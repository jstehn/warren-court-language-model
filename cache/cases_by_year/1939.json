States Supreme Court\nALTON R. CO. v. ILLINOIS COMMERCE COMMISSION(1939)\nNo. 231\nArgued: Decided: January 16, 1939\n\n\n\n\n[305 \nU.S. 548, 549]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Frank H. Towner, of Chicago, Ill., for appellant.\n Mr. Harry R. Booth, of Chicago, Ill., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question is whether an order made by the commission, denying appellant's application for authority to discontinue, and requiring it to continue, maintenance and operation of a switch track in Chicago used to serve shippers, deprives it of its property in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, Const.U.S.C.A. Specifically, appellant maintains that by compelling it to expend its funds for the upkeep of a track not constructed or owned by it and upon land it does not own, the order is repugnant to that provision of the Constitution. The Illinois supreme court, affirming the circuit court of Cook County, sustained the order as a valid exercise of state power. 368 Ill. 584, 15 N. E.2d 508.\n Appellees, insisting that our decisions rule that question in their favor, filed a motion to dismiss or affirm.* We \n\n[305 \nU.S. 548, 550]\n\u00a0\n postponed consideration of the motion to the argument of the case on the merits. Now after hearing counsel it appears that the question presented by the appeal is not so clearly lacking in merit that upon mere citation of our decisions it may be put aside as not requiring further consideration. We therefore deny the motion. Milheim v. Moffat Tunnel Imp. Dist., \n262 \nU.S. 710, 716\n, 717 S., 43 S.Ct. 694, 696; Hamilton v. Regents, \n293 \nU.S. 245, 258\n, 55 S.Ct. 197, 202.\n Through purchasers at judicial sale July 18, 1931, appellant acquired the properties of the Chicago & Alton Railroad Company, a consolidated company formed in 1906 and in receivership from 1922 to the sale. It and its predecessors, including the receiver, may for brevity be referred to as the carrier.\n The switch track in question extends from the carrier's main line about 150 feet on the right-of-way, thence 2,681 feet, crossing public streets and alleys, to the boundary of the plant of the Peoples Gas Light & Coke Company upon land largely, if not wholly, owned by that company and the other industries served by the track. The industries, commencing with the one nearest the main line, are Commonwealth Edison Company, E. Heldmaier, Inc., Moulding-Brownell Corp., and the gas company. All but the first depend upon the track for rail transportation. It has been extended for some distance into the plant of the gas company. Five spurs, that appropriately may be called private sidings, extend from it and serve within the plants of the industries. There is here no question as to the part of the track within the gas plant or of the spurs serving the industries. Construction was begun prior to 1884, and at least since 1887 the stretch here in question has been used to serve the gas \n\n[305 \nU.S. 548, 551]\n\u00a0\n company, and for more than 30 years other industries between that company's plant and the main line. The original cost of construction was borne by the gas company and possibly other industries. It does not appear by whom the cost of maintenance prior to 1904 was paid.\n Pursuant to ordinance passed November 2, 1903, a part of the track was elevated at crossings of three streets and two intervening alleys. November 1, 1904, the carrier made an agreement with the gas company and the predecessor of the electric company pursuant to which they paid the cost of elevation. The gas company agreed to pay an annual fee of $300 imposed by the ordinance for the privilege of maintaining the track across the streets and alleys. The carrier agreed to maintain the track. And, by an assignment reciting that the ordinance had been obtained for their benefit, the carrier transferred it to the gas and electric companies. The gas company paid the fees until the 1903 ordinance expired November 2, 1923. Then it and the electric company insisted that future exactions by the city as well as maintenance should be borne by the carrier. The latter refused to accept the additional burden. December 10, 1924, the city passed an ordinance authorizing use of the streets for 20 years from expiration of the 1903 ordinance, increased the annual fee to $1,400, and required a bona to insure compliance. The carrier accepted the terms of the ordinance, having an understanding with the gas and electric companies that they would pay the charges. Nevertheless, it paid $1,400 annually from 1923 to 1932 and was reimbursed only to the extent of $300 paid by the gas company for each of three years in that period. As of November 2, 1932 the annual fee was reduced to $700, and appellant paid it up to November 2, 1936. The carrier bore the cost of maintaining the track from 1904 to March 26, 1936. On that \n\n[305 \nU.S. 548, 552]\n\u00a0\n date, exercising as it asserts a right reserved by final decree in the receivership proceeding, it elected not to assume the contract. Nevertheless, it has continued to use and maintain the track. Thus since 1903 the carrier, in addition to maintaining the track, has paid $15,190 to the city as compensation for its occupancy of the public streets and alleys. Through error as it says, it paid taxes on the track for some of the time.\n Needed repairs and betterments of the track involved will require expenditures amounting to about $4,000 a year for three years; then annual cost of maintenance will be about $1,000. It may be assumed that, in order to continue operation, appellant will have to pay whatever fees are charged by the city, and that, because the track is on land not owned by it, its expenditures for additions and betterments must, as it asserts, by accounting regulations be charged to operating expenses. The annual gross revenue for transportation over the track amounts to about $40,000.\n Appellant does not suggest that operating expenses including the city charges, plus cost of replacements and betterments, will exceed revenue derived from use of the track or that operation of the track will not yield it a reasonable profit; nor does it claim, as of constitutional right, to be entitled to have any profit from use of the switch track separately considered. Puget Sound Traction, Light & Power Co. v. Reynolds, \n244 \nU.S. 574, 575\n, 580 S., 37 S.Ct. 705, 706, 707; Fort Smith Light & Traction Co. v. Bourland, \n267 \nU.S. 330, 332\n, 45 S.Ct. 249; Western & Atlantic R.R. v. Georgia Public Service Comm., \n267 \nU.S. 493, 496\n, 497 S., 45 S.Ct. 409, 410. Admittedly, appellant is willing to continue to use the track to serve the industries. Its petition prays an order requiring them to pay cost of maintenance and future city charges. It seeks authority to discontinue service and to cancel applicable rates, but only in case of failure of the industries to pay these op- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 548, 553]\n\u00a0\n erating expenses. It wants, not to give up the traffic, but to shift a substantial financial burden that it has long been bearing to the industries served.\n The state supreme court held: 'As between the public and the railroad, a switch track built for industrial purposes and across public thoroughfares becomes a part of the main line of the system which it joins and is subject to governmental regulation in the public interest, even though it was built by private funds and for the most part on private property; appellant uses the switch track in question for its own benefit to serve industries located on it and may use it and extensions of it to serve other shippers and the public at large; the public has an interest quite apart from that of the parties to the suit in the maintenance of the track; the state public utility act,  50, Ill.Rev.Stat.1937, c. 111 2\/3,  50, is broad enough to impose upon a railroad duty to maintain the property which it uses for its own benefit as well as that to which it has title; the commission has ample power to enforce that duty and the order does not violate any provision of the state or federal constitutions.\n We have held: The uses for which a track was desired are not the less public because the motive which dictated its location was to reach a private industry, or because the proprietors of that industry contributed to the cost.

Comm., \n249 \nU.S. 422, 424\n, 39 S.Ct. 345, 346, and Western & Atlantic R.R. v. Georgia Public ServiceComm., supra.\n The decision of the state supreme court in this case must here be held conclusively to establish that under the constitution and laws of Illinois the order is valid. The decisions of this Court above cited leave no doubt as to the power of the State to require a common carrier by railroad to condemn rights-of-way for and to construct switch tracks like the one here involved. So far as concerns decision of this case, it matters not whether Illinois has exerted that power, for the track has been laid and is being used by the carrier. The required maintenance and operation are not beyond the scope of the carrier's undertaking to serve the public. Union Lime Co. v. Chicago & N.W. Ry. Co., supra; Chicago & N.W. Ry. Co. v. Ochs, supra.\n Assuming that the questions whether the switch track is open to public use and has become a part of the main line are so related to the constitutional issue here presented that the state court's determination of them is not binding upon this Court, we are of opinion that, upon the facts alleged in appellant's petition to the commission, the latter's unchallenged findings, and our decisions in similar cases, it is clear that in point of fact and law the switch track and any extensions of it that may be made are open to use to serve the public and constitute a part of the carrier's system.\n Asserting that the duty to maintain a track such as that in question normally results from ownership, appellant earnestly insists that the order is shown to be unreasonable by the fact that rails and other materials purchased and owned by it when put into the track immediately cease to belong to it and become the property of the gas \n\n[305 \nU.S. 548, 555]\n\u00a0\n company which, appellant says, retains right of ownership in the track. But, in making that and similar arguments, appellant ignores the decisions in this case of the commission, the state supreme court, and as well the ruling of this Court just indicated, to the effect that the track in question is one built for industrial purposes on and across public thoroughfares; a track that has become a part of the main line of the carrier's system and, though constructed without cost to it on lands owned by others, is open to public use; a track which has long been and is being used by the carrier for its own benefit and by it may be used, with extensions if any shall be made, to serve the public at large.\n Appellant does not suggest that as against the owners of the land or those who paid for building the track, it is a trespasser or without right to continue to maintain and operate the track as required by the order. Nor does it say that, by exertion of the power of eminent domain, it may not successfully resist demands of claimant or owners for possession of any part of the land or of the track not owned by it. See Mapes v. Vandalia R. Co., 238 Ill. 142, 145, 87 N.E. 393, 128 Am.St.Rep. 117; Black v. Chicago, B. & Q.R. Co., 243 Ill. 534, 539, 90 N.E. 1075; Roberts v.

Smith, \n171 \nU.S. 260, 271\n, 18 S.Ct. 794, 798.\n If, as suggested, expenditures for needed betterments, as well as those for maintenance, are chargeable to operating expenses, all are returnable to the carrier, out of operating revenue, as a part of the cost of maintenance and use. And, if appellant acquires title to the land and track, then additions and betterments made by it will constitute a part of its investment in road and equipment owned and used for its purposes as a common carrier and, by the due process clauses of the state and federal constitutions, safeguarded against confiscation. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 548, 556]\n\u00a0\n It is clear that enforcement of the order will not take appellant's property in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice BLACK is of opinion that the motion to dismiss should be granted.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Appellees rest their motion to dismiss or affirm on: Union Lime Co. v.

RAILROAD COMMISSION(1939)\nNo. 704\nArgued: April 21, 1939Decided: June 5, 1939\n\n\n\n\n[307 \nU.S. 486, 487]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Max Thelen, of San Francisco, Cal., for appellant.\n Mr. Ira H. Rowell, of San Francisco, Cal., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This appeal is from a judgment of the highest court of the State upholding an order of the state railroad commission that reduces tolls for use of appellant's bridge across the Carquinez Straits between the counties of Contra Costa and Solano. Appellant contends that the order violates Art. I,  10, of the Constitution, U.S.C.A.; that the commission's procedure was repugnant to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and that the order, in violation of that clause, prescribes rates that are confiscatory.\n February 5, 1923, the board of supervisors of Contra Costa County, exerting power conferred by state legislation,1 passed ordinance No. 171 granting to the Rodeo-Vallejo Ferry Company a franchise to construct and for 25 years to erate the Carquinez bridge. June 4, 1923, the same board granted to the Delta Bridge Corporation a like franchise for the construction and operation of a bridge across the San Joaquin River near Antioch, between the counties of Contra Costa and Sacramento. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 486, 488]\n\u00a0\n Each ordinance provides that, on the expiration of the franchise, the property rights, including title to the bridge, revert to the adjacent counties. Appellant became the owner of both franchises. The Antioch bridge was opened in January, 1926, and the Carquinez in May, 1927\n\n\n When the Carquinez bridge opened, the board of supervisors fixed tolls at 60 cents for automobiles and at 10 cents for each person in a vehicle or on foot. 2 That scale was in operation when the commission made the order in question which reduced these charges to 45 and 5 cents, respectively. Jurisdiction over toll bridges having been conferred upon it by a statute of 1937,3 the commission in August of that year on its own motion commenced an investigation of all toll bridges. But, in October following, it commenced a separate proceeding solely to investigate reasonableness of Carquinez tolls. February 8, 1938, it announced its opinion and promulgated the order in question. Appellant obtained judicial review; the court upheld the order. Cal.Sup., 83 P.2d 1.\n The statutory provisions authorizing the county board to grant the franchises, ordinance No. 171, and the grantees' acceptance constitute a contract between the parties. Contra Costa County v. American Toll Bridge Co., 1937, 10 Cal.2d 359, 74 P.2d 749. As to that, there is no controversy. But appellant contends that under the franchise it has a contract right that the bridge tolls shall not be reduced by the public authorities unless it shall first appear that they are yielding a rate in excess of 15 per cent upon the rate base specified by  2845 and 2846, Political Code.\n These sections provide:\n s 2845. 'The board of supervisors granting authority to construct a toll-bridge ... must at the same time: ... \n\n[307 \nU.S. 486, 489]\n\u00a0\n\n'2. Fix the amount of license tax to be paid by the person or corporation for taking tolls thereon, not less than three nor over one hundred dollars per month, payable annually;\n\n'3. Fix the rate of tolls which may be collected for crossing the bridge ... which must not raise annually an income exceeding fifteen per cent on the actual cost of the construction or erection and maintenance of the bridge ... for the first year, nor on the fair cash value together with the repairs and maintenance thereof for any succeeding year; ....'4\n\n s 2846. 'The license tax and rate of toll fixed as provided in the preceding section must not be increased or diminished during the term of twenty years, at any time, unless it is shown to the satisfaction of the board of supervisors at the receipts from tolls in any one year is disproportionate to the cost of construction or erection, or the fair cash value thereof, together with the cost of all necessary repairs and maintenance of the bridge .... The license tax fixed by the board of supervisors$must not exceed ten per cent of the tolls annually collected.'\n The state court held that  2846 contemplates increases as well as reductions, limited by the 15 per cent maximum, at any time the disproportion is shown to exist. It construed the language of that section to be inconsistent with the intent to contract that appellant shall have a 15 per cent return, if yielded by the tolls specified in the franchise. The opinion explains that: 'Rather it is to be assumed that the legislature intended, not only to afford an adequate and proportionate return to the grantee, but \n\n[307 \nU.S. 486, 490]\n\u00a0\n that it also intended some measure of protection to the public's right to be charged not more than a reasonable toll for the use of the bridge. ... In 1872, when section 2846 was enacted by the legislature, sufficient scope was allowed between both interests, public and private, to permit adequate elasticity in the exercise of the legislative rate-making function in the light of prevailing economic conditions. Such a statute does not savor of a contract obligation to the grantee. Its object was to delegate to and vest in the designated body the power to regulate tolls as circumscribed by the stated limitation.' 83 P.2d page 6.\n Upon the issue whether the order is repugnant to the contract clause, 'No State shall ... pass any ... Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts,' state court's construction, will decide for state court's construction, will decided for itself whether, as claimed by appellant, the franchise by contract limits exertion of sovereign powers to regulate tolls.

And, if it plainly appears that it does, this Court will not hesitate so to adjudge. Detroit United Ry. v. Michigan, \n242 \nU.S. 238\n, 251-253, 37 S.Ct. 87, 91, 92; City of Cleveland v. Cleveland City Ry. Co., \n194 \nU.S. 517, 524\n, 536 S., 24 S.Ct. 756, 758, 763; City of Detroit v. Detroit Citizens' Street Ry. Co., \n184 \nU.S. 368, 382\n, 389 S., 22 S.Ct. 410, 416, 418; St. Cloud Public Service Co. v. St. Cloud, \n265 \nU.S. 352\n, 44 S.Ct. 492. Compare Georgia v. Chattanooga, \n264 \nU.S. 472, 480\n, 44 S.Ct. 369, 370.\n Upon an elaborate review of the California legislation relating to bridge tolls, appellant says that in the first period, 1850 to 1857, bridge franchises allowed owners to take only such tolls as the courts of sessions and, later, the county boards should fix annually; that in the second period, 1857 to 1864, tolls were limited to those fixed by county boards annually, subject to change by the legislature; that in the third period, 1862 to 1872, general statutes and special acts authorized such rates as the \n\n[307 \nU.S. 486, 491]\n\u00a0\n county boards should annually prescribe, declaring, however, that they should not be so low as to make income less than a specified percentage of a defined base. On that foundation, it maintains that there was an evolution of policy to grant to builders and operators of bridges contract rights as to tolls. In that light it examines the language of  2845 and 2846 and concludes that the proper construction of the franchise in question is that unless the yield becomes in excess of 15 per cent the license tax must not be increased and the rate of toll must not be diminished.\n We assume, without detailed examination, that the legislation so portrayed indicates that in the period next preceding 1872, when the provisions of  2846 were enacted, the State had adopted the policy of safeguarding operators of toll bridges against rate reduction by county boards below specified levels. But that fact may not be employed to arrive at a construction not indicated by the language used. So far as concerns the point under consideration, the meaning of the statutory provision is plain. Section 2845 requires the county board, when granting the franchise, to fix the license tax within specified limits and a rate of toll, which must not raise annually an income exceeding 15 per cent of base. Section 2846 declares that the license tax and the rate of toll so fixed must not be diminished unless receipts are disproportionate to base. Thus plainly the commands are that at first the tolls must be fixed, but not to produce income above the 15 per cent specified, and that the tolls so fixed shall not be diminished unless yield is disproportionate to the defined base. Neither in text nor in reason is the 'fifteen per cent' prescribed as maximum yield tied to, or made the test by which to ascertain whether receipts from tolls are, 'disproportionate'. We construe these statutory provisions to negative appellant's claim that by the franchise in question the State bargained away power to reduce tolls for use of the Carquinez bridge unless \n\n[307 \nU.S. 486, 492]\n\u00a0\n annual return becomes more than 15 per cent. See e.g. Paducah v. Paducah Ry., \n261 \nU.S. 267, 275\n, 43 S.Ct. 335, 338; Banton v. Belt Line Ry., \n268 \nU.S. 413\n, 417-419, 45 S.Ct. 534, 535, 536; Railroad Commission v. Los Angeles R. Co., \n280 \nU.S. 145, 152\n, 155 S., 50 S.Ct. 71, 72, 73. The order is not repugnant to the contract clause.\n Appellant claims that, in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the commission denied it a full and fair hearing and failed adequately to find the facts. The commission initiated the proceeding, entitled 'In the matter of the investigation upon the commission's own motion, into the rates, charges, contracts, classifications, rules and regulations of American Toll Bridge Company covering its operation of the toll bridge over the Carquinez Straits between the counties of Contra Costa and Solano'; gave appellant notice that the investigation would extend to tolls for use of that bridge; accorded it opportunity to introduce evidence and present is contentions; and received the evidence offered by it, 233 pages of the printed record and numerous exhibits. Appellant submitted the case for decision without making any request for findings and without argument, oral or written. The commission, without formal findings, filed its decision which, sufficiently to meet requirements of due process, indicates the facts on which it made the order.\n Then appellant filed petition for rehearing. That document, including eight captions and 12 sub-captions and an exhibit, occupies 39 printed pages of the record. \n5\n It \n\n[307 \nU.S. 486, 493]\n\u00a0\n specifically sets forth the grounds on which appellant claimed the decision to be unlawful. These include the commission's determination of the various classes of facts usually considered in cases in which prescribed rates are challenged as confiscatory. The petition contains no hint of claim that the commission denied appellant procedural due process. Nor was that specified in the petition for judicial review. Morgan v. United States, \n304 \nU.S. 1\n, 58 S.Ct. 773, 999, on which appellant relies, was decided after filing of that petition and before argument in the California court. That court rightly held it not in point. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 486, 494]\n\u00a0\n Appellant also claims that the commission denied it procedural due process by excluding the Antioch bridge rates from the proceeding. It moved to include with this proceeding an investigation of the Antioch bridge tolls. In support of the motion, it suggested that the bridges are part of a single system but compete with each other; that operations of the Antioch are less satisfactory financially than those of the Carquinez; and that reduction of Carquinez tolls would force reduction of Antioch tolls.\n In the first instance, at least, determination of the proper unit for rate making was for the commission. The Antioch bridge is not used or useful to render any service covered by the Carquinez tolls; appellant's duty to operate either bridge is independent of its obligation to operate the other. The record discloses no basis on which it reasonably may be held that by limiting the investigation to the Carquinez tolls the commission abused its discretion, and clearly there is no foundation for the claim that in excluding the Antioch the commission denied appellant procedural due process. See Gilchrist v. Interborough Co., \n279 \nU.S. 159, 206\n, 209 S., 49 S.Ct. 282, 288, 289; Wabash Valley Elec. Co. v. Young, \n287 \nU.S. 488\n, 495-498, 53 S.Ct. 234, 235, 237; Florida Power & Light Co. v. City of Miami, 5 Cir., 98 F.2d 180; International Ry. Co. v. Prendergast, D.C., 1 F.Supp. 623. Cf. Coney v. Broad River Power Co., 171 S.C. 377, 172 S.E. 437.\n There is no foundation for the claim that the commission's procedure violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n There remains for consideration the contention that the prescribed rates are confiscatory. The burden is on appellant to show that enforcement of the order will compel it to furnish the service covered by the reduced rates for less than a reasonable rate of return on the value of the property used, at the time it is being used, for that service. And, in the absence of clear and convincing proof that the reduced tolls are too low to yield that return, it \n\n[307 \nU.S. 486, 495]\n\u00a0\n may not be adjudged that the State by enforcement of the measure complained of will deprive appellant of its property without due process of law. Chicago & G.T. Ry. Co. v. Wellman, \n143 \nU.S. 339, 344\n, 345 S., 12 S.Ct. 400, 402; San Diego Land & Town Co. v. Jasper, \n189 \nU.S. 439, 441\n, 446 S., 23 S.Ct. 571, 572, 573; City of Knoxville v. Water Co., \n212 \nU.S. 1, 8\n, 16 S., 29 S.Ct. 148, 150, 153; Minnesota Rate Cases, Simpson v.

Galveston, \n262 \nU.S. 443, 446\n, 43 S.Ct. 606, 607; Aetna Insurance Co. v. Hyde, \n275 \nU.S. 440, 448\n, 48 S.Ct. 174.\n The terms of the order must first be given attention. It directs appellant to change the items of its schedule of charges, reading as follows: 'Passengers (7 years of age and older) on foot or in vehicles . . . .10. Auto only . . . .60' so as to read: 'Passengers (7 years of age and older) on foot or in vehicles . . . .05. Auto only . . . .45'. Thus, the order extends only to automobiles and passengers. The Carquinez franchise specifies, until otherwise ordered by the commission, tolls applicable to other classes of traffic crossing the bridge, namely, bicycles, carts and wagons, commercial or delivery automobiles and motor trucks, ditchers, harvesters, etc., cattle and stock, motor stages to which commutation rates are applied when operated as specified, freight, hearses, horses, motorcycles, and trailers.\n Appellant fails to establish, by allocation or apportionment to the traffic covered by the tolls so reduced, the operating expenses, cost of depreciation, taxes, and contributions to the sinking fund for amortization of investment that are fairly attributable to the service covered by the order; it also fails to establish the amount of property value that is justly assignable to that traffic. Obviously, the return to be yielded by the reduced tolls cannot be found without comparison of the revenues to be derived from the service with the amounts of operating expenses and other charges rightly to be made against them. Inadequacy of revenues from all traffic \n\n[307 \nU.S. 486, 496]\n\u00a0\n does not tend to show that the rates on automobiles and persons prescribed by the commission's order are too low. Minnesota Rate Cases, supra, Simpson v. Shepard, 230 U.S. pages 452, 453, 33 S.Ct. pages 761, 762, 48 L.R.A.,N.S., 1151, Ann.Cas.1916A, 18; Baltimore & O.R. Co. v. United States, \n298 \nU.S. 349, 372\n, 378 S., 381, 56 S.Ct. 797, 809, 812, 813. It follows that appellant is not titled to a decree that the order is confiscatory.\n More need not be written to dispose of the issues presented in this case. But in view of appellant's earnest contentions, it is not inappropriate to say that the record, considered in the light of its argument, fails to show that the rate reduction will so lessen revenues from the Carquinez bridge that there will remain less than sufficient, under the due process clause to constitute just compensation for its use-a reasonable rate of return on the value of the bridge property.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice BLACK, Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER and Mr. Justice DOUGLAS concur in the result. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Political Code,  2843, 2845, 2846, and 2872 (as amended May 8, 1923, Cal.Stats.1923, p. 272). \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The franchise ordinance fixed these tolls at 75 cents and 15 cents. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Act of August 27, 1937, Cal.Stats.1937, p. 2473. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] By Act of May 9, 1923, par. 3 was amended to read as follows: 'Fix the rate of tolls which may be collected for crossing the bridge ... which may raise annually an income not exceeding fifteen per cent on the actual cost of the construction or erection of the bridge ... and such additional income as will provide for the annual cost of operation, maintenance, amortization and taxes of the bridge ....'

Judicial Code,  239, 28 U.S.C.  346, 28 U.S.C.A.  346.\n The certificate states that on March 13, 1936, Atlas Life Insurance Company, an Oklahoma corporation, plaintiff below, issued, on a single application, three policies of insurance on the life of one Southern, in amounts of $10,000, $15,000 and $25,000 respectively, each naming as beneficiary W. I. Southern, Inc., a Delaware corporation. All of the policies contained an incontestable clause reading:\n'This policy will be incontestable after two years from date of issue except for the nonpayment of premium and except as to provisions and conditions relating to disability benefits and those granting additional insurance specifically against death by accident, if any.' and a clause relating to statements of the insured in his application as follows:\n\n'All statements made by the Insured shall, in the absence of fraud, be deemed representations and not warranties, and no such statement shall void this policy unless it be contained in the written application and a copy of the application is endorsed upon or attached to this policy when issued.'\n\n The insured died February 23, 1938, and on March 7, 1938, the corporate beneficiary began suit against the insurance company in the Oklahoma state district court. On the following day the insurance company brought a suit in equity against the beneficiary in the federal district court for northern Oklahoma for cancellation of the \n\n[306 \nU.S. 563, 567]\n\u00a0\n policies, on the ground that in his application the insured had intentionally and fraudulently given false answers to questions material to the risk. The trial court sustained a motion to dismiss the equity suit, made on the ground that the insurance company had an adequate remedy at law by setting up the alleged fraud as a defense to the action pending in the state court. D.C., 23 F.Supp. 334. The insurance company electing not to plead further, a decree was entered dismissing the bill, from which the insurance company appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n Under the Oklahoma practice the insurance company can set up the fraud as a defense to the action at law on the policies, or can interpose a cross-complaint in that action for cancellation of the policies. Farmers' & Merchants' Bank v. Hoyt, 29 Okl. 772, 120 P. 264. The action on the policies in the state court is not removable by the insurance company, since it is not a non-resident of Oklahoma within the meaning of  28 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  71, 28 U.S.C.A.  71.\n The questions certified are as follows:\n'1. Is the remedy at law available in the state court by setting up the alleged fraud as a defense to the action on the policies, such an adequate remedy at law as will constitute a valid defense to the suit in equity for cancellation of the policies?\n\n'2. In order to constitute a defense to a suit in equity to cancel a policy of life insurance on the ground of fraud, is it essential that the remedy at law be available to the complainant in an action at law pending in the federal court?\n\n'3. Is the principle that the adequate remedy at law which will preclude a federal court of equity from granting relief must be one available in the federal courts, applicable in the instant case where the relief sought is affirmative in form but defensive in character?' \n\n[306 \nU.S. 563, 568]\n\u00a0\n Section 11 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat. 78, provided that the circuit courts should have 'cognizance ... of all suits of a civil nature at common law or in equity' in cases appropriately brought in those courts. This provision is perpetuated in  24(1) of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  41(1), 28 U.S.C.A.  41(1), which declares that the district courts shall have jurisdiction of such suits. The 'jurisdiction' thus conferred on the federal courts to entertain suits in equity is an authority to administer in equity suits the principles of the system of judicial remedies which had been devised and was being administered by the English Court of Chancery at the time of the separation of the two countries. Payne v. Hook, 7 Wall. 425, 430; In re Sawyer, \n124 \nU.S. 200, 209\n, 210 S., 8 S.Ct. 482, 486, 487; Matthews v. Rodgers, \n284 \nU.S. 521, 525\n, 52 S.Ct. 217, 219; Gordon v. Washington, \n295 \nU.S. 30, 36\n, 55 S.Ct. 584, 587. This clause of the statute does not define the jurisdiction of the district courts as federal courts, in the sense of their power or authority to hear and decide, but prescribes the body of doctrine which is to guide their decisions and enable them to determine whether in any given instance a suit of which a district court has jurisdiction as a federal court is an appropriate one for the exercise of the extraordinary powers of a court of equity. See Massachusetts State Grange v. Benton, \n272 \nU.S. 525, 528\n, 47 S. Ct. 189, 190; Pennsylvania v. Williams, \n294 \nU.S. 176, 181\n, 55 S.Ct. 380, 383, 96 A.L.R. 1166, and cases cited. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[306 \nU.S. 563, 569]\n\u00a0\n Section 16 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat. 82, continued without material change as  267 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  384, 28 U.S.C.A.  384, declares that suits in equity shall not be sustained in the courts of the United States in any case where a 'plain, adequate and complete remedy may be had at law.' The command of  267 is but a declaration of the equity rule established long before the enactment of the Judiciary Act, and it serves by emphasis of the rule to protect the states from the encroachments which would result from the exercise of equity powers by federal courts failing to observe it. Matthews v. Rodgers, supra, 284 U.S. page 525, 52 S.Ct. page 219; Stratton v. St. Louis Southwestern R. Co., \n284 \nU.S. 530\n, 52 S.Ct. 222.\n\n By long-settled construction, the accepted test of legal adequacy which the section prescribes is the legal remedy which the federal, rather than state, courts afford. \n2\n Smyth v. Ames, \n169 \nU.S. 466\n, 18 S.Ct. 418; Risty v. Chicago, M. & St. P.R. Co., \n270 \nU.S. 378, 388\n, 46 S.Ct. 236, 240; Di Giovanni v. Camden Insurance Ass'n, \n296 \nU.S. 64\n, 56 S.Ct. 1; Petroleum Exploration, Inc., v. Public Service Commission, \n304 \nU.S. 209, 217\n, 58 S.Ct. 834, 838. But although the adequacy of the legal remedy precludes resort to a federal court of equity, it does not follow that the converse is true-that the want of a legal remedy in the federal courts gives the suitor free entrance to a fed- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 563, 570]\n\u00a0\n eral court of equity. Absence of legal remedy does not dispense with the necessity of alleging and proving a cause of action in equity as a prerequisite to equitable relief in a federal court. enelow v. new York Life Insurance Co., \n293 \nU.S. 379\n, 55 S.Ct. 310; Di Giovanni v. Camden Insurance Ass'n, supra; American Life Insurance Co. v. Stewart, \n300 \nU.S. 203\n, 57 S.Ct. 377, 111 A.L.R. 1268\n\n\n The insurance company in the circumstances disclosed by the certificate is without remedy in a suit at law. The federal courts can render no judgment at law directing cancellation of a contract for fraud in its inception or preserving evidence of the fraud. These are forms of relief which a court of equity alone can give. But the basis of equitable relief is that the cancellation asked is necessary to protect the suitor from irreparable injury when there is manifest danger that his defense at law on the policy will be lost or prejudiced. Enelow v. New York Life Insurance Co., supra; Di Giovanni v. Camden Insurance Ass'n, supra; American Life Insurance Co. v. Stewart, supra.\n Ordinarily when the defense of fraud may be interposed to an action at law on the policy and such an action is imminent or pending, there is no occasion for equitable relief and the parties will be left to their rights as determined in the suit at law. In such a case the bill is dismissed without prejudice, not because there is want of jurisdiction in the federal court, but because the plaintiff has made no case for equitable relief. Phoenix Mut. L. Insurance Co. v. Bailey, 13 Wall. 616; Cable v. United States Life Insurance Co., \n191 \nU.S. 288\n, 24 S.Ct. 74; Enelow v. New York Life Insurance Co., supra; Di Giovanni v. Camden Insurance Ass'n, supra. And since the issue is not one of jurisdiction but of the need and propriety of equitable relief, the mere fact that the suit at law which is imminent can be brought only in the state court, or that it is pending there, is immaterial. Cable v. United States Life Insurance Co., \n\n[306 \nU.S. 563, 571]\n\u00a0\n supra; Di Giovanni v. Camden Insurance Ass'n, supra; cf. Phoenix Mut. L. Insurance Co. v. Bailey, supra. It is no ground for equitable relief that the suit at law is brought in a state rather than a federal court, for the insurance company's defense may be protected there as well as in a federal court, and in that case there is no threat of irreparable injury. See Cable v. United States Life Insurance Co., supra. On comparable grounds a federal court may withhold its aid when a plaintiff has failed to resort to a state administrative remedy. Natural Gas Pipeline Co. v. Slattery, \n302 \nU.S. 300, 310\n, 311 S., 58 S.Ct. 199, 204. Only when special circumstances are shown which subject the insurer to the hazard that his defense to the suit at law, whether in the state or federal court, will be lost or prejudiced, is there occasion for equity to give relief. American Life Insurance Co. v. Stewart, supra.\n In the light of what we have said it is evident that the certified questions cannot be properly answered, both because they are apparently framed without reference to the requirements for the maintenance of a suit in equity in the federal courts independently of  267 of the Judicial Code and on the mistaken assumption that that section affords the only test of the insurance company's right to proceed in a federal court of equity; and because the certificate does not exclude the possibility that there are facts, lurking in the record or within the range of judicial notice, which may have a material bearing on the insurance company's need for equitable relief.\n Since the insurance company has no remedy at law in the federal courts for the cancellation of the policies,  267 interposes no obstacle to a suit in equity in a federal court. But it is requisite under  24(1) of the Judicial Code to the maintenance of suit there that facts should be presented entitling the company to equitable relief. In this aspect of the case the certified questions are incapable of categorical answer and the questions which \n\n[306 \nU.S. 563, 572]\n\u00a0\n they suggest can be properly answered only by reframing the questions certified or giving qualified answers to them. This we are not required to do, see Jewell v. Knight, \n123 \nU.S. 426, 432\n, 435 S., 8 S.Ct. 193, 194, 195; Chicago Burlington & Quincy R. Co. v. Williams, \n205 \nU.S. 444\n, 27 S.Ct. 559; United States v. John Barth Co., \n276 \nU.S. 606\n, 48 S.Ct. 338; White v. Johnson, \n282 \nU.S. 367\n, 51 S.Ct. 115, and cannot properly do without recourse to the record, which is not before us.\n The suit at law in the state court in this case was brought shortly before the expiration of the two year period after which the incontestable clause, according to its terms, would come into operation. The fact that that period was about to expire was thought to be a sufficient ground for resort to equity in American Life Insurance Co. v. Stewart, supra, where no suit at law was pending or appeared to be imminent when the bill was filed. But we cannot say, at least without qualification, that a complainant similarly sustains the burden of showing threatened irreparable injury when a suit at law is pending in which he is free to set up as a defense the fraud on which he must rely in a cancellation suit in equity. Whether there are other special circumstances in the present case entitling the insurance company to equitable relief; whether there are peculiarities of local procedure which, in some circumstances, might impair the insurance company's defense; whether such circumstances exist; or whether, under local law, a defense once interposed before the policy has become incontestable is a 'contest' sufficient to preserve the insurer's rights for all purposes, see New York Life Insurance Co. v. Hurt, 10 Cir., 35 F.2d 92, 95; Harnischfeger Sales Corporation v. National Life Insurance Co., 7 Cir., 72 F.2d 921, 922; Killian v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., 251 N.Y. 44, 48, 166 N.E. 798, 64 A.L.R. 956, are questions which the certificate does not exclude from the case and which have not been briefed or argued here. Yet they are questions which may require consideration before a court can determine whether \n\n[306 \nU.S. 563, 573]\n\u00a0\n the equity suit should be dismissed or whether the bill should be retained without further proceedings pending disposition of the suit at law, as may be done by the equity court in its discretion. Landis v. North American Co ., \n299 \nU.S. 248\n, 57 S.Ct. 163; American Life Insurance Co. v. Stewart, supra, 300 U.S. page 215, 57 S.Ct. page 380, 111 A. L.R. 1268. The guiding principle is that the federal court should proceed only so far as is necessary to protect the suitor from loss of his defense at law, without needlessly interfering with the determination of the plaintiff's rights in the state court, where his action was properly begun. See Di Giovanni v. Camden Insurance Ass'n, supra, 296 U.S. page 73, 56 S. Ct. page 5, and cases cited.\n The certificate fails to disclose whether all the facts and circumstances pertinent to this issue have been certified. This Court cannot be required by certificate to answer, and should not answer, questions which may be affected by unstated matter lurking in the record, or questions which admit of one answer under one set of circumstances and a different answer under another, neither of which is inconsistent with the certificate. See Tripplett v. Lowell, \n297 \nU.S. 638, 648\n, 649 S., 56 S.Ct. 645, 650.\n The certificate is dismissed.\n Dismissed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Unlike the objection that the court is without jurisdiction as a federal court, see Mansfield Coldwater & Lake Michigan R.

SCOTT COUNTY MILLING CO.(1939)\nNo. 650\nArgued: April 21, 1939Decided: June 5, 1939\n\n\n\n\n[307 \nU.S. 478, 479]\n\u00a0\n Mr. H. H. Larimore, of St. Louis, Mo., for petitioners.\n Mr. James A. Finch, of Cape Girardeau, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The decision in this case depends on provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq., and orders of the commission.\n In September, 1924, respondent and others complained to the commission that the tariff charges they had been and were then paying the Missouri Pacific and other carriers for the transportation of coal from mines in southern Illinois and western Kentucky to destinations in southeastern Missouri and northeastern Arkansas were excessive. They asked the commission to establish reasonable rates for the future, to ascertain the amount of damages they had sustained, and to order the carriers to make reparation. After hearings the commission, by order of February 11, 1929, and supplemental order of March 11 \n\n[307 \nU.S. 478, 480]\n\u00a0\n in the same year, found that the carriers' tariff rates had been, were, and for the future would be, unreasonable to an extent indicated, prescribed as reasonable lower rates to be established for the future, and found that complainants including respondent, having paid excessive charges, had suffered damages and were entitled to reparation to the extent of the difference between amounts paid and what the charges would have been under the rates that the commission then found reasonable.\n On demand of the respondent, made in accordance with the commission's rules of practice,1 the Missouri Pacific before April 20, 1929, paid it $ 23,994.33, being the amounts directed to be paid by the reparation order or account of shipments for which the Missouri Pacific, delivering carrier, had collected the charges. After denial of a number of petitions for rehearing filed by the Missouri Pacific and other carriers, the commission, November 2, 1931, reopened the case. July 3, 1933, after hearings and protracted contest, it found the rates that it had theretofore condemned were not unreasonable and set aside all findings and orders that it had made, including the reparation order on which respondent had collected.\n October 30, 1934, petitioners, who had been appointed trustees of the Missouri Pacific, asked respondent to refund the amount it had received; respondent refused. To recover with interest the amount the Missouri Pacific paid, petitioners brought this suit in a circuit court of Missouri; it gave judgment for respondent. The supreme court affirmed. It held that, as the Missouri Pacific had paid the amount of the reparation award with full knowledge of the facts without denying liability or waiting to be sued, the payment was a voluntary one and that therefore petitioners were not entitled to recover. The court \n\n[307 \nU.S. 478, 481]\n\u00a0\n also held that by the voluntary payment the Missouri Pacific caused respondent to believe that the matter was a closed transaction and that in the circumstances, to which reference will later be made, it would be inequitable to require respondent to refund.\n We think that petitioners are entitled to recover.\n\n 1. \nIn absence of prior finding by the commission that the tariff charges collected for interstate transportation are unreasonable, there can be no enforceable claim for damages caused by exactions according to the tariff. Texas & Pac. R. Co. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co., \n204 \nU.S. 426, 444\n, 27 S.Ct. 350, 356, 9 Ann.Cas. 1075; Robinson v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., \n222 \nU.S. 506, 510\n, 32 S.Ct. 114, 115; Mitchell Coal & Coke Co. v. Pennsylvania R. Co., \n230 \nU.S. 247, 259\n, 33 S.Ct. 916, 921. And see Lewis-Simas-Jones Co. v. Southern Pac. Co., \n283 \nU.S. 654, 661\n, 51 S.Ct. 592, 595; Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. Brady, \n288 \nU.S. 448, 458\n, 53 S.Ct. 441, 443. Prior to the findings and orders of the commission, February 11 and March 11, 1929, respondent was not permitted to collect, nor was the Missouri Pacific or other carriers allowed to pay, the damages claimed by respondent. But when the commission made the findings and reparation orders, the carriers, in the absence of facts constituting a defense, were in duty bound to pay in accordance with the order.\n Section 16(1)2 provides that if the commission shall determine complainant entitled to an award of damages, it shall direct the carrier to pay complainant the sum to which he is found entitled within a specified time. Section 16(2) 3 declares that if the carrier does not comply \n\n[307 \nU.S. 478, 482]\n\u00a0\n within the time limit, complainant may bring suit setting forth the causes for which he claims damages. It also declares that, in claimants' suits in federal courts, the findings and order of the commission shall be prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated. It allows plaintiffs, if they prevail, to recover reasonable attorneys' fees. By thus laying on the carriers the burden of bringing forward evidence to overcome presumptions created against them, and by compelling them, if defeated, to pay plaintiffs' attorneys' fees in addition to the interest allowed by law, the Act unmistakably evidences purpose directly to prevent interposition of pleas lacking merit and so coercively to bring about prompt payment of the commission's awards. In Meeker v. Lehigh Valley R. Co., \n236 \nU.S. 412\n, 35 S.Ct. 328, Ann.Cas. 1916B, 691, this Court, upholding the clause as to attorneys' fees, said (236 U.S. page 433, 35 S.Ct. page 337, Ann.Cas. 1916B, 691): 'The provision is leveled against common carriers engaged in interstate commerce, a quasi public business, and is confined to cases wherein a recovery is had for damages resulting from the carrier's violation of some duty imposed in the public interest by the act to regulate commerce. ... One of its purposes is to promote a closer observance by carriers of the duties so imposed; and that there is also a purpose to \n\n[307 \nU.S. 478, 483]\n\u00a0\n encourage the payment, without suit, of just demands, does not militate against its validity.' And in St. Louis & S.F.R. Co. v. Spiller, \n275 \nU.S. 156\n, 48 S.Ct. 96, referring to the same provision, we said ( 275 U.S. page 159, 48 S.Ct. page 97): 'The purpose of Congress in making the provision concerning costs was to discourage harassing resistance by a carrier to a reparation order.'\n There is nothing in the record to indicate, nor is it suggested by respondent or in the state court's opinion, that the Missouri Pacific had any defense against respondent's claim under the findings and reparation order. The liability so established persisted until payment of the claim. It may not reasonably be held that the Missouri Pacific was bound to await suit or delay adjudication by false or frivolous answer while expenses of litigation, interest, and fees for its adversary's counsel accumulated. Sections 16(1) and 16(2) indicate legislative purpose to penalize failure of carriers, having no defense, to pay damages in accordance with the terms of the commission's findings and reparation orders.\n But by  16a,4 the commission was empowered to set aside its orders. That section was drafted by the com- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 478, 484]\n\u00a0\n mission at the request of the Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce and was added by the Hepburn Act of 1906. It was 'a new section ... which expressly authorizes the commission to review and modify its own decisions.' 5 It was expounded by the commission as 'intended to give the commission the right to rehear a matter for the purpose of correcting any injustice in its previous order.' Cattle Raisers' Ass'n of Texas v. Missouri, Kansas & Texas R. Co., 12 I.C.C. 1, 3. While careful to prevent applications for rehearing from being used to avoid or delay compliance with the commission's orders, it empowers the commission at any time to grant rehearings as to any decision, order, or requirement and to reverse, change, or modify the same. Respondent made its demand and collected the money subject to the authority of the commission to set aside the order which authorized payment of the same.\n The clauses of  16a that authorize the commission to consider facts arising after the former hearing and that make its decisions after rehearing subject to the same provisions as an original order manifest the purpose of the Act to require carriers to serve for, and the shippers to pay, the lawful tariff rates. The Act condemns every deviation from lawful tariff rates. It declares that no carrier may lawfully collect a greater or less or different compensation for transportation than the rates specified in the tariff filed nor refund or remit any portion of the rates so specified.  6(7); see also  10(2). Similarly, it condemns the obtaining of transportation for less than \n\n[307 \nU.S. 478, 485]\n\u00a0\n the legally established rate. See  10(3) and (4). Involuntary rebates as well as those that are voluntary are prohibited. Lowden et al. v. Simonds- Shields-Lonsdale Grain Co. \n306 \nU.S. 516\n, 59 S.Ct. 612; Pittsburgh, C.C. & St. L.R. Co. v.

By accepting delivery of the coal, respondent became bound to pay the tariff charges. As the commission has found them not unreasonable but lawful, respondent is without right to retain the amount it collected upon the claim that they were excessive.\n The retention by respondent of money collected under the findings and order that the commission later set aside and vacated clearly would be repugnant to the policy and provisions of the Act.\n\n 2. \nThe facts on which the state court held it would be inequitable to require respondent to refund may be briefly stated. Respondent employed an expert to represent it before the commission and promised to pay him one- half the amount covered as reparation. Upon collection, it promptly paid as agreed. When petitioners asked refund, more than five years had elapsed and suit to recover back the fee was barred by the statute of limitations. Respondent used the other half to pay dividends and for other corporate purposes. As above indicated, the court held the payment to be voluntary and rested its ruling on that fact. But as shown above it was not voluntary; it was demanded by respondent and compelled by the Act, findings, and reparation order. Moreover, equitable considerations may not serve to justify failure of carrier to collect, or retention by shipper of, any part of lawful tariff charges. Pittsburgh, C.C. & St. L.R. Co. v.

Foley, of Boston, Mass., for appellee Boston Port Authority.\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Interstate Commerce Commission entered an order on February 2, 1937, which directed certain carriers serving the Port of New York district to cease and desist on or before April 5, 1937, from permitting shippers in interstate commerce over the carriers' lines from occupying 'space by lease or otherwise in warehouses, buildings or on piers owned or controlled directly of indirectly by, or affiliated with' the carriers involved 'at rates and charges which failed to compensate said' carriers 'for the cost of providing said space.' The cease and desist order likewise directed the carriers to abstain from storing, handling or insuring goods for shippers at less than cost. One carrier was also directed to abstain from granting concessions to a warehouse company by means of leasing space to the warehouse company at less than the cost of the space to the carrier. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 507, 514]\n\u00a0\n As authorized by the Judicial Code,1 a petition in equity was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on March 9, 1937, seeking a permanent injunction against the enforcement of the order. A hearing was had by a three-judge court pursuant to the provisions of the Urgent Deficiencies Appropriation Act of October 22, 1913,2 and a final order dismissing the petition entered on March 23, 1938. 3 An appeal was taken directly to this Court as authorized by the Urgent Deficiencies Act and the Judicial Code. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n The order appeal from was entered in an investigation into 'practices of carriers affecting operating revenues or expenses'5 undertaken by the Interstate Commerce Commission upon its own motion. \n6\n For convenience the general investigation was divided into different parts; the one in which the order under consideration was entered is Part VI, 'Warehousing and Storage of Property by Carriers at the Port of New York.' The particular practices affected by the order were brought to the attention of the Commission by complaints of warehouse operators in the New York district that warehouses owned or controlled by the carriers were being operated contrary to the Interstate Commerce Act. Full reports of the investigation into the practices complained of were made by the Commission on December 12, 1933,7 and June 8, 1936.8 The first report terminated in an admonition; the second report was followed by an order \n\n[305 \nU.S. 507, 515]\n\u00a0\n which never became effective. This order was superseded by the Commission's order of February 2, 1937, in controversy here. This last order was entered by the Commission upon reconsideration of its former reports. \n9\n The Commission postponed its effective date until the injunction was brought and the lower court has entered an order for a further stay pending the determination of the appeal to this Court.\n While the issues here are matters of law depending on whether admitted facts support the order, it will be helpful for an understanding of the basis of our opinion to have summarized the underlying facts found by the lower court.\n The railroads affected by the order are the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, the Central Railroad Company of New Jersey, the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad Company, Erie railroad Company, Lehigh Valley Railroad Company, the New York Central Railroad Company and the Pennsylvania Railroad Company. All are subject to the Interstate Commerce Act. As common carriers they operate lines of railroad extending in a generally westward direction from the Port of New York district to various western points and compete each with the others for domestic nd foreign commerce to and from the district. All united in the petition to enjoin the enforcement of the order. Their petition name as defendant the United States of America. The Interstate Commerce Commission and the Warehousemen's Protective Committee intervened. Later, orders were entered allowing the intervention of the American Warehousemen's Association, Merchandise Division; the Boston Port Authority; and the City of Boston.\n It was the practice of these carriers to furnish to shippers in the Port of New York area the storage, handling and insurance which were under investigation. On ac- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 507, 516]\n\u00a0\n count of the high price and great demand for storage space in the wholesale and retail business locations of New York, dealers must store their surplus stocks in lowrent sections. To serve those merchants who do not have their own warehouse facilities, numerous companies not affiliated with the carriers are engaged in the commercial warehouse business in the immediate vicinity of New York. Their business, like the warehouse businesses owned or operated by or affiliated with the carriers, not only covers the storage of goods but its handling in and out of cars and ships with all the incidental services connected therewith such as the issuance of warehouse receipts, inspection, cooperage, marking, and weighing.\n Neither the complaints of the competitors of the carriers in the warehousing business nor the terms of the Commission's order are directed at the involuntary storage of goods incidental to transportation. This is the period before or after shipment during which goods occupy cars or floors without any charge above the strictly transportation rate. The warehousing practices complained of are those in connection with accessorial services of the carriers, accurately designated commercial warehousing. Examples of such services are the storage and other warehousing services furnished by the carriers or their affiliates or subsidiaries, to enable shippers to hold and handle their commodities beyond the time allowed by transportation rates and in ways not required by rail movement itself. All of the carriers 'now generally store freight on piers owned or leased by them and in warehouses operated by affiliated or subsidiary companies.' This business is carried on in various ways. Some carriers lease space to shippers for warehousing; others have aided in financing structures on their property in which they lease space from their own subsidiaries; and still others own directly the buildings and lease them to subsidiaries for warehouse operations. In all cases the carriers exercise sufficient \n\n[305 \nU.S. 507, 517]\n\u00a0\n control over the warehouse facilities to make them subservient to the competitive needs of the carriers. Their entrance into warehousing was brought about by a desire to induce shippers to use particular rail facilities and as first one and then the other of the carriers gained traffic by their warehouse conveniences, it seemed necessary for their competitors to equip themselves with similar advantages. Obviously a shipper, who can secure transportation, storage, handling and insurance together from a carrier and its affiliates for an aggregate cost which is less than the sum for which he can secure the various services when purchased separately from carriers and non-affiliated enterprises, will deal with those offering the best terms. The storage largely determines the transportation route. To get the rail transportation of large shippers, the carriers sought them out and offered warehousing services and space below the rates of private warehousemen and below the cost to the carriers of the services rendered. It was not only a contest between carriers and private warehousemen but also between the carriers themselves. Traffic departments of the railroads became solicitors for warehousing business. Favored shippers were rented space by the carriers below compensatory figures. To meet the requirements of this competition the various Port of New York railroads added many new buildings in recent years. This provided many millions of square feet of space above the present needs of the district. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n Another form of warehousing is found in a development of the storage- in-transit privilege at the Port of New York. The carriers have rules and regulations governing this privilege which are published in separate tariffs filed with the Commission. These tariffs provide that westbound freight in carloads 'from points within the free lighterage limits of New York Harbor may be \n\n[305 \nU.S. 507, 518]\n\u00a0\n stored in designated warehouses ... within the Port District, and, if reforwarded by rail within the period specified in the tariffs ... the through rate ... from point of origin in New York Harbor to the final destination, will be applied.'\n As the through rate from shipside and from warehouse is the same, if the shipment moves outbound from the warehouse over the line of the inbound carrier, a shipper using carrier warehouses has the advantage of port stoppage without extra transportation cost. This tariff arrangement does not affect charges for warehousing services in connection with the storage. The storage is commercial in character and involves large tonnages. While the transportation tariffs permit varying periods of from twelve to thirty-six months for the different commodities, storage may be continued beyond this time limit at the same rate. Prior to October 16, 1934, the tariffs permitted the removal of the commodities stored at any time in any quantity and by any means of transportation without additional charge. On that date an additional charge was provided for withdrawal by means other than over the railroad which granted the storage. It will be noted that in the movement from shipside to a western destination an extra handling of the commodity is required if the warehouse is located directly on the water-front and two extra handlings if the goods must first be transported from the water-front to the warehouse and then loaded into westbound cars. The cost of these extra handlings is borne by the carrier. Insurance is furnished at a level premium rate notwithstanding the variables of the different exposures. All in all, it was determined, and this conclusion is not in dispute, that the warehouse services were performed 'at rates and charges which fail to compensate' the carriers for the cost.\n Through arrangements permitting distributors to avoid payment of tariff charges for storage, the Com- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 507, 519]\n\u00a0\n mission and the District Court found that the carriers permitted distributors of flour to get unjust and discriminatory charges.\n After examining the details of cost of the various carriers for warehousing, both as storage-in-transit and ordinary storage, the conclusion of the Interstate Commerce Commission was that the commercial warehousing was carried on at a substantial loss. The term 'commercial warehousing' covers all warehousing practices except those strictly a part of the operation of rail transportation. This phase of the circumstances surrounding the order may be summed up in the words of the 179th finding of fact of the District Court, which reads as follows:\n'In its first report the Commission pointed out that the matters and transactions referred to therein 'are further illustrations of serious waste resulting from the competition of railroads with each other for traffic.' The extent of this waste is indicated by statements contained in appendices to the report, Appendix I of which shows that the seven plaintiffs expended approximately $35,000,000 in connection with the warehouse projects considered in the report. In its second report the Commission found that up to the close of the year 1930, the cold storage industry had placed 33,688,546 cubic feet of refrigerated space on the market in the Port of New York District, and that within a period of three years thereafter warehouses affiliated with the Erie and Pennsylvania placed an additional 8,500,000 cubic feet of refrigerated space on the market, notwithstanding the fact that at the time there was an unused capacity of at least 30 per cent of the then-existing facilities; and further that as of the close of the year 1930 the 43 warehouse companies operating merchandise warehouses, other than cold storage, in the Port of New York District had placed 20,450,000 square feet of warehouse space on the market in that district, and that within six years subsequent to January \n\n[305 \nU.S. 507, 520]\n\u00a0\n 1, 1929, the plaintiffs or their affiliates placed 6,185,000 square feet of new additional merchandise warehouse space on the market, thereby, without commercial need, increasing the capacity at least 25 per cent. Appendix II of the first report shows that the loss incurred by plaintiffs in connection with their warehouse projects during the year 1931 was $1, 260,441. Appendix III shows that the loss per ton of freight stored in transit during 1931 ranged from $1.28 to $6.18. These losses were added to by losses incurred on freight stored on railroad piers, and in cars, on insurance premiums, and from loans and advances. In this connection the Commission found: 'Whether or not initial advantages may have been realized at one time or another, by individual carriers, the result is that a preferred group of large shippers are now the sole beneficiaries, and are so at the expense of the carriers and the general shipping public.' And the Commission found 'that the respondents' warehousing and storage practices, charges assessed, and allowances made in connection therewith at the Port of New York district dissipate their funds and revenues, are not in conformity with efficient and economical management as contemplated by the Interstate Commerce Act, and are not in the public interest.\"\n\n The final order of the District Court, dismissing upon these facts the petition for injunction to restrain the enforcement of the Commission's order, is attacked here upon two grounds: First, that the rendition of services to the public at less than cost is insufficient in law to establish that the carriers thereby make concessions and through such concessions are guilty of the violation of Sections 2, 3 and 6 of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C.A.  2, 3, 6; second, that the carriers having published and observed tariffs covering storage-in-transit cannot be guilty as to such services of violations of the same three sections.\n The carriers contend that the questions involved in charges of violations of the Interstate Commerce Act by \n\n[305 \nU.S. 507, 521]\n\u00a0\n discrimination and rebate are to be judged by the reasonable worth of the services rendered instead of by the cost to the carrier and that the charges for storage-in-transit are not warehousing costs but transportation costs and therefore it is no violation of the Act to furnish them at less than cost to the carriers.\n Warehousing Charges.-The order, as entered by the Commission11 and sustained by the lower court, was an \n\n[305 \nU.S. 507, 522]\n\u00a0\n exercise by the Commission of its power to cause carriers to cease and desist from practices which result in the receipt of less than the published tariffs for transportation services, with the consequence that concessions were given and preferences and advantages obtained by certain shippers. Its validity, except as it may be affected by consideration of the point that the practices were in accordance with tariffs made and filed with the Commission, depends upon whether a finding that the warehousing services were rendered at a charge below cost to the carrier authorized the order, without the further finding that the reasonable value of the service was above the charge.\n It was the view of the Commission and the lower court that the finding of the Commission showed a violation of Sections 2, 3(1) and 6(7) of the Interstate Commerce Act. \n12\n\u00a0\n\n[305 \nU.S. 507, 523]\n\u00a0\n These sections were enacted to assure the maintenance of rail transportation tariffs without rebate, discrimination or preference. No findings appear, nor has our attention been called to any evidence, which suggests the charges were made to meet the competition of the commercial warehousemen or were based upon the fair value of the services rendered, regardless of competition. On the contrary, it was the carriers' struggle to obtain line haul traffic which led them into the price cutting warfare. Charges for leases, storage, both in and out of the transit privilege, handling and insurance were alike slashed to meet the competition.\n Since the tariffs for rail haul are fixed for the various points and freight classifications, every shipper must pay that tariff for his transportation. As the shippers of the Port of New York district can utilize, in many instances, commercial storage and other warehousing services in addition to rail transportation, a saving on the non- transportation services obviously figures out the same as a rebate on the transportation service. It is immaterial that the shipper pays fair value or the market price for the extra privilege he enjoys. Section 6(7) of the Act forbids the carrier to receive less than the published rates \n\n[305 \nU.S. 507, 524]\n\u00a0\n for transportation or to remit 'by any device any portion of the rates.' When services, not necessary for transportation, are furnished below cost in an effort to acquire rail transportation, as was done here, this provision is violated. \n13\n Since the carrier warehouse rates, as found by the Court and Commission, are not open to all shippers alike14 there is violation of sections 2 and 3(1) prohibiting discrimination and unreasonable prejudice. The rail transportation rates have charged against them the loss occasioned by warehousing practices designed to attract a volume of rail business.\n This is not to say that for every situation it is necessary that accessorial services should be rendered at not less than cost, rather than market or fair value. The Commission pointed out it was not condemning bona fide storage-in-transit for milling, manufacturing or processing,15 but only the storage practices indulged in here to get rail transportation. In other circumstances fair value and market have been recognized as legitimate bases. 16 Where competitive practices such as existed here are absent, reasonble or market value charges may well be the test. The power, however, is in the Commission, whenever it is of the opinion that any practice is unjust, unreasonable, preferential or otherwise violative of the Act, to prescribe what practice will be just, fair and reasonable. \n17\n As in Merchants' Warehouse Co. v. United States18 the Commission 'rightly secured the discontinu- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 507, 525]\n\u00a0\n ance of the discrimination by ordering the carriers to cease employing the means by which it had been accomplished.'\n In-Transit Tariffs.-The carriers urge additional reasons why the order is invalid as to in-transit storage. They find in the order as to it all the alleged vices of the order with respect to leases and non-transit storage, which arise from basing the minimum charges on cost rather than market or fair value. They also contend that since the charges for in- transit arrangements are and must be published in tariffs, they are a part of transportation costs and therefore may be rendered at less than cost. \n19\n Even if the in-transit warehousing is not technically transportation, say the carriers, its inclusion in tariffs is sufficient to protect it from the attack that its below-cost charges violate Section 6. The carriers insist that they do not remit by any device any portion of the specified tariff charges and that, as asserted violations of Sections 2 and 3 are predicated upon violations of Section 6, none of the findings as to in- transit charges supports the orders.\n The Commission found that the in-transit warehousing was not a part of transportation. This finding is not affected by the determination of the Commission that the rates and charges should be published in the tariffs. Indeed, in its report on the subject the Commission said 'What is here condemned is the fact that the respondents have voluntarily engaged in storage and warehousing services which are not within their common- carrier obligations and, by providing such services to shippers below the cost of such services, reduce the cost to such shippers for the transportation of their goods. The tariffs now on \n\n[305 \nU.S. 507, 526]\n\u00a0\n file are instruments which work violations of the act in that, through them, respondents hold themselves out to perform commercial services ( under the guise of performing transportation services) at rates and charges which fail to compensate respondents for the cost of performing them, and thereby violate sections 2, 3, and 6 of the act.' \n20\n\u00a0\n\n We accept this conclusion. \n21\n If the service is non-transportation, the fact that it is in a tariff does not save it from the condemnation of Section 6(7). That section forbids receiving a less compensation for transportation than the tariff. The loss on in-transit warehousing, entered into to secure the rail-haul, results in lowered receipts for the transportation and in violation of the section. Some shippers are not in a position to avail themselves of the below-cost in-transit service. They must pay the full transportation rate, without any offset from the warehousing. This discrimination between shippers is unlawful and the remedy applied by the order valid in these circumstances.\n Conclusion.-We do not discuss the suggestion that the order deprives the carriers of their liberty and property contrary to the 5th Amendment, U.S.C.A.Const. Amend. 5. If, as here held, the order is a valid regulation of rates for warehousing services which affect transportation tariffs, it cannot be unconstitutional. Appellants' contention of unconstitutionality is predicated on the invalidity of the order under the Interstate Commerce Act.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 24, subsection (28), 28 U.S.C.A.  41(28). \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 38 Stat. 220, 28 U.S.C.A.  47. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] For opinion below see Baltimore & O.R.

The court below held the Resolution was not applicable. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n It is respondents' contention that their bonds represent a form of private international obligation, in no wise subject to the laws of the United States. However, they seek to enforce that obligation in this country and Congress has, as it constitutionally may, provided that multiple currency provisions of dollar obligations are against public policy here and, thus, unenforceable. The Constitution provides 'This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.' U.S.C. A.Const. art. 6, cl. 2. Courts in this country, State and Federal, can no longer enforce the contractual provisions which respondents have proceeded on, irrespective of their place of making.\n In the absence of any claim of international rights based upon the treaty provision of the Constitution, it is enough that respondents' bonds are 'obligations payable in the money of the United States', as we have this day held.\n Under the governing principles announced in Nos. 384 and 495, the multiple currency provisions of respondents' bonds are within the operation of the Resolution, and their coupons are dischargeable dollar for dollar in current legal tender money of the United States.\n Reversed. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 265, 268]\n\u00a0\n The CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, Mr. Justice BUTLER and Mr. Justice STONE think the judgments in these cases should be affirmed, for reasons stated in the opinion of Mr. Justice STONE in No. 384, Guaranty Trust Company of New York v. Henwood, and No. 495, Chemical Bank & Trust Company v.

We granted certiorari because of conflicting views between the Ninth and the Tenth Circuits, \n306 \nU.S. 629\n, 59 S.Ct. 787. See United States v. Nez Perce County, Idaho, 9 Cir., 95 F.2d 232.1\n M-Ko-Quah-Wah is a full-blooded Pottawatomie Indian. In her behalf the United States asserts whatever rights she may have flowing from the Treaty of November 15, 1861, between the United States and the Pottawatomie nation of Indians, 12 Stat. 1191, and the legislation in aid of it. This Treaty made lands held by the United States in trust for the Pottawatomie Indians 'exempt from levy, taxation, or sale ...' 'until otherwise provided by law ....' Article 2. The land which gave rise to this controversy, situated in Jackson County, Kansas, was patented under the General Allotment Act of February 8, 1887,  5, 24 Stat. 388, 25 U.S.C .  348, 25 U.S.C.A.  348. In pursuance of this Act, the United States agreed to hold the land for twenty-five years under the restrictions of the 1861 Treaty, subject to extension at the President's discretion. Two ten-year extensions were made by Executive Order, one, in 1918 and the other, in 1928; and by the Act of June 18, 1934, the existing trust periods were indefinitely extended by Congress. 48 Stat. 984, 25 U.S.C.A.  461 et seq.\n In this legislative setting, the Secretary of the Interior in 1918, over the objection of M-Ko-Quah-Wah, cancelled her outstanding trust patent and in its place issued a fee simple patent. This was duly recorded in the Registry of Deeds for Jackson County. In consequence Jackson County in 1919 began to subject the land to its regular property taxes. It continued to do so as long as \n\n[308 \nU.S. 343, 349]\n\u00a0\n this fee simple patent was left undisturbed by the United States. In 1927 Congress authorized the Secretary of the Interior to cancel fee simple patents theretofore issued over the objection of allottees. In 1935 the patent for the land in controversy was cancelled, and in the next year proceedings were begun by the United States as guardian of M-Ko-Quah-Wah to recover the taxes which Jackson County had collected, amounting to $1, 966.13, with interest from the respective dates of payment. The District Court allowed interest at 6%, and a verdict for principal and interest, amounting to $3,277.49, was returned by the jury. A judgment upon this verdict was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. Jackson County does not here contest its liability for the principal, but challenges the Government's right to interest prior to judgment.\n The issue is uncontrolled by any formal expression of the will of Congress. The United States urges that we must be indifferent to the law of the state pertaining to the recovery of taxes improperly levied on land within it. Jackson County, on the other hand, urges that the law of Kansas controls. It is settled doctrine there that a tax-payer may not recover from a county interest upon taxes wrongfully collected. Jackson County Com'rs v. Kaul, 77 Kan. 715, 96 P. 45, 17 L.R.A.,N.S., 552.\n We deem neither the juristic theory urged by the Government nor that of Jackson County entirely appropriate for the solution of our problem. The starting point for relief in this case is the Treaty of 1861, exempting M-Ko-Quah-Wah's property from taxation. Effectuation of the exemption is, of course, entirely within Congressional control. But Congress has not specifically provided for the present contingency, that is, the nature and extent of relief in case loss is suffered through denial of exemption. It has left such remedial details to judicial implications. Since the origin of the right to be enforced is the Treaty, plainly whatever rule we fashion is ultimately \n\n[308 \nU.S. 343, 350]\n\u00a0\n attributable to the Constitution, treaties or statutes of the United States, and does not owe its authority to the law-making agencies of Kansas. Cf. Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, \n304 \nU.S. 64\n, 58 S.Ct. 817, 114 A.L.R. 1487. And so the concrete problem is to determine the materials out of which the judicial rule regarding interest as an incident to the main remedy should be formulated. In ordinary suits where the Government seeks, as between itself and a private litigant, to enforce a money claim ultimately derived from a federal law, thus implying a wish of Congress to collect what it deemed fairly owing according to the traditional notions of Anglo-American law, this Court has chosen that rule as to interest which comports best with general notions of equity. United States v. Sanborn, \n135 \nU.S. 271, 281\n, 10 S.Ct. 812, 815; Billings v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 261\n, 34 S.Ct. 421. Instead of choosing a rigid rule, the Court has drawn upon those flexible considerations of equity which are established sources for judicial law- making.\n But the present case introduces an important factor not present in former decisions. The litigation is not between the United States and a private litigant, but between the United States and the political subdivision of a state. In effect, therefore, we have another aspect of our task in adjusting the interests of two governments within the same territory.\n Nothing that the state can do will be allowed to destroy the federal right which is to be vindicated; but in defining the extent of that right its relation to the operation of state laws is relevant. The state will not be allowed to invade the immunities of Indians, no matter how skilful its legal manipulations. United States v. Rickert, \n188 \nU.S. 432\n, 23 S.Ct. 478. Cf. Bunch v. Cole, \n263 \nU.S. 250\n, 44 S.Ct. 101. Nor are the federal courts restricted to the remedies available in state courts in enforcing such federal rights. United States v. Board of Com'rs of Osage County, \n251 \nU.S. 128\n, 40 S.Ct. 100; Ward v. Board of Com'rs of Love County, \n253 \nU.S. 17\n, 40 S.Ct. 419. Nor may the right to recover taxes \n\n[308 \nU.S. 343, 351]\n\u00a0\n illegally collected from Indians be unduly circumscribed by state law. Carpenter v. Shaw, \n280 \nU.S. 363\n, 50 S.Ct. 121. Again, state notions of laches and state statutes of limitations have no applicability to suits by the Government, whether on behalf of Indians or otherwise. United States v. Minnesota, \n270 \nU.S. 181\n, 46 S.Ct. 298. Cf. Chesapeake & Delaware Canal Co. v. United States, \n250 \nU.S. 123\n, 39 S.Ct. 407. This is so because the immunity of the sovereign from these defenses is historic. Unless expressly waived, it is implied in all federal enactments.\n But the recovery of interest in inter-governmental litigation has no such roots in history. Indeed, liability for interest is of relatively recent origin and the rationale of its recognition or denial is not always clear. That it is not a congenital rule in our law is indicated by its denial in United States v. North Carolina, \n136 \nU.S. 211\n, 10 S.Ct. 920, on grounds of 'public convenience'. Since Congress has, in the legislation implementing the Indians' tax immunity, remained silent as to recovery of interest, we need not presume that it has impliedly fixed liability for interest in a suit like the present.\n Having left the matter at large for judicial determination within the framework of familiar remedies equitable in their nature, see Stone v. White, \n301 \nU.S. 532, 534\n, 57 S.Ct. 851, 852, Congress has left us free to take into account appropriate considerations of 'public convenience'.2 Nothing seems to us more appropriate than due regard for local institutions and local interests. We are concerned with the interplay between the rights of Indians under federal guardianship and the local repercussion of those rights. Congress has not been heedless of the interests of the states in which Indian lands were situated, as reflected by their local laws. \n3\n With reference to other federal rights, the state law has been absorbed, as it were, \n\n[308 \nU.S. 343, 352]\n\u00a0\n as the governing federal rule not because state law was the source of the right but because recognition of state interests was not deemed inconsistent with federal policy. See Brown v. United States, \n263 \nU.S. 78\n, 44 S.Ct. 92; Seaboard Air Line R. Co. v. United States, \n261 \nU.S. 299\n, 43 S.Ct. 354. In the absence of explicit legislative policy cutting across state interests, we draw upon a general principle that the beneficiaries of federal rights are not to have a privileged position over other aggrieved tax-payers in their relation with the states or their political subdivisions. To respect the law of interest prevailing in Kansas in no wise impinges upon the exemption which the Treaty of 1861 has commanded Kansas to respect and the federal courts to vindicate.\n Assuming, however, that the law as to interest in governmental actions based upon quasi-contractual obligations be applicable, the United States must fail here. The cases teach that interest is not recovered according to a rigid theory of compensation for money withheld, but is given in response to considerations of fairness. It is denied when its exaction would be inequitable. United States v. Sanborn, \n135 \nU.S. 271, 281\n, 10 S.Ct. 812, 815; Billings v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 261\n, 34 S.Ct. 421.\n Jackson County in all innocence acted in reliance on a fee patent given under the hand of the President of the United States. Even after Congress in 1927 authorized the Secretary of the Interior to cancel such a patent, it was not until 1935 that such cancellation was made. Here is a long, unexcused delay in the assertion of a right for which Jackson County should not be penalized. By virtue of the most authoritative semblance of legitimacy under national law, the land of M-Ko-Quah-Wah and the lands of other Indians had become part of the economy of Jackson County. For eight years after Congress had directed attention to the problem, those specially entrusted with the intricacies of Indian law did not \n\n[308 \nU.S. 343, 353]\n\u00a0\n call Jackson County's action into question. Whatever may be her unfortunate duty to restore the taxes which she had every practical justification for collecting at the time, no claim of fairness calls upon her also to pay interest for the use of the money which she could not have known was not properly hers.\n Such is this Court's doctrine regarding the imposition of interest in cases where this Court has fashioned its own doctrine. If it be said that the default of the United States should not be charged against its Indian wards, a choice has to be made between equally innocent victims of official neglect from 1918 until 1936 in the administration of the Indian law. The loss of interest to the United States because of the conduct of its officials in the Sanborn and Billings cases, supra, had to be borne by the innocent public. We think as to interest here, the loss should remain where it has fallen. If thereby Indians are out of pocket, they should not be made whole by putting Jackson County unfairly out of pocket. The appeal for relief must be made elsewhere.\n The judgment below must accordingly be modified, and the case is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion. It is so ordered.\n Judgment modified.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS concurs in the result.\n\n Opinion of Mr. Justice BLACK.\n Congress has traditionally treated the Indian wards of the Nation with particular solicitude,1 but has also gradually evolved a policy looking to their eventual absorption into the general body of citizenry. \n2\n This policy has \n\n[308 \nU.S. 343, 354]\n\u00a0\n progressively subjected Indians to the laws under which all other citizens must live in the Indians' States of residence, if not in conflict with specific protective measures of Congress. \n3\n Here, in the exercise of its plenary authority, Congress by treaty exempted the lands of the Pottawatomies from taxation. It could have by stipulation granted the additional right to recover interest on any taxes collected in violation of the exemption; but it did not. The failure of Congress to stipulate that a State-as here-must pay interest to an Indian when the State law permits interest to no one,4 is entirely consistent with the congressional policy of steadily extending the operation of the States' laws over their resident Indians. Congress-with exclusive plenary power to legislate concerning the Indians-has not provided for recovery of interest from Kansas, and the courts have no constitutional power to create the right.\n That Congress contented itself with the creation of the right to be free from taxation-as distinguished from a right to interest in a suit for refund-is emphasized by the conclusion which would be inescapable were this a suit against the United States for violation of the exemption here conceded to be binding on it. \n5\n Without more,6 Congress would then-even on the basis of this concession-be deemed to have refused to create the separate right to recover interest. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n[308 \nU.S. 343, 355]\n\u00a0\n Because the laws of Kansas deny interest on tax refunds, I concur in the modification of the judgment below. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS concurs in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] This case has since been followed by the same court in United States v.

INGELS(1939)\nNo. 15\nArgued: October 16, 1939Decided: November 6, 1939\n\n\n\n As Modified on Denial of Rehearing Dec. 4, 1939\n\n\n Messrs. Raphael Dechter and Thomas S. Tobin, both of Los Angeles, Cal ., for petitioner.\n Mr. H. H. Linney, of San Francisco, Cal., for respondents. \n\n[308 \nU.S. 57, 58]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Under California law vehicle license and registration fees are due the State on January first of each year; they become delinquent when a vehicle is operated without registration and license; if the fees are not paid within thirty days after delinquency a penalty equal to the fees accrues; fees and penalties are protected by statutory lien on the vehicle from the due date. \n 1\n\u00a0\n\n The single question presented is sufficiently stated by the petition for certiorari:\n'Is a bankrupt's estate liable to penalties imposed by State statutes for non-payment of automobile license fees where license fees and penalties claims accrued during operations for purposes of liquidation of the business of bankrupt's estate by the Trustee in Bankruptcy?'\n\n As trustees of a business in bankruptcy, petitioner and his predecessor continuously operated unregistered and unlicensed vehicles on California highways, from January first to February twenty-seventh. Tender of fees without accrued penalties was rejected by California. Upon petition of the trustee, the referee in bankruptcy ordered the vehicles sold free and clear of any claims or liens of the State but permitted California to file claims for fees, without penalties, within thirty days or be forever barred. The referee's order was confirmed by the District Court which also directed California officials (respondents here) to issue licenses to the trustee. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, ordering alternatively that accrued fees and penalties be paid, or that the vehicles be disposed of subject to the lien of the State for the unpaid taxes and penalties. \n2\n Because of asserted conflict with the \n\n[308 \nU.S. 57, 59]\n\u00a0\n Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit,3 we granted certiorari. *\n The trustee insists that the State is barred from collecting the penalties because of section 57, sub. j of the Bankruptcy Act4 which provides:\n'Debts owing to the United States, a State, a county, a district, or a municipality as a penalty or forfeiture shall not be allowed, except for the amount of the pecuniary loss sustained by the act, transaction, or proceeding out of which the penalty or forfeiture arose, with reasonable and actual costs occasioned thereby and such interest as may have accrued thereon according to law.'\n\n Recognizing that section 57, sub. j, prohibits allowance of tax penalties accruing prior to bankruptcy5, the State nevertheless insists that this subdivision does not exempt the trustee from State laws applicable to the business he operates after bankruptcy. California considers the trustee subject to the requirements and penalties of its license and registration laws under an Act of Congress of June 18, 1934, 48 Stat. 993, 28 U.S.C.A.  124a, reading in part as follows:\n'Any receiver, liquidator, referee, trustee, or other officers or agents appointed by any United States court who is authorized by said court to conduct any business, or who does conduct any business, shall, from and after June 18, 1934, be subject to all State and local taxes applicable to such business the same as if such business were conducted by an individual or corporation ....'\n\n First. Section 57, sub. j, prohibits allowance of a tax penalty against the bankrupt estate only if incurred by the bankrupt before bankruptcy by reason of his own delinquency. After bankruptcy, it does not purport to ex- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 57, 60]\n\u00a0\n empt the trustee from the operation of State laws, or to relieve the estate from liability for the trustee's delinquencies. \n6\n For 57j is a subdivision of Section 57 of the Bankruptcy Act governing 'Proof and Allowance of Claims.' And 57, sub. a, makes clear that Section 57 as a whole relates only to claims 'justly owing from the bankrupt to the creditor.' The fees and penalties in issue were incurred by the trustee in operating the bankrupt business, and thus were not owed by the bankrupt to the State as a 'creditor.' Therefore, regardless of other rights the State might have, it could not file proof of claim for these fees and penalties as a creditor under Section 57. And neither the tax liability nor the penalties incurred by the trustee after bankruptcy are governed by this Section or its subdivisions. We must look elsewhere than to section 57, sub. j, to determine whether the court below correctly held that California may enforce its statutory penalties against this estate.\n Second. The Act of June 18, 1934, 28 U.S.C.A.  124a, declares that a trustee in bankruptcy conducting a business, as this trustee was, 'shall ... be subject to all State and local taxes applicable to such business the same as if such business were conducted by an individual or corporation ....' As originally offered, this Act applied only to receivers. \n7\n Reported by the House Committee on the Judiciary without amendment,8 the bill was amended on the House floor to apply not only to receivers but to a 'liquidator, referee, trustee or other officer or agent.' \n 9\n\u00a0\n\n We need not determine whether, without legislation such as the 1934 Act, the fact that a local business in \n\n[308 \nU.S. 57, 61]\n\u00a0\n bankruptcy is operated by a bankruptcy trustee makes the business immune from State laws and valid measures for their enforcement. Clearly, means of permitting such immunity from local laws will not be read into the Bankruptcy Act. At any rate, Congress has here with vigor and clarity declared that a trustee and other court appointees who operate businesses must do so subject to State taxes 'the same as if such business(es) were conducted by an individual or corporation.' If businesses in California not conducted by a bankruptcy trustee are delinquent in the fees, they must pay the penalty. However, petitioner's contention would exempt a trustee operating a business in bankruptcy from this double tax liability which other delinquents must bear. A State would thus be accorded the theoretical privilege of taxing businesses operated by trustees in bankruptcy on an equal footing with all other businesses, but would be denied the traditional and almost universal method of enforcing prompt payment.\n Taxation on and regulation of highway traffic are matters of constantly increasing importance and concern to the States. The Act of 1934 indicates a Congressional purpose to facilitate-not to obstruct- enforcement of State laws; the court below correctly recognized and applied this Congressional purpose and its judgment is\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice BUTLER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] c. 362, Calif.Stat. of 1935, p. 1313, as amended. c. 27, Calif.Stat. of 1935, Calif.

JOHNSTON(1939)\nNo. 359\nArgued: January 11, 1939Decided: January 30, 1939\n\n\n\n\n\n[306 \nU.S. 19, 21]\n\u00a0\n Seth W. Richardson, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Bates Booth, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner was convicted, in 1933, in the District Court of the Northern District of Georgia, of murder committed in 1930 on the Government Reservation known as the Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Park within the exterior limits of the State of Georgia. He was sentenced to imprisonment for life and is confined in the prison at Alcatraz, California.\n In 1937, he presented a petition for a writ of habeas corpus to the District Judge of the Northern District of California alleging that the indictment was void, and no legal judgment could be based thereon, as it failed to show jurisdiction over the person and subject matter; that the United States did not have exclusive jurisdiction over the Park. \n1\n He also alleged that on his trial the court did not have the evidence taken down and preserved so that he might appeal, and that, upon this ground and others, he had been deprived of his liberty without due process of law. A copy of the indictment was annexed to the petition. Pursuant to an order to show cause, the Warden made return showing the judgment and the record of commitment. On the return day there was no appearance of petitioner's attorneys, and no evidence, apart from the return and the attached exhibits, was offered. The petition was submitted and later was de- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 19, 22]\n\u00a0\n nied without opinion. On appeal, the order was affirmed. Bowen v. Johnson, 9 Cir., 97 F.2d 860.\n The principal contention before the Circuit Court of Appeals was that the United States did not have exclusive jurisdiction over the Park and hence that the District Court in Georgia did not have jurisdiction to try the petitioner. The court, taking the view that the United States could constitutionally acquire jurisdiction over the Park (Collins v. Yosemite Park & C. Co., \n304 \nU.S. 518\n, 58 S.Ct. 1009), held that the question whether the United States did acquire such jurisdiction could not be raised on habeas corpus. In view of the importance of the question thus presented, we granted certiorari. October 10, 1938, \n305 \nU.S. 579\n, 59 S.Ct. 98, 83 L.Ed. --.\n First.-Jurisdiction is conferred upon the District Courts 'of all crimes and offenses cognizable under the authority of the United States'. Jud.Code, sec. 24, 28 U.S.C.  41(2), 28 U.S.C.A.  41(2).\n Crimes are thus cognizable-\n'When committed within or on any lands reserved or acquired for the exclusive use of the United States, and under the exclusive jurisdiction thereof, or any place purchased or otherwise acquired by the United States by consent of the legislature of the State in which the same shall be, for the erection of a fort, magazine, arsenal, dockyard, or other needful building'. Crim.Code, sec. 272, 18 U.S.C.  451, Third, 18 U.S.C.A.  451, subd. 3.\n\n The last clause covers cases where exclusive jurisdiction is acquired by the United States pursuant to Article 1, section 8, clause 17, of the Constitution, U.S.C.A.\n In the instant case, no question of fact was presented with respect to the place where the crime was committed. The indictment specified the place, that is,-\n'a certain place and on certain lands reserved and acquired for the exclusive use of the United States and under exclusive jurisdiction thereof, and acquired by the United States by consent of the Legislature of the State \n\n[306 \nU.S. 19, 23]\n\u00a0\n of Georgia, to wit: Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Park, sometimes known as Chickmauga and Chattanooga National Military Park, in said State of Georgia'.\n\n The sole question was whether this Park was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States. There is no question that the United States had the constitutional power to acquire the territory for the purpose of a national park and that it did acquire it. Whether or not the National Government acquired exclusive jurisdiction over the lands within the Park or the State reserved, as it could, jurisdiction over the crimes there committed, depended upon the terms of the consent or cession given by the legislature of Georgia. Collins v. Yosemite Park Co., supra, pages 529, 530, 58 S.Ct. page 1014. See, also, James v. Dravo Contracting Co., \n302 \nU.S. 134\n, 146-148, 58 S.Ct. 208, 214, 215, 114 A.L.R. 318. The federal courts take judicial notice of the Georgia statutes. Owings v. Hull, 9 Pet. 607; Lamar v. Micou, \n114 \nU.S. 218, 223\n, 5 S.Ct. 857, 859. If these statutes did not give to the United States exclusive jurisdiction over the Park, the indictment did not charge a crime cognizable under the authority of the United States.\n Second.-Where the District Court has jurisdiction of the person and the subject matter in a criminal prosecution, the writ of habeas corpus cannot be used as a writ of error. The judgment of conviction is not subject to collateral attack. Ex parte Watkins, 3 Pet. 193, 203; Ex parte Parks, \n93 \nU.S. 18\n, 23; Harlan v.

But if it be found that the court had no jurisdiction to try the petitioner, or that in its proceedings his constitutional rights have been denied, the remedy of habeas corpus is available. Ex parte Lange, 18 Wall. 163, 178; Ex parte Crow Dog, \n109 \nU.S. 556, 572\n, 3 S.Ct. 396, 406; In re Snow, \n120 \nU.S. 274, 285\n, 7 S.Ct. 556, 561; Ex parte Coy, \n127 \nU.S. 731, 751\n, 758 S., 8 S.Ct. 1263, 1268, 1272; Ex parte Hans Nielsen, Petitioner, \n131 \nU.S. 176, 182\n, 9 S.Ct. 672, 674; In re Bonner, \n151 \nU.S. 242, 257\n, 14 S.Ct. 323, 325; Moore v. Dempsey, \n261 \nU.S. 86, 91\n, 43 S.Ct. 265, 266; Johnson v. Zerbst, \n304 \nU.S. 458, 467\n, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 1024\n\n\n In applying this principle, we have said that the court 'has jurisdiction to render a particular judgment only when the offense charged is within the class of offenses placed by the law under its jurisdiction'. In re Bonner, supra, 14 S.Ct. 325. As it is the duty of the District Court, when the prosecution is brought before it, to examine the charge and ascertain whether the offense is of that class, the District Court is thus empowered to pass upon its own jurisdiction. This, under the applicable statute, may require consideration of the place where the offense is alleged to have been committed. The answer to that question may require the examination and determination of questions of fact and law and that determination may be the appropriate subject of appellate review. Thus, if, construing a statute, a question of law is determined against the Government on demurrer to the indictment, the case may fall within the provisions of the Criminal Appeals Act, 18 U.S.C.A.  682. United States v. Sutton, \n215 \nU.S. 291\n, 30 S.Ct. 116; United States v. Soldana, \n246 \nU.S. 530\n, 38 S.Ct. 357. Or, if decided against the accused, the question may be reviewed by the Circuit Court of Appeals on appeal from the judgment of conviction. In considering the distribution of appellate jurisdiction under the former statute2 permitting a direct writ of error from this Court to the District Court, when the question of the jurisdiction of the latter was the only \n\n[306 \nU.S. 19, 25]\n\u00a0\n question involved, we drew the distinction between the question of the jurisdiction of the District Court in that aspect and that of the jurisdiction of the United States. Louie v. United States, \n254 \nU.S. 548, 550\n, 41 S.Ct. 188, 189. There, on a charge of murder committed within the limits of an Indian reservation, the defendant contended that before the time of the alleged crime he had been declared competent and that the land on which the crime was alleged to have been committed 'had been allotted and deeded to him in fee simple'. 'That the District Court ... had jurisdiction to determine whether the locus in quo was a part of the reservation was not questioned' and the judgment was held to be reviewable by the Circuit Court of Appeals and not directly by this Court. See, also, Pronovost v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 487\n, 34 S.Ct. 391; Pothier v. Rodman, \n261 \nU.S. 307, 311\n, 43 S.Ct. 374, 375.\n Where on the face of the record the District Court has jurisdiction of the offense and of the defendant and the defendant contends that on the facts shown the crime was not committed at a place within the jurisdiction of the United States, we have held that the judgment is one for review by the Circuit Court of Appeals in error proceedings and that the writ of habeas corpus is properly refused. Toy Toy v. Hopkins, \n212 \nU.S. 542, 549\n, 29 S.Ct. 416, 417. And, on removal proceedings, we have observed that in a case where the question 'whether the locus of the alleged crime was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States demands consideration of many facts and seriously controverted questions of law', these matters 'must be determined by the court where the indictment was found' and that 'the regular course may not be anticipated by alleging want of jurisdiction and demanding a ruling thereon in a habeas corpus proceeding'. Rodman v. Pothier, \n264 \nU.S. 399, 402\n, 44 S.Ct. 360, 361. See, also, Henry v. Henkel, \n235 \nU.S. 219, 229\n, 35 S.Ct. 54, 57. On the same principle, in Walsh v. Archer, 9 Cir., 73 F.2d 197, where the indictment charged \n\n[306 \nU.S. 19, 26]\n\u00a0\n murder committed on board a vessel on the high seas, the court affirmed an order dismissing a petition for habeas corpus, it being contended that the vessel at the time of the commission of the crime was within the State of California and under its jurisdiction, saying-' Whether the location of the alleged crime was upon the high seas and exclusively within the jurisdiction of the United States required consideration of many facts and seriously controverted questions of law, including the alleged error involving the jurisdiction of the court'. Id., page 199.\n But the rule, often broadly stated, is not to be taken to mean that the mere fact that the court which tried the petitioner had assumed jurisdiction, necessarily deprives another court of authority to grant a writ of habeas corpus. As the Court said in the case of Coy, supra, pages 757, 758, 8 S.Ct. page 1272, the broad statement of the rule was certainly not intended to go so far as to mean, for example, 'that because a federal court tries a prisoner for an ordinary common-law offense, as burglary, assault and battery, or larceny, with no averment or proof of any offense against the United States, or any connection with a statute of the United States, and punishes him by imprisonment, that he cannot be released by habeas corpus because the court which tried him had assumed jurisdiction'. Despite the action of the trial court, the absence of jurisdiction may appear on the face of the record (see In re Snow, supra; Ex parte Hans Nielsen, Petitioner, supra, page 183, 9 S.Ct. page 674) and the remedy of habeas corpus may be needed to release the prisoner from a punishment imposed by a court manifestly without jurisdiction to pass judgment.\n It must never be forgotten that the writ of habeas corpus is the precious safeguard of personal liberty and there is no higher duty than to maintain it unimpaired. Ex parte Lange, supra. The rule requiring resort to appellate procedure when the trial court has determined its own jurisdiction of an offense is not a rule denying the \n\n[306 \nU.S. 19, 27]\n\u00a0\n power to issue a writ of habeas corpus when it appears that nevertheless the trial court was without jurisdiction. The rule is not one defining power but one which relates to the appropriate exercise of power. It has special application where there are essential questions of fact determinable by the trial court. Rodman v. Pothier, supra. It is applicable also to the determination in ordinary cases of disputed matters of law whether they relate to the sufficiency of the indictment or to the validity of the statute on which the charge is based. Id.; Glasgow v. Moyer, supra; Henry v. Henkel, supra. But it is equally true that the rule is not so inflexible that it may not yield to exceptional circumstances where the need for the remedy afforded by the writ of habeas corpus is apparent. Among these exceptional circumstances are those indicating a conflict between state and federal authorities on a question of law involving concerns of large importance affecting their respective jurisdictions. In re Lincoln, \n202 \nU.S. 178, 182\n, 183 S., 26 S.Ct. 602, 603, 604; Henry v. Henkel, supra, pages 228, 229, 35 S.Ct. pages 56, 57.\n We think that there are such exceptional circumstances in this instance. There appear to be uncertainty and confusion with respect to the question whether offenses within the Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Park are triable in the state or federal courts. It is represented that murder cases have been tried in the state court as well as in the federal court. If the District Court which tried petitioner gave consideration to the question, it made no comment on the subject, as it rendered no opinion and apparently made no record of its proceedings aside from the indictment and judgment. The matter stood without any judicial explication and without appeal. If, as contended, there being no disputed questions of fact, a reading of the Georgia statute of consent and cession would show that the United States had not acquired jurisdiction so as to bring the offense charged in the in \n\n[306 \nU.S. 19, 28]\n\u00a0\n dictment within the class of offenses cognizable in the District Court, we think that it was within the province of the court to which the application for habeas corpus was made to examine the question and to issue the writ in case the claim of want of jurisdiction in the trial court was found to be a valid one.\n Third.-Our examination of the Georgia statutes leads to the conclusion that it is unnecessary to remand the case for the determination of the District Court but that it may be, and should be, disposed of at once by our decision.\n The lands which are embraced within the Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Park, and lie within the exterior limits of the State of Georgia, were acquired under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved August 19, 1890, and supplementary legislation. 26 Stat. 333, 16 U.S.C.A.  424. The Act provided for the establishment of the Park 'upon the ceding of jurisdiction by the legislature of the State of Georgia'. The lands were acquired in 1891 and subsequent years. Some were acquired by purchase and some by condemnation. Consent was given and jurisdiction was ceded to the United States by an Act of the Legislature of Georgia approved November 19, 1890. Georgia Laws, 1890-91, vol. 1, p. 199. The Act specifically reserved to the State of Georgia criminal jurisdiction in the ceded territory by the following proviso:\n'provided, that this cession is upon the express condition that the State of Georgia shall so far retain a concurrent jurisdiction with the United States over said lands and roads as that all civil and criminal process issued under the authority of this State may be executed thereon in like manner as if this Act had not been passed; and upon the further express conditions, that the State shall retain its civil and criminal jurisdiction over persons and citizens in said ceded territory as over other persons and citizens in the State, and the property of said citizens and resi- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 19, 29]\n\u00a0\n dents thereon, except land and such other property as the general government may desire for its use, and that the property belonging to persons residing within said ceded territory shall be liable to State and county taxes, the same as if they resided elsewhere, and that citizens of this State in said ceded territory shall retain all rights of State suffrage and citizenship;'\n\n Later Acts of cession contained a similar reservation as to criminal jurisdiction. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n If the matter rested with these statutes, there would be no room for doubt that jurisdiction to punish for crimes committed on the lands within the Park remained with the State. See James v. Dravo Contracting Co., supra. But in 1927, another cession act of a general character was passed by the state legislature, purporting to cede exclusive jurisdiction to the United States over any land 'which has been or may hereafter be acquired for custom-houses, post-offices arsenals, other public buildings whatever, or for any other purposes of government'. Georgia Laws, 1927, p. 352. This Act reserved the right to serve civil and criminal processes but not criminal jurisdiction over offenses within the ceded territory.\n The argument is strongly pressed that as this is a general act and there is no express repeal of, or specific reference to, the earlier special acts relating to the lands within the Park, it should not be regarded as yielding the jurisdiction which the earlier acts reserved to the State. But we find that the administrative construction is to the contrary. The administration of the Park was placed with the War Department4 and it appears from its files that on July 14, 1930, upon a review of the pertinent legislation, the Judge Advocate General gave an opinion that the Act of 1927 'vests exclusive jurisdiction in the \n\n[306 \nU.S. 19, 30]\n\u00a0\n United States over that part of the Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park located within the State of Georgia' and that violations of law occurring on the ceded lands are enforceable only by the proper authorities of the United States. As this administrative construction is a permissible one we find it persuasive and we think that the debated question of jurisdiction should be settled by construing the Act of 1927 in the same way.\n On this ground, the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals, affirming the order of the District Court denying the petition for habeas corpus, is affirmed.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Criminal Code, Sec. 272, Third, 18 U.S.C.  451, 18 U.S.C.A.  451, subd. 3. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 26 Stat. 827, 36 Stat. 1157, Jud.Code, sec. 238, 28 U.S.C.A.  345. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Georgia Laws, 1893, p. 110; 1895, p. 77; 1901, p. 85; 1902, p. 110. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] Transferred to the National Parks Service, Department of the Interior by Executive Order No. 6166, June 10, 1933. \n\n\n\n\n","9":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBRUNO v. UNITED STATES(1939)\nNo. 300\nArgued: November 6, 1939Decided: December 4, 1939\n\n\n\n\n[308 \nU.S. 287, 288]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Samuel B. Wasserman and M. Michael Edelstein, both of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. O. John Rogge, Asst. Atty. Gen., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[308 \nU.S. 287, 291]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In affirming the conviction of Jerry Bruno, who, with eighty-seven others, was convicted of a conspiracy to violate the narcotic laws, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit dealt with an important question in the administration of federal criminal justice in such a way as to lead us to grant certiorari, \n308 \nU.S. 536\n, 60 S.Ct. 112, 84 L.Ed. --.\n Some of Bruno's co-defendants took the witness-stand. He did not. The trial court gave the following instructions to the jury regarding the attitude to be observed by them towards the accused as a witness: 'It is the privilege of a defendant to testify as a witness if, and only when, he so elects; and when he does testify his credibility is to be determined in the light of his interest, which usually is greater than that of any other witness, and is therefore a matter which may seriously affect the credence that shall be given to his testimony.' \n\n[308 \nU.S. 287, 292]\n\u00a0\n Bruno requested this additional instruction: 'The failure of any defendant to take the witness stand and testify in his own behalf, does not create any presumption against him; the jury is charged that it must not permit that fact to weigh in the slightest degree against any such defendant, nor should this fact enter into the discussions or deliberations of the jury in any manner.'\n The trial judge declined this request, saying 'I feel that I've already covered that.' The exception to this denial having been saved, the Circuit Court of Appeals found no error in the refusal, although confessing that the guidance which had been given the jury 'was not the equivalent of what the defendant had requested', United States v. Bruno, 2 Cir., 105 F.2d 921, 923. By this, we take it, the court below meant that the topic on which Bruno proffered an instruction had not been charged at all.\n Therefore, the narrow question before us is whether in these circumstances Bruno had the indefeasible right to have the jury told in substance what he asked the judge to tell it. The issue is determined by a proper application of the Act of March 16, 1878, 20 Stat. 30, now 28 U.S.C. A.  632, 28 U.S.C.A.  632.1\n That Act freed the accused in a federal prosecution from his common law disability as a witness. But Congress coupled his privilege to be a witness with the right to have a failure to exercise the privilege not tell against him. The accused could 'at his own request but not \n\n[308 \nU.S. 287, 293]\n\u00a0\n otherwise, be a competent witness. And his failure to make such request shall not create any presumption against him.' Such was the command of the law-makers. The only way Congress could provide that abstention from testifying should not tell against an accused was by an implied direction to judges to exercise their traditional duty in guiding the jury by indicating the considerations relevant to the latter's verdict on the facts. Sparf v. United States, \n156 \nU.S. 51, 715\n, 15 S.Ct. 273. By legislating against the creation of any 'presumption' from a failure to testify, Congress could not have meant to legislate against the psychological operation of the jury's mind. It laid down canons of judicial administration for the trial judge to the extent that his instructions to the jury, certainly when appropriately invoked, might affect the behavior of jurors. Concededly the charge requested by Bruno was correct. The Act of March 16, 1878, gave him the right to invoke it.\n A subsidiary question remains for determination. It derives from the Act of February 26, 1919, 40 Stat. 1181, 28 U.S.C.  391, 28 U.S.C.A.  391,2 whereby appellate courts are under duty in criminal as well as in civil cases to disregard 'technical errors, defects, or exceptions which do not affect the substantial rights of the parties.' Is the disregard of the right which Congress gave to Bruno an error, the commission of which we may disregard? We hold not. It would be idle to predetermine the scope of such a remedial provision as  391 by anticipating the myriad varieties of rulings made in trials and attempting an \n\n[308 \nU.S. 287, 294]\n\u00a0\n abstract, inclusive definition of 'technical errors'. Suffice it to indicate, what every student of the history behind the Act of February 26, 1919, knows, that that Act was intended to prevent matters concerned with the mere etiquette of trials and with the formalities and minutiae of procedure from touching the merits of a verdict. Of a very different order of importance is the right of an accused to insist on a privilege which Congress has given him.\n To the suggestion that it benefits a defendant who fails to take the stand not to have the attention of the jury directed to that fact, it suffices to say that, however difficult it may be to exercise enlightened self-interest, the accused should be allowed to make his own choice when an Act of Congress authorizes him to choose. And when it is urged that it is a psychological impossibility not to have a presumption arise in the minds of jurors against an accused who fails to testify, the short answer is that Congress legislated on a contrary assumption and not without support in experience. It was for Congress to decide whether what it deemed legally significant was psychologically futile. Certainly, despite the vast accumulation of psychological data, we have not yet attained that certitude about the human mind which would justify us in disregarding the will of Congress by a dogmatic assumption that jurors, if properly admonished, neither could nor would heed the instructions of the trial court that the failure of an accused to be a witness in his own cause 'shall not create any presumption against him.'\n We conclude that the substance of the denied request should have been granted, and the judgment therefore is\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS concurs in the result. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 632: 'In the trial of all indictments, informations, complaints, and other proceedings against persons charged with the commission of crimes, offenses, and misdemeanors, in the United States courts, Territorial courts, and courtsmartial, and courts of inquiry, in any State or Territory, including the District of Columbia, the person so charged shall, at his own request but not otherwise, be a competent witness.

Schweppe, of Seattle, Wash., for appellees.\n\n\n\n[307 \nU.S. 95, 97]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal, under section 266 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.A .  380, from a decree dismissing appellants' bill to enjoin the enforcement by the appellees of a statute of the State of Washington. \n1\n The purpose of the statute is to render illegal certain activities carried on by pools of copyright owners in authorizing by blanket licenses the performance of their musical compositions.\n The statute declares it unlawful for two or more persons holding separate copyrighted works to pool their interests in order to fix prices for their use, to collect fees or to issue blanket licenses for their commercial production. Joint undertakings for this purpose are permitted if the licenses are issued at rates assessed on a per piece system of usage. All combinations of owners of separate copyrighted musical works are required to file a complete list of these works once each year with the secretary of state of the State of Washington, together with detailed information as to prices and ownership. There are numerous other provisions unnecessary to detail.\n The appellants are the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers; Gene Buck, suing in his own name and as the president of the Society; and a number of other members, corporate publishers and authors, composers or their next of kin. This suit was brought by complainants on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated, members of the Society too numerous to make it practicable to join them as plaintiffs in a matter of common and general interest. The bill alleges the organization of the Society as a voluntary, unincorporated, \n\n[307 \nU.S. 95, 98]\n\u00a0\n non-profit association under the laws of New York, and sets out that its purpose is to protect the owners of copyrighted musical works against piracies, to grant licenses and to collect royalties for the public performance for profit of the compositions of its members. These are composers, authors and publishers of musical compositions or their successors. The royalties and license fees collected by the Society are distributed from time to time, as ordered by the Board of Directors, among the members of the Society, after the payment of expenses of operation and sums due to foreign affiliated societies and after the deduction of a limited reserve fund.\n In addition to the general allegation that the value of the matter in dispute is in excess of $3,000, the bill alleges that the value of each publisher's copyrights exceeds $1,000,000. The bill further shows that each individual complainant has rights to royalties and renewals worth in excess of $100,000. It is shown by the bill that in the State of Washington there were five hundred twenty-eight contracts outstanding in 1936, all entered into in the name of the Society, from which it received more than $60,000 and that similar sums annually will be collected. Other allegations are discussed later.\n On the filing of the bill, a motion was made for an interlocutory injunction and affidavits were filed in support of the request. At the time the motion for a temporary injunction came on for hearing, the defendant state officers and certain intervenors filed motions to dismiss which challenged the bill on various grounds. The district court considered only one ground: whether the value of the subject matter in dispute is more than $3,000, exclusive of interest and costs. Upon the hearing, and district court found that neither the bill nor the record shows the necessary jurisdictional value and dismissed the bill. The basis for this ruling is treated here. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 95, 99]\n\u00a0\n Although this statute of Washington, as that of Florida,2 is aimed at the power exercised by combinations of copyright owners over the use of musical compositions for profit, the differences between the enactments and the procedural situations require additional consideration. The Florida statute does not permit any combination of copyright owners for the purpose of licensing the use of their compositions. The prohibition is complete. In the Washington statute, on the other hand, such a combination, federation or pool is not prohibited if it issues licenses 'on rates assessed on a per piece system of usage.' Even upon these permitted transactions there are limitations of price and use, unnecessary to consider here. \n3\n The statute is directed particularly at \n\n[307 \nU.S. 95, 100]\n\u00a0\n the practice of issuing blanket licenses which authorize the performance of all copyrighted material belonging to the licensor. Whether a state statute is regulatory or prohibitory, when a bill is filed against its enforcement under section 266 of the Judicial Code, the matter in controversy is the right to carry on business free of the regulation or prohibition of the statute. \n4\n Where the statute is regulatory the value of the right to carry on the business, as was said in McNutt v. General Motors Acceptance Corporation, supra, may be shown by evidence of the loss that would follow the enforcement of the statute. And this loss may be something other than the difference between the net profit free of regulation and the net profit subject to regulation. The difficulties of determining the value of rights by calculating past profits as compared with possible future profits, influenced by the single factor of statutory regulation, are obvious. This difference is not the only test of the value of the right in question. The value of the matter in controversy may be at least as accurately shown by proving the additional cost of complying with the regulation. This factor was not offered in evidence in the McNutt case.\n In Packard v. Banton5 the existence of the jurisdictional amount was partly determined by consideration of the cost of providing liability insurance required by a regulatory statute. Where a state railroad commission required e construction and service of an industrial spur \n\n[307 \nU.S. 95, 101]\n\u00a0\n which did not increase earning capacity, the cost was held to measure the jurisdictional amount. \n6\n The expense of producing the information required by a challenged order in a utility investigation was considered sufficient to establish the value of the matter in controversy. \n7\n The cost of complying with the challenged statute as a test of the value of the amount in controversy has been applied in effect in suits to enjoin the collection of taxes as unconstitutional interferences with the right to do business. In such cases 'the sum due or demanded is the matter in controversy and the amount of the tax, not its capitalized value, is the measure of the jurisdictional amount.' \n8\n\u00a0\n\n By section 4 of the Washington statute every combination of two or more copyright owners must file, once a year, with the secretary of state, a complete list of their copyrighted works, under oath. \n9\n By section 3, individuals are forbidden from joining together 'for the purpose of collecting fees in this state' unless their licenses are on a per piece system of rates. In addition to the general allegation that the value of the matter in controversy exceeds $3,000, the bill alleges the cost of compliance by the Society, the com- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 95, 102]\n\u00a0\n bination of members, with section four would exceed $300,000. 10 For the individual members who now have the benefits of the services performed by the Society, additional allegations set out the cost imposed upon them by the statutory regulation as being 'in excess of $10,000' to each for carrying on for themselves the functions now performed for them by the Society. The motions to dismiss deny the general allegation of value, deny that there would be any cost to the Society by compliance with section four as the required list is already compiled and the expense, since the Society is non-profit, would be borne by members, and deny that the individual complainants would be put to a cost of $10,000 each. There was no allegation of the loss or cost to the Society or members occasioned by the requirement that the licenses from pooled copyrights should be issued at per piece rates.\n On submission of the motion to dismiss for want of the jurisdictional value, the burden of proof was upon complainants. \n11\n Although the trial court called specific attention to the jurisdictional matters three months before it filed its opinion denying jurisdiction, by request for additional briefs, no evidence was offered after the filing of the opinion and before the entry of the decree, \n\n[307 \nU.S. 95, 103]\n\u00a0\n on complainants' motion an order was entered to show cause why witnesses should not be heard on the value of the matter in controversy. The complainants furnished an uncontroverted affidavit stating that their failure to offer evidence was due to the fact that there was no denial of the facts pleaded. The offer of proof showed that it was desired 'to offer the testimony of expert witnesses concerning the cost of complying with the requirements of Section 4 of the Act, and concerning the value of the property rights in question which will be affected by this Statute.' The court did not reject the evidence as a matter of discretion because tardily presented. On the hearing on the rule the court made it quite clear that the proffered evidence was deemed immaterial because it showed only cost of compliance, not the value of the right to do business free of the compulsion of the statute. \n12\n The application to take further testimony was denied and the motion to dismiss granted 'in that this cause is not within the jurisdiction of this court as a federal court.' We conclude that the refusal to permit additional evidence in these circumstances was error.\n The complainants in this case are the same as those in Gibbs v. Buck, supra. In the Gibbs case we pointed out that the members share directly in the earnings of the Society and have a common and undivided interest in \n\n[307 \nU.S. 95, 104]\n\u00a0\n the right to license in association through the Society free of the provisions of the state statute. The allegations as to relationship between the Society and its members show the same status in this case. The fact that 'neither practice nor rule of the committee concerning the apportioning among the Society's members of the pooled license fees realized is shown,'13 does not affect the rights members have in the apportionment of the royalties from license fees. These rights are granted by the articles of association which are a part of the bill. KVOS, Inc. v. Associated Press,14 relied upon below, is distinguished in the Gibbs case.\n The cause will be remanded to the District Court with directions to permit the introduction of evidence and for further proceedings not inconsistent herewith.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice BLACK dissents.\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Buck v.

MCKINLEY(1939)\nNo. 201\nArgued: Decided: December 18, 1939\n\n\n\n\n[308 \nU.S. 358, 359]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Terrell Marshall, of Little Rock, Ark., for petitioner.\n Mr. W. L. Pope, of Little Rock, Ark., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Section 901 of the Social Security Act, 49 Stat. 620, 42 U.S.C.A.  1101, levies an excise tax, equal to specified percentages of total wages paid, on 'every employer' of eight or more persons with respect to their 'employment'. By  902 the taxpayer may credit against this tax the amount of contributions paid by him into an unemployment fund under a state law, such credit however not to exceed 90 per cent of the tax and to be allowed only for contributions made \n\n[308 \nU.S. 358, 360]\n\u00a0\n under the laws of states approved and certified by the Social Security Board in accordance with the standards prescribed in  903. By  907 the term 'employment' is defined to mean 'any service, of whatever nature, performed within the United States by an employee for his employer' except, inter alia, service performed 'in the employ of the United States Government or of an instrumentality of the United States'.\n Petitioner is an Arkansas corporation, organized for profit and with its only place of business situated on the United States Government Reservation known as Hot Springs National Park. It operates a bath house, which it erected and equipped, under a long term lease from the Secretary of the Interior. By the terms of that lease the operation and use of the bath house facilities are subject to certain control by the Department of the Interior, which in the main relate to the number of bath tubs which may be used, the charges to the public, the qualifications of employees, the maintenance and care of the premises, a prohibition of employment of agents to solicit patronage, and control over an assignment or transfer of the lease or any interest therein.\n Respondents are officials of the State of Arkansas charged with the duty of enforcement of the Arkansas Unemployment Compensation Law,1 an act reciprocal to, and integrated with, the Social Security Act. \n2\n Pursuant to that act respondents sought to collect from petitioner as an employer the required contributions for the calendar year 1937. Petitioner paid into the Treasury of the United States the tax required by the Social Security Act \n\n[308 \nU.S. 358, 361]\n\u00a0\n for that period. But it refused to pay the state tax and sued in the state court to enjoin its collection on the grounds, inter alia, that it is an instrumentality of the United States and that certain acts of Congress and statutes of Arkansas exempt it from such taxation. The Supreme Court of Arkansas affirmed a decree sustaining a demurrer to the bill and dismissing it, on the grounds that the Arkansas statute was applicable to petitioner and that, on construction of the acts in question, petitioner did not have the claimed immunity, 127 S.W.2d 802. We granted certiorari because that decision was asserted to be repugnant to the acts vesting exclusive jurisdiction over the Hot Springs Reservation in the United States. \n308 \nU.S. 508\n, 60 S.Ct. 97, 84 L.Ed. --.\n Petitioner's contention here, as below, is based primarily on the Act of Congress of March 3, 1891, 26 Stat. 842, whereby the consent of the United States was given for the taxation, under the authority of the laws of the State of Arkansas applicable to the equal taxation of personal property in that State, as personal property of all structures and other property in private ownership on the Hot Springs Reservation (National Park).' 16 U.S.C.A.  365. 3 Petitioner points \n\n[308 \nU.S. 358, 362]\n\u00a0\n out that the tax imposed by the Social Security Act against which appropriate credits may be made for contributions under state laws is laid, as stated by this Court in Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, \n301 \nU.S. 548, 578\n, 57 S.Ct. 883, 886, 887, 109 A.L.R. 1293, 'as a duty, an impost, or an excise upon the relation of employment'; and that as held by the Supreme Court of Arkansas the tax in question is 'not a tax on personal property; nor is it, in any sense, a property tax'. 127 S.W.2d 805. Therefore, petitioner concludes that the United States did not confer on the state of Arkansas the power to impose such a tax but retains its sovereign jurisdiction in that regard since the power of Arkansas to tax was limited to the enumerated property taxes.\n We agree with the Supreme Court of Arkansas that the state had jurisdiction to impose the tax in question.\n There can be no question but that petitioner is liable for the tax levied by  901 of the Social Security Act, unless it is exempted by that portion of  907 which relieves 'an instrumentality of the United States' from that duty. But it seems clear that petitioner is not, within the meaning of the Social Security Act, such an instrumentality. The mere fact that a private corporation conducts its business under a contract with the United States does not make it an instrumentality of the latter. Fidelity & Deposit Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n240 \nU.S. 319\n, 36 S.Ct. 298. Petitioner's lease from the Secretary of the Interior did not convert it into such an instrumentality. Petitioner 'is engaged in its own behalf, not the government's, in the conduct of a private business for profit'. See Federal Compress & Warehouse Co. v. McLean, \n291 \nU.S. 17, 23\n, 54 S.Ct. 267, 269. Though it acts with the Government's permission and has received a privilege from the Government, it does not exercise that privilege on behalf of the latter. See Broad River Power \n\n[308 \nU.S. 358, 363]\n\u00a0\n Co. v. Query, \n288 \nU.S. 178, 180\n, 53 S.Ct. 326, 327. The control reserved by the Government for protection of a governmental program and the public interest is not incompatible with the retention of the status of a private enterprise. See Federal Compress & Warehouse Co. v. McLean, supra. That control, being wholly supervisory, is not to be differentiated from the type of control which the United States may reserve over any independent contractor without transforming him into its instrumentality. See James v. Dravo Contracting Co., \n302 \nU.S. 134, 149\n, 58 S.Ct. 208, 216, 114 A.L.R. 318. In effect, petitioner concedes the point by admitting its liability under the Social Security Act.\n That petitioner is subject to the Social Security Act is extremely relevant to the solution of the problem at hand. For that Act laid the foundation for a cooperative endeavor between the states and the nation to meet a grave emergency problem. As pointed out by this Court in Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, supra, 301 U.S. page 588, 57 S.Ct. page 891, 109 A.L.R. 1293, that Act was an attempt to find a method by which the states and the federal government could 'work together to a common end'. Prior thereto many states had 'held back through alarm lest in laying such a toll upon their industries, they would place themselves in a position of economic disadvantage as compared with neighbors or competitors', Id., 301 U.S. page 588, 57 S.Ct. page 891, 109 A.L.R. 1293. The Act was designed therefore to operate in a dual fashion-state laws were to be integrated with the Federal Act; payments under state laws could be credited against liabilities under the other. That it was designed so as to bring the states into the cooperative venture is clear. The fact that it would operate though the states did not come in does not alter the fact that there were great practical inducements for the states to become components of a unitary plan for unemployment relief. It is this invitation by the Congress to the states which is of importance to the issue \n\n[308 \nU.S. 358, 364]\n\u00a0\n in this case. For certainly, under the coordinated scheme which the act visualizes, when Congress brought within its scope various classes of employers it in practical effect invited the states to tax the same classes. Hence, if there were any doubt as to the jurisdiction of the states to tax any of those classes it might well be removed by that invitation, for in absence of a declaration to the contrary, it would seem to be a fair presumption that the purpose of Congress was to have the state law as closely coterminous as possible with its own. To the extent that it was not, the hopes for a coordinated and integrated dual system would not materialize.\n Hence, it is our view that on the facts of this case, Congress has given Arkansas implied authority to tax petitioner under its Unemployment Compensation Law since the Congress has included under the Social Security Act employers such as petitioner. Clear evidence of a contrary intention would, of course, negative the existence of the implied authority. But here there is none. That conclusion is strengthened by the exemption of certain classes of employers from the sweep of the Federal Act. Thus, the exclusion of federal instrumentalities from the scope of the Federal Act, and hence from the complementary state systems, emphasizes the purpose to exclude from this statutory system only that well defined and well known class of employers who have long enjoyed immunity from state taxation. Had it been desired to exempt the equally well known class, of which petitioner is a member, so as to save it from reciprocal state systems, it would seem that an equally clear exception would have been made.\n Whether the same result would follow in case the cession act had absolutely forbidden a state to impose any tax on petitioner we need not decide. For here Arkansas did have a prior express power to tax petitioner's property. The implied authority which we here find to \n\n[308 \nU.S. 358, 365]\n\u00a0\n exist is therefore used not to override an earlier express authority but merely to extend it to a degree. For in final analysis the Arkansas tax does have some relation to the use of petitioner's property. The existence of the implied authority does not therefore do violence to the earlier statutory grant.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice REED concurs on the ground that the Act of Congress of March 3, 1891, 26 Stat. 842, in which the United States consented 'for the taxation ... as personal property of all structures and other property in private ownership on the Hot Springs Reservation (National Park),' 16 U. S.C.A.  365, should be interpreted to give consent to the application of the Arkansas Unemployment Compensation Law. Collins v.

Wood, of Washington, D.C., for petitioners.\n Mr. Frederick D. Hamrick, Jr., of Rutherfordton, N.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Supreme Court, North Carolina, ruled that negotiable notes and United States bonds purchased, and held as investments, for an incompetent World War veteran \n\n[306 \nU.S. 545, 546]\n\u00a0\n by his guardian out of 'payments of benefits' authorized under laws relating to such veterans, were subject to execution upon a judgment against the incompetent. Petitioners challenge that view and claim immunity under section 3, Act August 12, 1935 (c. 510, 49 Stat. 607, 609, 38 U.S.C.A.  454a):\n'Sec. 3. Payments of benefits due or to become due shall not be assignable, and such payments made to, or on account of, a beneficiary under any of the laws relating to veterans shall be exempt from taxation, shall be exempt from the claims of creditors, and shall not be liable to attachment, levy, or seizure by or under any legal or equitable process whatever, either before or after receipt by the beneficiary. Such provisions shall not attach to claims of the United States arising under such laws nor shall the exemption herein contained as to taxation extend to any property purchased in part or wholly out of such payments. Section 4747 of the Revised Statutes and section 22 of the World War Veterans' Act, 1924, are hereby repealed, and all other Acts inconsistent herewith are hereby modified accordingly. The provisions of this section shall not be construed to prohibit the assignment by any person, to whom converted insurance shall be payable under title III of the World War Veterans' Act, 1924, of his interest in such insurance to any other member of the permitted class of beneficiaries. ...\n\n'Sec. 5. That this Act shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage, but the provisions hereof shall apply to payments made heretofore under any of the Acts mentioned herein.'\n\n The conclusion below is supported by McCurry v. Peek, 1936, 54 Ga.App. 341, 187 S.E. 854, the only other opinion squarely upon the point here involved which has been called to our attention.\n The language of section three, although not entirely felicitous, conflicts with the petitioners' insistence. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 545, 547]\n\u00a0\n The first sentence grants exemption from taxation, claims of creditors, attachment, levy or seizure under any legal process whatever. The things exempted are 'payments of benefits' due or to become due either before or after receipt by the beneficiary.\n Investments purchased with money received in settlement of benefits are not such payments due or to become due. Accordingly, giving the words employed their ordinary meaning, the notes and bonds in question are not exempted by the first sentence in section three. It left them, like other property, subject to taxation, claims of creditors, and legal process.\n The second sentence in the section clearly recognizes the distinction between benefit payments and property purchased with money therefrom. It declares the exemption provisions in the first sentence shall not attach to claims of the United States; also that exemption from taxation shall not extend to property purchased out of benefit payments. Nothing is said concerning claims of creditors. Nevertheless, petitioners seem to maintain, immunity from these must be inferred. But a mere declaration that investments always subject to taxation shall not enjoy exemption therefrom affords no basis for holding them free from claims of creditors. Although the first sentence extended no immunity to investments, apparently out of abundant caution, the second declared them subject to taxation.\n We find nothing in the history or supposed purpose of the enactment adequate to support a construction not in accord with the ordinary import of the words employed.\n Under Spicer v. Smith, 1933, \n288 \nU.S. 430, 434\n, 53 S.Ct. 415, 416, 84 A.L.R. 1525, payment of benefits to the guardian vested title in the ward. The exemptions of the statute would not be different if the ward had personally received the payments.\n Section 4747 Revised Statutes, Act March 3, 1873 (38 U.S.C.A.  54) remained in force until repealed by Act August 12, 1935. It provided: \n\n[306 \nU.S. 545, 548]\n\u00a0\n 'No sum of money due, or to become due, to any pensioner shall be liable to attachment, levy, or seizure by or under any legal or equitable process whatever, whether the same remains with the Pension Office, or any officer or agent thereof, or is in course of transmission to the pensioner entitled thereto, but shall inure wholly to the benefit of such pensioner.'\n This section was considered in McIntosh v. Aubrey, 1902, \n185 \nU.S. 122, 124\n, 22 S.Ct. 561, 562, where it was unsuccessfully claimed that property purchased with pension money could not be seized under an execution. It was there said: 'The language of the section of itself seems to present no difficulty, and if doubt arises at all it is only on account of the decisions of courts whose opinions are always entitled to respect . ... But, notwithstanding, we think the purpose of Congress is clearly expressed. It is not that pension money shall be exempt from attachment in all of its situations and transmutations. It is only to be exempt in one situation, to wit, when 'due or to become due.' From that situation the pension money of plaintiff in error had departed.'\n Section 22 World War Veterans' Act, 1924, c. 320, 43 Stat. 607, 613, 38 U.S.C.A.  454, repealed by Act August 4, 1935, provided: 'That the compensation, insurance, and maintenance and support allowance payable under Titles II, III, and IV, respectively, shall not be assignable; shall not be subject to the claims of creditors of any person to whom an award is made under Titles II, III, or IV; and shall be exempt from all taxation: Provided, That such compensation, insurance, and maintenance and support allowance shall be subject to any claims which the United States may have, under Titles II, III, IV, and V, against the person on whose account the compensation, insurance, or maintenance and support allowance is payable . ...' \n\n[306 \nU.S. 545, 549]\n\u00a0\n Trotter v. Tennessee, 1933, \n290 \nU.S. 354, 356\n, 357 S., 54 S.Ct. 138, 139, construed this section. A veteran had purchased land in Tennessee with money received as compensation, and claimed exemption from taxation. We said: 'The moneys payable to this soldier were unquestionably exempt till they came into his hands or the hands of his guardian. McIntosh v. Aubrey, \n185 \nU.S. 122\n, 22 S.Ct. 561. We leave the question open whether the exemption remained in force while they continued in those hands or on deposit in a bank. ... Be that as it may, we think it very clear that there was an end to the exemption when they lost the quality of moneys and were converted into land and buildings. The statute speaks of 'compensation, insurance, and maintenance and support allowance payable' to the veteran, and declares that these shall be exempt. We see no token of a purpose to extend a like immunity to permanent investments or the fruits of business enterprises.'\n In 1935 Congress gave much consideration to the exemption which should be accorded to veterans. The outcome is shown by sections three and five Act August 12, 1935 ante.\n Section three of that Act came under review in Lawrence v. Shaw, 1937, \n300 \nU.S. 245, 249\n, 250 S., 57 S.Ct. 443, 445, 108 A.L.R. 1102. Exemption was successfully claimed for bank deposits standing in the name of a veteran's guardian upon the view that such deposits, made in the ordinary course and subject to demand for the veteran's use, should be treated as if money in his hands.\n'The World War Veterans' Act, 1924, provided that the compensation and insurance allowances should be 'exempt from all taxation.' The Act of 1935 is more specific, providing that the payments shall be exempt from taxation and shall not be liable to process 'either before or after receipt by the beneficiary.' There was added the qualification that the exemption should not extend 'to \n\n[306 \nU.S. 545, 550]\n\u00a0\n any property purchased in part or wholly out of such payments.' This more detailed provision was substituted for that of the earlier Act and was expressly made applicable to payments theretofore made. We think it clear that the provision of the later Act was intended to clarify the former rather than to change its import and it was with that purpose that it was made retroactive. ... The provision of the Act of 1935 that the exemption should not apply to property purchased out of the moneys received from the Government shows the intent to deny exemption to investments, as was ruled in the Trotter case.'\n\n The questioned judgment must be affirmed. \n\n\n\n","13":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCASE v.

Los Angeles Lumber Products Co. \n308 \nU.S. 106\n (1939) ]\n\n\n[308 \nU.S. 106, 108]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Robert M. Clarke, of Los Angeles, Cal., for petitioners.\n Mr. Robert H. Jackson, Sol. Gen., for the United States as amicus curiae, by special leave of Court.\n Messrs. J. Clifford Argue, J. C. Macfarland, David R. Faries, and Woodward M. Taylor, all of Los Angeles, Cal., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These cases1 present the question of the conditions under which stockholders may participate in a plan \n\n[308 \nU.S. 106, 109]\n\u00a0\n of reorganization under  77B, 48 Stat. 912, 11 U.S.C.A.  207, of the Bankruptcy Act where the debtor corporation is insolvent both in the equity and in the bankruptcy sense. Because of the contrariety of tendencies in practical administration of the Act among the circuits as illustrated by the differences between the holding below (9 Cir., 100 F.2d 963) and that in Re Barclay Park Corp., 2 Cir., 90 F.2d 595, we granted certiorari, \n307 \nU.S. 619\n, 59 S.Ct. 1030.\n The debtor is a holding company owning all of the outstanding shares of the capital stock (except for certain qualifying shares held by directors) of six subsidiaries. Three of these have no assets of value to the debtor. Two have assets of little value. The debtor's principal asset consists of the stock of Los Angeles Shipbuilding and Drydock Corporation which is engaged in shipbuilding and ship repair work in California. This subsidiary has fixed assets of $430,000 and current assets of approximately $400,000. This subsidiary has only current debts of a small amount, not affected by the plan. The debtor's assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries aggregate less than $10,000.\n The debtor's liabilities2 consist of principal and interest of $3,807, 071.88 on first lien mortgage bonds issued in 1924 and maturing in 1944, secured by a trust indenture covering the fixed assets of Los Angeles Shipbuilding and Drydock Corporation (one of the subsidiaries) and the capital stock of all of the subsidiaries. No interest has been paid on these bonds since February 1, 1929. In 1930, as a consequence of the financial embarrassment of the debtor, a so-called voluntary reorganization was effected. To that end, a supplement to this trust indenture was executed, pursuant to a provision therein, with the consent of about 97% of the face value of all \n\n[308 \nU.S. 106, 110]\n\u00a0\n the outstanding bonds, which reduced the interest from 7 1\/2% to 6% and made the interest payable only if earned. At the same time the old stock of the debtor was wiped out by assessment and new stock issued, divided into Class A and Class B, with equal voting rights. Class A stock was issued to some of the old stockholders who contributed $400,000 new money which was turned over to the Los Angeles Shipbuilding and Drydock Corporation and used by it as working capital. In consideration of this contribution the bondholders who agreed to the modification of the identure likewise released the stockholders' liability under California law in favor of these contributors. Some Class B stock was issued to bondholders in payment of unpaid interest coupons. \n3\n At present there are outstanding 57,788 shares of Class A stock and 5,112 shares of Class B stock.\n In 1937 the management prepared a plan of reorganization to which over 80% of the bondholders and over 90% of the stock assented. This plan of reorganization, as we shall discuss hereafter, provided for its consummation either on the basis of contract or in a  77B proceeding, such election to be made by the board of directors. In January 1938 the directors chose the latter course and the debtor corporation filed a petition for reorganization under  77B of the Bankruptcy Act, with the plan attached and reciting, inter alia, that the required percentage of security holders had consented to it. This plan as filed was later modified by the debtor, as we point out later, in a manner not deemed by us ma- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 106, 111]\n\u00a0\n terial to the issues here involved. That plan as modified provides for the formation of a new corporation, which will acquire the assets of Los Angeles Shipbuilding and Drydock Corporation,4 and which will have a capital structure of 1,000,000 shares of authorized $1 par value voting stock. This stock is divided into 811,375 shares of preferred and 188,625 shares of common. The preferred stock will be entitled to a 50% non- cumulative dividend, after which the common stock will be entitled to a similar dividend. Thereafter all shares of both classes will participate equally in dividends. The preferred stock will receive on liquidation a preference to the amount of its par value. Thereupon the common will receive a similar preference. Thereafter all shares of both classes participate equally.\n 170,000 shares of preferred are reserved for sale to raise money for rehabilitation of the yards. \n5\n 641,375 shares of the preferred are to be issued to the bondholders, 250 shares to be exchanged for each $1000 bond. The Class A stockholders will receive the 188,625 shares of common stock, without the payment of any subscription or assessment. No provision is made for the old Class B stock. The aggregate par value of the total preferred and common stock to be issued to existing security holders is $ 830,000-an amount which equals the going concern value of the assets of the enterprise.\n The plan was assented to by approximately 92.81% of the face amount of the bonds, 99.75% of the Class A \n\n[308 \nU.S. 106, 112]\n\u00a0\n stock, and 90% of the Class B stock. Petitioners own $18,500 face amount of the bonds. They did not consent to the so-called voluntary reorganization in 1930 whereby the trust indenture was amended. And throughout the present  77B proceedings they appropriately objected that the plan was not fair and equitable to bondholders.\n The District Court found that the debtor was insolvent both in the equity sense and in the bankruptcy sense. 24 F.Supp. 501. The latter finding was based upon 'appraisal and audit reports.' In this connection the court found that the total value of all assets of Los Angeles Shipbuilding and Drydock Corporation was $830,000, those assets constituting practically all of the assets of the debtor and of its various subsidiaries of any value to the estate. Yet in spite of this finding, the court, in the orders now under review, confirmed the plan. And the court approved it despite the fact that the old stockholders, who have no equity in the assets of the enterprise, are given 23% of the assets and voting power in the new company without making any fresh contribution by way of subscription or assessment. The court, however, justified inclusion of the stockholders in the plan (1) because it apparently felt that the relative priorities of the bondholders and stockholders were maintained by virtue of the preferences accorded the stock which the bondholders were to receive and the fact that the stock going to the bondholders carried 77% of the voting power of all the stock presently to be issued under the plan; and (2) because it was able to find that they had furnished the bondholders certain 'compensating advantages' or 'consideration'. This so-called consideration was stated by the District Court in substance as follows:\n\n 1. \nIt will be an asset of value to the new company to retain the old stockholders in the business because of 'their familiarity with the operation' of the business and their 'financial standing and influence in the com- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 106, 113]\n\u00a0\n munity'; and because they can provide a 'continuity of management.'\n\n 2. \nIf the bondholders were able to foreclose now and liquidate the debtor's assets, they would receive 'substantially less than the present appraised value' of the assets.\n\n 3. \nBy reason of the so-called voluntary reorganization in 1930, the bondholders cannot foreclose until 1944, the old stockholders having the right to manage and control the debtor until that time. At least the bondholders cannot now foreclose without 'long and protracted litigation' which would be 'expensive and of great injury' to the debtor. Hence, the virtual abrogation of the agreement deferring foreclosure until 1944 was 'the principal valuable consideration' passing to the bondholders from the old stockholders.\n\n 4. \nBonding companies are unwilling to assume the risk of becoming surety for the debtor or its principal subsidiary 'because of the outstanding bond issue'. The government's construction program will provide 'valuable opportunities' to the debtor if it is prepared to handle the business. Hence, the value to the bondholders of maintaining the debtor 'as a going concern, and of avoiding litigation, is in excess of the value of the stock being issued' to the old stockholders.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals in affirming the decree confirming the plan stated that it was not possible for it to do other than accept these findings because of a stipulation and the state of the record thereunder. That stipulation provided for an abbreviated record and stated that the dissenting bondholders intended 'to raise questions of substantive law only'. But it also specified as errors, inter alia, the inclusion of stockholders in a plan where they have no equity and the finding that the plan was 'fair' and 'equitable'. Thereby the stipulation adequately reserved the question of law as to whether \n\n[308 \nU.S. 106, 114]\n\u00a0\n on these facts the plan was fair and equitable within the meaning of  77B. But in any event a stipulation does not foreclose legal questions. Swift & Co. v. Hocking Valley Ry. Co., \n243 \nU.S. 281, 289\n, 37 S.Ct. 287, 289.\n On that question of law we think that the District Court erred in confirming the plan and that the Circuit Court of Appeals erred in affirming that decree. We think that as a matter of law the plan was not fair and equitable.\n At the outset it should be stated that where a plan is not fair and equitable as a matter of law it cannot be approved by the court even though the percentage of the various classes of security holders required by  77B, sub. f for confirmation of the plan has consented. It is clear from a reading of  77B, sub. f6 that the Congress has required both that the required percentages of each class of security holders approve the plan and that the plan be found to be 'fair and equitable'. The former is not a substitute for the latter. The court is not merely a ministerial register of the vote of the several classes of security holders. All those interested in the estate are entitled to the court's protection. Accordingly the fact that the vast majority of the security holders have approved the plan is not the test of whether the plan is a fair and equitable one. This is in line with the decision of this Court in Taylor v. Standard Gas & Electric Co., \n306 \nU.S. 307\n, 59 S.Ct. 543, which reversed an order approving a plan of reorganization under  77B, in spite of the fact that the requisite percentage of the various classes of \n\n[308 \nU.S. 106, 115]\n\u00a0\n security holders had approved it, on the ground that preferred stock of the debtor corporation was inequitably treated under the plan. The contrary conclusion in such cases would make the judicial determination on the issue of fairness a mere formality and would effectively destroy the function and the duty imposed by the Congress on the district courts under  77B. That function and duty are no less here than they are in equity receivership reorganizations, where this Court said, 'Every important determination by the court in receivership proceedings calls for an informed, independent judgment.' National Surety Co. v. Coriell, \n289 \nU.S. 426, 436\n, 53 S.Ct. 678, 682, 88 A.L.R. 1231.\n Hence, in this case the fact that 92.81% in amount of the bonds, 99. 75% of the Class A stock, and 90% of the Class B stock have approved the plan is as immaterial on the basic issue of its fairness as is the fact that petitioners own only $18,500 face amount of a large bond issue.\n The words 'fair and equitable' as used in  77B, sub. f are words of art which prior to the advent of  77B had acquired a fixed meaning through judicial interpretations in the field of equity receivership reorganizations. Hence, as in case of other terms or phrases used in that section, Duparquet Huot & Moneuse Co. v. Evans, \n297 \nU.S. 216\n, 56 S.Ct. 412, we adhere to the familiar rule that where words are employed in an act which had at the time a well known meaning in the law, they are used in that sense unless the context requires the contrary. Keck v. United States, \n172 \nU.S. 434, 446\n, 19 S.Ct. 254, 258.\n In equity reorganization law the term 'fair and equitable' included, inter alia, the rules of law enunciated by this Court in the familiar cases of Chicago, R.I. & P. Railroad Co. v. Howard, 7 Wall. 392; Louisville Trust Co. v. Louisville, New Albany & Chicago Ry. Co., \n174 \nU.S. 674\n, 19 S.Ct. 827; Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. Boyd, \n228 \nU.S. 482\n, 33 S.Ct. 554; Kansas City Terminal Ry. Co. v. Central Union Trust Co., \n271 \nU.S. 445\n, 46 S.Ct. 549. These cases dealt with the precedence to be accorded \n\n[308 \nU.S. 106, 116]\n\u00a0\n creditors over stockholders in reorganization plans. \n7\n In Louisville Trust Co. v. Louisville, New Albany & Chicago Ry. Co., supra, this Court reaffirmed the 'familiar rule' that 'the stockholder's interest in the property is subordinate to the rights of creditors. First, of secured, and then of unsecured, creditors.' And it went on to say that 'any arrangement of the parties by which the subordinate rights and interests of the stockholders are attempted to be secured at the expense of the prior rights of either class of creditors comes within judicial denunciation.' 174 U.S. page 684, 19 S.Ct. page 830. This doctrine is the 'fixed principle' according to which Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. Boyd, supra, decided that the character of reorganization plans was to be evaluated. And in the latter case this court added, 'If the value of the road justified the issuance of stock in exchange for old shares, the creditors were entitled to the benefit of that value, whether it was present or prospective, for dividends or only for purposes of control. In either event it was a right of property out of which the creditors were entitled to be paid before the stockholders could retain it for any purpose whatever.' 228 U.S. page 508, 33 S.Ct. page 561. On the reaffirmation of this 'fixed principle' of reorganization law in Kansas City Terminal Ry. Co. v. Central Union Trust Co., supra, it was said that 'to the extent of their debts creditors are entitled to priority over stockholders against all the property of an insolvent corporation.' 271 U.S. page 455, 46 S.Ct. page 551. \n\n[308 \nU.S. 106, 117]\n\u00a0\n In application of this rule of full or absolute priority this Court recognized certain practical considerations and made it clear that such rule did not 'require the impossible, and make it necessary to pay an unsecured creditor in cash as a condition of stockholders retaining an interest in the reorganized company. His interest can be preserved by the issuance, on equitable terms, of income bonds or preferred stock.' Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. Boyd, supra, 228 U.S. page 508, 33 S.Ct. page 561. And this practical aspect of the problem was further amplified in Kansas City Terminal Ry. Co. v. Central Union Trust Co., supra, by the statement that 'when necessary, they (creditors) may be protected through other arrangements, which distinctly recognize their equitable right to be preferred to stockholders against the full value of all property belonging to the debtor corporation, and afford each of them fair opportunity, measured by the existing circumstances, to avail himself of this right.' 271 U.S. pages 454, 455, 46 S.Ct. page 551. And it also recognized the necessity at times of permitting the inclusion of stockholders on payment of contributions, even though the debtor company was insolvent. As stated in Kansas City Terminal Ry. Co. v. Central Union Trust Co., supra, 271 U.S. page 455, 46 S.Ct. page 552: 'Generally, additional funds will be essential to the success of the undertaking, and it may be impossible to obtain them, unless stockholders are permitted to contribute and retain an interest sufficiently valuable to move them. In such or similar cases the chancellor may exercise an informed discretion concerning the practical adjustment of the several rights.' But even so, payment of cash by the stockholders for new stock did not itself save the plan from the rigors of the 'fixed principle' of the Boyd case, for in that case the decree was struck down where provision was not made for the unsecured creditor and even though the stockholders paid cash for their new stock. Sales pursuant to such plans were void, even though there was no fraud \n\n[308 \nU.S. 106, 118]\n\u00a0\n in the decree. Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. Boyd, supra, 228 U.S. page 504, 33 S.Ct. page 560. As this Court there stated, 228 U.S. page 502, 33 S.Ct. page 559, 'There is no difference in principle if the contract of reorganization, instead of being effectuated by private sale, is consummated by a master's deed under a consent decree.'\n Throughout the history of equity reorganizations this familiar rule was properly applied in passing on objections made by various classes of creditors that junior interests were improperly permitted to participate in a plan or were too liberally treated therein. In such adjudications the doctrine of Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. Boyd, supra, and related cases, was commonly included in the phrase 'fair and equitable' or its equivalent. As we have said, the phrase became a term of art used to indicate that a plan of reorganization fulfilled the necessary standards of fairness. Thus throughout the cases in this earlier chapter of reorganization law, we find the words 'equitable and fair',8 'fair and equitable',9 fairly and equitably treated',10 'adequate and equitable',11 'just, 'fair, and equitable' 12 and like phrases13 used to include the 'fixed principle' of the Boyd case, its antecedents and \n\n[308 \nU.S. 106, 119]\n\u00a0\n its successors. Hence we conclude, as have other courts,14 that that doctrine is firmly imbedded in  77B.\n We come then to the legal question of whether the plan here in issue is fair and equitable within the meaning of that phrase as used in  77B.\n We do not believe it is for the following reasons. Here the court made a finding that the debtor is insolvent not only in the equity sense but also in the bankruptcy sense. Admittedly there are assets not in excess of $900,000, while the claims of the bondholders for principal and interest are approximately $3,800,000. Hence even if all of the assets were turned over to the bondholders they would realize less than 25 per cent on their claims. Yet in spite of this fact they will be required under the plan to surrender to the stockholders 23 per cent of the value of the enterprise.\n True, the relative priorities of the bondholders and the old Class A stockholders are maintained by virtue of \n\n[308 \nU.S. 106, 120]\n\u00a0\n the priorities accorded the preferred stock which the bondholders are to receive. But this is not compliance with the principle expressed in Kansas City Terminal Ry. Co. v. Central Union Trust Co., supra, that 'to the extent of their debts creditors are entitled to priority over stockholders against all the property of an insolvent corporation', for there are not sufficient assets to pay the bondholders the amount of their claims. Nor does this plan recognize the 'equitable right' of the bondholders 'to be preferred to stockholders against the full value of all property belonging to the debtor corporation', within the meaning of the rule announced in that case, since the full value of that property is not first applied to claims of the bondholders before the stockholders are allowed to participate. Rather it is partially diverted for the benefit of the stockholders even though the bondholders would obtain less than 25% payment if they received it all. Under that theory all classes of \n\n[308 \nU.S. 106, 121]\n\u00a0\n security holders could be perpetuated in the new company even though the assets were insufficient to pay-in new bonds or stock-the amount owing senior creditors. Such a result is not tenable.\n It is, of course, clear that there are circumstances under which stockholders may participate in a plan of reorganization of an insolvent debtor. This Court, as we have seen, indicated as much in Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. Boyd, supra, and Kansas City Terminal Ry. Co. v. Central Union Trust Co., supra. Especially in the latter case did this Court stress the necessity, at times, of seeking new money 'essential to the success of the undertaking' from the old stockholders. \n15\n Where that necessity exists and the old stockholders make a fresh contribution and receive in return a participation reasonably equivalent to their contribution, no objection can be made. But if these conditions are not satisfied the stockholder's participation would run afoul of the ruling of this Court in Kansas City Terminal Ry. Co. v. Central Union Trust Co., supra, that 'Whenever assessments are demanded, they must be adjusted with the purpose of according to the creditor his full right of priority against the corporate assets, so far as possible in the existing \n\n[308 \nU.S. 106, 122]\n\u00a0\n circumstances.' 271 U.S. page 456, 46 S.Ct. page 552. If, however, those conditions we have mentioned are satisfied, the creditor cannot complain that he is not accorded 'his full right of priority against the corporate assets'. If that were not the test, then the creditor's rights could be easily diluted by inadequate contributions by stockholders. To the extent of the inadequacy of their contributions the stockholders would be in precisely the position which this Court said in Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. Boyd, supra, the stockholders there were in, viz., 'in the position of a mortgagor buying at his own sale.' 228 U.S. page 504, 33 S.Ct. page 560.\n In view of these considerations we believe that to accord 'the creditor his full right of priority against the corporate assets' where the debtor is insolvent, the stockholder's participation must be based on a contribution in money or in money's worth, reasonably equivalent in view of all the circumstances to the participation of the stockholder.\n The alleged consideration furnished by the stockholders in this case falls far short of meeting those requirements.\n\n 1. \nThe findings below that participation by the old Class A stockholders will be beneficial to the bondholders because those stockholders have 'financial standing and influence in the community' and can provide a 'continuity of management' constitute no legal justification for issuance of new stock to them. Such items are illustrative of a host of intangibles which, if recognized as adequate consideration for issuance of stock to valueless junior interests, would serve as easy evasions of the principle of full or absolute priority of Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. Boyd, supra, and related cases. Such items, on facts present here, are not adequate consideration for issuance of the stock in question. On the facts of this case they cannot possibly be translated into money's worth reasonably equivalent to the participation accorded the old stockholders. They have no place in the asset \n\n[308 \nU.S. 106, 123]\n\u00a0\n column of the balance sheet of the new company. They reflect merely vague hopes or possibilities. \n16\n As such, they cannot be the basis for issuance of stock to otherwise valueless interests. The rigorous standards of the absolute or full priority doctrine of the Boyd case will not permit valueless junior interests to perpetuate their position in an enterprise on such ephemeral grounds. \n17\n\u00a0\n\n\n 2. \nThe District Court's further finding that if the bondholders were to foreclose now they would receive 'substantially less than the present appraised value' of the assets of the debtor corporation is no support for inclusion of the old stockholders in the plan. The fact that bondholders might fare worse as a result of a foreclosure and liquidation than they would by taking a debtor's plan under  77B can have no relevant bearing on whether a proposed plan is 'fair and equitable' under that section. Submission to coercion is not the application of 'fair and equitable' standards. Such a proposition would not only drastically impair the standards of 'fair and equitable' as used in  77B; it would pervert \n\n[308 \nU.S. 106, 124]\n\u00a0\n the function of that Act. One of the purposes of  77B was to avoid the consequences to debtors and creditors of foreclosures, liquidations, and forced sales with their drastic deflationary effects. \n18\n To hold that in a  77B reorganization creditors of a hopelessly insolvent debtor may be forced to share the already insufficient assets with stockholders because apart from rehabilitation under that section they would suffer a worse fate, would disregard the standards of 'fair and equitable'; and would result in impairment of the Act to the extent that it restored some of the conditions which the Congress sought to ameliorate by that remedial legislation.\n\n 3. \nThe conclusion of the District Court that the virtual abrogation of the agreement deferring foreclosure until 1944 ('the principal valuable consideration' given to the bondholders by the stockholders) justified participation by the stockholders in the plan is likewise erroneous.\n What were the rights of the bondholders under the supplemental indenture executed in 1930 we cannot determine. That indenture is not in the abbreviated record before us. The District Court found that for all practical purposes the bondholders could not foreclose until 1944. From the findings below we conclude that that followed as a consequence of making interest payable only if earned. On this record it does not appear whether or not there might be other events of default-such as non-payment of sinking funds-giving bondholders or the trustee the right to foreclose or giving bondholders or the trustee the right to accelerate the maturity of the bonds so that suits could be brought thereon. Hence, we must assume, as the District Court found, that the bondholders and the trustee could not take possession \n\n[308 \nU.S. 106, 125]\n\u00a0\n of the property through foreclosure or otherwise until the maturity of the bonds. And as a corollary thereof we likewise assume that the stockholders, at least so far as the bondholders were involved, could keep their management group in possession and control until that time. And we assume that this right or power on the part of the stockholders to keep possession until 1944 was for them a thing of value, though there is no finding that the old stock had any value, present or prospective.\n But we cannot conclude that that right survived the commencement of the proceeding under  77B. A debtor as well as a creditor who invokes the aid of the federal courts in reorganization or rehabilitation under  77B assumes all of the consequences which flow from that jurisdiction. Once the property is in the hands of the court private rights as respect that res are subject to the superior dominion of the court and are to be adjudicated pursuant to the standards prescribed by the Congress. As a result of such proceedings the hand of all executions or levies may be stayed. \n19\n The court acquires 'exclusive jurisdiction of the debtor and its property wherever located for the purposes of this section.' \n20\n The court need not keep the debtor in possession but may substitute for the old management a trustee; or if the old management is retained it operates the business 'subject at all times to the control of the judge, and to such limitations, restrictions, terms, and conditions as the judge may from time to time impose and prescribe'.21 Thus, while the property remains in the hands of the court, as it does until dismissal or final decree on confirmation, the debter, though left in pos- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 106, 126]\n\u00a0\n session by the judge, does not operate it, as it did before the filing of the petition, unfettered and without restraint. The control of the court is then pervasive. \n22\n Furthermore stockholders and other junior interests may be excluded from any plan of reorganization if the court finds that the debtor is insolvent. In re 620 Church Street Building Corp., \n299 \nU.S. 24\n, 57 S.Ct. 88. And on facts such as exist here, these junior interests must be excluded unless they furnish adequate consideration for the interest which they obtain in the new company. And once the jurisdiction of the court has been invoked, whether by the debtor or by a creditor, that petitioner cannot withdraw and oust the court of jurisdiction. \n23\n He in- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 106, 127]\n\u00a0\n vokes that jurisdiction risking all of the disadvantages which may flow to him as a consequence, as well as gaining all of the benefits. One of those disadvantages from the viewpoint of the debtor and its stockholders is the approval of a plan of reorganization which eliminates them completely. \n24\n Accordingly, respondent's assertion in this case that the major contribution of these stockholders justifying their inclusion in the plan was the waiver of their right to defer or put off foreclosure until 1944, i.e., to remain in possession, does not stand analysis. The right to remain in unmolested dominion and control over the property was necessarily waived or abandoned on invoking the jurisdiction of the federal courts in these proceedings. When that jurisdiction attached, the court rather than the stockholders was in control with all of the powers and duties which that entailed under  77B. Certainly the surrender of a right thus waived is not adequate consideration for the dilution of the bondholders' priorities which this plan would effect.\n And there is a further reason why this result necessarily follows, if the will of the Congress as expressed in  77B is not to be thwarted and if the integrity of such proceedings is to be maintained. As we have said, this plan had its origin in an endeavor on the part of the debtor in 1937 to effect a voluntary reorganization. A plan was proposed by the debtor which was the same as that here involved except for the amount and nature of the stock to be received by the bondholders. \n25\n That plan \n\n[308 \nU.S. 106, 128]\n\u00a0\n contained two methods for its consummation. The first was by means of an amendment to the trust indenture and a recapitalization of the debtor, a method to be followed if the board felt that sufficient approvals had been obtained. The second was by means of  77B. Over 80% of the bondholders and over 90% of the stock approved the original plan. Thereupon the debtor filed its petition in  77B. Thereafter, the debtor filed a modification of the plan to which the assents, here relied upon, were obtained. 26 Thus respondent argues that since the plan of reorganization was entered into between the bondholders and the stockholders before institution of the reorganization proceedings under  77B, the consideration flowing from the stockholders had been furnished and the interests of the bondholders and stockholders in the assets of the debtor had been fixed prior to the filing of the petition. In fact, respondent frankly insists that the stockholders' 'right of aprticipation was secured by contract before, and as a condition precedent to, the institution of the 77B proceedings.'\n But the mere statement of this proposition is its own refutation. If the reorganization court were bound by such conventions of the parties, it would be effectively ousted of important duties which the Act places on it. Federal courts acting under  77B would be required to place their imprimatur on plans of reorganization which disposed of the assets of a company not in accord with the standards of 'fair and equitable' but in compliance with agreements which the required percentages of secu- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 106, 129]\n\u00a0\n rity holders had previously made. Such procedure would deprive scattered and unorganized security holders of the protection which the Congress had provided them under  77B. The scope of the duties and powers of the Court would be delimited by the bargain which reorganizers had been able to make with security holders before they asked the intercession of the court in effectuating their plan. Minorities would have their fate decided not by the court in application of the law of the land as prescribed in  77B, but by the forces utilized by reorganizers in prescribing the conditions precedent on which the benefits of the statute could be obtained. No conditions precedent to enjoyment of the benefits of  77B can be provided except by the Congress. To hold otherwise would be to allow reorganizers to rewrite it so as to best serve their own ends. \n27\n\u00a0\n\n\n 4. \nThe holding of the District Court that the value to the bondholders of maintaining the debtor as a going concern and of avoiding litigation with the old stockholders justifies the inclusion of the latter in the plan is likewise erroneous. The conclusion of the District Court that avoidance of litigation with the stockholders gave validity to their claim for recognition in the plan involves a misconception of the duties and responsibilities of the court in these proceedings. Whatever might be the stragetic or nuisance value of such parties outside of  77B is irrelevant to the duties of the court in confirming or disapproving a plan under that section. In these proceedings there is no occasion for the court to yield to such pressures. If the priorities of creditors which the law \n\n[308 \nU.S. 106, 130]\n\u00a0\n protects are not to be diluted, it is the clear duty of the court to resist all such assertions. Of course, this is not to intimate that compromise of claims is not allowable under  77B. There frequently will be situations involving conflicting claims to specific assets which may, in the discretion of the court, be more wisely settled by compromise rather than by litigation. Thus, ambiguities in the wording of two indentures may make plausible the claim of one class of creditors to an exclusive or prior right to certain assets as against the other class in spite of the fact that the latter's claim flows from a first mortgage. \n28\n Close questions of interpretations of after-acquired property clauses in mortgages, preferences in stock certificates, divisional mortgages and the like will give rise to honest doubts as to which security holders have first claim to certain assets. Settlement of such conflicting claims to the res in the possession of the court is a normal part of the process of reorganization. In sanctioning such settlements the court is not bowing to nuisance claims; it is administering the proceedings in an economical and practical manner. But that is not the situation here. As a result of the filing of the petition in this case, the court, not the stockholders, acquired exclusive dominion and control over the estate. Hence, any strategic position occupied by the stockholders prior to these proceedings vanished once the court invoked its jurisdiction. Threats by stockholders of the kind here in question are merely threats to the jurisdiction of the \n\n[308 \nU.S. 106, 131]\n\u00a0\n court, which jurisdiction these selfsame stockholders invoked for their benefit when they caused the debtor's petition to be filed. Consequently, these claims of the stockholders are, as we have said, entitled to no more dignity than any claim based upon sheer nuisance value.\n In this connection it should be observed that the finding of the court that it was important to admit the stockholders to participation in the plan so as to maintain the debtor as a going concern and thus protect the bondholders was based upon a misconception of its legal powers and duties. For the court assumed that the only alternative to acceptance of this debtor's plan was a dismissal of the proceeding or a liquidation. But this is not true. In the first place, no special perquisites (of consequence here) flow to stockholders by virtue of the fact that the proceedings are instituted by a voluntary rather than an involuntary petition. The criteria for exclusion or inclusion of stockholders in a plan are precisely the same in both situations. In practice it is not infrequent to find proceedings which start with a debtor's petition ending up with plans of reorganization which exclude stockholders. Reading Hotel Corp. v. Protective Committee etc., 3 Cir., 89 F.2d 53. In the second place, failure to accept this plan does not force dismissal or liquidation. Section 77B, sub. c(8) gives the court explicit powers where 'a plan of reorganization is not proposed or accepted within such reasonable period as the judge may fix' either to 'extend such period' or to 'dismiss the proceeding' or, with exceptions not relevant here, to cause liquidation, such choice to be made 'as the interests of the creditors and stockholders may equitably require'. Accordingly, dismissal has not infrequently been properly denied. In re Bush Terminal Co., 2 Cir., 84 F.2d 984. And in this case there has been no showing that a plan which is not only fair and equitable but also meets the other \n\n[308 \nU.S. 106, 132]\n\u00a0\n requirements of the Act cannot be adopted nor that all reasonable time for proposal of such alternative plans has expired.\n We therefore hold that the plan is not fair and equitable and that the judgment below must be and is\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice BUTLER took no part in the consideration or disposition of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] One involves an interlocutory order and the other a final order confirming a plan of reorganization under  77B of the Bankruptcy Act. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Other liabilities, not material here, are $6,075.94 of current accounts payable and $496,899.76 due the Los Angeles Shipbuilding and Drydock Corporation. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] A large block of Class B stock was escrowed under a management contract with one Armes to be delivered to him when all the bonds were retired and the Class A stockholders were paid back their $400,000 plus interest in the form of dividends. But this management contract was later terminated and the escrowed Class B stock was returned to the debtor and cancelled. Class A stock was preferred to Class B in the event of liquidation to the amount of $400,000 and interest. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The assets of the debtor, except the capital stock of two subsidiaries which have assets of some, though slight, value will also be transferred to the new company. The assets of these two subsidiaries will be liquidated and the proceeds distributed pro rata among bondholders. The assets of the other three subsidiaries will also apparently be acquired by the new company. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] No underwriting of these funds is provided and no disclosure is made as to how the additional funds are to be raised. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] It provides in part: 'After hearing such objections as may be made to the plan, the judge shall confirm the plan if satisfied that (1) it is fair and equitable and does not discriminate unfairly in favor of any class of creditors or stockholders, and is feasible; (2) it complies with the provisions of subdivision (b) of this section; (3) it has been accepted as required by the provisions of subdivision (e), clause (1) of this section; ....' \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] For analyses and reviews of these cases as applied to equity reorganizations or reorganizations under  77B and  77 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A.  207, 205, see Frank, Some Realistic Reflections on Some Aspects of Corporate Reorganization, 19 Va.L.Rev. 541; Swaine, Reorganization of Corporations: Certain Developments of the Last Decade, 27 Col.L.Rev. 901; Spaeth and Winks, The Boyd Case and Section 77, 32 Ill.

Hotel Co., 7 Cir., 93 F.2d 841, are not tenable.\n The statutory scheme of  77B (in those respects which are material here) is in sharp contrast to that which was provided for compositions under former  12, 11 U.S.C.A.  30. This court said in Callaghan v. Reconstruction Finance Corp., \n297 \nU.S. 464, 470\n, 56 S.Ct. 519, 522: 'Reorganizations now permitted under section 77B present certain resemblances to compositions under section 12 which have been commented upon as supporting the constitutionality of the reorganization provisions of section 77 or section 77B. ... But section 77B contemplates a procedure and results not permissible under section 12. Reorganizations are nowhere referred to in the statute as compositions.' Under  12, sub. a, 11 U.S.C.A.  30, sub. a, (as it existed at the time  77B was enacted) only a 'bankrupt' could offer 'terms of composition to his creditors'. Under  77B, sub. d plans may be proposed not only by the debtor but also by a designated percentage of the creditors or, where the debtor is not found to be insolvent, by a specified percentage of stockholders. Section 12, sub. d as it then existed provided that the judge 'shall confirm a composition if satisfied' inter alia that 'it is for the best interests of the creditors'. See Fleischmann & Devine, Inc., v. Saul Wolfson Dry Goods Co., Inc., 5 Cir., 299 F. 15. The 'fair and equitable' standard employed in  77B was not then present in  12. Consent by the debtor to the composition was implicit in former  12. Cf. In re Bryer, 2 Cir., 281 F. 812. But under  77B approval of a plan by security holders who have no equity in the enterprise is unnecessary. \n In re 620 Church Street Building Corp., \n299 \nU.S. 24\n, 57 S.Ct. 88. The general view was well expressed in Re Dutch Woodcraft Shops, D.C., 14 F.Supp. 467, 469, 'The preservation of business enterprises must not be at the expense of creditors, and the provisions of section 77B should not be taken advantage of to effect what, in fact, amounts to a composition under section 12.'\n The Chandler Act, c. 10, 52 Stat. 840, 883,  101 et seq., 11 U.S.C.A .  501 et seq., approved June 22, 1938, now supplants  77B. Various substantial changes in the provisions of  77B have been made therein. But the standard of 'fair and equitable' as used in  77B remains unaltered as one of the criteria necessary for confirmation of a plan of reorganization .  221(2). \n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] This new money was commonly necessary in equity reorganizations not only to provide new working capital but also to pay dissenting creditors. See Weiner, Conflicting Functions of the Upset Price in a Corporate Reorganization, 27 Col.L.Rev. 132.\n Like considerations are relevant in reorganizations under  77B. As stated by the court in Re Dutch Woodcraft Shops, D.C., 14 F.Supp. 467, 471:\n'Circumstnaces may exist where the success of an undertaking requires that new money be furnished and where the former stockholders are the only or most feasible source of the new capital. In such instances, the court may recognize as fair and equitable a plan which includes contributions of new money by stockholders, provided it satisfactorily appears that full recognition has been given to the value of creditors' claims against the property.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] On comparable facts a like conclusion was reached in Re Barclay Park Corp., 2 Cir., 90 F.2d 595, where the court said, page 598:\n'It is argued that the stockholders represent the present management of the hotel and that the management is valuable and indeed necessary to the enterprise and that the manager-stockholders will 'walk out' if the proposed plan does not go through and leave the hotel to its fate. But there is no binding agreement on their part to remain which might afford a justification for giving them a stock interest and, if their managerial skill is vital to the success of the hotel, any stock issued to insure the continuance of their relation ought to go to those stockholders who are of use to the enterprise and agree to act in its behalf, and not to all stockholders as such. Indeed, the supposed advantages of retaining the existing management seem to be a matter of inference, if not of speculation, supported by the oral statements of attorneys instead of by testimony.' \n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] This conclusion is reemphasized here by the fact that not all of the Class A stockholders who receive new stock are part of the management of the debtor. \n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] See H.R. Rep. No. 1409, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 38, dealing with recent amendments to the section; and H.R. Rep. No. 194, 73rd Cong., 1st Sess., p. 2, the report accompanying the original Act. \n\n[\nFootnote 19\n] Section 77B, subs. a, c(10). Cf. Continental Illinois National Bank & Trust Co. v. Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Ry. Co., \n294 \nU.S. 648\n, 55 S.Ct. 595. \n[\nFootnote 20\n] Section 77B, sub. a. \n[\nFootnote 21\n] Section 77B, sub. c. \n\n[\nFootnote 22\n] See, 1 Gerdes on Corporate Reorganizations, c. 9. These powers embrace not only the specifically enumerated powers contained in  77B but also 'all the powers, not inconsistent with this section, which a Federal court would have had it appointed a receiver in equity of the property of the debtor by reason of its inability to pay its debts as they mature.'  77B, sub. a. In addition, by virtue of  77A 11 U.S.C.A.  206, the district court, as a court of bankruptcy, has original jurisdiction in proceedings under  77B. Illustrative of specific powers granted by  77B are the powers of the court to authorize issuance of certificates ( 77B, sub. c(3), to require the filing of schedules and reports ( 77B, sub. c(4 ), to direct rejection of executory contracts ( 77B, sub. c(5), to control salaries of officers and to approve appointments 'to any office ( 77B, sub. c(11). The last subsection also provides, 'In case a trustee is not appointed, the debtor shall continue in the possession of its property, and, if authorized by the judge, shall operate the business thereof during such period, fixed or indefinite, as the judge may from time to time prescribe, and shall have all the title to and shall exercise, consistently with the provisions of this section, all the powers of a trustee appointed pursuant to this section, subject at all times to the control of the judge, and to such limitations, restrictions, terms, and conditions as the judge may from time to time impose and prescribe.' In the instant case the court left the debtor in possession, allowing its officers no salaries but allowing specified salaries to be paid to designated officers of the principal subsidiary. \n[\nFootnote 23\n] The Act has explicit standards for dismissal ( 77B, sub. c(8) which we discuss hereafter. \n\n[\nFootnote 24\n] As recognized in In re 620 Church Street Building Corp., supra,  77B, sub. e(1) expressly takes care of this contingency in the provision that acceptance of the plan by a majority of the stock 'shall not be requisite to the confirmation of the plan by any stockholder or class of stockholders (1) if the judge shall have determined' inter that 'the debtor is insolvent.' \n[\nFootnote 25\n] Under that plan the new company was to have an authorized capital of $1,000,000 consisting of 1,000,000 shares of a par value of $1.00 per share, the bondholders getting 590,065 of the shares and the old Class A stockholders getting 239,935 of the shares. Shares going to the bondholders were of the same class as those received by stockholders. \n\n[\nFootnote 26\n] These assents were apparently measured by the failure of the bondholders to withdraw their consents which had been given to the original plan, on receiving copies of the proposed modification. \n\n[\nFootnote 27\n] Cf. Hollister v. Stewart, 111 N.Y. 644, 19 N.E. 782, where the court struck down a voluntary reorganization which attempted to bind minority bondholders. The court said 'Unless railroad syndicates or committees are to be put above the constitution, the trustees cannot set aside and change their contract with plaintiff of their own volition without his consent.' 111 N.Y. page 660, 19 N.E. page 789. \n\n[\nFootnote 28\n] That would appear to be essentially the type of case involved in In the Matter of Detroit International Bridge Co., Debtor, No. 24131, U.S. D.C.E.D.Mich., 30 F.Supp, 127, cited to us by the respondent and described in an advisory report (Corporate Reorganization Release No. 9) submitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to  172, c.

Oldham Clarke and Lafon Allen, both of Louisville, Ky., for respondents.\n\n\n\n[307 \nU.S. 474, 476]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In January, 1937, the legislature of Kentucky adopted a resolution purporting to ratify the constitutional amendment proposed by the Congress in 1924 and known as the 'Child Labor Amendment'.1\n Respondents, citizens, taxpayers and voters in Kentucky brought this suit in the state court to restrain the Governor of the Commonwealth and the officers of the General Assembly from sending certified copies of the resolution to the Secretary of State of the United States and the presiding officers of the Senate and House of Representatives, and for a judgment declaring the action of the General Assembly to be illegal and void. The complaint stated that in 1926 the proposed amendment had been rejected by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth and also by more than a majority of the legislatures of the States, and that the General Assembly could not thereafter legally reconsider and adopt the amendment; and, further, that its action was not taken within a reasonable time after the amendment was proposed.\n Upon the filing of the petition, a restraining order was granted and summons was issued. On the same day, but before the Governor was actually served with a copy of the restraining order or summons, he forwarded by mail a certified copy of the resolution to the Secretary of State. It is not claimed that the Governor then knew of the pendency of the proceeding.\n Plaintiffs then filed an amended petition setting forth the action taken by the Governor and sought a mandatory \n\n[307 \nU.S. 474, 477]\n\u00a0\n injunction to require him to notify the Secretary of State of the pendency of the suit and that the notice which he had sent was void and should be disregarded. That action was not taken. Defendants filed a general demurrer which was sustained in the Circuit Court but its judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeals. 270 Ky. 1, 108 S.W.2d 1024\n\n\n The court gave opportunity on the remand to the Circuit Court, with directions to overrule the demurrer, for such further proceedings as were not inconsistent with its views. Upon that remand the defendants declined to plead further and judgment was entered in accordance with the opinion of the Court of Appeals. The judgment so entered set forth (1) that an actual controversy existed between the parties, that the plaintiffs had the right to maintain the suit and the court had jurisdiction; (2) that the resolution of the legislature purporting to ratify the proposed amendment was void, not having been ratified according to the provisions of the Constitution of the United States; (3) that the notice given by the Governor to the Secretary of State was of no effect; (4) that the clerk of the court should give official notice to the Department of State that the resolution purporting to ratify the amendment was invalid, that it had not been ratified according to the provisions of the Constitution of the United States, and that the notice given by the Governor was of no effect.

We granted certiorari. \n303 \nU.S. 634\n, 58 S.Ct. 831.\n We think that, while the state court had jurisdiction in limine, the writ of certiorari should be dismissed upon the ground that after the Governor of Kentucky had forwarded the certification of the ratification of the amendment to the Secretary of State of the United States there \n\n[307 \nU.S. 474, 478]\n\u00a0\n was no longer a controversy susceptible of judicial determination.\n Dismissed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice BUTLER think that the judgment of the Court of Appeals of Kentucky should be affirmed on the authority of Dillon v.

LOS ANGELES COUNTY FLOOD CONTROL DIST.(1939)\nNo. 368\nArgued: Decided: March 27, 1939\n\n\n\n\n[306 \nU.S. 459, 460]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Bourke Jones and Frederick von Schrader, both of Los Angeles, Cal., for appellant.\n Mr. W. B. McKesson, of Los Angeles, Cal., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellant maintains that a California statute authorizing an administrative board to levy special assessments on his land within a flood control district created by the legislature to pay cost of local improvements and facilities and of their operation, maintenance, and betterment, without providing him an opportunity to be heard on the question of benefits, is repugnant to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S.C.A.Const.\n Chapter 755, p. 1502, Statutes 1915, creates the Los Angeles flood control district. Section 2 declares that the purposes of the act are to provide for the control of the flood and storm waters of the district, to conserve them for beneficial uses, and to protect the property within the district from damage by flood or storm waters. Section 16 empowers the board of supervisors of the district to construct all improvements and to acquire all property that is necessary or useful for carrying out the purposes of the act. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 459, 461]\n\u00a0\n Chapter 642, p. 1763, Statutes 1937, added  13 1\/2 to the flood control act. It provides: The board of supervisors of the district may accept on its behalf, a transfer and conveyance of 'all, but not less than all,' storm drain improvements, drainage improvements or drainage systems of defined classes lying within the district. Upon conveyance to the district of any such drainage works it shall become liable for principal and interest of bonds thereafter maturing which were issued by any drainage district to pay the cost of constructing the transferred property. For that purpose the board shall levy a special tax each year upon the taxable real estate in the district.\n A map, that with appellant's consent is included in appellees' brief, shows that the flood control district is within and nearly as large as Los Angeles county which contains almost 4,000 square miles and that within it there are eleven drainage districts, two of which were organized under Chapter 258, p. 354, Statutes 1903, and amendatory acts, and nine of which were organized under Chapter 354, p. 731, Statutes 1919, and amendatory acts. \n*\n\u00a0\n\n Appellant and the city of Los Angeles presented to the highest court of the State their petition for a peremptory writ of mandate. In substance it alleges: Petitioners own taxable real property within the flood control district and outside the drainage districts. December 1, 1937, the board of supervisors of the district accepted a transfer to the district of the improvements and systems of the eleven drainage districts. The board intends to levy annual special assessments against all real estate in that \n\n[306 \nU.S. 459, 462]\n\u00a0\n district sufficient to meet the outstanding obligations incurred on account of the works so transferred. The levy of these assessments will be illegal in that they will be levied against property situated in the flood control district to pay the debts and obligations of other special assessment districts without regard to the accrual of benefits to the lands assessed and will deprive petitioners of their property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The petition prays a peremptory writ of mandate to require appellees to levy assessments in accordance with Chapter 755, p. 1502, Statutes 1915, as it was prior to the addition of  13 1\/2 and to command them to refrain from levying any assessment under that section.\n Appellees demurred on the ground that the petition failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The state court sustained that contention and denied the writ. It ruled: A finding by the legislature that lands within the flood control district would be benefited by that district's acquisition of the works of the drainage districts is conclusive unless shown to be without reasonable foundation. It must be presumed that, by designating in  13 1\/2 the improvements authorized to be transferred, the legislature found that the entire flood control district would be specially benefited by the acquisition. The particularity of the description implies such a finding. The finding thus implied is as fully effective as if declared in express terms in the act itself.\n Petitioners appealed to this court; appellees moved, as to the city, to dismiss or affirm on the ground that no federal question was involved; and, as to both appellants, on the grounds that no substantial federal question was presented, and that the decision below rests upon adequate non-federal grounds. We dismissed the city's appeal for want of a substantial federal question and postponed to the hearing on the merits further consideration \n\n[306 \nU.S. 459, 463]\n\u00a0\n of the question of jurisdiction and of the motion to dismiss or affirm. City of Los Angeles v. Los Angeles County Flood Control Dist., \n305 \nU.S. 564\n, 59 S.Ct. 104, 83 L.Ed. --.\n That motion is denied. The validity of the statute under the federal constitution was by the petition appropriately drawn in question and in substance the decision of the state supreme court is in favor of its validity. See People of State of New York ex rel. Bryant v. Zimmerman, \n278 \nU.S. 63\n, 67-69, 49 S.Ct. 61, 63, 62 A.L.R. 785. Its judgment does not depend upon characterization of the statute or mere interpretation of the language employed. Its decision is to the effect that the legislature found that the real property within the flood control district would be specially benefited by the acquisition of the district drainage works and that therefore the appellant and other owners are not entitled to be heard on the question of benefits. Appellant contends there is no foundation for the ruling that the legislature made that determination and that, as put in operation and effect by the State,  13 1\/2 deprives him of his constitutional right to be heard. See St. Louis S. W. Ry. Co. v. Arkansas, \n235 \nU.S. 350, 362\n, 35 S.Ct. 99, 102; Mountain Timber Co. v.

Tax Comm., \n302 \nU.S. 186, 206\n, 207 S., 58 S.Ct. 233, 243. We are unable to say that the question is foreclosed by our decisions or that it is so clearly not debatable as to require dismissal for lack of substance. Hamilton v.

Nor do we find any merit in the contention that the judgment rests upon an independent non-federal ground.\n But we are of opinion that the judgment is right and must be affirmed.\n In the absence of flagrant abuse or purely arbitrary action, the State, consistently with the federal constitution, may establish local districts to include real property that it finds will be specially benefited by drainage, flood \n\n[306 \nU.S. 459, 464]\n\u00a0\n control, or other improvements therein, and, to acquire, construct, maintain and operate the same, may impose special tax burdens upon the lands benefited.

But where the district was not directly created by the legislature and there has been no determination by it that their property will be benefited by the local improvements the owners are entitled, under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, to be heard by some officer or tribunal empowered by the State to hear them and to consider and decide whether their lands will be specially benefited.

Hooper, \n269 \nU.S. 396, 405\n, 406 S., 46 S.Ct. 141, 143\n The legislature need not adopt any form of statement or finding for, in the enforcement of restraints imposed by the federal constitution upon the power of States to assess and collect taxes, this Court regards the substance of their enactments as controlling rather than mere forms of expression employed. Londoner v. Denver, \n210 \nU.S. 373, 385\n, 28 S.Ct. 708, 713. Appellant does not suggest that as a matter of fact his land is not by the drainage works specially bene- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 459, 465]\n\u00a0\n fited or that a finding that it is so benefited would be without foundation or arbitrary. Indeed, he concedes that, if the legislature either by designating the territory to comprise the district or by expressly so declaring has made the finding, he is bound by it.\n As shown by the opinion below, the state court long before the addition of  13 1\/2, held that the mere passage of the flood control act, which did not contain a direct statement to that effect, 'must be taken to import a finding by the Legislature that the proposed work will answer a public purpose, and that its execution will benefit the land within the district to such an extent as to warrant the imposition upon such land of the cost in the manner provided. The findings thus implied are as fully effective as if declared in express terms in the act itself.' Los Angeles County Flood Control District v. Hamilton, 177 Cal. 119, 124, 125, 169 P. 1028, 1030 The court deemed that language applicable in disposing of appellant's contentions in this case. And we think that as the legislature had knowledge of that decision when enacting the challenged provision, it must be given great weight in determining the validity of  13 1\/2.\n The flood control district had long been in existence and empowered to acquire property necessary for its purposes. Section 13 1\/2 limited the board's authority to acceptance of 'all, but not less than all' the drainage works and defined the tax burden to be imposed. The legislation is not to be distinguished from a measure to take effect upon an event unrelated to the creation of the district or the imposition of special assessments.\n No question is raised as to the validity of the flood control district or its authority to levy special assessments on lands within it. By the enactment of the challenged section, the legislature unquestionably intended that the use of the drainage works should not be limited to the purposes for which originally they were intended but \n\n[306 \nU.S. 459, 466]\n\u00a0\n that they should also be used in connection with other facilities for the purposes of the flood control district. The challenged section was not enacted to create a new assessment district but specially to authorize the one already established to accept, maintain, and use the designated improvements for some of the purposes enumerated in the flood control act. The essential features of the challenged statute necessarily imply special benefits to the lands in question. We think the state court's ruling that impliedly the legislature made the requisite findings is not without adequate foundation. Mere lack of formal or express statement of them is not sufficient to require reversal.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] The two districts organized under the act of 1903 and amendatory acts are No. 1, containing 2093 acres, and No. 3, containing 835 acres.

UNITED STATES(1939)\nNo. 244\nArgued: Decided: January 3, 1939\n\n\n\n Mr. Webster Ballinger, of Washington, D.C., for appellants.\n Mr. Raymond T. Nagle, of Washington, D.C., for the United States. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 479, 480]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Chippewa Indians filed suit in the Court of Claims asserting two separate claims against the government. The government pleaded offsets greatly in excess of the claims of the Tribe. Dismissing the Tribe's petition as to both its claims,1 the Court found it unnecessary to pass upon the government's offsets, and therefore denied them without prejudice. The cause is here on appeal by virtue of a Special Act of Congress requiring our view of the judgment of the Court of Claims. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n As to the first claim. A Congressional Act of May 23, 1908, created a National Forest upon lands then in possession of the United States but held by the government as a trustee for the benefit of the Chippewa Indian Tribe. \n3\n This Act authorized the Secretary of the Interior to 'proceed with the sale of the merchantable pine timber' upon certain of these lands; and provided for an appraisal 'forthwith' of the timber on the lands; for payment to the Indians of the appraised value plus payments received from the sale of any timber by the Secretary of the Interior prior to the appraisal; and for payment to the Tribe of $1.25 per acre for all of the lands appropriated. Appraisal was not made 'forthwith', but in 1922. In 1908, when the Act was passed, certain types of the timber were not 'merchantable' and had no value. By 1923, however, when the appraisal was completed and approved, these particular timbers were appraised at $1,060, 887.07. In view of the long delay in making the appraisal and payment, approximately $490,000 in interest was appropriated for the benefit of the Tribe in 1926. The Court of Claims construed the 1908 Act as an appropriation of the lands and timber for a public use at the date of \n\n[305 \nU.S. 479, 481]\n\u00a0\n enactment, and finding the timbers in question without a merchantable value at that time, decided against the Tribe on this claim.\n The sole question raised by appellants' assignment of error with reference to this first claim attacks the Court of Claims' holding-based on its construction of the Act of 1908-that the appropriation of the Tribe's land and timber was effected by that Act and as of the date of the Act, and that court's failure to hold that the appropriation occurred when the timber was appraised and the appraisal approved in April, 1923\n\n\n The findings do not show as clearly as might be desired that the timber was without merchantable value in 1908. However, there is a complete absence of any controversy on this point, and appellants were not denied the right to introduce evidence to establish the value of the property. When these findings are considered with the pleadings and are clarified by the opinion of the court below, all possible doubt as to their meaning disappears, and they show that the Court found a lack of any merchantable value in 1908.4\n Actual appropriation of the land or timber by the United States is admitted. Just compensation for the property appropriated must be its value as of the date when the Tribe's interest in the property was taken. \n5\n It is agreed that until the passage of the Act of 1908 the government held possession of the land and timber as trustee for the Tribe. Under that trust the government was charged with disposal of the property for the benefit of the Tribe. If the Act of 1908 actually deprived the Tribe of its beneficial interest in the property, the Act \n\n[305 \nU.S. 479, 482]\n\u00a0\n represented an exercise of the power of eminent domain and vested-when enacted-complete title in the government. This would be an appropriation-a complete taking of property-at the time the Act became effective. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n We need look no further than the language of this Act to ascertain its effect. The very first words after the enacting clause are '... there is hereby created in the State of Minnesota a national forest consisting of lands and territories described as follows, ....' 35 Stat. 268,  1. There follows a description of the lands in question by metes and bounds. Throughout the Act there are repeated declarations referring to the National Forest 'hereby created.' It would have been difficult for Congress to have selected language more clearly expressing the intent and purpose to deprive the Tribe completely-by the Act-of all its remaining beneficial interest in the property.\n Appellants urge that appropriation of the property did not take place until the appraisal of the timber was approved in 1923. In support of this contention they rely chiefly upon the following provisions of Section 5 of the Act, 35 Stat. 272: '... all moneys received from the sale of timber from any of the land set aside by this Act for a National Forest, prior to the appraisal herein provided for ... shall be placed to the credit of the Chippewa Indians in the State of Minnesota ... and after said appraisal the National Forest hereby created, as above described, shall be subject to all general laws and regulations ... governing national forests, ....' But this provisions by its very terms characterizes the property as 'the National Forest hereby created' and directs disposition of 'all moneys received from the sale of timber from any of the land set aside by this Act for a National Forest, ....' (Italics supplied) The fact that the lands were not to \n\n[305 \nU.S. 479, 483]\n\u00a0\n be subjected to the general laws and regulations governing National Forests until after the appraisal was made indicates no congressional intent to delay the creation of the National Park. The government already had legal title to, and possession of the property, and the Act contemplated that the appraisal should be made 'forthwith.' Since the Tribe was to be paid the appraised value of all the timber, the Act appropriately provided that proceeds for sales of any timber sold before appraisal should be paid to the Tribe.\n Upon examination of the Act we are of the opinion that the Court of Claims correctly decided that the appropriation of the land and timber occurred in 1908, when the Act became the law, and that accordingly it properly dismissed the claim.\n Second. The jurisdictional Act under which the petition in this cause was filed7 conferred jurisdiction upon the Court of Claims 'to hear, examine, and adjudicate and render judgment in any and all legal and equitable claims arising under or growing out of the Act of January 14, 1889 ..., or arising under or growing out of any subsequent Act of Congress in relation to Indian Affairs which said Chippewa Indians of Minnesota may have against the United States, ....' Appellants' second claim was based upon allegations that the government made erroneous surveys of Indian lands between and including the years 1872 and 1885; that these errors resulted in wrongfully excluding the lands from Indian reservations; and that the government thereafter appropriated and sold these lands (some of which belonged to appellants) before the Act of 1889 was passed. Inspection of the 1889 Act8 discloses that none of its provisions related to these lands \n\n[305 \nU.S. 479, 484]\n\u00a0\n previously disposed of by the government. Its terms were restricted to the Chippewa reservations then existing (1889) in Minnesota. None of the subsequent Acts, relating to Indian affairs, upon which appellants rely9 expanded the provisions of the 1889 Act so as to include Congressional treatment of the transactions made the basis of this second claim. Since this second claim did not arise from or grow out of the 1889 Act or subsequent Acts, the Court of Claims properly dismissed for want of jurisdiction.\n The judgment is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 87 Ct.Cl. 1. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 49 Stat. 1826, Act of June 22, 1936, c. 714. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] 35 Stat. 268. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Cf.

UNITED STATES(1939)\nNo. 666\nArgued: March 30, 1939Decided: April 17, 1939\n\n\n\n Messrs. Donald S. Holmes, of Duluth, Minn., and Webster Ballinger, of Washington, D.C., for appellants.\n Mr. Raymond T. Nagle, of Washington, D.C., for appellee. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 1, 2]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Claims1 dismissing a suit brought to compel restoration of trust funds alleged to have been diverted by the appellee.\n In 1926 Congress granted permission for the bringing of the suit,2 which was instituted April 13, 1927. In order to permit the claim to be presented in its present form the permissive act was amended in 1934.3 The appellants then filed an amended petition to which the appellee responded by a general traverse. The right of appeal from the judgment of the Court of Claims is conferred by Joint Resolution of June 22, 1936.4\n The suit is for the enforcement of equitable claims arising under or growing out of the Act of January 14, 1889.5 The appellants' theory is that the Act constituted an offer on the part of Congress for an agreement with the bands of Chippewas located in Minnesota, whereby, if these bands would cede the Indian title to their reservations (which they did), the United States would sell the timber thereon and open the agricultural lands to settlement, and hold the proceeds of the timber and the lands, in trust, to expend the income for purposes specified in the statute, including payment of a portion of such income to the Indians, and to distribute the principal at the expiration of fifty years after allotments had been completed to all the members of the various bands on specified reservations. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 1, 3]\n\u00a0\n The circumstances leading to the adoption of the Act and its relevant sections appear in earlier decisions of this Court and need not here be repeated. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n The appellants assert that, by the Act of 1889, Congress abdicated its plenary power of administration of the Chippewas' property as tribal property, recognized that the reservations of the respective bands were not tribal property, and agreed to hold the proceeds of the ceded lands in strict and conventional trust for classes of individual Indians in accordance with the program outlined in the Act.\n In this view the living Chippewas are beneficiaries of the income of the fund during the fifty year period, and individual Chippewa Indians who may be living at the expiration of the period, as a class, are remaindermen. It is urged that, as Congress has, from time to time, reimbursed the Treasury for expenditures for the benefit of the Chippewa Indians of Minnesota out of the fund, and has authorized other direct expenditures from the fund for the benefit of the Indians in ways not authorized by the Act, the United States has been guilty of a diversion of trust funds and that the appellants, as the representatives of the remaindermen, are entitled, on plain principles of equity, to demand restoration of the diverted sums to the corpus.\n If, as the Court of Claims has found, the Act of 1889, and the cessions made pursuant to it, did not create a technical trust, we are relieved from considering many of the contentions pressed by the appellants in that court and re. We are of opinion that the Court of Claims was right in its decision that no such trust was created.\n The original tribal status of the Chippewas is described in Wilbur v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 206, 208\n, 50 S.Ct. 320, 321, \n\n[307 \nU.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n and Chippewa Indians v. United States, \n301 \nU.S. 358, 360\n, 57 S.Ct. 826, 827. It is unnecessary now to restate what was there said on the subject.\n It is true that, prior to the adoption of the Act of 1889, the tribe had been broken up into numerous bands, some of which held Indian title to tracts in the State of Minnesota. The Act refers to these collectively as 'The Chippewas in the State of Minnesota.' Whether or not the tribal relation had been dissolved prior to its adoption, the Act contemplates future dealings with the Indians upon a tribal basis. It exhibits a purpose gradually to emancipate the Indians and to bring about a status comparable to that of citizens of the United States. But it is plain that, in the interim, Congress did not intend to surrender its guardianship over the Indians or treat them otherwise than as tribal Indians.\n This is evidenced by a series of acts, the first of which was adopted nineteen months after the Act of 1889, which are inconsistent with the view that the Congress considered the Indians as emancipated or intended to enter into a binding contract with them as individuals. \n7\n Many of these statutes refer to the Chippewas of Minnesota as a tribe. \n8\n Moreover, an examination of the Act \n\n[307 \nU.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n of 1889 discloses that it is not cast in the form of an agreement; and, we may not assume that Congress abandoned its guardianship of the tribe or the bands and entered into a formal trust agreement with the Indians, in the absence of a clear expression of that intent.\n It is not contended that the expenditures made from the fund, or reimbursed from it, were not for the benefit of the Indians or were not such as properly might be made for their education and civilization, the purposes stated in the Act of 1889\n\n\n We hold that the Act did not tie the hands of Congress so that it could not depart from the plan envisaged therein, in the use of the tribal property for the benefit of its Indian wards.\n The judgment of the Court of Claims is affirmed.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 87 Ct.Cl. 1. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Act of May 14, 1926, c. 300, 44 Stat. 555, as amended by Acts of April 11, 1928, c. 357, 45 Stat. 423, and June 18, 1934, c. 568, 48 Stat. 979. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Act of June 18, 1934, c. 568, 48 Stat. 979. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] c. 714, 49 Stat. 1826. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] 25 Stat. 642. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Wilbur v.

Trammell, both of Fort Worth, Tex ., for petitioner.\n Mr. Angus G. Wynne, of Longview, Tex., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This cause is here in order that we may decide whether the Circuit Court of Appeals wrongly declined to follow the rule of the Texas courts prescribing how and by whom the facts should be shown where one party to a contest concerning ownership of land claims the legal title as bona fide purchaser. We have considered that point only and conclude the ruling below was error. In consequence the challenged judgment must be reversed. The cause will be remanded for final determination upon the entire record consistent with this opinion.\n Prior to 1899 Louisa Rogers owned a rectangular tract of land-320 acres-in Gregg County, Texas. In February of that year her heirs-J. F. Rogers and his three brothers-divided this by deeds, duly executed and recorded. One of these conveyed to J. F. Rogers sixty-eight acres out of the northwest portion of the tract, described by metes and bounds. The north line was said to begin at a specified point and to run thence west 440 yards to 'Wiley Davis N. E. corner.' There the boundary turns south and runs for eight hundred and eighty yards, thence east, &c. Measured on the ground, 440 yards ends sixty-six feet east of Davis' corner. This discrepancy gave occasion for the present controversy over the sixty-six foot strip lying between a south-line from Davis' corner and a parallel one sixty-six feet to the east. The interest asserted by respondents rests upon the theory that by intention this was left undivided. \n\n[308 \nU.S. 208, 210]\n\u00a0\n In 1930 J. F. Rogers' heirs granted an oil and gas lease to all land described in the 1899 deed to him. By assignments and succession, petitioner Oil Company became owner of this. The conveyances were duly recorded.\n In 1934 respondent Dunlap obtained from the three brothers of J. F. Rogers and his heirs, a lease of the major part of the sixty-six foot strip above described. Title to this is the subject of the present controversy.\n Claiming that the land described in the Dunlap lease of 1934 was within the boundaries of its earlier one (1930), petitioner filed an original bill in the United States District Court to remove the cloud. Dunlap and the Rogers appeared and denied the material allegations. A cross-bill set up their recorded deed and alleged that the call in the 1899 deed to J. F. Rogers for 'Davis' northeast corner' was inserted through inadvertence and mistake; that the distance call controlled; that the purpose of the parties was to establish the western terminus of the north line sixty-six feet east of Davis' corner and leave a strip on the west in common ownership.\n Petitioner denied the allegations of the cross-bill and asserted that it and its predecessors were purchasers of the recorded legal title for value in good faith and without notice of mistake.\n The District Court ruled in favor of Dunlap. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 5 Cir., 100 F.2d 294; 101 F.2d 314, 315.\n In the latter court petitioner maintained that under the established Texas rule, on an issue of bona fide purchaser for value without notice, the burden of proof is upon him who attacks the legal title and asserts a superior equity. It cited White v. Hix, Tex.Civ.App., 104 S.W.2d 136, 139, 140,1 and insisted that Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, \n304 \nU.S. 64\n, 58 S. Ct. 817, 114 A.L.R. 1487, required observance of the local rule. \n\n[308 \nU.S. 208, 211]\n\u00a0\n The court recognized the existence of the Texas rule as claimed but thought a different and better one was generally approved and should be followed. It said-\n'In the present case the appellant is the original complainant, seeking a decree quieting its title. It has entered a court of equity, asking equity and bound to do equity. The defendants in their answer set up a mistake, correctable in equity, in the partition deed made to complainant's grantor, J. F. Rogers. Complainant replies, denying the alleged mistake and alleging additionally in very general terms that it and its predecessors in title purchased in good faith, paying value for the oil and gas lease it holds in reliance on the deed as written, and without notice or knowledge of the claim now asserted that the call for the Wiley Davis northeast corner was inserted by mistake. There was no further pleading. ...\n\n'Issue stands joined on the new facts alleged by this complainant's reply concerning its purchase for value without knowledge or notice. It seems to us that the burden of proving these facts ought reasonably to rest on the complainant, both because it has alleged them and they are essential to its success, and because they are peculiarly within its knowledge. ... What the complainant itself paid, and with what knowledge, it of course knows and could easily prove. There is a failure of evidence, not only as to bona fides and want of notice, \n\n[308 \nU.S. 208, 212]\n\u00a0\n but as to what was paid and to whom, and when and how; the details of which the maker of this plea has from the earliest times been held bound to allege and, when put in issue, to prove.\n\n'This seems to us a matter of practice or procedure and not a matter of substantive law. There is no question as to what are the rights of a bona fide purchaser, or as to whether the facts established make complainant out such, but only a question of how and by whom the facts shall be shown to the court. Such matters are not within the decision in Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, and the cases following it. ...\n\n'We have here not a case where a Texas statute has created the right asserted, or has created a presumption, or is in any manner to be applied as construed in Texas. The question is simply what is the proper practice in courts of equity. The practice followed in the State courts of Texas, where equity courts as such do not exist, is not controlling.'\n\n We cannot accept the view that the question presented was only one of practice in courts of equity. Rather we think it relates to a substantial right upon which the holder of recorded legal title to Texas land may confidently rely. Petitioner was entitled to the protection afforded by the local rule. In the absence of evidence showing it was not a bona fide purchaser its position was superior to a claimant asserting an equitable interest only. This was a valuable assurance in favor of its title.\n Central Vermont Ry. Co. v. White, \n238 \nU.S. 507, 512\n, 35 S.Ct. 865, 867, Ann.Cas.1916B, 252, considered an analogous situation and pointed out the principle presently applicable. Proof that petitioner did not purchase for value and in good faith was 'part of the very substance' of respondents' cause.\n Sundry arguments advanced here to support respondents' demand for affirmance, notwithstanding the er- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 208, 213]\n\u00a0\n roneous pronouncement below, will be matter for consideration when the cause comes again before the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'It is thoroughly settled that one who claims a superior equitable title to land as against one who has purchased from the holder of the legal title must show that such purchaser did not purchase for value or purchased with notice of the outstanding equity.

ARKANSAS, LOUISIANA GAS CO.(1939)\nNo. 294\nArgued: Decided: February 6, 1939\n\n\n\n As Amended March 27, 1939.[ City of Texarkana, Tex. v. Arkansas, Louisiana Gas Co. \n306 \nU.S. 188\n (1939) ]\n\n\n[306 \nU.S. 188, 190]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Benjamin E. Carter, of Texarkana, Ark., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Wm. C. Fitzhugh and Henry C. Walker, Jr., both of Shreveport, La., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n A writ of certiorari brings to this Court for review a judgment1 of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit denying the validity or applicability of the following section in a franchise granted to respondent by petitioner in 1930. Section IX of that franchise reads as follows:\n'If Grantee shall be finally compelled to, or should voluntarily, place (sic) in any rates in the City of Texarkana, Arkansas, less than the rates granted by this Ordinance then and thereupon the lessened rate shall apply in the City of Texarkana, Texas, and Grantee shall not be authorized or permitted to charge and collect any higher rate.'\n\n Texarkana, Texas, and Texarkana, Arkansas, are adjacent cities divided by the Arkansas-Texas state line. Respondent serves as a public utility for the distribution of gas in \n\n[306 \nU.S. 188, 191]\n\u00a0\n both cities. Because of the section just quoted, the Texas city undertook judicial action to secure gas for itself and its citizens at rates lower than those stated in other sections of the franchise. We granted certiorari2 on account of asserted conflict with the decisions of the state courts on an important question of local law.\n The charter of the Texas city gives authority to grant franchises for the use of its public ways upon terms to be embodied in ordinances, which must expressly provide that the city shall retain the regulation of the business of the utility, the fixing of its rates and the right to inspect its operations. Should these reservations be omitted, they are nevertheless to be considered part and parcel of the franchise. \n3\n The charter also provides that the city should have the power to regulate rates charged by gas com- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 188, 192]\n\u00a0\n panies. \n4\n The gas company and its predecessors had long held a franchise for furnishing gas to the Texas city. The earliest ordinances of the city were amended in 1923, by which amendment certain rates for gas were fixed. Article E in that ordinance provided that the gas company should 'not at any time charge for furnishing gas' to the Texas city 'a greater sum ... than it at the same time charges and collects' from the Arkansas city. On June 17, 1930, the gas company accepted a compromise agreement, in ordinance form, which increased the rates to gas consumers from those set out in the 1923 franchise. This is the ordinance containing the Section IX heretofore quoted and it is the ordinance regulating rates now in effect in the Texas city.\n On May 30, 1930, the gas company secured a similar arrangement adjusting rates from the Arkansas city. There had previously been in effect a franchise of 1923 with rates substantially identical with the Texas 1923 rates. The Arkansas franchise of 1930 was subjected to a referendum and to prolonged litigation. Eventually, on December 1, 1933, a final order set aside the 1930 ordinance of the Arkansas city and established the rates of the 1923 ordinance as effective for the consumers of the Arkansas city from 1930 to the date of the decree. This \n\n[306 \nU.S. 188, 193]\n\u00a0\n decree also required refunds to the Arkansas consumers for overpayment during that period. \n5\n By further litigation, a resolution of the council of the Arkansas city of December 22, 1933, promulgating rates for the future was upheld. \n6\n These last rates were the 1923 rates, modified in minor particulars. In the order of December 4, 1936, confirming the rates established by its resolution, the gas company was directed to refund to the consumers any overpayment by reason of the collection of higher rates during this last judicial proceeding. It thus appears that the legal rates to the consumers of the Arkansas city at all times have been substantially those of the 1923 ordinance.\n In Texarkana, Texas, the consumers have paid since 1930 the rates fixed in that ordinance, which are substantially higher than those finally determined as applicable to the Arkansas consumers. The gas company in October, 1933, sought from the Texas city council rates still higher than those granted by the 1930 ordinance. The company gave notice that on November 23, 1933, a new and higher schedule of rates than those provided in the 1930 agreement would be established in the Texas city. The Texas city sought and obtained in the state court an injunction against this increase. This is still effective. This suit was removed to the Federal district court for Texas. The bill was amended on January 15, 1934, to set up an additional cause of action against the gas company by reason of the entry of the decree on December 1, 1933, in the Arkansas litigation. As this decree was a final order determining that the Arkansas consum- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 188, 194]\n\u00a0\n ers should pay only the 1923 rates, the Texas city conceived its citizens should have the benefit of the same lower rates by virtue of Section IX. It was further sought by this amendment to recover for the affected time a refund for the Texas consumers equal to the difference between the Arkansas rates, as determined by the decree of December 1, 1933, and the Texas 1930 rates. Later, on December 30, 1936, a supplemental bill was filed to set out the further claim of the Texas city consumers, for the period between that covered by the first amendment and the filing of the supplemental bill, together with a prayer that the gas company be compelled to pay into the registry of the court the excess amount which it was alleged it had and was continuously collecting from the Texas consumers. Immediate distribution was asked for the funds applicable to those periods concerning which no further Arkansas litigation was pending.\n The situation from the standpoint of the Texas city might be summarized by saying that it seeks for its consumers the lower 1923 Arkansas rates instead of the Texas 1930 rates, from the effective date of the Arkansas resolution of May 30, 1930, to February 16, 1934. This refund is claimed because the Arkansas consumers obtained these lower rates by the Arkansas decree of December 1, 1933, and the voluntary act of the gas company in collecting the lower rates from the date of the decree to February 16, 1934. On final affirmance of the Arkansas litigation, it seeks refunds for its consumers from February 16, 1934, to December 4, 1936, of the difference between the Texas 1930 rates and the Arkansas December 22, 1933, rates. This refund is claimed because of the decree of December 4, 1936,7 validating for the Arkansas consumers the rates of the 1933 resolution. These rates were sub- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 188, 195]\n\u00a0\n stantially the same as those fixed in the 1923 ordinance. As an injunction, pending appeal, was refused, these lower rates have been in effect in Arkansas since the date of the decree. As pointed out above, the decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals and certiorari refused here. It is further sought to have put into effect in Texas the rates collected in Arkansas after December 4, 1936. The right to the lower rates and to the refund depends upon the interpretation of Section IX.\n Another bill was filed by the Texas city in May, 1934, seeking substantially the same relief as that sought in the proceeding heretofore detailed. The reasons for the filing of this second suit and its purpose are not material to the present proceeding. The two actions were consolidated. Later motions, pleadings and the decree in the two cases are the same.\n The gas company filed answers to the bills set out above and a counterclaim seeking higher rates. Section IX was challenged as invalid because of conflict with the provisions of the city charter, the laws and constitution of Texas. It was asserted that the section was not a binding contract on either party to the franchise and further asserted that if Section IX was valid, it was inapplicable to any of the three periods for which the Texas city sought relief and refund. The district court granted the city's motion to strike the answers and counterclaim and, the gas company declining to amend, decreed that Section IX was a binding contract between the parties; that it was inapplicable to the period prior to December 1, 1933; that refund should be made from December 1, 1933, to February 16, 1934; and that the suit was premature as to the period after February 16, 1934, because an appeal was pending in the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit at the time the second amendment was filed by the Texas city on December 30, 1936. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded with directions to dismiss \n\n[306 \nU.S. 188, 196]\n\u00a0\n the bill. \n8\n It thought that Section IX was an invalid abdication or delegation of the Texas city's rate-making power since the section purported to bind both parties to lower rates which might be fixed by the gas company and the Arkansas city. The lower court stated also, without discussion, that the clause was inapplicable even if valid. The petition for certiorari relies upon the alleged error of the lower court in deciding that the section was invalid and inapplicable.\n Abdication or delegation of regulatory power. By the act to incorporate the city of Texarkana, Texas, the legislature granted a special charter which contained delegations of power to the municipality to contract for utilities and to regulate gas rates, and prohibitions against the granting of a franchise without specific reservation of this power of future regulation. \n9\n The respondent takes the position that since Section IX not only requires the application of lower Arkansas rates to Texas consumers but provides that the gas company 'shall not be authorized or permitted to charge and collect any higher rate,' the Texas city has abdicated power to raise the Texas rates above the Arkansas rates. As the Texas city is forbidden to give up the power to regulate rates, the section, says the company, is invalid.\n The city agrees that any delegation or abdication of complete power to regulate rates would be unlawful and any provision of a franchise leading to that result invalid under the decisions of Texas. \n10\n It is the petitioner's po- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 188, 197]\n\u00a0\n sition, however, that a proper interpretation of the section leaves with the city the unimpaired power to regulate the gas rates, within the limits of the applicable constitutional provisions. We agree with this analysis of the section. The words just quoted prohibiting the charge or collection of higher rates more reasonably imply a limitation on the right of the gas company to look to other provisions of the franchise for authority to exact other rates. But if this view is not accepted, it is quite clear that the charter provision 163a retaining the right to regulate must be read into the franchise. This would result in leaving in the council of the Texas city the power to raise or lower the gas rates.\n Nor, in this view, can it be said there is delegation as distinct from abdication of the power to regulate. It is true, extra-state action determines that the rate shall lessen but the council has power over the rates at all times. The Arkansas rate is a mere measuring rod, as though the rate fluctuated with temperature or consumption. Even if Section VIII- A11 is valid, in the face of sections 163, 163a and 196 of the charter, it is inapplicable, by its terms, to the power of the city to increase rates.\n The obligation of the utility under Section IX. As the lower court determined Section IX is wholly invalid as a delegation and abdication by the city of its rate making powers, there was no occasion for it to consider whether the \n\n[306 \nU.S. 188, 198]\n\u00a0\n section was binding upon the utility alone. With the conclusion that the city is free to raise or lower the rate, in the public interest, we must inquire whether the gas company is bound to furnish Texas consumers their gas at the lessened Arkansas rates. The determination follows the state law. \n12\n This court looks to the trial court for the original examination of local questions13 and relies for aid upon the explanation of its conclusion. While no opinion was written in the trial court, its decree found Section IX a 'binding contract' and awarded recovery for a portion of the time involved. Assuming the district court agreed with this Court that the city could not and did not delegate or abdicate its rate making function, this necessarily required a holding that the company alone was bound by this section of the contract. An appeal, with specific assignment of this ruling as error, brought the case to the Circuit Court of Appeals and the point is argued here by respondent as justification for the judgment reversing the District Court. 14 Under these circumstances, we feel constrained to pass upon the question. \n 15\n\u00a0\n\n It cannot be said that any opinion of the Supreme Court of Texas settles the problem of whether a utility is bound to a contract for a schedule of rates when the municipality is not. That court, in 1925, in Dallas Railway Co. v. Geller, did state that an ordinance on rates is a contract. \n16\n There had been a franchise with a fixed \n\n[306 \nU.S. 188, 199]\n\u00a0\n maximum rate. The municipality granted an increase. A citizen objected on the ground that the franchise, as a contract, bound the municipality and the utility to the agreed rate. The Court of Civil Appeals17 held the rate section of the franchise was not a 'fixed contract' but a rate schedule, subject to the city's power of regulation by reason of Section 17 of Article 1 of the Texas Constitution, Vernon's Ann.St., forbidding uncontrollable grants of special privileges. On review, the Supreme Court stated that a question had been raised by city attorneys, appearing as amici curiae, as to the meaning of the language of the lower court which was construed by some to hold that 'a municipality cannot make contracts that are binding upon public service corporations.' \n18\n While the court could have avoided comment on the point upon the theory that whether or not there was a contract, the city's regulatory power was unaffected, it chose to interpret the franchise in the light of the contract in these words: 'The right or power to further control or regulate the grant in regard to the rate schedule is a reservation to the municipality, and not an inhibition to contract; and, where a franchise is accepted by a grantee, this reservation ... becomes a part of the contract.' Later the Supreme Court, in discussing the power of the legislature to authorize specifically binding rate contracts for definite periods, citing the Uvalde Case, said, 'It is well established in this state that the Legislature may, by express words, authorize municipal corporations to enter into contracts' for rates for limited periods. \n19\n We reason from these opinions that in Texas a \n\n[306 \nU.S. 188, 200]\n\u00a0\n utility franchise is a contract, with an express or implied provision that the rate schedules are subject to regulation by the city. In such a contract an agreement by the utility to lower rates under specified conditions is binding, although the rule as to the reserved power of regulation prevents the city from agreeing not to raise or lower rates. Grant of the franchise is consideration for the undertaking of the utility to maintain the prescribed rates until they are altered by the exercise of the reserved power of the municipality to regulate the rates.\n The case of the City of Uvalde v. Uvalde Electric & Ice Co., 1923,20 is suggested as an authority against interpreting a rate contract, invalid as to the city, as binding upon the utility. Uvalde, without power to contract for rates, did so contract. The utility raised the rates without permission. The court was of the view that 'the power to regulate rates and the power to stipulate by contract for a term of 10 years for rates cannot coexist.' Looking at the contract in this way and without discussion of the effect of the attempted agreement on the utility, an injunction against the new rates was refused. That case appears rather a precedent for the rule that where a city is not authorized to contract as to rates but only to regulate them, any effort to contract is nugatory. As indicated above, it has been cited by the Supreme Court of Texas as authority for the right of a municipality to contract when so empowered.\n This Court has had other occasions to consider the rights of Texas utilities under the provisions of the Texas statutes and constitution. In San Antonio Traction Co. v. Altgelt21 we assumed a rate contract between the city and the street railway, and ruled that it was subject to \n\n[306 \nU.S. 188, 201]\n\u00a0\n Section 17 of the Texas bill of rights,22 which declared that all privileges granted by the legislature remained under its control. Consequently, an enactment changing the rate agreement was valid. Later, 1920, in City of San Antonio v. San Antonio Pub. Serv. Co.23 in passing upon a rate increase by a utility in the face of a franchise limitation we ruled that Section 17 of the constitution, with its provision against irrevocable special privileges, made impossible a contract in Texas on rates because of the conflict between the right to contract and the superior and inconsistent power to regulate. To the argument that the company might be bound, though the city was not, the court replied: If the city is not bound 'it would follow that that power (uncontrolled regulatory) would be required to be exerted and hence the supposed condition operating upon the private owner would be nugatory.' \n24\n\u00a0\n\n These conclusions of this Court are inapplicable here for two reasons: first, the subsequent opinion of the Supreme Court of Texas in the Geller Case indicates that regulatory and contract power may be exercised concurrently in that state; second, the charter of Texarkana, Texas, gives it specific power to enter into franchise agreements with rate regulation reserved to the city. 25 The \n\n[306 \nU.S. 188, 202]\n\u00a0\n utility was chargeable with notice in 1930 of the rule in Texas, restated in the Texarkana charter, that rate regulatory power remains in the municipality and the charter provision to that effect was reserved in the franchise by force of law. It contracted, nevertheless, to furnish the Texas city gas at the same rates as Arkansas consumers enjoy. There appears no reason why such an agreement should not be enforceable and, in our view of the Texas law, it is.\n Applicability. The trial court determined that Section IX was not to be applied to the period prior to December 1, 1933; that it should be applied to the period December 1, 1933, to February 16, 1934, and that the effort to recover refunds for the period after February 16, 1934, was premature. The Circuit Court of Appeals thought the section, if valid, generally inapplicable. We are of the opinion that the language of the section was intended to and does make applicable to each Texas consumer the same rates that Arkansas consumers are charged for similar uses and quantity, when the Arkansas rates are lower than the rates granted Texas consumers by the ordinance of the City of Texarkana, Texas, of June 13, 1930. This flows from the words in Section IX 'place in any rates' less than the Texas ordinance rates.\n The lower rates for Texas are to be effective only when the utility is 'finally compelled to, or should voluntarily, place in' effect the lower rates for Arkansas. When a rate is voluntarily placed in effect in Arkansas, the Texas consumers are immediately entitled to the same rate. We construe 'finally compelled' as meaning the entry by a court of the final order which makes effective a challenged rate order. No right to demand the lower rate and no cause of action to enforce the right arises until that time. When such order is entered, however, the Texas consumers are entitled to have the lowered rate applied to their consumption for the same period of time \n\n[306 \nU.S. 188, 203]\n\u00a0\n it is enjoyed by the Arkansas consumers. The purpose of the clause was to give Texas consumers the advantage of lower Arkansas rates for similar periods of time. Litigation, regardless of its merit, may not stay the beginning of the lower Texas rate. On our view, so much of the relief sought as was based upon the challenged rate order of December 22, 1933, was premature. \n26\n As there was an appeal from the decree of December 4, 1936, it was ineffective to create a cause of action when the supplemental petition of December 30, 1936, was filed.\n Leave to file a supplemental petition to bring to date the controversy over the refund of rates, collected subsequent to February 16, 1934, should be granted, upon the return of the case to the District Court, on motion of the City of Texarkana, Texas. The present action is an appropriate proceeding for the settlement of the entire rate controversy and the refund of such sums as may be determined, ultimately, to be due the Texas consumers. \n27\n Where there is a good cause of action stated in the original bill, a supplemental bill setting up facts subsequently occurring which justify other or further relief is proper. If the original decree in the trial court had not been entered, this supplemental petition would simplify the controversy. \n28\n We think this procedure is equally applicable after remand for further proceedings. \n29\n\u00a0\n\n[306 \nU.S. 188, 204]\n\u00a0\n Other suggestions to support the respondent's position that Section IX is invalid are made. It is said that it is vague, indefinite and obscure. These have been answered by what we have written. The issue of confiscation tendered by the answer of the utility to the petition to enforce the obligations of Section IX need not be considered in this proceeding. If the utility has entered into a binding contract as to rates, their confiscatory character is not a defense to the claim of the city to service at the contract rates. \n30\n\u00a0\n\n It is further ordered that the decree of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, filed herein on July 31, 1937, be reversed in so far as it held that Section IX of the franchise was not applicable to the period prior to December 1, 1933\n\n\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice BUTLER are of opinion that the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals is right and that its judgment should be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Arkansas Louisiana Gas Co. v.

PAUL GRAY, INC.(1939)\nNo. 534\nArgued: March 27, 1939Decided: April 17, 1939\n\n\n\n Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of California.\n\n\n[306 \nU.S. 583, 585]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Amos M. Mathews, of Chicago, Ill., and Frank W. Richards, of Los Angeles, Cal., for appellants.\n Mr. Everett W. Mattoon, of Los Angeles, Cal., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The principal questions for decision are whether the California Caravan Act of 1937, exacting fees aggregating \n\n[306 \nU.S. 583, 586]\n\u00a0\n $15 for each automobile driven into the state for sale, imposes a forbidden burden on interstate commerce or infringes the due process or equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S.C.A.Const.\n This is an appeal under  238(3), 266 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C .  345(3), 380, 28 U.S.C.A.  345(3), 380, from a final decree of the district court for southern California, three judges sitting, enjoining appellants, officers of the State of California, from enforcing the license and fee provisions of Chapter 788, p. 2253, California Statutes of 1937. Gray v. Ingels, D.C., 23 F.Supp. 946.1\n The statute, known as the Caravan Act, was enacted as a substitute for the Caravan Act of 1935, c. 402, p. 1453, Cal.Stat.1935, held invalid in Ingels v. Morf, \n300 \nU.S. 290\n, 57 S.Ct. 439, as an infringement of the commerce clause. 'Caravaning' is defined in  1 of the present Act as the 'transportation of any vehicle ... operated on its own wheels, or in tow of a motor vehicle, for the purpose of selling or offering the same for sale ... within or without this State.' Sections 4, 5 and 6 exact in lieu of all other fees two license fees, each of $7.50 for a six months permit for caravaning a vehicle on the state highways. One of these is 'to reimburse the State for expense incurred in administering police regulations pertaining to the operation of vehicles moved pursuant to such permits and to public safety upon the highways as affected by such operation'; the other is declared to be 'compensation for the privilege of using the public highways'. Section 8, excepts from the \n\n[306 \nU.S. 583, 587]\n\u00a0\n operation of the statute vehicles moving wholly within either of two zones which are approximately the northern and southern halves of the state. Other sections of the Act make provision for the issuance of licenses and the collection of fees. Section 12 provides for the collection of fees by seizure and sale of vehicles transported in violation of the Act, and  13 prescribes criminal penalties for violation.\n Appellees, numerous individuals, copartnerships and corporations, joined in bringing the present suit against appellants, state officers charged with the duty of enforcing the Act, alleging that each appellee had driven and would in the course of business drive automobiles into California for the purpose of sale. They prayed an injunction restraining appellants from collecting the fees and enforcing the provisions of the statute in aid of their collection. The district court's findings state that the amount involved in the action is in excess of the sum of $3,000; that each of appellees, in the course of business of selling motor cars, purchases cars previously registered in other states and 'caravans' them into the state of California; that cars for sale are often moved between points in a state zone; that the operation of cars in caravans does not create an additional hazard or a traffic problem necessitating special policing of the caravans and that the caravaning of cars does not create undue wear and tear on the highways of the state; that the fees charged are excessive and bear no relation to the added expense to the motor vehicle department of policing the highways of the state of California; and that they are disproportionate to other taxes or license fees charged by the state for the use of the highways. The court concluded that the statute discriminated against interstate commerce, deprived appellees of their property without due process, and denied to them equal protection of the laws, in that it applies only to those using the highways \n\n[306 \nU.S. 583, 588]\n\u00a0\n for the transportation of motor vehicles for the purposes of sale and does not apply to other persons using the highways under comparable circumstances.\n Appellants assail here the findings of fact of the court below on which it predicated its conclusion of unconstitutionality, and insist that upon the evidence there is no basis for the conclusion that the fees exacted are excessive or that there is discrimination against interstate commerce or a denial of equal protection or due process.\nJurisdiction of the District Court.\n A motion of appellants in the court below to dismiss the bill of complaint for want of the jurisdictional amount was withdrawn, and the jurisdiction of the district court is not challenged here. But on the argument, it appearing doubtful whether the 'matter in controversy' exceeded 'the sum or value of' $3,000,  24(1) of the Judicial Code, 28 U. S.C.  41(1), 28 U.S.C.A.  41(1), we raised the question whether the jurisdictional amount was involved, as was our duty. Mansfield, Coldwater & Lake Michigan R. Co. v. Swan, \n111 \nU.S. 379, 382\n, 4 S.Ct. 510, 511; Stratton v. St. Louis Southwestern R. Co., \n282 \nU.S. 10, 13\n, 51 S.Ct. 8, 9; St. Paul Indemnity Co. v. Red Cab Co., \n303 \nU.S. 283, 287\n, 58 S.Ct. 586, 589, note 10. The bill of complaint alleges generally that 'the amount involved in this litigation is in excess of Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000.00), exclusive of interest and costs'. But it is plain that this allegation is insufficient to satisfy jurisdictional requirements where there are numerous plaintiffs having no joint or common interest or title in the subject matter of the suit. As the bill of complaint shows on its face, and as the findings establish, each appellee maintains his own separate and independent business, which is said to be affected by the challenged fees. No joint or common interest of appellees in the subject matter of the suit is shown. Cf. Gibbs v. Buck, \n307 \nU.S. 66\n, 59 S.Ct. 725, 83 L.Ed. --, decided this day. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 583, 589]\n\u00a0\n It is a familiar rule that when several plaintiffs assert separate and distinct demands in a single suit, the amount involved in each separate controversy must be of the requisite amount to be within the jurisdiction of the district court, and that those amounts cannot be added together to satisfy jurisdictional requirements. Wheless v. St. Louis, \n180 \nU.S. 379\n, 21 S.Ct. 402; Rogers v. Hennepin County, \n239 \nU.S. 621\n, 36 S.Ct. 217; Pinel v. Pinel, \n240 \nU.S. 594\n, 36 S.Ct. 416, 60$L.Ed. 817; Scott v. Frazier, \n253 \nU.S. 243\n, 40 S.Ct. 503. The general allegation in the bill of complaint that 'the amount involved in this litigation is in excess of' $3,000 and the finding of the court that 'the amount involved in the within action' exceeds the jurisdictional amount, give no indication that the amount in controversy with respect to the claim of any single plaintiff exceeds the jurisdictional amount and are insufficient to show that the district court had jurisdiction of the cause. Pinel v. Pinel, supra.\n Examination of the record shows that only in the case of a single appellee, Paul Gray, Inc., is there any allegation or proof tending to show the amount in controversy. As to it the bill of complaint alleges that 'it causes to be caravaned into the said state ... approximately one hundred fifty (150) automobiles each year.' This allegation is supported by evidence that this appellee is regularly engaged in the business and tending to show that its volume exceeded that amount when the act went into effect July 2, 1937. Since the amount in controversy in a suit to restrain illegal imposition of fees or taxes is the amount of the fees or taxes which would normally be collected during the period of the litigation, Healy v. Ratta, \n292 \nU.S. 263\n, 54 S.Ct. 700, we cannot say, upon this state of the record, that jurisdiction was not established as to appellee Paul Gray, Inc.\n We ignore affidavits filed here for the purpose of supplementing the record by showing the amount in controversy as to another appellee. While it has been the prac- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 583, 590]\n\u00a0\n tice of this Court to receive affidavits for the purpose of establishing its own appellate jurisdiction under statutes prescribing that a specified amount in controversy is prerequisite to the appeal, Williamson v. Kincaid, 4 Dall. 20; Rush v. Parker, 5 Cranch 287; Roura v. Government of Philippine Islands, \n218 \nU.S. 386\n, 31 S.Ct. 73; see Red River Cattle Co. v. Needham, \n137 \nU.S. 632\n, 11 S.Ct. 208, that procedure is inapplicable here. Our review of the action of the district court in assuming jurisdiction is confined to the record before the district court. Henneford v. Northern Pacific Railway Co., \n303 \nU.S. 17\n, 58 S.Ct. 415.\n Proper practice requires that where each of several plaintiffs is bound to establish the jurisdictional amount with respect to his own claim, the suit should be dismissed as to those who fail to show that the requisite amount is involved. \n2\n Otherwise an appellate court could be called on to sustain a decree in favor of a plaintiff who had not shown that the claim involved the jurisdictional amount, even though the suit were dismissed on the merits as to e other plaintiffs who had established the jurisdictional amount for themselves. Although it appears that such a result could not follow here, we think it better practice to dismiss the suit for want of the jurisdictional amount as to all appellees except Paul Gray, Inc. See Rich v. Lambert, 12 How. 347; Ex parte Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co., \n106 \nU.S. 5\n, 1 S.Ct. 35; Hassall v. Wilcox, \n115 \nU.S. 598\n, 6 S.Ct. 189. Cf. Grosjean v. American Press Co., Inc., \n297 \nU.S. 233\n, 56 S.Ct. 444. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 583, 591]\n\u00a0\n Discrimination.\n Apart from appellees' insistence that the fees are an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce because excessive, the substance of their contention is that the statute discriminates between automobiles transported into the state singly and those similarly transported intrazone, for which no fee is charged, and also that the statute discriminates between those cars driven by appellees in caravans and those similarly driven wholly within either of the state zones, for which no fee is charged.\n In Morf v. Bingaman, \n298 \nU.S. 407\n, 56 S.Ct. 756, we had occasion to consider the validity of a fee or tax exacted by New Mexico for the transportation into the state of any motor vehicle for the purpose of sale within or without the state. It there appeared that the plaintiff, with others, was engaged in transporting motor cars on their own wheels in caravans across the State of New Mexico for the purpose of sale, and that their transportation for that purpose had resulted in the creation of a distinct class of motor vehicle traffic of considerable magnitude. In the course of this business second-hand cars purchased at points in the east are assembled in caravans, which are driven as such to the point of sale in California. Large numbers of the cars are coupled in twos, each two in charge of a single driver who operates the forward car and controls the movement of both by the use of the mechanism and brakes of one. The drivers of caravans, except two or three regularly engaged, are casually employed and serve without pay or for small compensation in order to secure transportation to the point of destination. We said, 298 U. S. pages 411, 412, 56 S.Ct. page 758: 'The Legislature may readily have concluded, as did the trial court, that the drivers have little interest in the business or the vehicles they drive and less regard than \n\n[306 \nU.S. 583, 592]\n\u00a0\n drivers of state licensed cars for the safety and convenience of others using the highways. The evidence supports the inference that cars thus coupled and controlled frequently skid, especially on curves, causing more than the usual wear and tear on the road; that this and other increased difficulties in the operation of the coupled cars, and the length of the caravans, increase the inconvenience and hazard to passing traffic. ... There is ample support for a legislative determination that the peculiar character of this traffic involves a special type of use of the highways, with enhanced wear and tear on the roads and augmented hazards to other traffic, which imposes on the state a heavier financial burden for highway maintenance and policing than do other types of motor car traffic. We cannot say that these circumstances do not afford an adequate basis for special licensing and taxing provisions, whose only effect, even when applied to interstate traffic, is to enable the state to police it, and to impose upon it a reasonable charge, to defray the burden of this state expense, and for the privilege of using the state highways.'\n The State of California has found it expedient to adopt licensing provisions for this class of traffic and to exact the fees specified in the statute for the use of its highways and the expense of policing. That this peculiar type of traffic occurs in large volume between eastern points and points in California, and that there is basis for the legislative judgment that the traffic imposes special burdens on the use of the state highways for which a special charge may be made, are abundantly supported by the record. The parties have stipulated that fifteen thousand automobiles are brought into the state for sale annually. Of these, from 80 to 90 per cent. come in caravans or convoys, and of the cars so moving one-half are coupled together in twos. It further appears by stipulation that the caravans or convoys are made up of from nineteen to twenty-five cars. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 583, 593]\n\u00a0\n There is much evidence in the record indicating that if is the long haul traffic in cars for sale in California which tends to produce the movement in large caravans or convoys in order to save expense of transportation, and which in turn tends to impose special burdens on the state in connection with the use of its highways, calling for the imposition of regulations and fees different from those applied to other types of motor car movement. Without repeating what was said more at length of like traffic in Morf v. Bingaman, supra, the evidence in the present case shows that coupled cars, under control of a single driver, subject the highways to increased wear and tear because of their tendency to skid and sway on curves and in passing other traffic, and that the length of the caravans and the inefficiency and irresponsibility of the drivers, casually employed, increase traffic congestion and the inconveniences and hazards of automobile traffic. These circumstances have caused the state to make increased provision for the policing of the traffic. It is true that the district court found that the practice of caravaning creates no additional traffic hazard, nor any undue wear and tear on the highways. But in this we think that its determination was not only contrary to the evidence, but went beyond the judicial province.\n It is no longer open to question that the states have constitutional authority to exact reasonable fees for the use of their highways by vehicles moving interstate, Hendrick v. Maryland, \n235 \nU.S. 610\n, 35 S.Ct. 140; Kane v. New Jersey, \n242 \nU.S. 160\n, 37 S.Ct. 30; Clark v. Poor, \n274 \nU.S. 554\n, 47 S.Ct. 702; Sprout v.

Continental Baking Co. v. Woodring, \n286 \nU.S. 352, 370\n, 371 S., 52 S. Ct. 595, 601, 81 A.L.R. 1402; Hicklin v. Coney, \n290 \nU.S. 169\n, 54 S.Ct. 142; Morf v. Bingaman, supra, 298 U.S. page 413, 56 S.Ct. page 759, 80$L.Ed. 1245; Dixie Ohio Express Co. v. State Revenue Comm., supra.\n The classification of the traffic for the purposes of regulation and fixing fees is a legislative, not a judicial, function. Its merits are not to be weighed in the judicial balance and the classification rejected merely because the weight of the evidence in court appears to favor a different standard. Cf. Worcester County Trust Co. v. Riley, \n302 \nU.S. 292, 299\n, 58 S.Ct. 185, 187. The determination of the legislature is presumed to be supported by facts known to it, unless facts judicially known or proved preclude that possibility. Standard Oil Co. v. Marysville, \n279 \nU.S. 582, 584\n, 49 S.Ct. 430; Borden's Farm Products Co. v. Ten Eyck, \n297 \nU.S. 251, 263\n, 56 S.Ct. 453, 456; Id., D.C., 11 F.Supp. 599, 600; South Carolina Highway Department v.

Hence, in passing on the validity of the present classification, it is not the province of a court to hear and examine evidence for the purpose of deciding again a question which the legislature has already decided. Its function is only to determine whether it is possible to say that the legislative decision is without rational basis. This is equally the case where the classification, which is one which the legislature was competent to make, is applied to vehicles using the state highways in interstate commerce. South Carolina Highway Department v. Barnwell Bros., supra, 303 U.S. page 187 et seq., 58 S.Ct. page 514. The legislature must be assumed to have acted on information available to courts, and where, as here, the evidence, like that discussed in Morf v. Bingaman, supra, shows that it is at least a debatable question whether the traffic in caravans involves special wear and tear of the highways and increased traffic hazards requiring special police control, decision is for the legislature and not the courts. Standard Oil Co. v. Marysville, \n\n[306 \nU.S. 583, 595]\n\u00a0\n supra; South Carolina Highway Department v. Barnwell Bros., supra.\n Appellee Paul Gray, Inc., so far as appears, caravans its cars for sale in California from Detroit, Michigan, and St. Joseph, Missouri. Its cars, like those of the other appellees, move in caravans of from nineteen to twenty-five cars. It does not appear, nor is it contended, that this appellee transports any cars singly. From what has been said it is evident, as was decided in Morf v. Bingaman, supra, that cars moving in caravans of the type described constitute a special class of traffic which may be taxed or charged for differently from other classes without infringing the equal protection clause.\n The argument that the statute denies equal protection to appellees because it exacts fees for cars transported into the state for sale singly but none for cars which move similarly intrazone or for those which enter the state not for purposes of sale, ignores the actual circumstances in which the statute is applied to appellees, as shown by the record, and seeks to take advantage of an alleged discrimination which, if it exists, does appellees no harm. The Fourteenth Amendment does not require classification for fees, more than for taxation, to follow any particular form of words. If that adopted results in the application of the exaction to a class which may be separately charged without a denial of equal protection, those within the class cannot complain that it might have been more aptly defined or that the statute may tax others who are not within the class. See Patsone v. Pennsylvania, \n232 \nU.S. 138, 144\n, 34 S.Ct. 281, 282; Silver v. Silver, \n280 \nU.S. 117, 123\n, 50 S.Ct. 57, 58, 65 A.L.R. 939; Morf v. Bingaman, supra, 298 U.S. page 413, 56 S.Ct. page 759\n\n\n It is the practice of transporting automobiles for long distances over the highway for purpose of sale which has given rise to the practice of moving them in caravans. The use of automobiles for other purposes, or for pleasure, does not have that result. The classification of the stat- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 583, 596]\n\u00a0\n ute, in its practical application, embraces and is constitutionally applicable to cars moving in caravans, the class of traffic in which appellee Paul Gray, Inc., engages and on which it is alone taxed. One form of discrimination of which it complains is that fees are exacted for cars driven into the state singly for sale but not for those driven singly to market intrazone or singly from without the state for other purposes. Appellee does not show that it belongs to either class, and so far as the traffic in which it participates is properly taxed, it cannot complain of the imposition of the charge on a business which it does not do.\n So far as appellees complain that no fee is exacted for cars which move for sale intrazone in caravans, different considerations apply. As we have said, it is the long haul of cars for sale which has produced motor vehicle caravans and has made them a special class for the purposes of regulation and imposition of fees. It was for the legislature to consider and decide whether the actual conditions which prevail in the state, affecting movement of cars for sale, eliminate or so reduce the burden of the caravan traffic on the highways as to call for a different classification of the short haul traffic for the purposes of regulation and fees. The legislature having made its classification by the establishment of zones, in the light of special conditions in the state, courts are not free to set aside its determination unless they can say that it is without any substantial basis. Carley & Hamilton v. Snook, \n281 \nU.S. 66, 73\n, 50 S.Ct. 204, 207, 68 A.L.R. 194; Continental Baking Co. v. Woodring, supra; Sproles v. Binford, \n286 \nU.S. 374\n, 52 S.Ct. 581; Hicklin v. Coney, supra; Aero Mayflower Transit Co. v. Public Service Comm., \n295 \nU.S. 285\n, 55 S.Ct. 709.\n The trial court found that cars are often moved in convoys in Zone 1, which includes the metropolitan area of Los Angeles, and it thought this sufficient to establish an unlawful discrimination without consideration of the \n\n[306 \nU.S. 583, 597]\n\u00a0\n other conditions affecting the intrazone traffic. The evidence establishes, beyond any reasonable doubt, that the movement intrazone of cars for sale in convoys similar to that of appellees is negligible and that the principal sources of cars for sale moving intrazone are the assembly plants of automobile manufacturers located in or near the metropolitan areas of Los Angeles and San Francisco. Being new cars, the bulk of them, shipped interstate or to distant Points intrastate, move by rail, water or truck. Most of those which move on their own wheels are driven relatively short distances, seventy-five miles or less, in the metropolitan area over highways of more than two lanes, as distinguished from caravans coming from without the state, which move for long distances over two-lane highways in mountain districts. The proportion driven singly does not appear. Such convoys or caravans as there are usually consist of two or three cars. The evidence discloses no case of more than four. Coupling is negligible. Each car is in charge of a regularly employed and licensed driver. The intrazone movement is subject to other licensing and taxing provisions of the state law, and no showing is made that the differences in fees or taxes exacted from the two classes of traffic do not bear a fair relationship to the differences in the burden of the traffic for which the state must provide.\n The legislature could reasonably have concluded that the wear and tear and injury to the highways from driving coupled cars intrazone was negligible, and that the relatively short distances which cars are driven in twos or threes, the character of the highways used, and the difference in the class of drivers, taken together, eliminate from the intrazone traffic or so substantially reduce the burden imposed by traffic like that of appellees moving interstate or interzone as to require, in fairness, a different classification for the purpose of fees charged for the use of the highways. We cannot say that that conclusion \n\n[306 \nU.S. 583, 598]\n\u00a0\n is without support or infringes the principles which we have repeatedly recognized as defining the power of the states, in the absence of Congressional action, to classify vehicles or traffic for the purposes of regulating use of the highways by vehicles moving interstate. If the classification with respect to a matter remaining within state control, despite the commerce clause, is otherwise valid, it is not any the less so because it affects interstate commerce. See South Carolina Highway Department v. Barnwell Bros., supra, 303 U.S. pages 191, 192, 58 S.Ct. page 517, and cases cited. As the state has authority to charge a reasonable fee for the use of its highways, and as the classification of the traffic which the state has made for the purpose of fixing the fees is valid, the only remaining question is whether the fees which it has fixed must be deemed excessive.\nReasonableness of the Fees.\n In Ingels v. Morf, supra, the $15 fee charged under the California Act of 1935 for driving a car into the state for purpose of sale was contested as excessive. There the statute declared that the fee was 'intended to reimburse the State treasury for the added expense which the State may incur in the administration and enforcement of this act and the added expense of policing the highways over which such caravaning may be conducted, ....' St.Cal.1935, p. 1454,  6, and the automobile owner assumed and by proof sustained the burden of showing that the charge made for the precise purposes defined by the statute was excessive. We accepted the evidence as establishing that the cost of issuing caravan permits was about $5 per car and as supporting the finding of the trial court that the cost of policing did not exceed $5 a car. And we concluded that the total cost of administration and policing was substantially less than the $15 fee charged.\n Here a fee of $7.50 is collected for administration and enforcement of the Act and a fee of like amount is charged \n\n[306 \nU.S. 583, 599]\n\u00a0\n for the use of the highways. Appellees have offered no proof that either of the fees is too large, although the burden rested upon them to show that the fees were excessive for the declared purposes. Hendrick v. Maryland, supra, 235 U.S. page 624, 35 S.Ct. page 142; Interstate Busses Corporation v. Blodgett, \n276 \nU.S. 245, 251\n, 48 S.Ct. 230, 231; Morf v. Bingaman, supra, 298 U.S. page 410, 56 S.Ct. page 757; Ingels v. Morf, supra, 300 U.S. page 296, 57 S.Ct. page 442; Great Northern Railway Co. v. Washington, \n300 \nU.S. 154\n, 57 S.Ct. 397, is not to the contrary.\n Appellants, without abandoning their position that the burden of proof rests on appellees, offered evidence to show that the costs of administration and policing proved in Ingels v. Morf, supra, were incomplete. Due to the nature of the case much of the proof is inexact and speculative. But there is evidence that thirty-nine officers devoted part or all of their time to enforcing the 1937 Act. The expense of operating their automobiles and motorcycles is considerable; an increased burden is imposed upon the personnel of the border police stations; and some increase in clerical force and in expenditures for stationery and miscellaneous items has been required. Investigations of attempted evasions increase the unit cost above that of other types of traffic. The total of these added expenses, as computed by appellants at about $133,000 annually certainly approximates the amount of the revenue derived from the fees. The aggregate of the fees collected during eleven months for 14,000 cars at $7.50 each is $105,000. Appellees do nothing to challenge this evidence, and they point to no specific errors in the estimates or computation upon which appellants calculate the costs.\n The state is not required to compute with mathematical precision the cost to it of the services necessitated by the caravan traffic. If the fees charged do not appear to be manifestly disproportionate to the services rendered, we cannot say from our own knowledge or experience that they are excessive. Kane v. New Jersey, supra, 242 U.S. page 168, 37 S.Ct. page 32; \n\n[306 \nU.S. 583, 600]\n\u00a0\n Interstate Busses Corp. v. Blodgett, supra, 276 U.S. page 251, 252, 48 S. Ct. page 231; Morf v. Bingaman, supra; Dixie Ohio Express Co. v. State Revenue Comm., supra; see Patapsco Guano Co. v. North Carolina, \n171 \nU.S. 345, 354\n, 18 S.Ct. 862, 865; Territory of New Mexico ex rel. McLean & Co. v. Denver & Rio Grande R. Co., \n203 \nU.S. 38, 55\n, 27 S.Ct. 1, 5; Interstate Transit, Inc., v. Lindsey, \n283 \nU.S. 183, 186\n, 51 S.Ct. 380, 381. Appellees have failed to sustain the burden of proof that either of the fees is excessive for the purpose for which it is collected.\n The trial court seems to have thought, as appellees argue, that unreasonableness of the fees was established by proof that the same fees are not imposed on other classes of traffic. But since, as we have seen, there is basis for the classification of the traffic, there is basis for a difference in fees charged the different classes. Hendrick v. Maryland, supra; Interstate Busses Corp. v. Blodgett, supra. Appellees have laid no foundation for any contention that there are not compensating differences in the traffic comparable to the difference in fees, or for impeaching the legislative judgment that those specified are fairly related to the traffic to which they are applied.\n The cause will be reversed with instructions to the district court to dismiss the case as to appellee Paul Gray, Inc., on the merits, and to dismiss as to the other appellees for want of jurisdiction.\n So ordered.\n Mr. Justice BLACK is of the opinion that the case should be dismissed for want of jurisdiction as to all the appellees. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The suit was begun July 14, 1937, before the enactment of the amendment to  24 of the Judicial Code, 50 Stat. 738, 28 U.S.C.A.  41(1), providing that 'no district court shall have jurisdiction of any suit to enjoin, suspend, or restrain the assessment, levy, or collection of any tax imposed by or pursuant to the laws of any State where a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy may be had at law or in equity in the courts of such State.'

William H. Thompson and Albert L. Rabb, both of Indianapolis, Ind., for appellant.\n Messrs. Edward H. Knight, of Indianapolis, Ind., and Rexell A. Boyd, of Evansville, Ind., for appellee. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 439, 440]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Supreme Court of Indiana affirmed a judgment which convicted appellant of violating section 11 of the Animals Disposal Act approved March 12, 19371 (c. 278, Acts 1937) by transporting a dead horse over a highway of that State and into Illinois without license. For \n\n[306 \nU.S. 439, 441]\n\u00a0\n bidden transportation is admitted; also that while license can be obtained under prescribed conditions for such transportation within the state it is prohibited for points outside.\n Section 11 is a part of a comprehensive statute which requires, and undertakes to regulate, the prompt \n\n[306 \nU.S. 439, 442]\n\u00a0\n disposition of large dead animals (not slaughtered for human food) under the general supervision of the State Veterinarian. The obvious purpose of the enactment is to prevent the spread of disease and the development of nuisances.\n The prescribed plan exacts that within twenty-four hours after death owners shall bury or burn such bodies on their premises, or there deliver them to the representative of a disposal plant licensed to do business within the State. It further directs that the body shall be promptly carried to such plant in a sanitary vehicle and speedily rendered innocuous. The conveyance must be thoroughly and promptly disinfected at the plant.\n The validity of the statute was unsuccessfully challenged on the ground that it unduly discriminates against and burdens interstate commerce and thereby violates the Federal Constitution. The Supreme Court of the State reviewed the statute; pointed out its purpose to suppress obvious danger to public health; referred to the means adopted as reasonably appropriate to that end; quoted from Bowman v. Chicago & Northwestern Railway Co., \n125 \nU.S. 465, 489\n, 8 S.Ct. 689, 700.2 It concluded that dead bodies of animals not \n\n[306 \nU.S. 439, 443]\n\u00a0\n slaughtered for food are not legitimate subjects of commerce; that the statute is an appropriate sanitary measure whose effect upon interstate commerce, if any, is merely incidental.\n As the precise point for our determination, counsel for appellant submit the following-\n'The Supreme Court of Indiana erred in holding that the Indiana Dead Animal Disposal Act of 1937 was valid as a reasonable regulation or quarantine and not invalid as a discriminatory prohibition of interstate commerce in commodities recognized as legitimate articles of intrastate commerce, contrary to Article 1, Section 8, Clause 3, of the Constitution of the United States, U.S.C.A.'\n\n It seems plain enough that the challenged statute is a sanitary and health measure not intended to cause discrimination against or to burden interstate commerce. Its purpose is to promote the health of the people of the State in feasible ways.\n'The power of the state to prescribe regulations which shall prevent the production within its borders of impure foods, unfit for use, and such articles as would spread disease and pestilence, is well established. Such articles, it has been declared by this court, are not the legitimate subject of trade or commerce, nor within the protection of the commerce clause of the Constitution. ... Nor does it make any difference that such regulations incidentally affect interstate commerce, when the object of the regulation is not to that end, but is a legitimate attempt to protect the people of the state.' Sligh v. Kirkwood, \n237 \nU.S. 52, 59\n, 60 S., 35 S.Ct. 501, 502.\n\n Here, contrary to what seems to be the insistence of counsel, the State has not recognized dead horses as legitimate articles of intrastate commerce. It permits them to be sold only to licensed operators who must transport them immediately under strict sanitary regulations for prompt delivery to a licensed plant there to be rendered \n\n[306 \nU.S. 439, 444]\n\u00a0\n innocuous without delay by prescribed methods. All this is part of a workable scheme to secure prompt removal of decaying carcasses and thus protect against obvious evils.\n We can find no substantial basis for the charge of discrimination against legitimate interstate commerce. That any real burden upon commerce which the State is not free to inhibit will result from the challenged statute seems impossible.\n There is no suggestion of conflict with a federal enactment. The mere power of the Federal Government to regulate interstate commerce does not disable the States from adopting reasonable measures designed to secure the health and comfort of their people. The statute under consideration is an effort to discharge an obligation to the public; the means adopted we think are clearly appropriate to this lawful end.\n The judgment of the court below must be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Indiana Acts 1937, c. 278-\n'Sec. 4.

Such articles are not merchantable. They are not legitimate subjects of trade and commerce. They may be rightly outlawed, as intrinsically and directly the immediate sources and causes of destruction to human health and life.

In January, 1937, a resolution known as 'Senate Concurrent Resolu- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 433, 436]\n\u00a0\n tion No. 3' was introduced in the Senate of Kansas ratifying the proposed amendment. There were forty senators. When the resolution came up for consideration, twenty senators voted in favor of its adoption and twenty voted against it. The Lieutenant Governor, the presiding officer of the Senate, then cast his vote in favor of the resolution. The resolution was later adopted by the House of Representatives on the vote of a majority of its members.\n This original proceeding in mandamus was then brought in the Supreme Court of Kansas by twenty-one members of the Senate, including the twenty senators who had voted against the resolution, and three members of the house of representatives, to compel the Secretary of the Senate to erase an endorsement on the resolution to the effect that it had been adopted by the Senate and to endorse thereon the words 'was not passed', and to restrain the officers of the Senate and House of Representatives from signing the resolution and the Secretary of State of Kansas from authenticating it and delivering it to the Governor. The petition challenged the right of the Lieutenant Governor to cast the deciding vote in the Senate. The petition also set forth the prior rejection of the proposed amendment and alleged that in the period from June, 1924, to March, 1927, the amendment had been rejected by both houses of the legislatures of twenty-six states, and had been ratified in only five states, and that by reason of that rejection and the failure of ratification within a reasonable time the proposed amendment had lost its vitality.\n An alternative writ was issued. Later the Senate passed a resolution directing the Attorney General to enter the appearance of the State and to represent the State as its interests might appear.

The court entertained the action and held that the Lieutenant Governor was authorized to cast the deciding vote, that the proposed amendment retained its original vitality, and that the resolution 'having duly passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, the act of ratification of the proposed amendment by the Legislature of Kansas was final and complete'. The writ of mandamus was accordingly denied. 146 Kan. 390, 71 P.2d 518, 526. This Court granted certiorari. \n303 \nU.S. 632\n, 58 S.Ct. 758\n\n\n First.-The jurisdiction of this Court.-Our authority to issue the writ of certiorari is challenged upon the ground that petitioners have no standing to seek to have the judgment of the state court reviewed, and hence it is urged that the writ of certiorari should be dismissed. We are unable to accept that view.\n The state court held that it had jurisdiction; that 'the right of the parties to maintain the action is beyond question'.2 The state court thus determined in substance that members of the legislature had standing to seek, and the court had jurisdiction to grant, mandamus to compel a proper record of legislative action. Had the questions been solely state questions, the matter would \n\n[307 \nU.S. 433, 438]\n\u00a0\n have ended there. But the questions raised in the instant case arose under the Federal Constitution and these questions were entertained and decided by the state court. They arose under Article V of the Constitution, U.S.C. A., which alone conferred the power to amend and determined the manner in which that power could be exercised. Hawke v. Smith (No. 1), \n253 \nU.S. 221, 227\n, 40 S.Ct. 495, 497, 10 A.L.R. 1504; Leser v. Garnett, \n258 \nU.S. 130, 137\n, 42 S.Ct. 217. Whether any or all of the questions thus raised and decided are deemed to be justiciable or political, they are exclusively federal questions and not state questions.\n We find the cases cited in support of the contention, that petitioners lack an adequate interest to invoke our jurisdiction to review, to be inapplicable. 3 Here, the plaintiffs include twenty senators, whose votes against ratification have been overridden and virtually held for naught although if they are right in their contentions their votes would have been sufficient to defeat ratification. We think that these senators have a plain, direct and adequate interest in maintaining the effectiveness of their votes. Petitioners come directly within the provisions of the statute governing our appellate jurisdiction. They have set up and claimed a right and privilege under the Constitution of the United States to have their votes given effect and the state court has denied that right and privilege. As the validity of a state statute was not assailed, the remedy by appeal was not available, Jud.Code, Sec. 237(a ), 28 U.S.C.  344(a), 28 U.S.C.A.  344(a), and the appropriate remedy was by writ of certiorari which we granted. Jud.Code, Sec. 237(b), 28 U.S. C.  344(b), 28 U.S.C.A.  344(b).\n The contention to the contrary is answered by our decisions in Hawke v. Smith, supra, and Leser v. Garnett, \n\n[307 \nU.S. 433, 439]\n\u00a0\n supra. In Hawke v. Smith, supra, the plaintiff in error, suing as a 'citizen and elector of the State of Ohio, and as a taxpayer and elector of the County of Hamilton', on behalf of himself and others similarly situated, filed a petition for an injunction in the state court to restrain the Secretary of State from spending the public money in preparing and printing ballots for submission of a referendum to the electors on the question of the ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution, U.S.C.A. A demurrer to the petition was sustained in the lower court and its judgment was affirmed by the intermediate appellate court and the Supreme Court of the State. This Court entertained jurisdiction and, holding that the state court had erred in deciding that the State had authority to require the submission of the ratification to a referendum, reversed the judgment.\n In Leser v. Garnett, supra, qualified voters in the State of Maryland brought suit in the state court to have the names of certain women stricken from the list of qualified voters on the ground that the constitution of Maryland limited suffrage to men and that the Nineteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution, U.S.C.A. has not been validly ratified. The state court took jurisdiction and the Court of Appeals of the State affirmed the judgment dismissing the petition. We granted certiorari. On the question of our jurisdiction we said:\n'The petitioners contended, on several grounds, that the amendment had not become part of the federal Constitution. The trial court overruled the contentions and dismissed the petition. Its judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeals of the state (Md.) (139 Md. 46) 114 A. 840; and the case comes here on writ of error. That writ must be dismissed; but the petition for a writ of certiorari, also duly filed, is granted. The laws of Maryland authorized such a suit by a qualified voter against the board of registry. Whether the Nineteenth Amendment has be \n\n[307 \nU.S. 433, 440]\n\u00a0\n come part of the federal Constitution is the question presented for decision'.\n\n And holding that the official notice to the Secretary of State, duly authenticated, of the action of the legislatures of the States, whose alleged ratifications were assailed, was conclusive upon the Secretary of State and that his proclamation accordingly of ratification was conclusive upon the courts, we affirmed the judgment of the state court.\n That the question of our jurisdiction in Leser v. Garnett, supra, was decided upon deliberate consideration is sufficiently shown by the fact that there was a motion to dismiss the writ of error for the want of jurisdiction and opposition to the grant of certiorari. The decision is the more striking because on the same day, in an opinion immediately preceding which was prepared for the Court by the same Justice,4 jurisdiction had been denied to a federal court (the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia) of a suit by citizens of the United States, taxpayers and members of a voluntary association organized to support the Constitution, in which it was sought to have the Nineteenth Amendment declared unconstitutional and to enjoin the Secretary of State from proclaiming its ratification and the Attorney General from taking steps to enforce it. Fairchild v. Hughes, \n258 \nU.S. 126\n, 42 S.Ct. 274, 275. The Court held that the plaintiffs' alleged interest in the question submitted was not such as to afford a basis for the proceeding; that the plaintiffs had only the right possessed by every citizen 'to require that the government be administered according to law and that the public moneys be not wasted' and that this general right did not entitle a private citizen to bring such a suit as the one in question in the federal courts. 5 It \n\n[307 \nU.S. 433, 441]\n\u00a0\n would be difficult to imagine a situation in which the adequacy of the petitioners' interest to invoke our appellate jurisdiction in Leser v. Garnett, supra, could have been more sharply presented.\n The effort to distinguish that case on the ground that the plaintiffs were qualified voters in Maryland, and hence could complain of the admission to the registry of those alleged not to be qualified, is futile. The interest of the plaintiffs in Leser v. Garnett, supra, as merely qualified voters at general elections is certainly much less impressive than the interest of the twenty senators in the instant case. This is not a mere intra-parliamentary controversy but the question relates to legislative action deriving its force solely from the provisions of the Federal Constitution, and the twenty senators were not only qualified to vote on the question of ratification but their votes, if the Lieutenant Governor were excluded as not being a part of the legislature for that purpose, would have been decisive in defeating the ratifying resolution.\n We are of the opinion that Hawke v. Smith and Leser v. Garnett, supra, are controlling authorities, but in view of the wide range the discussion has taken we may refer to some other instances in which the question of what constitutes a sufficient interest to enable one to invoke our appellate jurisdiction has been involved. The principle that the applicant must show a legal interest in the controversy has been maintained. It has been applied repeatedly in cases where municipal corporations have challenged state legislation affecting their alleged rights and obligations. Being but creatures of the State, municipal corporations have no standing to invoke the contract clause or the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution in opposition to the will of their creator. \n6\n But there \n\n[307 \nU.S. 433, 442]\n\u00a0\n has been recognition of the legitimate interest public officials and administrative commissions, federal and state, to resist the endeavor to prevent the enforcement of statutes in relation to which they have official duties. Under the Urgent Deficiencies Act,7 the Interstate Commerce Commission, and commissions representing interested States which have intervened, are entitled as 'aggrieved parties' to an appeal to this Court from a decree setting aside an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission, though the United States refuses to join in the appeal. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Oregon-Washington R. & N. Co., \n288 \nU.S. 14\n, 53 S.Ct. 266. So, this Court may grant certiorari, on the application of the Federal Trade Commission, to review decisions setting aside its orders. 8 Federal Trade Commission v. Curtis Publishing Company, \n260 \nU.S. 568\n, 43 S.Ct. 210. Analogous provisions authorize certiorari to review decisions against the National Labor Relations Board. \n9\n National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Corporation, \n301 \nU.S. 1\n, 57 S.Ct. 615, 108 A.L.R. 1352. Under Section 266 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  380, 28 U.S.C.  380, where an injunction is sought to restrain the enforcement of a statute of a State or an order of its administrative board or commission, upon the ground of invalidity under the Federal Constitution, the right of direct appeal to this Court from the decree of the required three judges is accorded whether the injunction be granted or denied. Hence, in case the injunction is granted, the state board is entitled to appeal. See, for example, South Carolina Highway Department v. Barnwell Brothers, \n303 \nU.S. 177\n, 58 S.Ct. 510.\n The question of our authority to grant certiorari, on the application of state officers, to review decisions of state courts declaring state statutes, which these officers \n\n[307 \nU.S. 433, 443]\n\u00a0\n seek to enforce, to be repugnant to the Federal Constitution, has been carefully considered and our jurisdiction in that class of cases has been sustained. The original Judiciary Act of 1789 provided in Section 25 10 for the review by this Court of a judgment of a state court 'where is drawn in question the validity ... of a statute of, or an authority exercised under any State, on the ground of their being repugnant to the constitution, treaties or laws of the United States, and the decision is in favour of such their validity'; that is, where the claim of federal right had been denied. By the Act of December 23, 1914,11 it was provided that this Court may review on certiorari decisions of state courts sustaining a federal right. The present statute governing our jurisdiction on certiorari contains the corresponding provision that this Court may exercise that jurisdiction 'as well where the Federal claim is sustained as where it is denied'. Jud.Code, Section 7(b), 28 U.S.C.  344(b), 28 U.S. C.A.  344(b). The plain purpose was to provide an opportunity, deemed to be important and appropriate, for the review of the decisions of state courts on constitutional questions however the state court might decide them. Accordingly where the claim of a complainant that a state officer be restrained from enforcing a state statute because of constitutional invalidity is sustained by the state court, the statute enables the state officer to seek a reversal by this Court of that decision.\n In Blodgett v. Silberman, \n277 \nU.S. 1, 7\n, 48 S.Ct. 410, 412, the Court granted certiorari on the application of the State Tax Commissioner of Connecticut who sought review of the decision of the Supreme Court of Errors of the State so far as it denied the right created by its statute to tax the transfer of certain securities, which had been placed for safekeeping in New York, on the ground that they \n\n[307 \nU.S. 433, 444]\n\u00a0\n were not within the taxing jurisdiction of Connecticut. Entertaining jurisdiction, this Court reversed the judgment in that respect. Id., 277 U. S. at page 18, 48 S.Ct. at page 416.\n The question received most careful consideration in the case of Boynton, Attorney General, v. Hutchinson Gas Company, \n291 \nU.S. 656\n, 54 S. Ct. 457, where the Supreme Court of Kansas had held a state statute to be repugnant to the Federal Constitution, and the Attorney General of the State applied for certiorari. His application was opposed upon the ground that he had merely an official interest in the controversy and the decisions were invoked upon which the Government relies in challenging our jurisdiction in the instant case. \n12\n Because of its importance, and contrary to our usual practice, the Court directed oral argument on the question whether certiorari should be granted and after that argument, upon mature deliberation, granted the writ. The writ was subsequently dismissed but only because of a failure of the record to show service of summons and severance upon the appellees in the state court who were not parties to the proceedings here. Boynton v. Hutchinson Gas Co., \n292 \nU.S. 601\n, 54 S.Ct. 639. This decision with respect to the scope of our jurisdiction has been followed in later cases. In Morehead v. New York ex rel. Tipaldo, \n298 \nU.S. 587\n, 56 S.Ct. 918, 103 A.L.R. 1445, we granted certiorari on an application by the warden of a city prison to review the decision of the Court of Appeals of the State on habeas corpus, ruling that the minimum wage law of the State violated the Federal Constitution. This Court decided the case on the merits. In Kelly v. Washington ex rel. Foss Company, \n302 \nU.S. 1\n, 58 S.Ct. 87, we granted certiorari, on the application of the state authorities charged with the enforcement of the state law relating to the inspection and regulation of vessels, to review the decision of the state court holding the statute invalid in its application to navigable waters. We concluded that the state act had a permissible field of operation and the decision of the \n\n[307 \nU.S. 433, 445]\n\u00a0\n state court in holding the statute completely unenforceable in deference to federal law was reversed.\n This class of cases in which we have exercised our appellate jurisdiction on the application of state officers may be said to recognize that they have an equate interest in the controversy by reason of their duty to enforce the state statutes the validity of which has been drawn in question. In none of these cases could it be said that the state officers invoking our jurisdiction were sustaining any 'private damage'.\n While one who asserts the mere right of a citizen and taxpayer of the United States to complain of the alleged invalid outlay of public moneys has no standing to invoke the jurisdiction of the federal courts ( Frothingham v. Mellon, \n262 \nU.S. 447, 480\n, 486 S., 487, 43 S.Ct. 597, 598, 600), the Court has sustained the more immediate and substantial right of a resident taxpayer to invoke the interposition of a court of equity to enjoin an illegal use of moneys by a municipal corporation. Crampton v. Zabriskie, \n101 \nU.S. 601\n, 609; Frothingham v. Mellon, supra. In Heim v. McCall, \n239 \nU.S. 175\n, 36 S.Ct. 78, Ann.Cas.1917B, 287, we took jurisdiction on a writ of error sued out by a property owner and taxpayer, who had been given standing in the state court, for the purpose of reviewing its decision sustaining the validity under the Federal Constitution of a state statute as applied to contracts for the construction of public works in the City of New York, the enforcement of which was alleged to involve irreparable loss to the city and hence to be inimical to the interests of the taxpayer.\n In Smiley v. Holm, \n285 \nU.S. 355\n, 52 S.Ct. 397, we granted certiorari on the application of one who was an 'elector', as well as a 'citizen' and 'taxpayer', and who assailed under the Federal Constitution a state statute establishing congressional districts. Passing upon the merits we held that the function of a state legislature in prescribing the time, place and manner of holding elections for representatives \n\n[307 \nU.S. 433, 446]\n\u00a0\n in Congress under Article I, Section 4, U.S.C.A.Const., was a law-making function in which the veto power of the state governor participates, if under the state constitution the governor has that power in the course of the making of state laws, and accordingly reversed the judgment of the state court. We took jurisdiction on certiorari in a similar case from New York where the petitioners were 'citizens and voters of the State' who had sought a mandamus to compel the Secretary of State of New York to certify that representatives in Congress were to be elected in the congressional districts as defined by a concurrent resolution of the Senate and Assembly of the legislature. There the state court, construing the provision of the Federal Constitution as contemplating the exercise of the law-making power, had sustained the defense that the concurrent resolution was ineffective as it had not been submitted to the Governor for approval, and refused the writ of mandamus. We affirmed the judgment. Koenig v. Flynn, \n285 \nU.S. 375\n, 52 S.Ct. 403.\n In the light of this course of decisions, we find no departure from principle in recognizing in the instant case that at least the twenty senators whose votes, if their contention were sustained, would have been sufficient to defeat the resolution ratifying the proposed constitutional amendment, have an interest in the controversy which, treated by the state court as a basis for entertaining and deciding the federal questions, is sufficient to give the Court jurisdiction to review that decision.\n Second.-The participation of the Lieutenant Governor.-Petitioners contend at, in the light of the powers and duties of the Lieutenant Governor and his relation to the Senate under the state constitution, as construed by the supreme court of the state, the Lieutenant Governor was not a part of the 'legislature' so that under Article V of the Federal Constitution, he could be permitted to have a deciding vote on the ratification of the \n\n[307 \nU.S. 433, 447]\n\u00a0\n proposed amendment, when the senate was equally divided.\n Whether this contention presents a justiciable controversy, or a question which is political in its nature and hence not justiciable, is a question upon which the Court is equally divided and therefore the Court expresses no opinion upon that point.\n Third.-The effect of the previous rejection of the amendment and of the lapse of time since its submission.\n\n 1. \nThe state court adopted the view expressed by text-writers that a state legislature which has rejected an amendment proposed by the Congress may later ratify. \n13\n The argument in support of that view is that Article V says nothing of rejection but speaks only of ratification and provides that a proposed amendment shall be valid as part of the Constitution when ratified by three-fourths of the States; that the power to ratify is thus conferred upon the State by the Constitution and, as a ratifying power, persists despite a previous rejection. The opposing view proceeds on an assumption that if ratification by 'Conventions' were prescribed by the Congress, a convention could not reject and, having adjourned sine die, be reassembled and ratify. It is also premised, in accordance with views expressed by text-writers,14 that ratification if once given cannot afterwards be rescinded and the amendment rejected, and it is urged that the same effect in the exhaustion of the State's power to act should be ascribed to rejection; that a State can act 'but once, either by convention or through its legislature'. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 433, 448]\n\u00a0\n Historic instances are cited. In 1865, the Thirteenth Amendment was rejected by the legislature of New Jersey which subsequently ratified it, but the question did not become important as ratification by the requisite number of States had already been proclaimed. \n15\n The question did arise in connection with the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment. The legislatures of Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina had rejected the amendment in November and December, 1866.16 New governments were erected in those States (and in others) under the direction of Congress. \n17\n The new legislatures ratified the amendment, that of North Carolina on July 4, 1868, that of South Carolina on July 9, 1868, and that of Georgia on July 21, 1868.18 Ohio and New Jersey first ratified and then passed resolutions withdrawing their consent. 19 As there were then thirty-seven States, twenty-eight were needed to constitute the requisite three-fourths. On July 9, 1868, the Congress adopted a resolution requesting the Secretary of State to communicate 'a list of the States of the Union whose legislatures have ratified the fourteenth article of amendment',20 and in Secretary Seward's report attention was called to the action of Ohio and New Jersey. \n21\n On July 20th Secretary Seward issued a proclamation reciting the ratification by twenty-eight States, including North Carolina, South Carolina, Ohio and New Jersey, and stating that it appeared that Ohio and New Jersey had since passed resolutions withdrawing their consent and that 'it is \n\n[307 \nU.S. 433, 449]\n\u00a0\n deemed a matter of doubt and uncertainty whether such resolutions are not irregular, invalid and therefore ineffectual'. The Secretary certified that if the ratifying resolutions of Ohio and New Jersey were still in full force and effect, notwithstanding the attempted withdrawal, the amendment had become a part of the Constitution. \n22\n On the following day the Congress adopted a concurrent resolution which, reciting that three- fourths of the States having ratified (the list including North Carolina, South Carolina, Ohio and New Jersey),23 declared the Fourteenth Amendment to be a part of the Constitution and that it should be duly promulgated as such by the Secretary of State. Accordingly, Secretary Seward, on July 28th, issued his proclamation embracing the States mentioned in the congressional resolution and adding Georgia. \n24\n\u00a0\n\n Thus the political departments of the Government dealt with the effect both of previous rejection and of attempted withdrawal and determined that both were ineffectual in the presence of an actual ratification. \n25\n While there were special circumstances, because of the action of the Congress in relation to the governments of the rejecting States (North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia), these circumstances were not recited in proclaiming ratification and the previous action taken in these States was set forth in the proclamation as actual previous rejections by the respective legislatures. This \n\n[307 \nU.S. 433, 450]\n\u00a0\n decision by the political departments of the Government as to the validity of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment has been accepted.\n We think that in accordance with this historic precedent the question of the efficacy of ratifications by state legislatures, in the light of previous rejection or attempted withdrawal, should be regarded as a political question pertaining to the political departments, with the ultimate authority in the Congress in the exercise of its control over the promulgation of the adoption of the amendment.\n The precise question as now raised is whether, when the legislature of the State, as we have found, has actually ratified the proposed amendment, the Court should restrain the state officers from certifying the ratification to e Secretary of State, because of an earlier rejection, and thus prevent the question from coming before the political departments. We find no basis in either Constitution or statute for such judicial action. Article V, speaking solely of ratification, contains no provision as to rejection. \n26\n Nor has the Congress enacted a statute relating to rejections. The statutory provision with respect to constitutional amendments is as follows:\n'Whenever official notice is received at the Department of State that any amendment proposed to the Constitution of the United States has been adopted, according to the provisions of the Constitution, the Secretary of State shall forthwith cause the amendment to be published, with his certificate, specifying the States by which the same may have been adopted, and that the same has become valid, to all intents and purposes, as a part of the Constitution of the United States'.27 \n\n[307 \nU.S. 433, 451]\n\u00a0\n The statute presupposes official notice to the Secretary of State when a state legislature has adopted a resolution of ratification. We see no warrant for judicial interference with the performance of that duty. See Leser v. Garnett, supra, 258 U.S. at page 137, 42 S.Ct. at page 217.\n\n\n 2. \nThe more serious question is whether the proposal by the Congress of the Amendment had lost its vitality through lapse of time and hence it could not be ratified by the Kansas legislature in 1937. The argument of petitioners stresses the fact that nearly thirteen years elapsed between the proposal in 1924 and the ratification in question. It is said that when the amendment was proposed there was a definitely adverse popular sentiment and that at the end of 1925 there had been rejection by both houses of the legislatures of sixteen States and ratification by only four States, and that it was not until about 1933 that an aggressive campaign was started in favor of the amendment. In reply, it is urged that Congress did not fix a limit of time for ratification and that an unreasonably long time had not elapsed since the submission; that the conditions which gave rise to the amendment had not been eliminated; that the prevalence of child labor, the diversity of state laws and the disparity in their administration, with the resulting competitive inequalities, continued to exist. Reference is also made to the fact that a number of the States have treated the amendment as still pending and that in the proceedings of the national government there have been indications of the same view. \n28\n It is said that there were fourteen ratifications in 1933, four in 1935, one in 1936, and three in 1937. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 433, 452]\n\u00a0\n We have held that the Congress in proposing an amendment may fix a reasonable time for ratification. Dillon v. Gloss, \n256 \nU.S. 368\n, 41 S.Ct. 510. There we sustained the action of the Congress in providing in the proposed Eighteenth Amendment that it should be inoperative unless ratified within seven years. \n29\n No limitation of time for ratification is provided in the instant case either in the proposed amendment or in the resolution of submission. But petitioners contend that, in the absence of a limitation by the Congress, the Court can and should decide what is a reasonable period within which ratification may be had. We are unable to agree with that contention.\n It is true that in Dillon v. Gloss, supra, the Court said that nothing was found in Article V which suggested that an amendment once proposed was to be open to ratification for all time, or that ratification in some States might be separated from that in others by many years and yet be effective; that there was a strong suggestion to the contrary in that proposal and ratification were but succeeding steps in a single endeavor; that as amendments were deemed to be prompted by necessity, they should be considered and disposed of presently; and that there is a fair implication that ratification must be sufficiently contemporaneous in the required number of States to reflect the will of the people in all sections at relatively the same period; and hence that ratification must be within some reasonable time after the proposal. These considerations were cogent reasons for the decision in Dillon v. Gloss, supra, that the Congress had the power to fix a reasonable time for ratification. But it does not follow that, whenever Congress has not exercised that power, the Court should take upon itself the responsibility of deciding what con- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 433, 453]\n\u00a0\n stitutes a reasonable time and determine accordingly the validity of ratifications. That question was not involved in Dillon v. Gloss, supra, and, in accordance with familiar principle, what was there said must be read in the light of the point decided.\n Where are to be found the criteria for such a judicial determination? None are to be found in Constitution or statute. In their endeavor to answer this question petitioners' counsel have suggested that at least two years should be allowed; that six years would not seem to be unreasonably long; that seven years had been used by the Congress as a reasonable period; that one year, six months and thirteen days was the average time used in passing upon amendments which have been ratified since the first ten amendments; that three years, six months and twenty-five days has been the longest time used in ratifying. To this list of variables, counsel add that 'the nature and extent of publicity and the activity of the public and of the legislatures of the several States in relation to any particular proposal should be taken into consideration'. That statement is pertinent, but there are additional matters to be examined and weighed. When a proposed amendment springs from a conception of economic needs, it would be necessary, in determining whether a reasonable time had elapsed since its submission, to consider the economic conditions prevailing in the country, whether these had so far changed since the submission as to make the proposal no longer responsive to the conception which inspired it or whether conditions were such as to intensify the feeling of need and the appropriateness of the proposed remedial action. In short, the question of a reasonable time in many cases would involve, as in this case it does involve, an appraisal of a great variety of relevant conditions, political, social and economic, which can hardly be said to be within the appropriate range of evidence receivable in a court of justice \n\n[307 \nU.S. 433, 454]\n\u00a0\n and as to which it would be an extravagant extension of judicial authority to assert judicial notice as the basis of deciding a controversy with respect to the validity of an amendment actually ratified. On the other hand, these conditions are appropriate for the consideration of the political departments of the Government. The questions they involve are essentially political and not justiciable. They can be decided by the Congress with the full knowledge and appreciation ascribed to the national legislature of the political, social and economic conditions which have prevailed during the period since the submission of the amendment.\n Our decision that the Congress has the power under Article V to fix a reasonable limit of time for ratification in proposing an amendment proceeds upon the assumption that the question, what is a reasonable time, lies within the congressional province. If it be deemed that such a question is an open one when the limit has not been fixed in advance, we think that it should also be regarded as an open one for the consideration of the Congress when, in the presence of certified ratifications by three- fourths of the States, the time arrives for the promulgation of the adoption of the amendment. The decision by the Congress, in its control of the action of the Secretary of State, of the question whether the amendment had been adopted within a reasonable time would not be subject to review by the courts.\n It would unduly lengthen this opinion to attempt to review our decisions as to the class of questions deemed to be political and not justiciable. In determining whether a question falls within that category, the appropriateness under our system of government of attributing finality to the action of the political departments and also the lack of satisfactory criteria for a judicial determina- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 433, 455]\n\u00a0\n tion are dominant considerations. \n30\n There are many illustrations in the filed of our conduct of foreign relations, where there are 'considerations of policy, considerations of extreme magnitude, and certainly entirely incompetent to the examination and decision of a court of justice'. Ware v. Hylton, 3 Dall. 199, 260.31 Questions involving similar considerations are found in the government of our internal affairs. Thus, under Article IV, section 4, of the Constitution, U.S.C.A. providing that the United States 'shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government', we have held that it rests with the Congress to decide what government is the established one in a State and whether or not it is republican in form. Luther v. Borden, 7 How. 1, 42. In that case Chief Justice Taney observed that 'when the senators and representatives of a State are admitted into the councils of the Union, the authority of the government under which they are appointed, as well as its republican character, is recognized by the proper constitutional authority. And its decision is binding on every other department of the government, and could not be questioned in a judicial tribunal'. So, it was held in the same case that under the provision of the same Article for the protection of each of the States 'against domestic violence' it rested with the Congress 'to determine upon the means proper to be adopted to fulfill this guarantee'. Id., 7 How. at page 43. So, in Pacific Telephone Company v. Oregon, \n223 \nU.S. 118\n, 32 S.Ct. 224, 231, we considered that questions arising under the guaranty of \n\n[307 \nU.S. 433, 456]\n\u00a0\n a republican form of government had long since been 'definitely determined to be political and governmental' and hence that the question whether the government of Oregon had ceased to be republican in form because of a constitutional amendment by which the people reserved to themselves power to propose and enact laws independent of the legislative assembly and also to approve or reject any act of that body, was a question for the determination of the Congress. It would be finally settled when the Congress admitted the senators and representatives of the State.\n For the reasons we have stated, which we think to be as compelling as those which underlay the cited decisions, we think that the Congress in controlling the promulgation of the adoption of a constitutional amendment has the final determination of the question whether by lapse of time its proposal of the amendment had lost its vitality prior to the required ratifications. The state officials should not be restrained from certifying to the Secretary of State the adoption by the legislature of Kansas of the resolution of ratification.\n As we find no reason for disturbing the decision of the Supreme Court of Kansas in denying the mandamus sought by petitioners, its judgment is affirmed but upon the grounds stated in this opinion.\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Concurring opinion by Mr. Justice BLACK, in which Mr. Justice ROBERTS, Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER and Mr. Justice DOUGLAS join.\n Although, for reasons to be stated by Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER, we believe this cause should be dismissed, the ruling of the Court just announced removes from the case the question of petitioners' standing to sue. Under the compulsion of that ruling,1 Mr. Justice ROBERTS, \n\n[307 \nU.S. 433, 457]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER, Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and I have participated in the discussion of other questions considered by the Court and we concur in the result reached, but for somewhat different reasons.\n The Constitution grants Congress exclusive power to control submission of constitutional amendments. Final determination by Congress that ratification by three-fourths of the States has taken place 'is conclusive upon the courts.' 2 In the exercise of that power, Congress, of course, is governed by the Constitution. However, whether submission, intervening procedure or Congressional determination of ratification conforms to the commands of the Constitution, call for decisions by a 'political department' of questions of a type which this Court has frequently designated 'political.' And decision of a 'political question' by the 'political department' to which the Constitution has committed it 'conclusively binds the judges, as well as all other officers, citizens, and subjects of ... government.' \n3\n Proclamation under authority of Congress that an amendment has been ratified will carry with it a solemn insurance by the Congress that ratification has taken place as the Constitution commands. Upon this assurance a proclaimed amendment must be accepted as a part of the \n\n[307 \nU.S. 433, 458]\n\u00a0\n Constitution, leaving to the judiciary its traditional authority of interpretation. \n4\n To the extent that the Court's opinion in the present case even impliedly assumes a power to make judicial interpretation of the exclusive constitutional authority of Congress over submission and ratification of amendments, we are unable to agree.\n The State court below assumed jurisdiction to determine whether the proper procedure is being followed between submission and final adoption. However, it is apparent that judicial review of or pronouncements upon a supposed limitation of a 'reasonable time' within which Congress may accept ratification; as to whether duly authorized State officials have proceeded properly in ratifying or voting for ratification; or whether a State may reverse its action once taken upon a proposed amendment; and kindred questions, are all consistent only with an ultimate control over the amending process in the courts. And this must inevitably embarrass the course of amendment by subjecting to judicial interference matters that we believe were intrusted by the Constitution solely to the political branch of government.\n The Court here treats the amending process of the Constitution in some respects as subject to judicial construction, in others as subject to the final authority of the Congress. There is no disapproval of the conclusion arrived at in Dillon v. Gloss,5 that the Constitution impliedly requires that a properly submitted amendment must die unless ratified within a 'reasonable time.' Nor does the Court now disapprove its prior assumption of power to make such a pronouncement. And it is not made clear that only Congress has constitutional power to determine if there is any such implication in Article V of the Constitution. On the other hand, the Court's opinion declares that Congress has the exclusive power to \n\n[307 \nU.S. 433, 459]\n\u00a0\n decide the 'political questions' of whether a State whose legislature has once acted upon a proposed amendment may subsequently reverse its position, and whether, in the circumstances of such a case as this, an amendment is dead because an 'unreasonable' time has elapsed. such division between the political and judicial branches of the government is made by Article V which grants power over the amending of the Constitution to Congress alone. Undivided control of that process has been given by the Article exclusively and completely to Congress. The process itself is 'political' in its entirety, from submission until an amendment becomes part of the Constitution, and is not subject to judicial guidance, control or interference at any point.\n Since Congress has sole and complete control over the amending process, subject to no judicial review, the views of any court upon this process cannot be binding upon Congress, and insofar as Dillon v. Gloss, supra, attempts judicially to impose a limitation upon the right of Congress to determine final adoption of an amendment, it should be disapproved. If Congressional determination that an amendment has been completed and become a part of the Constitution is final and removed from examination by the courts, as the Court's present opinion recognizes, surely the steps leading to that condition must be subject to the scrutiny, control and appraisal of none save the Congress, the body having exclusive power to make that final determination.\n Congress, possessing exclusive power over the amending process, cannot be bound by and is under no duty to accept the pronouncements upon that exclusive power by this Court or by the Kansas courts. Neither State nor Federal courts can review that power. Therefore, any judicial expression amounting to more than mere acknowledgment of exclusive Congressional power over the political process of amendment is a mere admonition to \n\n[307 \nU.S. 433, 460]\n\u00a0\n the Congress in the nature of an advisory opinion, given wholly without constitutional authority.\n\n Opinion of Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER.\n It is the view of Mr. Justice ROBERTS, Mr. Justice BLACK, Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and myself that the petitioners have no standing in this Court.\n In endowing this Court with 'judicial Power' the Constitution presupposed an historic content for that phrase and relied on assumption by the judiciary of authority only over issues which are appropriate for disposition by judges. The Constitution further explicitly indicated the limited area within which judicial action was to move-however far-reaching the consequences of action within that area-by extending 'judicial Power' only to 'Cases' and 'Controversies'. Both by what they said and by what they implied, the framers of the Judiciary Article gave merely the outlines of what were to them the familiar operations of the English judicial system and its manifestations on this side of the ocean before the Union. Judicial power could come into play only in matters that were the traditional concern of the courts at Westminster and only if they arose in ways that to the expert feel of lawyers constituted 'Cases' or 'Controversies.' It was not for courts to meddle with matters that require no subtlety to be identified as political issues. \n1\n And even as to the kinds of questions which were the staple of judicial business, it was not for courts to pass upon them as abstract, intellectual problems but only if a concrete, living contest between adversaries called for the arbitrament of law. Compare Muskrat v. United States, \n219 \nU.S. 346\n, 31 S. Ct. 250; Tutun v. United States, \n270 \nU.S. 568\n, 46 S.Ct. 425; Willing Chi- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 433, 461]\n\u00a0\n cago Auditorium Ass'n, \n277 \nU.S. 274\n, 48 S.Ct. 507; Nashville, C. & St. L. Ry. v. Wallace, \n288 \nU.S. 249\n, 53 S.Ct. 345, 87 A. L.R. 1191.\n As abstractions, these generalities represent common ground among judges. Since, however, considerations governing the exercise of judicial power are not mechanical criteria but derive from conceptions regarding the distribution of governmental powers in their manifold, changing guises, differences in the application of canons of jurisdiction have arisen from the beginning of the Court's history. \n2\n Conscious or unconscious leanings toward the serviceability of the judicial process in the adjustment of public controversies clothed in the form of private litigation inevitably affect decisions. For they influence awareness in recognizing the relevance of conceded doctrines of judicial self-limitation and rigor in enforcing them.\n Of all this, the present controversy furnishes abundant illustration. Twenty-one members of the Kansas Senate and three members of its House of Representatives brought an original mandamus proceeding in the Supreme Court of that State to compel the Secretary of its Senate to erase an endorsement on Kansas 'Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 3' of January 1937, to the effect that it had been passed by the Senate, and instead to endorse thereon the words 'not passed.' They also sought to restrain the officers of both Senate and House from authenticating and delivering it to the Governor of the State for transmission to the Secretary of State of the United States. These Kansas legislators resorted to their Supreme Court claiming that there was no longer an amendment open for ratification by Kansas and that, in any event, it had not been ratified by the 'legislature' of \n\n[307 \nU.S. 433, 462]\n\u00a0\n Kansas, the constitutional organ for such ratification. See Article V of the Constitution of the United States. The Kansas Supreme Court held that the Kansas legislators had a right to its judgment on these claims, but on the merits decided against them and denied a writ of mandamus. Urging that such denial was in derogation of their rights under the Federal Constitution, the legislators, having been granted certiorari to review the Kansas judgment, Coleman v. Miller, \n303 \nU.S. 632\n, 58 S.Ct. 758, ask this Court to reverse it.\n Our power to do so is explicitly challenged by the United States as amicus curiae, but would in any event have to be faced. See Mansfield C. & L.M. Ry. v. Swan, \n111 \nU.S. 379, 382\n, 4 S.Ct. 510, 511. To whom and for what causes the courts of Kansas are open are matters for Kansas to determine. 3 But Kansas can not define the contours of the authority of the federal courts, and more particularly of this Court. It is our ultimate responsibility to determine who may invoke our judgment and under what circumstances. Are these members of the Kansas legislature, therefore, entitled to ask us to adjudicate the grievances of which they complain?\n It is not our function, and it is beyond our power, to write legal essays or to give legal opinions, however solemnly requested and however great the national emergency. See the correspondence between Secretary of State Jefferson and Chief Justice Jay, 3 Johnson, Correspondence and Public Papers of John Jay, 486-89. Unlike the role allowed to judges in a few state courts and to the Supreme Court of Canada, our exclusive business is litigation. \n4\n The requisites of litigation are not satisfied \n\n[307 \nU.S. 433, 463]\n\u00a0\n when questions of constitutionality though conveyed through the outward forms of a conventional court proceeding do not bear special relation to a particular litigant. The scope and consequences of our doctrine of judicial review over executive and legislative action \n\n[307 \nU.S. 433, 464]\n\u00a0\n should make us observe fastidiously the bounds of the litigious process within which we are confined. \n5\n No matter how seriously infringement of the Constitution may be called into question, this is not the tribunal for its challenge except by those who have some specialized interest of their own to vindicate, apart from a political concern which belongs to all. Stearns v. Wood, \n236 \nU.S. 75\n, 35 S.Ct. 229; Fairchild v. Hughes, \n258 \nU.S. 126\n, 42 S.Ct. 274.\n In the familiar language of jurisdiction, these Kansas legislators must have standing in this Court. What is their distinctive claim to be here, not possessed by every Kansan? What is it that they complain of, which could not be complained of here by all their fellow citizens? The answer requires analysis of the grievances which they urge.\n They say that it was beyond the power of the Kansas legislature, no matter who voted or how, to ratify the Child Labor Amendment because for Kansas there was no Child Labor Amendment to ratify. Assuming that an amendment proposed by the Congress dies of inanition after what is to be deemed a 'reasonable' time, they claim that, having been submitted in 1924, the proposed Child Labor Amendment was no longer alive in 1937. Or, if alive, it was no longer so for Kansas because, by a prior resolution of rejection in 1925, Kansas had exhausted her power. In no respect, however, do these objections relate to any secular interest that pertains to these Kansas legislators apart from interests that belong to the entire commonalty of Kansas. The fact that these legislators are part of the ratifying mechanism while the ordinary citizen of Kansas is not, is wholly irrelevant to this issue. On this aspect of the case the problem would be exactly the same if all but one legislator had voted for ratification. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 433, 465]\n\u00a0\n Indeed the claim that the Amendment was dead or that it was not longer open to Kansas to ratify, is not only not an interest which belongs uniquely to these Kansas legislators; it is not even an interest special to Kansas. For it is the common concern of every citizen of the United States whether the Amendment is still alive, or whether Kansas could be included among the necessary 'three-fourths of the several States.'\n These legislators have no more standing on these claims of unconstitutionality to attack 'Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 3' than they would have standing here to attack some Kansas statute claimed by them to offend the Commerce Clause, U.S.C.A.Const. art. 1,  8, cl. 3. By as much right could a member of the Congress who had voted against the passage of a bill because moved by constitutional scruples urge before this Court our duty to consider his arguments of unconstitutionality.\n Clearly a Kansan legislator would have no standing had be brought suit in a federal court. Can the Kansas Supreme Court transmute the general interest in these constitutional claims into the individualized legal interest indispensable here? No doubt the bounds of such legal interest have a penumbra which gives some freedom in judging fulfillment of our jurisdictional requirements. The doctrines affecting standing to sue in the federal courts will not be treated as mechanical yardsticks in assessing state court ascertainments of legal interest brought here for review. For the creation of vast domain of legal interests is in the keeping of the states, and from time to time state courts and legislators give legal protection to new individual interests. Thus, while the ordinary state taxpayer's suit is not recognized in the federal courts, it affords adequate standing for review of state decisions when so recognized by state courts. Coyle v. Smith, \n221 \nU.S. 559\n, 31 S.Ct. 688; Heim v. McCall, \n239 \nU.S. 175\n, 36 S.Ct. 78, Ann.Cas.1917B, 287. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 433, 466]\n\u00a0\n But it by no means follows that a state court ruling on the adequacy of legal interest is binding here. Thus, in Tyler v. Judges of the Court of Registration, \n179 \nU.S. 405\n, 21 S.Ct. 206, the notion was rejected that merely because the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts found an interest of sufficient legal significance for assailing a statute, this Court must consider such claim. Again, this Court has consistently held that the interest of a state official in vindicating the Constitution of the United States gives him no legal standing here to attack the constitutionality of a state statute in order to avoid compliance with it. Smith v. Indiana, \n191 \nU.S. 138\n, 24 S.Ct. 51; Braxton County Court v. West Virginia, \n208 \nU.S. 192\n, 28 S.Ct. 275; Marshall v. Dye, \n231 \nU.S. 250\n, 34 S.Ct. 92; Stewart v. Kansas City, \n239 \nU.S. 14\n, 36 S.Ct. 15 Nor can recognition by a state court of such an undifferentiated, general interest confer jurisdiction on us. Columbus & Greenville Ry. v. Miller, \n283 \nU.S. 96\n, 51 S.Ct. 392, reversing Miller v. Columbus & Greenville Ry., 154$ Miss. 317, 122 So. 366. Contrariwise, of course, an official has a legally recognized duty to enforce a statute which he is charged with enforcing. And so, an official who is obstructed in the performance of his duty under a state statute because his state court found a violation of the United States Constitution may, since the Act of December 23, 1914, 38 Stat. 790, ask this Court to remove the fetters against enforcement of his duty imposed by the state court because of an asserted misconception of the Constitution. Such a situation is represented by Blodgett v. Silberman, \n277 \nU.S. 1\n, 48 S.Ct. 410, and satisfied the requirement of legal interest in Boynton v. Hutchinson, \n291 \nU.S. 656\n, 54 S.Ct. 457, certiorari dismissed on another ground in \n292 \nU.S. 601\n, 54 S.Ct. 639.6 \n\n[307 \nU.S. 433, 467]\n\u00a0\n We can only adjudicate an issue as to which there is a claimant before us who has a special, individualized stake in it. One who is merely the self-constituted spokesman of a constitutional point of view can not ask us to pass on it. The Kansas legislators could not bring suit explicitly on behalf of the people of the United States to determine whether Kansas could still vote for the Child Labor Amendment. They can not gain standing here by having brought such a suit in their own names. Therefore, none of the petitioners can here raise questions concerning the power of the Kansas legislature to ratify the Amendment.\n This disposes of the standing of the three members of the lower house who seek to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court. They have no standing here. Equally with \n\n[307 \nU.S. 433, 468]\n\u00a0\n out litigious standing is the member of the Kansas Senate who voted for 'Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 3'. He cannot claim that his vote was denied any parliamentary efficacy to which it was entitled. There remains for consideration only the claim of the twenty nay voting senators that the Lieutenant-Governor or Kansas, the presiding officer of its Senate, had, under the Kansas Constitution, no power to break the tie in the senatorial vote on the Amendment, thereby depriving their votes of the effect of creating such a tie. Whether this is the tribunal before which such a question can be raised by these senators must be determined even before considering whether the issue which they pose is justiciable. For the latter involves questions affecting the distribution of constitutional power which should be postponed to preliminary questions of legal standing to sue. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 433, 469]\n\u00a0\n The right of the Kansas senators to be here is rested on recognition by Leser v. Garnett, \n258 \nU.S. 130\n, 42 S.Ct. 217, of a voter's right to protect his franchise. The historic source of this doctrine and the reasons for it were explained in Nixon v. Herndon, \n273 \nU.S. 536, 540\n, 47 S.Ct. 446. That was an action for $5,000 damages against the Judges of Elections for refusing to permit the plaintiff to vote at a primary election in Texas. In disposing of the objection that the plaintiff had no cause of action because the subject matter of the suit was political, Mr. Justice Holmes thus spoke for the Court: 'Of course the petition concerns political action but it alleges and seeks to recover for private damage. That private damage may be caused by such political action and may be recovered for in a suit at law hardly has been doubted for over two hundred years, since Ashby v. White, 2 Ld. Raym. 938, 3 Ld.Raym. 320, and has been recognized by this Court.' 'Private damage' is the clue to the famous ruling in Ashby v. White, supra, and determines its scope as well as that of cases in this Court of which it is the justification. The judgment of Lord Holt is permeated with the conception that a voter's franchise is a personal right, assessable in money damages, of which the exact amount 'is peculiarly appropriate for the determination of a jury', see Wiley v. Sinkler, \n179 \nU.S. 58, 65\n, 21 S. Ct. 17, 20, and for which there is no remedy outside the law courts. 'Although this matter relates to the parliament,' said Lord Holt, 'yet it is an injury precedaneous to the parliament, as my Lord Hale said in the case of Bernardiston v. Soame, 2 Lev. 114, 116. The parliament cannot judge of this injury, nor give damage to the plaintiff for it: they cannot make him a recompense.' 2 Ld.Raym. 938, 958.\n The reasoning of Ashby v. White and the practice which has followed it leave intra-parliamentary controversies to parliaments and outside the scrutiny of law courts. The procedures for voting in legislative assem- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 433, 470]\n\u00a0\n blies-who are members, how and when they should vote, what is the requisite number of votes for different phases of legislative activity, what votes were cast and how they were counted-surely are matters that not merely concern political action but are of the very essence of political action, if 'political' has any connotation at all. Field v. Clark, \n143 \nU.S. 649, 670\n, 12 S.Ct. 495, et seq.; Leser v. Garnett, \n258 \nU.S. 130, 137\n, 42 S.Ct. 217. In no sense are they matters of 'private damage'. They pertain to legislators not as individuals but as political representatives executing the legislative process. To open the law courts to such controversies is to have courts sit in judgment on the manifold disputes engendered by procedures for voting in legislative assemblies. If the doctrine of Ashby v. White vindicating the private rights of a voting citizen has not been doubted for over two hundred years, it is equally significant that for over two hundred years Ashby v. White has not been sought to be put to purposes like the present. In seeking redress here these Kansas senators have wholly misconceived the functions of this Court. The writ of certiorari to the Kansas Supreme Court should therefore be dismissed.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER, dissenting.\n The Child Labor Amendment was proposed in 1924; more than 13 years elapsed before the Kansas legislature voted, as the decision just announced holds, to ratify it. Petitioners insist that more than a reasonable time had elapsed and that, therefore, the action of the state legislature is without force. But this Court now holds that the question is not justiciable, relegates it to the 'consideration of the Congress when, in the presence of certified ratifications by three-fourths of the States the time arrives for the promulgation of the adoption of the amendment' and declares that the decision by Congress would not be subject to review by the courts. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 433, 471]\n\u00a0\n In Dillon v. Gloss, \n256 \nU.S. 368\n, 41 S.Ct. 510, 511, one imprisoned for transportation of intoxicating liquor in violation of  3 of the National Prohibition Act, instituted habeas corpus proceedings to obtain his release on the ground that the Eighteenth Amendment was invalid because the resolution proposing it declared that it should not be operative unless ratified within seven years. The Amendment was ratified in less than a year and a half. We definitely held that Article V impliedly requires amendments submitted to be ratified within a reasonable time after proposal; that Congress may fix a reasonable time for ratification, and that the period of seven years fixed by the Congress was reasonable.\n We said:\n'It will be seen that this article says nothing about the time within which ratification may be had-neither that it shall be unlimited nor that it shall be fixed by Congress. What then is the reasonable inference or implication? Is it that ratification may be had at any time, as within a few years, a century or even a longer period; or that it must be had within some reasonable period which Congress is left free to define? ...\n\n'We do not find anything in the article which suggests that an amendment once proposed is to be open to ratification for all time, or that ratification in some of the states may be separated from that in others by many years and yet be effective. We do find that which strongly suggests the contrary. First, proposal and ratification are not treated as unrelated acts, but as succeeding steps in a single endeavor, the natural inference being that they are not to be widely separated in time. Secondly, it is only when there is deemed to be a necessity therefor that amendments are to be proposed, the reasonable implication being that when proposed they are to be considered and disposed of presently. Thirdly, as ratification is but the expression of the approbation of the people and is to be effective when had in three-fourths of the \n\n[307 \nU.S. 433, 472]\n\u00a0\n states, there is a fair implication that it must be sufficiently contemporaneous in that number of states to reflect the will of the people in all sections at relatively the same period, which of course ratification scattered through a long series of years would not do. These considerations and the general purport and spirit of the article lead to the conclusion expressed by Judge Jameson (in his Constitutional Conventions, 4th ed.  585) 'that an alteration of the Constitution proposed to-day has relation to the sentiment and the felt needs of to-day, and that, if not ratified early while that sentiment may fairly be supposed to exist, it ought to be regarded as waived, and not again to be voted upon, unless a second time proposed by Congress.' That this is the better conclusion becomes even more manifest when what is comprehended in the other view is considered; for, according to it, four amendments proposed long ago-two in 1789, one in 1810 and one in 1861-are still pending and in a situation where their ratification in some of the states many years since by representatives of generations now largely forgotten may be effectively supplemented in enough more states to make three- fourths by representatives of the present or some future generation. To that view few would be able to subscribe, and in our opinion it is quite untenable. We conclude that the fair inference or implication from article 5 is that the ratification must be within some reasonable time after the proposal.\n\n'Of the power of Congress, keeping within reasonable limits, to fix a definite period for the ratification we entertain no doubt. ... Whether a definite period for ratification shall be fixed, so that all may know what it is and speculation on what is a reasonable time may be avoided, is, in our opinion, a matter of detail which Congress may determine as an incident of its power to designate the mode of ratification. It is not questioned that seven years, the period fixed in this instance, was reason- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 433, 473]\n\u00a0\n able, if power existed to fix a definite time; nor could it well be questioned considering the periods within which prior amendments were ratified.'\n\n Upon the reasoning of our opinion in that case, I would hold that more than a reasonable time had elapsed* and \n\n[307 \nU.S. 433, 474]\n\u00a0\n that the judgment of the Kansas supreme court should be reversed.\n The point, that the question-whether more than a reasonable time had elapsed-is not justiciable but one for Congress after attempted ratification by the requisite number of States, was not raised by the parties or by the United States appearing as amicus curiae; it was not suggested by us when ordering reargument. As the Court, in the Dillon case, did directly decide upon the reasonableness of the seven years fixed by the Congress, it ought not now, without hearing argument upon the point, hold itself to lack power to decide whether more than 13 years between proposal by Congress and attempted ratification by Kansas is reasonable.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS joins in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The text of the proposed amendment is as follows (43 Stat. 670):\n'Section 1. The Congress shall have power to limit, regulate, and prohibit the labor of persons under eighteen years of age.\n\n'Sec. 2. The power of the several States is unimpaired by this article except that the operation of State laws shall be suspended to the extent necessary to give effect to legislation enacted by the Congress'. \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The state court said on this point:\n'At the threshold we are confronted with the question raised by the defendants as to the right of the plaintiffs to maintain this action. It appears that on March 30, 1937, the State Senate adopted a resolution directing the Attorney General to appear for the State of Kansas in this action. It further appears that on April 3, 1937, on application of the Attorney General, an order was entered making the State of Kansas a party defendant. The state being a party to the proceedings, we think the right of the parties to maintain the action is beyond question. G.S.1935, 75-702; State ex rel. v.

As to advisory opinions in Canada, see Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney- General for Canada (1912) A.C. 571. Speaking of the Canadian system, Lord Chancellor Haldane, in Attorney General for British Columbia v. Attorney General for Canada (1914) A.C. 153, 162, said: 'It is at times attended with inconveniences, and it is not surprising that the Supreme Court of the United States should have steadily refused to adopt a similar procedure, and should have confined itself to adjudication on the legal rights of litigants in actual controversies.' For further animadversions on advisory pronouncements by judges, see Lord Chancellor Sankey in In re The Regulation and Control of Aeronautics in Canada (1932) A.C. 54, 66: 'We sympathize with the view expressed at length by Newcombe, J., which was concurred in by the Chief Justice (of Canada) as to the difficulty which the Court must experience in endeavoring to answer questions put to it in this way.' \n Australia followed our Constitutional practice in restricting her courts to litigious business. The experience of English history which lay behind it was thus put in the Australian Constitutional Convention by Mr. ( later Mr. Justice) Higgins: 'I feel strongly that it is most inexpedient to break in on the established practice of the English law, and secure decisions on facts which have not arisen yet. Of course, it is a matter that lawyers have experience of every day, that a judge does not give the same attention, he can not give that same attention, to a suppositious case as when he feels the pressure of the consequences to a litigant before him. ... But here is an attempt to allow this High Court, before cases have arisen, to make a pronouncement upon the law at will be binding. I think the imagination of judges, like that of other persons, is limited, and they are not able to put before their minds all the complex circumstances which may arise and which they ought to have in their minds when giving a decision. If there is one thing more than another which is recognized in British jurisprudence it is that a judge never gives a decision until the facts necessary for that decision have arisen.' Rep.Nat. Austral.Conv.Deb. (1897) 966-67. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] See the series of cases beginning with Hayburn's Case, 2 Dall. 409, through United States v. West Virginia, \n295 \nU.S. 463\n, 55 S.Ct. 789. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] A quick summary of the jurisdiction of this Court over state court decisions leaves no room for doubt that the fact that the present case is here on certiorari is wholly irrelevant to our assumption of jurisdiction. Section 25 of the First Judiciary Act gave reviewing power to this Court only over state court decisions denying a claim of federal right. This restriction was, of course, born of fear of disobedience by the state judiciaries of national authority. The Act of September 6, 1916, 39 Stat. 726, withdrew from this obligatory jurisdiction cases where the state decision was against a 'title, right, privilege, or immunity' claimed to exist under the Constitution, laws, treaties or authorities of the United States. This change, which was inspired mainly by a desire to eliminate from review as of right of cases arising under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, 45 U.S.C.A.  51 et seq., left such review only in cases where the validity of a treaty, statute or authority of the United States was drawn into question and the decision was against the validity, and in cases where the validity of a statute of a state or a state authority was drawn into question on the grounds of conflict with federal law and the decision was in favor of its validity. \n The Act of February 13, 1925, 43 Stat. 936, 937, extended this process of restricting our obligatory jurisdiction by transferring to review by certiorari cases in which the state court had held invalid an 'authority' claimed to be exercised under the laws of the United States or in which it had upheld, against claims of invalidity on federal grounds, an 'authority' exercised under the laws of the states. Neither the terms of these two restrictions nor the controlling comments in committee reports or by members of this, Court who had a special share in promoting the Acts of 1916 and 1925, give any support for believing that by contracting the range of obligatory jurisdiction over state adjudications Congress enlarged the jurisdiction of the Court by removing the established requirement of legal interest as a threshold condition to being here.\n Nor does the Act of December 23, 1914, 38 Stat. 790, touch the present problem. By that Act, Congress for the first time gave this Court power to review state court decisions sustaining a federal right. For this purpose it made certiorari available. The Committee reports and the debates on this Act prove that its purpose was merely to remove the unilateral quality of Supreme Court review of state court decisions on constitutional questions as to which this Court has the ultimate say. The Act did not create a new legal interest as a basis of review here; it built on the settled doctrine that an official has a legally recognizable duty to carry out a statute which he is supposed to enforce.\n Thus, prior to the Act of 1914, the Kentucky case, Chandler v. Wise, \n307 \nU.S. 474\n, 59 S.Ct. 992, 83 L.Ed. --, could not have come here at all, and prior to 1916, the Kansas case would have come here, if at all, by writ of error. By allowing cases from state courts which previously could not have come here at all to come here on certiorari the Act of 1914 merely lifted the previous bar-that a federal claim had been sustained-but left every other requisite of jurisdiction unchanged. Similarly, no change in these requisites was affected by the Acts of 1916 and 1925 in confining certain categories of litigation from the state courts to our discretionary instead of obligatory reviewing power. \n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Chronology of Child Labor Amendment.\n (A State is said to have 'rejected' when both Houses of its legislature passed resolutions of rejection, and to have 'refused to ratify' when both Houses defeated resolution for ratification.)\n June 2, 1924, Joint Resolution deposited in State Department.

In New York, ratification was defeated in the House in 1935 and 1937, and in the latter year, the Senate passed such a resolution. \n\n\n\n\n","23":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS v. STATE OF MISSOURI(1939)\n\nArgued: Decided: November 6, 1939\n\n\n\n\n[308 \nU.S. 1, 2]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Edward O. Proctor, of Boston, Mass., for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\n\n\n\n[308 \nU.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Harry W. Kroeger, of St. Louis, Mo., for respondents Trustees.\n\n\n\n[308 \nU.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Edward H. Miller, of St. Louis, Mo., for the State of Missouri.\n\n\n\n[308 \nU.S. 1, 13]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Commonwealth of Massachusetts asks leave to file a bill of complaint against the State of Missouri and certain citizens of that State. On return to the order to show cause why lease should not be granted, the respondents, while contesting the claims of Massachusetts, stated that they had no cause to show. The Court set the motion for hearing upon the question whether the Court has jurisdiction to entertain the suit. The com- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 1, 14]\n\u00a0\n plaint and the individual respondents contend that the Court has jurisdiction and the State of Missouri now presents the contrary view.\n The argument for jurisdiction rests upon two grounds, (1) that there is a controversy between two States, and (2) that there is a controversy between a State and citizens of another State. U.S.C.A.Constitution, Article III, section 2, paragraphs 1 and 2.\n The proposed bill of complaint alleges in substance that Madge Barney Blake, domiciled in Massachusetts, died in 1935 leaving an estate in that State of $12,646.02, which has there been administered, and that this estate will be exhausted by costs of administration and federal taxes; that the decedent, while domiciled in Massachusetts, created three trusts of securities of the value (at the time of death) of $1,850,789.77, the trustees being residents of Missouri where the securities are held; that in two of these trusts, embracing the greater part of the securities, the settlor had reserved the right of revocation; that both Massachusetts and Missouri have inheritance tax statutes subjecting to taxation property passing by deed, grant or gift made or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment after the death of the donor; that the Massachusetts statute imposes the tax upon intangibles only when owned by inhabitants of that State; that the Missouri statute exempts from the tax intangibles owned by non-residents who reside in States extending reciprocal provisions to residents of Missouri; that in this instance both States are claiming the exclusive right to impose inheritance taxes upon the trust estates; that Missouri intends to exercise its jurisdiction over the trustees and the property to the exclusion of Massachusetts; that Massachusetts has taken the action required by its statutes to determine the amount of the tax, and to certify it to the persons by whom it is payable, and that there is now due to Massachusetts from the respondent \n\n[308 \nU.S. 1, 15]\n\u00a0\n trustees $137,000, if all the trust estates are taxable, and $127,000 if only the property under the two revocable trusts is taxable; and that the tax cannot be collected from any persons or property in Massachusetts.\n Alleging the absence of adequate remedy save in this Court sitting as a court in equity, the complainant prays that the Court may adjudge whether Massachusetts or Missouri has 'the jurisdiction and lawful right to impose transfer, succession or inheritance taxes' in respect of the several transfers described and to determine that question in favor of Massachusetts. There is also a general prayer for other relief by injunction or otherwise as the Court may deem expedient.\n First.-The proposed bill of complaint does not present a justiciable controversy between the States. To constitute such a controversy, it must appear that the complaining State has suffered a wrong through the action of the other State, furnishing ground for judicial redress, or is asserting a right against the other State which is susceptible of judicial enforcement according to the accepted principles of the common law or equity systems of jurisprudence. Florida v. Mellon, \n273 \nU.S. 12, 16\n, 17 S., 47 S.Ct. 265, 266; Texas v. Florida, \n306 \nU.S. 398, 405\n, 59 S. Ct. 563, 567. Missouri, in claiming a right to recover taxes from the respondent trustees, or in taking proceedings for collection, is not injuring Massachusetts. By the allegations, the property held in Missouri is amply sufficient to answer the claims of both States and recovery by either does not impair the exercise of any right the other may have. It is not shown that there is danger of the depletion of a fund or estate at the expense of the complainant's interest. It is not shown that the tax claims of the two States are mutually exclusive. On the contrary, the validity of each claim is wholly independent of that of the other and, in the light of our recent decisions, may constitutionally be pressed by each State without conflict in point of \n\n[308 \nU.S. 1, 16]\n\u00a0\n fact or law with the decision of the other. Curry v. McCanless, \n307 \nU.S. 357\n, 59 S.Ct. 900, 123 A.L.R. 162; Graves v. Elliott, \n307 \nU.S. 383\n, 59 S.Ct. 913. The question is thus a different one from that presented in Texas v. Florida, supra, where the controlling consideration was that by the law of the several States concerned only a single tax could be laid by a single State, that of the domicile. This was sufficient basis for invoking the equity jurisdiction of the Court, where it also appeared that there was danger that through successful prosecution of the claims of the several States in independent suits enough of the estate would be absorbed to deprive some State of its lawful tax. Texas v. Florida, supra, \n306 \nU.S. 398, 405\n, 406 S., 408, 410, 59 S.Ct. 563, 567, 568, 569.\n Massachusetts urges that a controversy has arisen over the enforcement of the reciprocal provisions of the tax statutes of the two States. It is said that Missouri has enacted reciprocal legislation under which there is exempted from taxation the transfer of intangibles where the transferor at the time of death was a resident of a State which at that time did not impose a transfer or death tax in respect of the intangible property of residents of other States or if the laws of the State of residence contained a reciprocal exemption provision, Missouri Rev.Stat.1929, c. 1, art. 21, sec. 576, Mo.St.Ann.  576, p. 357; and that Massachusetts since 1927, St.1927, c. 156, has granted complete exemption from the inheritance tax to intangible property not belonging to its inhabitants. Mass. General Laws (Ter.Ed.) c. 65, sec. 1. The argument is that Massachusetts and its residents are entitled to the immunity offered by the Missouri statute.\n But, apart from the fact that there is no agreement or compact between the States having constitutional sanction, U.S.C.A.Const. Art. I, sec. 10, par. 3, the enactment by Missouri of the so-called reciprocal legislation cannot be regarded as conferring upon Massachusetts any contractual right. Each State has enacted its legislation ac- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 1, 17]\n\u00a0\n cording to its conception of its own interests. Each State has the unfettered right at any time to repeal its legislation. Each State is competent to construe and apply its legislation in the cases that arise within its jurisdiction. If it be assumed that the statutes of the two States have been enacted with a view to reciprocity in operation, nothing is shown which can be taken to alter their essential character as mere legislation and to create an obligation which either State is entitled to enforce as against the other in a court of justice.\n The suggestion that residents of Massachusetts are entitled to the immunity offered by the Missouri statute is unavailing, as Massachusetts may not invoke our jurisdiction for the benefit of such individuals. Oklahoma v. Atchison, T. & S.F.R. Co., \n220 \nU.S. 277, 286\n, 31 S.Ct. 434, 436; Oklahoma ex rel. Johnson v. Cook, \n304 \nU.S. 387, 394\n, 58 S.Ct. 954, 957\n\n\n Nor does the nature of the suit as one to obtain a declaratory judgment aid the complainant. To support jurisdiction to give such relief, there must still be a controversy in the constitutional sense (AEtna Life Insurance Co. v. Haworth, \n300 \nU.S. 227, 240\n, 241 S., 57 S.Ct. 461, 463, 464, 108 A.L.R. 1000) and as between the two States there is no such controversy here.\n Second.-Complainant urges that jurisdiction may be sustained in the view that the proposed bill of complaint presents a controversy between Massachusetts and citizens of Missouri. The bill is not aptly framed so as to present such a controversy independently of a controversy between the States. The bill expressly states the issues presented as being (a) whether Massachusetts or Missouri has exclusive jurisdiction over the transfers in trust so as to have the taxing power, and (b) secondarily, whether the State having such jurisdiction can constitutionally reach one of the trusts in which the settlor reserved no right of revocation. And the specific relief sought is that the court may determine which State has the jurisdiction to tax and may award that \n\n[308 \nU.S. 1, 18]\n\u00a0\n jurisdiction to Massachusetts as against Missouri. If the gravamen of the proposed bill is deemed to be an assertion of a controversy between the States, jurisdiction to entertain the bill cannot be supported in the absence of the showing of such a controversy. Missouri cannot be brought into court by the expedient of making its citizens parties to a suit otherwise not maintainable against the State.\n With respect to the second ground of invoking jurisdiction, as an independent ground, we are virtually asked to disregard the stated objective of the proposed bill, to treat it as amended so as to expunge claims against Missouri and to confine it to claims against the trustees; to consider the bill as no longer asking a declaratory judgment as to which State has power to tax, as not seeking relief in this court 'sitting as a court of equity', but, in the light of the general prayer for other relief, as presenting a simple action against the trustees to recover the amount of the tax claimed to be due Massachusetts irrespective of any claim of Missouri.\n If it be possible to consider the proposed bill as thus stripped of its abortive allegations against Missouri and as presenting a cause of action so distinct from that primarily relied upon, still the invocation of our jurisdiction must fail. In the exercise of our original jurisdiction so as truly to fulfill the constitutional purpose we not only must look to the nature of the interest of the complaining State-the essential quality of the right asserted-but we must also inquire whether recourse to that jurisdiction in an action by a State merely to recover money alleged to be due from citizens of other States is necessary for the State's protection. In Oklahoma ex rel. Johnson v. Cook, supra, we called attention to the enormous burden which would be imposed upon this Court if by taking title to assets of insolvent state institutions, including claims against citizens of other States, a State could demand access to the origi- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 1, 19]\n\u00a0\n nal jurisdiction of this Court to enforce such claims. To open this Court to actions by States to recover taxes claimed to be payable by citizens of other States, in the absence of facts showing the necessity for such intervention, would be to assume a burden which the grant of original jurisdiction cannot be regarded as compelling this Court to assume and which might seriously interfere with the discharge by this Court of its duty in deciding the cases and controversies appropriately brought before it. We have observed that the broad statement that a court having jurisdiction must exercise it (see Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 404) is not universally true but has been qualified in certain cases where the federal courts may, in their discretion, properly withhold the exercise of the jurisdiction conferred upon them where there is no want of another suitable forum. Canada Malting Co. v. Paterson Co., \n285 \nU.S. 413, 422\n, 52 S.Ct. 413, 415; Rogers v. Guaranty Trust Co., \n288 \nU.S. 123, 130\n, 131 S., 53 S.Ct. 295, 297, 298, 89 A.L.R. 720. Grounds for justifying such a qualification have been found in 'considerations of convenience, efficiency and justice' applicable to particular classes of cases. Rogers v. Guaranty Trust Co., supra. Reasons not less cogent point to the need of the exercise of a sound discretion in order to protect this Court from an abuse of the opportunity to resort to its original jurisdiction in the enforcement by States of claims against citizens of other States.\n In this instance it does not appear that Massachusetts is without a proper and adequate remedy. Chause 2 of Section 2 of Article III merely distributes the jurisdiction conferred by clause one. Louisiana v. Texas, \n176 \nU.S. 1, 16\n, 20 S.Ct. 251, 256; Monaco v. Mississippi, \n292 \nU.S. 313, 321\n, 54 S.Ct. 745, 747. The original jurisdiction of this Court, in cases where a State is a party, 'refers to those cases in which, according to the grant of power made in the preceding clause, jurisdiction might be exercised in consequence of the character of the party, and an original suit might be instituted in any of \n\n[308 \nU.S. 1, 20]\n\u00a0\n the federal courts; not to those cases in which an original suit might not be instituted in a federal court'. Cohens v. Virginia, supra, 6 Wheat. 264, at pages 398, 399. With respect to the character of the claim now urged, we are not advised that Missouri would close its courts to a civil action brought by Massachusetts to recover the tax alleged to be due from the trustees. The Attorney General of Missouri at this bar asserts the contrary. He says that 'it would seem that Massachusetts should be able to bring a suit against the trustees for the collection of its taxes, in either a Missouri state court or in a federal district court in Missouri' and that 'such a suit would be of a civil nature and would present a justiciable case or controversy'. We have said that the objection that the courts in one State will not entertain a suit to recover taxes due to another or upon a judgment for such taxes, is not rightly addressed to any want of judicial power in courts which are authorized to entertain civil suits at law. It goes 'not to the jurisdiction but to the merits', and raises a question which district courts are competent to decide. Milwaukee County v. M. E. White Co., \n296 \nU.S. 268, 272\n, 56 S.Ct. 229, 231.\n The motion for leave to file the proposed bill of complaint is denied. It is so ordered.\n Motion denied.\n Mr. Justice BUTLER took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","24":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCONNECTICUT RY. & LIGHTING CO. v. PALMER(1939)\nNo. 63\nArgued: Decided: January 3, 1939\n\n\n\n\n[305 \nU.S. 493, 494]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Talcott M. Banks, Jr., of Boston, Mass., and George W. Martin, of New York City, for petitioner.\n Messrs. Hermon J. Wells, of New Haven, Conn., and James Garfield, of Boston Mass., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case poses the question of the correct measure of damages allowable to a lessor creditor of a railroad debtor for the rejection of a lease under the reorganization provisions of Section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act. The determination depends upon the meaning of the definitive clause 'to the extent of the actual damage or injury determined in accordance with principles obtaining in equity proceedings.' \n1\n Certiorari was granted, \n305 \nU.S. 584\n, 59 S.Ct. 65, 83 L.Ed. -- under Section 240(a) of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.A.  347(a), because the case involves an important question of federal law which should be settled by this Court.\n On December 19, 1906, the Connecticut Railway and Lighting Company, petitioner here, leased certain gas, electric and street railway properties for 999 years to the Consolidated Railway Company, predecessor of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad Company, hereinafter referred to as the New Haven. By a subsequent assignment the New Haven was divested of everything except the transportation properties involved here. On February 28, 1910, these were transferred to a wholly-owned subsidiary of the New Haven. Some question arose in the reorganization proceedings as to the New \n\n[305 \nU.S. 493, 495]\n\u00a0\n Haven's liability on the 1906 lease after this transfer to its subsidiary. The lower court, however, held the New Haven liable as lessee, and, no attack having been made upon this ruling, we treat, without further consideration, the Connecticut Railway as a lessor and the New Haven as lessee.\n The lease gave the lessor the option to terminate, on default of the lessee, and to repossess the property 'without prejudice to its right of action for arrears of rent or breach of covenant.' It contained no provision for liquidation of damages for breach of the entire lease.\n The New Haven agreed to pay all taxes on the property and on the lessor's income from the property. It also paid $1,049,563.50 annually for the street railways. Of this amount, $504,975 was intended to provide for the payment of interest on the Connecticut Pailway's bonds and for payments into a sinking fund. These interest and sinking fund payments created a claim upon the lessor for the contents of the fund at the date of payment of the bonds. The arrangement looked to the cancellation of the bonds in 1951 by the New Haven's payments, and the issuance by the Connecticut Railway of new bonds in their place. The delivery to it of these bonds, the New Haven agreed, would liquidate its claim for the contents of the sinking fund. In effect the annual reserved rent would then be considerably decreased, for the interest and sinking fund payments would be for its benefit as owner of the new bonds.\n On October 23, 1935, the New Haven filed its petition under Section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act. The petition was approved and the respondents were appointed trustees. On December 18, 1935, they rejected the 1906 lease with the approval of the court. On November 16, 1936, the Connecticut Railway repossessed the street railway properties. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 493, 496]\n\u00a0\n The Connecticut Railway filed claims against the New Haven's estate for numerous items, among them damages for breach of the lease and for deficiencies in property returned. It claims $23,190,314.73 as damages for rejection of the lease. This sum is alleged to be 'the difference between the present worth of rent and of rental value for the balance of the term of the lease, liquidated by discounting at 4%.'\n The District Court held that under Section 77 the lessor is a creditor for actual damages accruing from the rejection of the unexpired lease to the latest practicable date in the reorganization for presentation of lessors' claims. Damages were measured by the difference between the rent reserved in the lease and the net earnings of the property. The court allowed the amount proved up to June 20, 1937, with leave to the Connecticut Railway to apply for further hearings to liquidate damages suffered after that date.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed, approving the trial court's exclusion of any future damage which had not accrued up to the latest possible hearing in the proceedings.\n First. The claim for deficiencies in the property returned to petitioner is not properly before this Court. The petition for certiorari did not include the claim among the questions presented or reasons for the issuance of the writ. It was listed as one of three rulings below. The first related to rent accrued to petition filed, the second to deficiencies in property returned, and the third to damages for rejection of the lease. Nowhere in the petition was there complaint as to the first two items. Clearly the petition sought review solely of the decree in so far as it limited petitioner's claim under Section 77 for damages from rejection of the unexpired lease. As clearly, certiorari was granted to review only the matter which this Court was advised aggrieved petitioner. Johnson v. Manhattan Ry. Co., \n289 \nU.S. 479, 494\n, 53 S.Ct. 721, 726; General Talking Pictures Corp. v. Western Electric Co., \n304 \nU.S. 175\n, 177-179, 58 S.Ct. 849, 850, 851. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 493, 497]\n\u00a0\n Petitioner relies upon Washington, V. & M.C. Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, \n301 \nU.S. 142, 146\n, 57 S.Ct. 648, 649. Neither the language of that case nor the authorities there cited in support of the refusal to review a claim not mentioned give vitality to the suggestion of the petitioner that a mere reference in a petition for certiorari to a ruling, without a request for review, will cause its consideration.\n Second. Under the Bankruptcy Act, prior to the amendment of Section 63a by the Act of June 7, 1934,2 a claim for future rent was not provable. 3 A covenant, however, creating a liability for damages on the filing of a petition in bankruptcy, measured by the difference between the present fair value of the remaining rent and the present fair rental value of the premises for the balance of the term, resulted in a provable claim. \n4\n This condition made for inequality among both creditors and bankrupts, since \n\n[305 \nU.S. 493, 498]\n\u00a0\n recovery by claimants depended upon the artistry with which their leases were drafted and discharged bankrupts were often left with surviving claims for rent, unduly burdensome upon their efforts at self- rehabilitation. \n5\n Everyone interested in bankruptcy problems had long been familiar with the future rent situation and its ramifications into the fields of anticipatory breach of executory contracts and the provability of contingent claims. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n During the years 1933 to 1935 the Congress dealt on several occasions with landlords' claims for future rent. The Act of March 3, 1933, made provision for the relief of individual debtors, agricultural and non- agriculatural, and for railroad reorganization. Section 75 defined creditors thus: 'The term 'creditor' shall include for the purposes of an extension proposal under this section all holders of claims of whatever character against the debtor or his property including a claim for future rent, whether or not such claims would otherwise constitute provable claims under this Act (title). A claim for future rent shall constitute a provable debt and shall be liquidated under section 63(b) of this Act ( section 103(b) of this title).'7 Similarly the railroad reorganization section treated of future rents in sub-sections 77(b), (h) and (j), 11 U.S. C.A.  205(b, h, j), hereafter more fully considered. By the decision of Manhattan Properties v. Irving Trust Company, on January 10, 1934, the difficulties of lessors were sharply emphasized. The Act of June 7, 1934, supplied procedure for corporate reorganization with arrangements permitting the proof of claims for future rent. \n8\n These provisions have been upheld. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n[305 \nU.S. 493, 499]\n\u00a0\n The first provisions for proof of claims for future rent in railroad reorganizations appeared in the Act of March 3, 1933, simultaneously with the broadening of the Bankruptcy Act to include the railroads as debtors. This act included Section 74, 11 U.S.C.A.  202, which enlarged the bankruptcy definition of creditor. For creditors of this type in railroad reorganizations, the enactment was equally broad. \n10\n The legislative history discloses nothing as to the motives which prompted the inclusion of the language. In the \n\n[305 \nU.S. 493, 500]\n\u00a0\n Act of August 27, 1935, 49 Stat. 411, these clauses were amended to read as they now stand but again nothing has been found commenting upon the reasons for their adoption in either the original or present form. Changes of interest here from the 1933 language were proposed by the Federal Coordinator of Transportation,11 but they were not deemed of sufficient importance by him to merit particular comment. The Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives held hearings and reported a bill, based on the Coordinator's draft, with the language, here important, changed to the exact wording of the Act \n\n[305 \nU.S. 493, 501]\n\u00a0\n of August 27, 1935. Nothing which illumines this problem appears in the hearings12 or committee report. \n13\n\u00a0\n\n The portions of the act which we must consider are as follows:\n'(Sec. 77.) Reorganization of railroads ... (b) ... The term 'creditors' shall include ... the holder of a claim under a contract executory in whole or in part including an unexpired lease.\n\n'... In case an executory contract or unexpired lease of property shall be rejected ... any person injured by such non-adoption or rejection shall for all purposes of this section be deemed to be a creditor of the debtor to the extent of the actual damage or injury determined in accordance with principles obtaining in equity proceedings . ...\n\n'(f) ... The property dealt with by the plan, when transferred and conveyed ... shall be free and clear of all claims of the debtor, its stockholders and creditors, and the debtor shall be discharged from its debts and liabilities, ....' 49 Stat. 911, 920, 11 U.S.C.A.  205(b, f).\n\n It is first to be noted that the successive acts of the Congress, on extension of individual debts and corporate and railroad reorganization, are directed generally at the rehabilitation of debtors. \n14\n As one of the means used consistently to accomplish this, claims for future rent are made provable and dischargeable, so that the debtor would not be burdened with the rent obligation after discharge. \n15\n\u00a0\n\n[305 \nU.S. 493, 502]\n\u00a0\n Next, the limitation of the amount of future rent recoverable to one year in Section 4, 11 U.S.C.A.  103, and to three years in Section 1 (section 77B(b)) or the Act of June 7, 1934, 11 U.S.C.A.  207(b), leaves no doubt that the Congress deemed a definite formula advantageous in bankruptcy and general corporate reorganization. Its failure to provide an exact measure in railroad reorganizations shows it was not there considered appropriate. Finally, it seems obvious that the changes of the Committee on the Judiciary in the wording of the Coordinator's draft, by which 'actual' was inserted before 'damage' and 'determined in accordance with principles obtaining in equitable proceedings' added as a guide, were intended to call emphatically to the attention of those administering the reorganization section the requirement that only those damages susceptible of definite proof should be allowed. We cannot read a limitation on damages into the language as enacted. As reorganizations had been traditionally carried on in equity and would be carried on in a bankruptcy court with equity powers, it was natural to add the caluse as to equitable proceedings. Leases were placed upon the same basis as executory contracts.\n The New Haven urges that the reference to 'equitable proceedings' is to receiverships in equity, as such receiverships were mentioned twice in the same subsection. The use of 'equitable proceedings' instead of 'equity receiverships' supports the view that something different was intended. The equitable principle for the allowance of claims for future rent the New Haven finds in Pennsylvania Steel Company v. New York City Railway Company, 2 Cir., 198 F. 721, expressed as follows, pages 741, 742: 'Claims which when presented within the time limited by the court for their presentation are certain or are capable of being made certain by recognized methods of computation, should be allowed. Claims which are not then certain should be disallowed because they afford no basis for making dividends.' \n\n[305 \nU.S. 493, 503]\n\u00a0\n The conclusion of the District Court, as affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, is then offered as the correct rule in this case. That conclusion was summarized by the brief of the New Haven in these words: 'The court thereupon held that damages measured by the difference between the rent reserved and the earnings of the property up to the date of hearing should be allowed, with the further right to the claimant, in common with all other claimants under rejected leases, to apply for a subsequent hearing at the latest practicable date to be determined by the court during the reorganization proceedings for the purpose of proving similar damages up to that date.' Damages for loss of rent which fell due after the latest practicable date for filing claims were thus barred from proof, and under the quoted language of subdivision (f), the right to recover for such injury from the debtor after reorganization was destroyed.\n We are of the opinion that this construction of the statutory provisions for the measurement of damages for loss of future rent is erroneous. Notwithstanding its extended term, the lease created an obligation under the present Bankruptcy Act upon the New Haven entitled to share in its assets upon reorganization on an equality with the claims of other creditors.\n While it could be said that the general rule in equity receiverships was that only accrued damages could be proven, there was no discernible equitable rule for the determination of damages for rejection or nonadoption of an unexpired lease. The actual damages from the breach were not determined. At the most an arbitrary time limit was set on proof. The reference to equity proceedings does not, in our opinion, refer to any rule for the measure of damages in equity receiverships. In their administration of estates, whether railroad or non-railroad, claims for future rents depended for their prova- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 493, 504]\n\u00a0\n bility upon the fact of reentry,16 the existence of a clause for indemnity in case of breach,17 or the incidence of the maturity of the rent claim under the local law. \n18\n\u00a0\n\n The damages recovered by an injured party have always been limited to his 'actual' damages. There is nothing to indicate that the Congress intended to have 'actual' interpreted as 'accrued.' The measure of damages applied by the courts for the breach of a lease, where damages are permitted, is uniform. In William Filene's Sons Co. v. Weed19 and in Kuehner v. Irving Trust Co., 20 this Court said in analogous situations that the measure was the present value of the rent reserved less the present rental value of the remainder of the term. \n21\n The English Bankruptcy Act permits proof of future rents, as any claim is provable which is 'as to mode of valuation, capable of being ascertained by fixed rules or as matter of opinion.' \n22\n The measure of damages is the same. \n23\n The difficulties of proof are well recognized. \n24\n\u00a0\n\n[305 \nU.S. 493, 505]\n\u00a0\n The same rules apply to executory contracts. In Kuehner v. Irving Trust Co. 25 this Court pointed out as one of the reasons for upholding the validity of a statutory formula the uncertainty as to the loss entailed by abrogation of leases, an uncertainty growing greater as the remainder of the term lengthens. 'Testimony as to present rental value,' it was said, 'partakes largely of the character of prophecy ....' A remainder of fourteen years was there involved. Here there is a remainder of 969 years. That lease was for a store in the City of New York. Evidence of the value of unexpired terms of street railway leases would be even more difficult to produce, as possible lessees are limited in number. Since insolvencies are more frequent in economic depressions and since, as a consequence, estimates of the rental value of the remainder of the term are given under subnormal business conditions, the difficulties are multiplied.\n Judges in equitable proceedings will have the advantage of evidence in applying the ususal rules as to the measure of damages. It is well understood that such evidence must show damages to reasonable certainty. Mere 'plausible anticipation' does not merit consideration nor are flights into the realm of pure speculation entitled to be treated as evidence. \n26\n The determination of the amount to be allowed as the damage will be based on evidence which satisfies the mind.\n Third. We comment briefly on two other points raised. The betterments and sinking funds having come into the possession of the lessors by the terms of the lease are not to be considered as offsets against the claim of the lessor. Their possession by the lessor increases the earning power of the assets to the benefit of the lessee. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 493, 506]\n\u00a0\n Since subsection [l] of Section 7727 is general in form and is specifically subordinated to the other provisions of the section, including subsection (b), 11 U.S.C.A.  205(b), Section 63a(9) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A.  103(a)(9), is inapplicable to the present controversy.\n As certiorari was sought and allowed only upon so much of the order of the Circuit Court of Appeals as affected the measure of the lessor's damage for rejection of the lease in question, the order of that court is reversed only in that particular and this case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in accordance with the order and opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals as herein modified and of this Court.\n Reversed in part, and remanded to District Court with directions.\n It is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS is of opinion that the judgment of the court below should be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 49 Stat. 911, 914, 11 U.S.C.A.  205(b). \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 48 Stat. 923-924, 11 U.S.C.A.  103.

WALLACE(1939)\nNo. 275\nArgued: January 4, 1939Decided: January 30, 1939\n\n\n\n\n\n[306 \nU.S. 1, 3]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. J. C. Lanier, of Greenville, N.C., B. S. Royster, Jr., of Oxford, N.C., J. W.

McConnaughey, of Dayton, Ohio, for respondents.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Plaintiffs, tobacco warehousemen and auctioneers in Oxford, North Carolina, seek a declaratory judgment1 that the Tobacco Inspection Act of August 23, 1935,2 is unconstitutional and an injunction against its enforcement. The Circuit Court of Appeals, reversing the District Court,3 sustained the validity of the Act and directed the dismissal of the bill of complaint. 95 F.2d 856. We granted certiorari. October 10, 1938, \n305 \nU.S. 584\n, 59 S.Ct. 91, 83 L.Ed. --.\n The Act states its scope and purpose. Secs. 1, 2. It applies to transactions involving the sale of tobacco at auction as commonly conducted at auction markets. These transactions are carried on by tobacco producers and by persons engaged in the business of buying and selling tobacco in commerce as defined, that is, in commerce which is interstate or foreign or is with or within the Territories or the District of Columbia. \n4\n Congress finds that the \n\n[306 \nU.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n classification of tobacco according to type, grade, and other characteristics affects the prices received; that 'without uniform standards of classification and inspection the evaluation of tobacco is susceptible to speculation, manipulation, and control' and 'unreasonable fluctuations in prices and quality determinations occur', constituting a burden upon commerce; and that the use of uniform standards is imperative 'for the protection of producers and others engaged in commerce and the public interest therein'.\n The Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to investigate the handling, inspection and marketing of tobacco and to establish standards by which its type, grade, size, condition, or other characteristics may be determined and these standards are to be the official standards of the United States, Secs. 3, 4.\n The Secretary is authorized to designate those markets where tobacco bought and sold at auction or the products customarily manufactured therefrom move in commerce. He is not to designate a market unless two- thirds of the growers, voting at a prescribed referendum, favor it. The Act provides that after public notice that a market has been so designated, no tobacco shall be offered for sale at auction thereon until it has been inspected and certified by an authorized representative of the Secretary according to the established standards. There is a proviso that in case competent inspectors are not available or for other reasons the Secretary is unable to provide for such inspection and certification at all auction markets within a type area, he shall first designate those markets where the greatest number of growers may be served with the facilities available. Sec. 5.\n Warehousemen must provide space on warehouse tickets or other tags or labels used by them for showing the grades as determined by an authorized inspector. Sec. 8. The Secretary is authorized to publish and distrib- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n ute, without cost to the grower, timely information on the 'market supply and demand, location, disposition, quality, condition, and market prices'. Sec. 9. Violation of the requirement of inspection and certification at designated markets, is made a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not more than $1000 or imprisonment for not more than one year or both. Sec. 12.\n The market practices which led to this enactment are disclosed by the record. They are described at length in the Report of the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives on the submission of the bill. 5 The growers sort their tobacco for market as best they can. It is tied in bundles or 'hands' and brought to the auction warehouse where it is put in baskets, weighed, and placed in rows on the warehouse floor with a ticket on each pile. The warehousemen auction the tobacco, acting as representatives of the growers and receiving fees at rates fixed by the state law. The auction goes forward with extreme rapidity-about one basket every ten seconds-the auctioneer proceeding along one side of a row and the buyers moving with him. The auction is conducted with a technical vocabulary intelligible only to the initiated, bids being made by well- understood gestures. The sale is not completed until the grower accepts the bid; he may decline the bid and take his tobacco away. The bidders are representatives of tobacco companies and speculators who are experts in grades. \n6\n The Committee reported that 'The possession of grade and price information by the buyers and the lack of it on the part of the growers, places the growers under a severe handicap in the marketing of their tobacco and opens the way to abuses and practices by which farmers are victim- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n ized. ... It is the thought of the committee that if the purchaser needs an expert in grades in order to protect his interest in the sale, the growers should be accorded the same protection'. It also appears from the record that because of the speed of the sale few buyers have the opportunity to make a satisfactory examination of the tobacco and consequently many errors are made, although on the average the buyers are not supposed to suffer seriously. The effect of the methods used is to introduce an unusual degree of uncertainty in the prices which a grower may receive for tobacco of any particular grade.\n Under the operation of the Act federal inspectors examine the tobacco about an hour before the sale. They pull samples from each pile and place tickets indicating the grade. Each day there is displayed in the warehouse a report indicating the average price for the government grades sold on the previous day, and weekly reports are issued for the preceding week.\n The Secretary promulgated regulations to be effective January 2, 1936. Later, official standard grades for flue-cured tobacco were prescribed. The Secretary designated twenty-three markets throughout the country for compulsory inspection and grading. In North Carolina tobacco was marketed on forty auction markets. Three of these, at Oxford, Goldsboro, and Farmville, were designated. \n7\n In view of the lack of expertly trained inspectors and graders, all markets in North Carolina could not be designated and defendants say that the markets above named were selected because in previous years the Department had established at these places voluntary inspection of tobacco under the Farm Products Inspection Act8 and the growers were familiar with the benefits accruing from the federal action. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n In relation to Oxford, the market here in question, the required referendum was had. Upwards of 8,600 ballots were distributed to growers who had sold on that market during the previous season; 1,896 ballots were returned, of which 1,782 were in favor of the designation. There were 248 other ballots returned, of which 96 per cent. were favorable.\n Plaintiffs contend (1) that the transaction of offering tobacco for sale at auction on the warehouse floor is not a transaction in interstate commerce and hence is not subject to congressional regulation; (2) that the Act is invalid because of its discriminatory character; (3) that the Act provides for an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power; and ( 4) that the Act violates the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, Const.U.S.C.A.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals found, and the record supports the finding, that there is an actual controversy between plaintiffs and defendants, entitling plaintiffs to invoke the Declaratory Judgment Act. See Aetna Life Insurance Company v. Haworth, \n300 \nU.S. 227, 240\n, 241 S., 57 S. Ct. 461, 463, 108 A.L.R. 1000\n\n\n First.-Plaintiffs urge that tobacco 'is not inherently an interstate commodity'; that the auction transaction is not a sale as title is not passed until the grower accepts the price; that after the auction the grower may, and often does, reject the bid and he may take his tobacco away; that the inspection required by the Act is done prior to the offering for sale; and that until sale and delivery to the purchaser the tobacco is not in interstate commerce and its control is reserved to the State. These objections are untenable. The record shows that the sales consummated on the Oxford auction market are predominantly sales in interstate and foreign commerce. The principal purchasers are few in number and in the main are engaged in the export trade or in the manufacture of tobacco products in other States. It appears that in a given week, shortly before the beginning of this suit, \n\n[306 \nU.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n approximately 2,000,000 pounds of tobacco were sold on the Oxford market, only 15.3 per cent. of which were definitely destined for manufacture in North Carolina. About 14 per cent. were in part for manufacture in North Carolina and in part for other States, and about 62 per cent. moved directly into foreign commerce. The fact that the growers are not bound to accept bids, and in certain instances reject them, does not remove the auction from its immediate relation to the sales that are consummated upon the offers that the growers do accept. The auction in such cases is manifestly a part of the transaction of sale. So far as the sales are for shipment to other States or to foreign countries, it is idle to contend that they are not sales in interstate or foreign commerce and subject to congressional regulation. Where goods are purchased in one State for transportation to another the commerce includes the purchase quite as much as it does the transportation. Swift & Co. v. United States, \n196 \nU.S. 375, 398\n, 399 S., 25 S.Ct. 276, 280; Dahnke-Walker Milling Co. v. Bondurant, \n257 \nU.S. 282, 290\n, 291 S., 42 S.Ct. 106, 108; Lemke v. Farmers' Grain Co., \n258 \nU.S. 50, 54\n, 42 S.Ct. 244, 246; Stafford v. Wallace, \n258 \nU.S. 495, 519\n, 42 S.Ct. 397, 403, 23 A.L.R. 229; Flanagan v. Federal Coal Co., \n267 \nU.S. 222, 225\n, 45 S.Ct. 233; Shafer v. Farmers' Grain Co., \n268 \nU.S. 189, 198\n, 45 S. Ct. 481, 484; Foster-Fountain Packing Co. v. Haydel, \n278 \nU.S. 1, 10\n, 49 S.Ct. 1, 3.\n There is no permissible constitutional theory which would apply this principle to purchases of livestock as in the Swift and Stafford Cases, and of grain as in the Lemke and Shafer Cases, and deny its application to tobacco. In the Lemke Case (supra, at pages 60, 61, 42 S.Ct. at page 248), condemning the effort of a State to control the buying of grain for shipment to other States, the Court referred to the power of Congress to provide its own regulation for such transactions, saying: 'It is alleged that such legislation is in the interest of the grain growers and essential to protect them from fraudulent purchases, and to secure payment to them of fair prices for the grain actually sold. This \n\n[306 \nU.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n may be true, but Congress is amply authorized to pass measures to protect interstate commerce if legislation of that character is needed'. And again, in the Shafer Case (supra, at pages 188, 199, 45 S.Ct. at page 485), the Court said: 'The right to buy it (grain) for shipment, and to ship it, in interstate commerce, is not a privilege derived from state laws, and which they may fetter with conditions, but is a common right, the regulation of which is committed to Congress and denied to the states by the commerce clause of the Constitution'.\n The fact that intrastate and interstate transactions are commingled on the tobacco market does not frustrate or restrict the congressional power to protect and control what is committed to its own care. As we said in the Shreveport Case, \n234 \nU.S. 342, 351\n, 352 S., 34 S.Ct. 833, 836, with respect to the intrastate rates of interstate carriers- 'Wherever the interstate and intrastate transactions of carriers are so related that the government of the one involves the control of the other, it is Congress, and not the state, that is entitled to prescribe the final and dominant rule, for otherwise Congress would be denied the exercise of its constitutional authority, and the statem, and not the nation, would be supreme within the national field'. See, also, Minnesota Rate Cases, \n230 \nU.S. 352, 399\n, 33 S.Ct. 729, 739, 48 L.R.A.,N.S., 1151, Ann. Cas.1916A, 18; Wisconsin Railroad Commission v. Chicago, B. & Q.R. Co., \n257 \nU.S. 563, 588\n, 42 S.Ct. 232, 237, 22 A.L.R. 1086; Stafford v. Wallace, supra, at page 522, 42 S.Ct. at page 404. Here, the transactions on the tobacco market were conducted indiscriminately at virtually the same time, and in a manner which made it necessary, if the congressional rule were to be applied, to make it govern all the tobacco thus offered for sale.\n Having this authority to regulate the sales on the tobacco market, Congress could prescribe the conditions under which the sales should be made in order to give protection to sellers or purchasers or both. Congress is not to be denied the exercise of its constitutional author- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 1, 12]\n\u00a0\n ity in prescribing regulations merely because these may have the quality of police regulations. It is on that principle that misbranding under the Food and Drugs Act9 embraces false or misleading statements as to the ingredients of commodities or the effects of their use. See Seven Cases v. United States, \n239 \nU.S. 510\n, 36 S.Ct. 190, L.R.A.1916D, 164. Inspection and the establishment of standards for commodities has been regarded from colonial days as appropriate to the regulation of trade, and the authority of the States to enact inspection laws is recognized by the Constitution. Art. 1, sec. 10, cl. 2, U.S.C.A. See Turner v. Maryland, \n107 \nU.S. 38, 39\n, 51 S.-54, 2 S.Ct. 44, 55; Pacific States Company v. White, \n296 \nU.S. 176, 181\n, 56 S.Ct. 159, 161, 101 A.L.R. 853. But the inspection laws of a State relating to exports or to articles purchased for shipment to other States are subject to the paramount regulatory power of Congress. Turner v. Maryland, supra, at pages 57, 58, 2 S.Ct. at page 60. And Congress has long exercised this authority in enacting laws for inspection and the establishment of standards in relation to various commodities involved in transactions in interstate or foreign commerce. \n10\n The fact that the inspection and grading of the tobacco take place before the auction does not dissociate the former from the latter, but on the contrary it is obvious that the inspection and grading have immediate relation to the sales in interstate and foreign commerce which Congress thus undertakes to govern.\n In Townsend v. Yeomans, \n301 \nU.S. 441\n, 57 S.Ct. 842, we recently had under consideration the legislation of Georgia prescribing maximum charges for the services of tobacco \n\n[306 \nU.S. 1, 13]\n\u00a0\n warehousemen who conducted their business in a manner similar to that prevailing in North Carolina. There, the warehousemen strongly insisted that they were engaged in interstate and foreign commerce, as the tobacco sold on their floors was destined for interstate or foreign shipment, and hence that the State was without power to fix their fees. They invoked the federal Act in support of their contention. But we found nothing in the federal Act which undertook to regulate the charges of warehousemen and hence we concluded that Congress had restricted its requirements and left the State free to deal with the matters not covered by the federal legislation and not inconsistent therewith. The authority of Congress to enact the Tobacco Inspection Act was not questioned.\n Second.-Plaintiffs complain that the Act is discriminatory. They say that warehousemen on other tobacco markets in North Carolina, doing the same sort of business and competing for patronage among the same growers, are at liberty to conduct sales in their warehouses without inspection and certification.\n The reason for the selection is shown. The lack of a sufficient number of expert inspectors made it impracticable to supply inspection and grading at all tobacco auction markets. Having this practical difficulty in mind, Congress directed that when for that reason or others the Secretary was unable to provide for inspection and certification at all such markets within a type area, he should first designate those where the greatest number of growers may be served with the facilities that are available. Sec. 5. We do not doubt that such a selection was within the congressional power.\n We have repeatedly said that the power given to Congress to regulate interstate and foreign commerce is 'complete in itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations, other than are prescribed \n\n[306 \nU.S. 1, 14]\n\u00a0\n in the constitution'. Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 196. To hold that Congress in establishing its regulation is restricted to the making of uniform rules would be to impose a limitation which the Constitution does not prescribe. There is no requirement of uniformity in connection with the commerce power (Art. 1, sec. 8, cl. 3, Const.U.S.C.A.) such as there is with respect to the power to lay duties, imposts and excises (Art. 1, sec. 8, cl. 1, Const.U.S.C.A.). Clark Distilling Co. v. Western Maryland R. Co., \n242 \nU.S. 311, 327\n, 37 S.Ct. 180, 185, L.R.A.1917B, 1218, Ann.Cas.1917B, 845. Undoubtedly, the exercise of the commerce power is subject to the Fifth Amendment (Monongahela Navigation Co. v. United States, \n148 \nU.S. 312, 336\n, 13 S.Ct. 622, 630; United States v. Cress, \n243 \nU.S. 316, 326\n, 37 S.Ct. 380, 384; Louisville Joint Stock Land Bank v. Radford, \n295 \nU.S. 555, 589\n, 55 S.Ct. 854, 863, 97 A.L.R. 1106); but that Amendment, unlike the Fourteenth, has no equal protection clause. LaBelle Iron Works v. United States, \n256 \nU.S. 377, 392\n, 41 S.Ct. 528, 532. Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, \n301 \nU.S. 548, 584\n, 57 S.Ct. 883, 889, 109 A.L.R. 1293.\n If it be assumed that there might be discrimination of such an injurious character as to bring into operation the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, that is a different matter from a contention that mere lack of uniformity in the exercise of the commerce power renders the action of Congress invalid. For that contention we find no warrant. It is of the essence of the plenary power conferred that Congress may exercise its discretion in the use of the power. Congress may choose the commodities and places to which its regulation shall apply. Congress may consider and weigh relative situations and needs. Congress is not restricted by any technical requirement but may make limited applications and resort to tests so that it may have the benefit of experience in deciding upon the continuance or extension of a policy which under the Constitution it is free to adopt. As to such choices, the question is one of wisdom and not of power. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 1, 15]\n\u00a0\n Third.-The argument that there is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power is equally untenable. This is not a case where Congress has attempted to abdicate, or to transfer to others, the essential legislative functions with which it is vested by the Constitution, U.S.C.A. Art. 1, sec. 1; sec. 8, cl. 18. See Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan, \n293 \nU.S. 388, 421\n, 55 S.Ct. 241, 248; Schechter Corporation v. United States, \n295 \nU.S. 495, 529\n, 541 S., 542, 553, 55 S.Ct. 837, 848, 97 A.L.R. 947. We have always recognized that legislation must often be adapted to conditions involving details with which it is impracticable for the legislature to deal directly. We have said that-'The Constitution has never been regarded as denying to the Congress the necessary resources of flexibility and practicality, which will enable it to perform its function in laying down policies and establishing standards, while leaving to selected instrumentalities the making of subordinate rules within prescribed limits and the determination of facts to which the policy as declared by the Legislature is to apply. Without capacity to give authorizations of that sort we should have the anomaly of a legislative power which in many circumstances calling for its exertion would be but a futility'. Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan, supra, 55 S.Ct. 248. In such cases 'a general provision may be made, and power given to those who are to act under such general provisions, to fill up the details'. Wayman v. Southard, 10 Wheat. 1, 43. We think that the Tobacco Inspection Act belongs to that class.\n So far as growers of tobacco are concerned, the required referendum does not involve any delegation of legislative authority. Congress has merely placed a restriction upon its own regulation by withholding its operation as to a given market 'unless two-thirds of the growers voting favor it'. Similar conditions are frequently found in police regulations. Cusack Company v. City of Chicago, \n242 \nU.S. 526, 530\n, 37 S.Ct. 190, 191, L.R.A.1918A, 136, Ann.Cas.1917C, 594. This is not a case where a group of producers may make the law and force it upon a minority ( see \n\n[306 \nU.S. 1, 16]\n\u00a0\n Carter v. Carter Coal Co., \n298 \nU.S. 238, 310\n, 318 S., 56 S.Ct. 855, 872, 876) or where a prohibition of an inoffensive and legitimate use of property is imposed not by the legislature but by other property owners ( see Washington ex rel. Seattle Trust Co. v. Roberge, \n278 \nU.S. 116, 122\n, 49 S.Ct. 50, 52, 86 A.L.R. 654). Here it is Congress that exercises its legislative authority in making the regulation and in prescribing the conditions of its application. The required favorable vote upon the referendum is one of these conditions. The distinction was pointed out in Hampton, Jr., & Co. v. United States, \n276 \nU.S. 394, 407\n, 48 S.Ct. 348, 351, where, in sustaining the so-called 'flexible tariff provision' of the Act of September 21, 1922,11 and the authority it conferred upon the President, we said: 'Congress may feel itself unable conveniently to determine exactly when its exercise of the legislative power should become effective, because dependent on future conditions, and it may leave the determination of such time to the decision of an executive, or, as often happens in matters of state legislation, it may be left to a popular vote of the residents of a district to be affected by the legislation. While in a sense one may say that such residents are exercising legislative power, it is not an exact statement, because the power has already been exercised legislatively by the body vested with that power under the Constitution, the condition of its legislation going into effect being made dependent by the legislature on the expression of the voters of a certain district'.\n Nor is there an unconstitutional delegation to the Secretary of Agriculture. Congress has set forth its policy for the establishment of standards for tobacco according to type, grade, size, condition, and other determinable characteristics. Secs. 3, 4. The provision that the Secretary shall make the necessary investigations to that end and fix the standards according to kind and quality is \n\n[306 \nU.S. 1, 17]\n\u00a0\n plainly appropriate and conforms to familiar legislative practice as shown by the various statutes already mentioned. \n12\n It is not different in principle from the authority conferred upon the Secretary of the Treasury to establish 'uniform standards of purity, quality, and fitness for consumption of all kinds of teas imported into the United States' ( Buttfield v. Stranahan, \n192 \nU.S. 470, 494\n, 24 S.Ct. 349, 354 ), or from that conferred upon the Interstate Commerce Commission to fix standards for safety devices and equipment (St. Louis, Iron Mountain R. Co. v. Taylor, \n210 \nU.S. 281, 286\n, 287 S., 28 S.Ct. 616, 617; Napier v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., \n272 \nU.S. 605, 612\n, 47 S.Ct. 207, 209), or from that conferred upon the Secretary of War to determine whether bridges and other structures constitute unreasonable obstructions to navigation and to specify and prescribe the structural changes that are required (Union Bridge Co. v. United States, \n204 \nU.S. 364\n, 27 S.Ct. 367).\n The Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to designate those markets where tobacco bought and sold thereon at auction moves in commerce. Sec. 5. This calls for the ascertainment of a fact. The intention of Congress is clear that markets thus ascertained shall be designated subject to the prescribed conditions and as rapidly as facilities for inspection are available. We find no unfettered discretion lodged with the administrative officer. The requirement of a referendum, as already noted, calls for the expression of the wishes of the growers and the Secretary acts merely as an administrative agent in conducting the referendum. The provision for the suspension of a designated market because competent inspectors are not available or the quantity of tobacco is not enough to justify the cost of the service, sets forth definite as well as reasonable criteria. The statute also lays down a practical rule for the guidance of the Secretary in the \n\n[306 \nU.S. 1, 18]\n\u00a0\n selection of markets in the event that because of lack of inspectors or other reasons the Secretary is unable to furnish inspection and certification at all auction markets within a type area. In that case he is first to designate those auction markets 'where the greatest number of growers may be served with the facilities available to him'.\n The statute thus defines the policy of Congress and establishes standards within the framework of which the administrative agent is to supply the details. The provisions of the Act are well within the principle of permissible delegation which we applied in relation to the administration of the forest reserve in United States v. Grimaud, \n220 \nU.S. 506, 517\n, 31 S.Ct. 480, 483; to the allocation of licenses, wave lengths, etc. in Federal Radio Commission v. Nelson Bros., etc., Co., \n289 \nU.S. 266, 285\n, 53 S.Ct. 627, 636; and to the exercise of the powers conferred upon the Interstate Commerce Commission in New York Central Securities Corporation v. United States, \n287 \nU.S. 12, 24\n, 53 S.Ct. 45, 48.\n Nor does it appear that, in his use of his authority in the instant case, the Secretary has acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner. As he did not have an adequate corps of experts to supply all the North Carolina markets, he selected those where there had been voluntary inspection under the prior Act. 13 It cannot be said that this was an unreasonable course.\n Fourth.-Finally, plaintiffs invoke the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. Plaintiffs are warehousemen and auctioneers acting as agents for the growers who own the tobacco and pay their commissions. Plaintiffs are thus in the position of contesting a regulation for the benefit of their principals because of an alleged interference with their business.

But even if it were assumed that the contention that the markets subject to the inspection provision would lose patronage could afford ground for resisting this sort of regulation, otherwise valid, the claim in this instance rests more on conjecture than on proof. We agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals that as to the asserted difference of prices obtainable on inspected markets, as compared with those not inspected, the evidence has little probative value and that the loss of business from growers who do not desire the inspection would seem by the record to be more than counterbalanced by the gain of business from those who desire it. 95 F.2d page 861.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is affirmed.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice BUTLER dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Declaratory Judgment Act, 48 Stat. 955, 28 U.S.C.A.  400. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 49 Stat. 731, 7 U.S.C.Supp. III, 511 to 511q, 7 U.S.C.A.  511 to 511q. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] 19 F.Supp. 211. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] See Section 1. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Report, Committee of Agriculture, June 5, 1935, to accompany H.R. 8026. \n[\nFootnote 6\n] The methods are similar to those followed in Georgia as described in Townsend v.

McCanless \n307 \nU.S. 357\n (1939) ]\n\n\n[307 \nU.S. 357, 360]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Marion Rushton, Ray Rushton, and A. A. Carmichael, all of Montgomery, Ala., for appellants.\n Mr. Edwin F. Hunt, of Nashville, Tenn., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The questions for decision are whether the States of Alabama and Tennessee may each constitutionally impose death taxes upon the transfer of an interest in intangibles held in trust by an Alabama trustee but passing under the will of a beneficiary decedent domiciled in Tennessee; and which of the two states may tax in the event that it is determined that only one state may constitutionally impose the tax.\n Decedent, a domiciled resident of Tennessee, by trust indenture transferred certain stocks and bonds upon specified trusts to Title Guarantee Loan & Trust Company, an Alabama corporation doing business in that state. So far as now material, the indenture provided that the net income of the trust property should be paid over to decedent during her lifetime. She reserved the power to remove the trustee and substitute another, which was never done; the power to direct the sale of the trust property and the investment of the proceeds; and the power to dispose of the trust estate by her last will and testament, in which event it was to be 'handled and disposed of as directed' in her will. The indenture provided further that in default of disposition by will the property was to be held in trust for the benefit of her husband, son, and daughter. Until decedent's death the trust was administered by the trust company in Alabama and the \n\n[307 \nU.S. 357, 361]\n\u00a0\n paper evidences of the intangibles held by the trustee were at all times located in Alabama.\n By her last will and testament decedent bequeathed the trust property to the trust company in trust for the benefit of her husband, son, and daughter, in different amounts and by different estates from those provided for by the trust indenture, with remainder interests over to the children of the son and the daughter respectively, and to his wife and her husband. By her will testatrix appointed a Tennessee trust company executor 'as to all property which I may own in the State of Tennessee at the time of my death', and an Alabama trust company executor 'as to all property which I may own in the State of Alabama and also as to all property which I may have the right to dispose of by last will and testament in said state'. The will has been probated in Tennessee and in Alabama, and letters testamentary have issued to the two trust companies named as executors in the will.\n The present suit was brought by the two executors in a chancery court of Tennessee against appellants, comprising the State Tax Commission of Alabama, and appellee, Commissioner of Finance and Taxation of the State of Tennessee, who are charged with the duty of collecting inheritance or succession taxes in their respective states. The bill of complaint prayed a declaratory judgment pursuant to the Tennessee Declaratory Judgments Act, Tennessee Code 1932,  8835-8847, determining what portions of the estate of decedent are taxable by the State of Tennessee and what portions by the State of Alabama. Appellants and appellee appeared and by their answers and by stipulation recited in detail the facts already stated and admitted that the taxing officials of each state had imposed or asserted the right to impose an inheritance or death transfer tax on the trust property passing under decedent's will. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 357, 362]\n\u00a0\n The chancery court of Tennessee decreed that the State of Alabama could lawfully impose the tax and that the inheritance tax law of Tennessee violated the Fourteenth Amendment in so far as it purported to impose a tax measured by the trust property disposed of by decedent's will. The Supreme Court of Tennessee reversed, and entered its decree declaring the trust property disposed of by decedent's will to be 'taxable in Tennessee and not taxable in Alabama for purposes of death succession or transfer taxes.' Nashville Trust Co. v. Stokes, Tenn., 118 S.W.2d 228. The case comes here on an appeal from this decree taken by the taxing officials of Alabama under  237(a) of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  344( a), 28 U.S.C.A.  344(a).\n Alabama has assessed a state inheritance tax on the trust property pursuant to Article XII, c. 2,  347.1 et seq., of its General Revenue Act. Alabama Acts 1935, p. 434 et seq. No transfer tax has been assessed upon the property by the Tennessee taxing officials, but they assert the right under the Tennessee statute to tax the transfer under decedent's will of the trust property. Sections 1259 and 1260 of the Tennessee Code of 1932 impose a tax upon the transfer at death by a resident of the state of his intangible property wherever located, including transfers under powers of appointment.\n Both the court of chancery of Tennessee and the Supreme Court of Tennessee, conceiving that the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S.C.A.Const., requires the transmission at death of intangibles to be taxed at their 'situs' and there only, considered that the primary question for determination was the situs or location to be attributed to the intangibles of the trust estate at the time of decedent's death. After considering all of the relevant factors, the one court concluded that the situs of the intangibles was in Alabama, the other that it was in Tennessee. Despite the impossibility in the circumstances of this case of attributing a single location to that which has no physical \n\n[307 \nU.S. 357, 363]\n\u00a0\n characteristics and which is associated in numerous intimate ways with both states, both courts have agreed that the Fourteenth Amendment compels the attribution to be made and that, once it is established by judicial pronouncement that the intangibles are in one state rather than the other, the due process clause forbids their taxation in any other.\n The doctrine, of recent origin, that the Fourteenth Amendment precludes the taxation of any interest in the same intangible in more than one state has received support to the limited extent that it was applied in Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. v. Minnesota, \n280 \nU.S. 204\n, 50 S.Ct. 98, 65 A.L.R. 1000; Baldwin v. Missouri, \n281 \nU.S. 586\n, 50 S.Ct. 436, 72 A.L.R. 1303; First National Bank v. Maine, \n284 \nU.S. 312\n, 52 S.Ct. 174, 77 A.L.R. 1401. Still more recently this Court has declined to give it completely logical application. \n1\n It has never been pressed to the extreme now urged upon us, and we think that neither reason nor authority requires its acceptance in the circumstances of the present case.\n That rights in tangibles-land and chattels-are to be regarded in many respects as localized at the place where the tangible itself is located for purposes of the jurisdiction of a court to make disposition of putative rights in them, for purposes of conflict of laws, and for purposes of taxation, is a doctrine generally accepted both in the common law and other legal systems before the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment and since. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[307 \nU.S. 357, 364]\n\u00a0\n Originating, it has been thought, in the tendency of the mind to identify rights with their physical subjects, see Salmond, Jurisprudence (2nd ed.) 398, its survival and the consequent cleavage between the rules of law applicable to tangibles and those relating to intangibles are attributable to the exclusive dominion exerted over the tangibles themselves by the government within whose territorial limits they are found. Green v. Van Buskirk, 7 Wall. 139, 150; Pennoyer v. Neff, \n95 \nU.S. 714\n; Arndt v. Griggs, \n134 \nU.S. 316, 320\n, 321 S., 10 S.Ct. 557, 558, 559. See McDonald v. Mabee, \n243 \nU.S. 90, 91\n, 37 S.Ct. 343, L.R.A.1917F, 458; cf. Harris v. Balk, \n198 \nU.S. 215, 222\n, 25 S.Ct. 625, 626, 3 Ann.Cas. 1084; Frick v. Pennsylvania, supra, \n268 \nU.S. 497\n, 45 S.Ct. 607, 42 A.L.R. 316. The power of government and its agencies to possess and to exclude others from possessing tangibles, and thus to exclude them from enjoying rights in tangibles located within its territory, affords adequate basis for an exclusive taxing jurisdiction. When we speak of the jurisdiction to tax land or chattels as being exclusively in the state where they are physically located, we mean no more than that the benefit and protection of laws enabling the owner to enjoy the fruits of his ownership and the power to reach effectively the interests protected, for the purpose of subjecting them to payment of a tax, are so narrowly restricted to the state in whose territory the physical property is located as to set practical limits to taxation by others. Other states have been said to be without jurisdiction and so without constitutional power to tax tangibles if, because of their location elsewhere, those states can afford no substantial protection to the rights taxed and cannot effectively lay hold of any interest in the \n\n[307 \nU.S. 357, 365]\n\u00a0\n property in order to compel payment of the tax. See Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Kentucky, \n199 \nU.S. 194, 202\n, 26 S.Ct. 36, 4 Ann.Cas. 493; Frick v. Pennsylvania, \n268 \nU.S. 473\n, 489 et seq., 45 S.Ct. 603, 604, 42 A.L.R. 316.3\n Very different considerations, both theoretical and practical, apply to the taxation of intangibles, that is, rights which are not related to physical things. Such \n\n[307 \nU.S. 357, 366]\n\u00a0\n rights are but relationships between persons, natural or corporate, which the law recognizes by attaching to them certain sanctions enforceable in courts. The power of government over them and the protection which it gives them cannot be exerted through control of a physical thing. They can be made effective only through control over and protection afforded to those persons whose relationships are the origin of the rights. See Chicago, R.I. & P.R. Co. v. Sturm, \n174 \nU.S. 710, 716\n, 19 S.Ct. 797, 799; Harris v. Balk, \n198 \nU.S. 215, 222\n, 25 S.Ct. 625, 626, 3 Ann.Cas. 1084. Obviously, as sources of actual or potential wealth-which is an appropriate measure of any tax imposed on ownership or its exercise-they cannot be dissociated from the persons from whose relationships they are derived. These are not in any sense fictions. They are indisputable realities.\n The power to tax 'is an incident of sovereignty, and is co-extensive with that to which it is an incident. All subjects over which the sovereign power of a state extends, are objects of taxation; but those over which it does not extend, are, upon the soundest principles, exempt from taxation.' McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 429. But this does not mean that the sovereign power of the state does not extend over intangibles of a domiciled resident because they have no physical location within its territory, or that its power to tax is lost because we may choose to say they are located elsewhere. A jurisdiction which does not depend on physical presence within the state is not lost by declaring that it is absent. From the beginning of our constitutional system control over the person at the place of his domicile and his duty there, common to all citizens, to contribute to the support of government have been deemed to afford an adequate constitutional basis for imposing on him a tax on the use and enjoyment of rights in intangibles measured by their value. Until this moment that jurisdiction has not been thought to depend on any factor other than the domicile \n\n[307 \nU.S. 357, 367]\n\u00a0\n of the owner within the taxing state, or to compel the attribution to intangibles of a physical presence within its territory, as though they were chattels, in order to support the tax. Carpenter v. Pennsylvania, 17 How. 456; Kirtland v. Hotchkiss, \n100 \nU.S. 491\n; Hawley v. Malden, \n232 \nU.S. 1\n, 34 S.Ct. 201, Ann.Cas.1916C, 842; Bullen v. Wisconsin, \n240 \nU.S. 625\n, 36 S.Ct. 473; Cream of Wheat Co. v. County of Grand Forks, \n253 \nU.S. 325\n, 40 S.Ct. 558; Blodgett v. Silberman, \n277 \nU.S. 1\n, 48 S.Ct. 410; Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. v. Minnesota, supra; Baldwin v. Missouri, supra; Beidler v. South Carolina Tax Comm., \n282 \nU.S. 1\n, 51 S.Ct. 54; First National Bank v. Maine, supra; Virginia v. Imperial Coal Sales Co., \n293 \nU.S. 15\n, 55 S.Ct. 12; Schuylkill Trust Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n302 \nU.S. 506\n, 58 S.Ct. 295.\n In cases where the owner of intangibles confines his activity to the place of his domicile it has been found convenient to substitute a rule for a reason, cf. New York ex rel. Cohn v. Graves, \n300 \nU.S. 308, 313\n, 57 S. Ct. 466, 467, 108 A.L.R. 721; First Bank Stock Corp. v. Minnesota, \n301 \nU.S. 234, 241\n, 57 S.Ct. 677, 680, 113 A.L.R. 228, by saying that his intangibles are taxed at their situs and not elsewhere, or, perhaps less artificially, by invoking the maxim mobilia sequuntur personam, Blodgett v. Silberman, supra; Baldwin v. Missouri, supra, which means only that it is the identity or association of intangibles with the person of their owner at his domicile which gives jurisdiction to tax. But when the taxpayer extends his activities with respect to his intangibles, so as to avail himself of the protection and benefit of the laws of another state, in such a way as to bring his person or property within the reach of the tax gatherer there, the reason for a single place of taxation no longer obtains, and the rule is not even a workable substitute for the reasons which may exist in any particular case to support the constitutional power of each state concerned to tax. Whether we regard the right of a state to tax as founded on power over the object taxed, as declared by Chief Justice Marshall in McCulloch v. Maryland, supra, \n\n[307 \nU.S. 357, 368]\n\u00a0\n through dominion over tangibles or over persons whose relationships are the source of intangible rights; or on the benefit and protection conferred by the taxing sovereignty, or both, it is undeniable that the state of domicile is not deprived, by the taxpayer's activities elsewhere, of its constitutional jurisdiction to tax, and consequently that there are many circumstances in which more than one state may have jurisdiction to impose a tax and measure it by some or all of the taxpayer's intangibles. Shares of corporate stock may be taxed at the domicile of the shareholder and also at that of the corporation which the taxing state has created and controls; and income may be taxed both by the state where it is earned and by the state of the recipient's domicile. 4 Protection, benefit, and power over the subject matter are not confined to either state. The taxpayer who is domiciled in one state but carries on business in another is subject to a tax there measured by the value of the intangibles used in his business. New Orleans v. Stempel, \n175 \nU.S. 309\n, 20 S.Ct. 110; Bristol v. Washington County, \n177 \nU.S. 133\n, 20 S.Ct. 585; State Board of Assessors v. Comptoir National, \n191 \nU.S. 388\n, 24 S.Ct. 109; Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. v. New Orleans, \n205 \nU.S. 395\n, 27 S.Ct. 499; Liverpool & London & Globe Ins. Co. v. Board, \n221 \nU.S. 346\n, 31 S.Ct. 550, L.R.A.1915C, 903; Wheeling Steel Corp. v. Fox, \n298 \nU.S. 193\n, 56 S.Ct. 773; cf. Blodgett v. Silberman, supra; Baldwin v. Missouri, supra. But taxation of a corporation by a state where it does business, measured by the value of the intangibles used in its business there, does not preclude the state of incorporation from imposing a tax measured by all its intangibles. Cream of Wheat Co. v. County of Grand Forks, supra, \n253 \nU.S. 329\n, 40 S.Ct. 559;5 see Fidelity & Columbia Trust Co. v. Louisville, \n245 \nU.S. 54\n, 38 S.Ct. 40, L.R.A.1918C, 124.\n The practical obstacles and unwarranted curtailments of state power which may be involved in attempting to \n\n[307 \nU.S. 357, 369]\n\u00a0\n prevent the taxation of diverse legal interests in intangibles in more than a single place, through first ascribing to them a fictitious situs and then invoking the prohibition of the Fourteenth Amendment against their taxation elsewhere, are exemplified by the circumstances of the present case. Here, for reasons of her own, the testatrix, although domiciled in Tennessee and enjoying the benefits of its laws, found it advantageous to create a trust of intangibles in Alabama by vesting legal title to the intangibles and limited powers of control over them in an Alabama trustee. But she also provided that by resort to her power to dispose of property by will, conferred upon her by the law of the domicile, the trust could be terminated and the property pass under the will. She thus created two sets of legal relationships resulting in distinct intangible rights, the one embodied in the legal ownership by the Alabama trustee of the intangibles, the other embodied in the equitable right of the decedent to control the action of the trustee with respect to the trust property and to compel it to pay over to her the income during her life, and in her power to dispose of the property at death.\n Even if we could rightly regard these various and distinct legal interests, springing from distinct relationships, as a composite unitary interest and ascribe to it a single location in space, it is difficult to see how it could be said to be more in one state than in the other and upon what articulate principle the Fourteenth Amendment could be thought to have withdrawn from either state the taxing jurisdiction which it undoubtedly possessed before the adoption of the Amendment by conferring on one state, at the expense of the other, exclusive jurisdiction to tax. See Paddell v. City of New York, \n211 \nU.S. 446, 448\n, 29 S.Ct. 139, 15 Ann.Cas. 187. If the 'due process' of the Fifth Amendment, U.S.C.A. Const., does not require us to fix a single exclusive place of taxation of intangibles for the benefit of their foreign owner, who is \n\n[307 \nU.S. 357, 370]\n\u00a0\n entitled to its protection, Burnet v. Brooks, \n288 \nU.S. 378\n, 53 S.Ct. 457, 86 A.L.R. 747; cf. Russian Volunteer Fleet v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 481, 489\n, 51 S.Ct. 229, 231, the Fourteenth can hardly be thought to make us do so here, for the due process clause of each amendment is directed at the protection of the individual and he is entitled to its immunity as much against the state as against the national government.\n If taxation is but a means of distributing the cost of government among those who are subject to its control and who enjoy the protection of its laws, see New York ex rel. Cohn v. Graves, supra, \n300 \nU.S. 313\n, 57 S. Ct. 467, 108 A.L.R. 721; First Bank Stock Corp. v. Minnesota, supra, \n301 \nU.S. 241\n, 57 S.Ct. 680, 113 A.L.R. 228, legal ownership of the intangibles in Alabama by the Alabama trustee would seem to afford adequate basis for imposing on him a tax measured by their value. We can find no more ground for saying that the Fourteenth Amendment relieves it, or the property which it holds and administers in Alabama, from bearing that burden, than for saying that they are constitutionally immune from paying any other expense which normally attaches to the administration of a trust in that state. This Court has never denied the constitutional power of the trustee's domicile to subject them to property taxation. Safe Deposit & Trust Co. v. Virginia, \n280 \nU.S. 83\n, 50 S.Ct. 59, 67 A.L.R. 386; see cases collected in 30 Columbia Law Rev. 530; 2 Cooley, Taxation (8th ed.)  602. And since Alabama may lawfully tax the property in the trustee's hands, we perceive no ground for saying that the Fourteenth Amendment forbids the state to tax the transfer of it or an interest in it to another merely because the transfer was effected by decedent's testamentary act in another state.\n No more plausible ground is assigned for depriving Tennessee of the power to tax in the circumstances of this case. The decedent's power to dispose of the intangibles was a potential source of wealth which was property in her hands from which she was under the highest obliga- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 357, 371]\n\u00a0\n tion, in common with her fellow citizens of Tennessee, to contribute to the support of the government whose protection she enjoyed. Exercise of that power, which was in her complete and exclusive control in Tennessee, was made a taxable event by the statutes of the state. Taxation of it must be taken to be as much within the jurisdiction of the state as taxation of the transfer of a mortgage on land located in another state and there subject to taxation at its full value. See Kirtland v. Hotchkiss, supra; cf. Paddell v. City of New York, supra.\n For purposes of taxation, a general power of appointment, of which the testatrix here was both donor and donee, has hitherto been regarded by this Court as equivalent to ownership of the property subject to the power. Chanler v. Kelsey, \n205 \nU.S. 466\n, 27 S.Ct. 550; Bullen v. Wisconsin, supra, \n240 \nU.S. 630\n, 36 S.Ct. 474; Chase National Bank v. United States, \n278 \nU.S. 327, 338\n, 49 S.Ct. 126, 128, 63 A.L.R. 388; see Gray, Rule Against Perpetuities (3d ed. 1916),  524.6 Whether the appointee derives title from the donor, under the common law theory, or from the donee by virtue of the exercise of the power, is here immaterial. In either event the trustee's title under the will was derived from decedent, domiciled in Tennessee. Cf. Wachovia Bank & Trust Co. v. Doughton, \n272 \nU.S. 567\n, 47 S.Ct. 202. There is no conflict here between the laws of the two states affecting the transmission of the trust property. The title of the trustee under the original Alabama trust came to an end upon the exercise of the testatrix's power of appointment; and although the trustee after her death still had title to the securities, it was in by a new title as legatee under her will, and a new beneficial interest was created, both derived through the exercise of her power of disposition. The resulting situation was no different from what it would have been if she had bequeathed the \n\n[307 \nU.S. 357, 372]\n\u00a0\n intangibles upon a new trust to a new and different trustee, either within or without the state of Alabama. So far as the power of Tennessee to tax the exercise of the power of appointment is concerned, there is no substantial difference between the present case and any other case in which at the moment of death the evidences of intangibles passing under the will of a decedent domiciled in one state are physically present in another. See Blodgett v. Silberman, supra; Baldwin v. Missouri, supra.\n It has hitherto been the accepted law of this Court that the state of domicile may constitutionally tax the exercise or non-exercise at death of a general power of appointment, by one who is both donor and donee of the power, relating to securities held in trust in another state. Bullen v. Wisconsin, supra. If it be thought that it is identity of the intangibles with the person of the owner at the place of his domicile which gives power over them and hence 'jurisdiction to tax', and this is the reason underlying the maxim mobilia sequuntur personam, it is certain here that the intangibles for some purposes are identified with the trustee, their legal owner, at the place of its domicile and that in another and different relationship and for a different purpose-the exercise of the power of disposition at death, which is the equivalent of ownership-they are identified with the place of domicile of the testatrix, Tennessee. In effecting her purposes, the testatrix brought some of the legal interests which she created within the control of one state by selecting a trustee there and others within the control of the other state by making her domicile there. She necessarily invoked the aid of the law of both states, and her legatees, before they can secure and enjoy the benefits of succession, must invoke the law of both.\n We can find nothing in the history of the Fourteenth Amendment and no support in reason, principle, or authority for saying that it prohibits either state, in the \n\n[307 \nU.S. 357, 373]\n\u00a0\n circumstances of this case, from laying the tax. On the contrary this Court, in sustaining the tax at the place of domicile in a case like the present, has declared that both the decedent's domicile and that of the trustee are free to tax. Bullen v. Wisconsin, supra, \n240 \nU.S. 631\n, 36 S.Ct. 474; cf. Keeney v. Comptroller of New York, \n222 \nU.S. 525, 537\n, 32 S.Ct. 105, 108, 38 L.R.A.,N.S., 1139; Guaranty Trust Co. v. Blodgett, \n287 \nU.S. 509\n, 53 S.Ct. 244. That has remained the law of this Court until the present moment, and we see no reason for discarding it now. We find it impossible to say that taxation of intangibles can be reduced in every case to the mere mechanical operation of locating at a single place, and there taxing, every legal interest growing out of all the complex legal relationships which may be entered into between persons. This is the case because in point of actuality those interests may be too diverse in their relationships to various taxing jurisdictions to admit of unitary treatment without discarding modes of taxation long accepted and applied before the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, and still recognized by this Court as valid. See Paddell v. New York, supra, \n211 \nU.S. 448\n, 29 S.Ct. 139, 15 Ann.Cas. 187. The Fourteenth Amendment cannot be carried out with such mechanical nicety without infringing powers which we think have not yet been withdrawn from the states. We have recently declined to press to a logical extreme the doctrine that the Fourteenth Amendment may be invoked to compel the taxation of intangibles by only a single state by attributing to them a situs within that state. \n7\n We think it cannot be pressed so far here.\n If we enjoyed the freedom of the framers it is possible that we might, in the light of experience, devise a more equitable system of taxation than that which they gave us. But we are convinced that that end cannot be attained by the device of ascribing to intangibles in every case a locus for taxation in a single state despite the \n\n[307 \nU.S. 357, 374]\n\u00a0\n multiple legal interests to which they may give rise and despite the control over them or their transmission by any other state and its legitimate interest in taxing the one or the other. While fictions are sometimes invented in order to realize the judicial conception of justice, we cannot define the constitutional guaranty in terms of a fiction so unrelated to reality without creating as many tax injustices as we would avoid and without exercising a power to remake constitutional provisions which the Constitution has not given to the courts. See Bristol v. Washington County, supra, \n177 \nU.S. 145\n, 20 S.Ct. 590; Kidd v. Alabama, \n188 \nU.S. 730, 732\n, 23 S.Ct. 401, 402, quoted with approval in Hawley v.

Upon this point he reserves his conclusion.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER, dissenting.\n The sole question is whether, on the facts about to be stated, the Tennessee inheritance tax law, consistently with the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S.C.A.Const., may be extended to intangible personal property evidenced by certificates of stock and bonds held in Alabama.\n The suit was brought in a chancery court of Tennessee under the declaratory judgments act of that State. \n1\n Com- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 357, 375]\n\u00a0\n plainants were the Nashville Trust Company, a Tennessee corporation appointed by the will of Mrs. Grace C. Scales as executor for Tennessee, and the Title Guarantee Loan & Trust Company, which will be referred to as the Birmingham trust company, an Alabama corporation appointed as executor for that State. Defendants were the Commissioner of Finance and Taxation of Tennessee, and the members of the Alabama Tax Commission. The bill prayed that the court determine what portions of the estate are taxable by Tennessee and what portions are taxable by Alabama. The Tennessee commissioner filed answer praying declaration and decree that the securities held in Alabama are subject to the inheritance tax law of Tennessee. 2 The members of the Alabama commission filed their answer and a cross-bill praying decree in favor of that State and against the Birmingham trust company for the tax claimed under the laws of Alabama. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n[307 \nU.S. 357, 376]\n\u00a0\n The parties stipulated that the facts are as stated in the pleadings. In substance they are as follows:\n At all times involved in this case, Mrs. Scales was a resident of and domiciled in Tennessee. Her brother, formerly living in Alabama, died in 1905 leaving a will that bequeathed to the Birmingham trust company stocks and bonds issued by Alabama corporations to be held in trust for the use and benefit of his widow and at her death to be delivered to Mrs. Scales. The widow died in 1917. Immediately, December 29, 1917, and without taking any of them from the possession of the trust company, Mrs. Scales executed jointly with it an indenture covering the stocks and bonds of which she had become owner under her brother's will.\n By paragraph 1, she transferred 50 bonds to the trust company as trustee for the use and benefit of her son and directed that it hold and manage the property and pay net income to him during his life, and that, subject to his power of disposition by will, all property belonging to the trust at the time of his death should go to his children. By paragraph 2, she transferred to the same company 50 other bonds to be held in trust for the benefit of her daughter subject to trusts, conditions, and power of testamentary appointment by her daughter like those specified in the provisions creating the trust for her son.\n By paragraph 3, she transferred to the same trustee the balance of the property by it to be held in trust and managed for specified uses and purposes and upon terms and conditions in substance as follows: (a) She directed the trustee to pay the income to her while she lived. (b) She reserved the right by will to dispose of all the trust property. (c) She directed that if she made no disposi- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 357, 377]\n\u00a0\n tion by will the trustee should pay $200 per month out of income to her husband during his life and the balance of income to her son and daughter during their lives; that the child or children of either, if dead, should receive the share of income which the parent would have received if living; that one-half of the property in the trust at the time of her death be transferred to the trust created for her son; and that the other half be transferred to the trust created for her daughter. (d) She reserved power at any time that she deemed income insufficient for her support to direct the trustee to sell a part of the trust property and to give her the amount received for it, and retained the right to direct transfer to her son or daughter of any portion of the trust property, and (e) the right to direct investments. She retained authority to remove the trustee and to appoint a successor. As to nearly all the property held in trust under paragraph 3, Mrs. Scales, her son, daughter, and the trustee, January 11, 1929, executed a writing releasing the power reserved to encroach on or dispose of corpus.\n January 1, 1926, Mrs. Scales exerted the power by will to dispose of the trust property. Item two recites that she had reserved the right to dispose by will of property conveyed to the trustee under paragraph 3 of the trust agreement and provides: 'Now, therefore, desiring to exercise the right to dispose of the said trust property, I do hereby give, devise, and bequeath all of the property custody of said Title Guarantee Loan & Trust Company ... at the time of my death to the said company, as trustee, the same to be held by it in trust upon the uses and trusts, terms, conditions, and limitations hereinafter set forth in this item of my will.'\n Section one of that item directs that from the trust estate there shall be set aside property of the value of $100,000 to be held in trust as there specified for her \n\n[307 \nU.S. 357, 378]\n\u00a0\n daughter and her daughter's children Section two makes like provision for her son and his children. Section three directs that, after the trust property shall be set aside as specified in sections one and two, the balance in the hands of the trustee shall be given in equal shares to her daughter and son to be theirs absolutely.\n An amendment to the answer of the members of the Alabama Tax Commission alleges, and by stipulation the other parties admit, that from the trust indenture it fully appears that the title, possession and control of the securities passed completely to the Birmingham trust company and that such was the status of the securities at the time of the death of Mrs. Scales. That amendment also alleges, and the stipulation admits, that she never exercised the right reserved to her to remove the trustee and that the trust property could not have been removed from Alabama except upon an order of a circuit court and in compliance with the statutes of that State. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n The chancery court found that at the time of the death of Mrs. Scales the securities in question 'had a legal situs analogous to the situs of tangible personal property in the State of Alabama.' It decreed that Alabama may legally impose upon them a death transfer or succession tax and that in so far as the inheritance tax law of Tennessee attempts to impose the tax claimed by that State it violates the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The state supreme court reversed the chancery court. It held that the securities were not so used in Alabama as to give them a situs there; that when Mrs. Scales died the situation was the same as though there never had been a trust; and that the property passed under the will as her absolute property. It entered a decree declaring the property taxable in Tennessee and not taxable in Alabama. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 357, 379]\n\u00a0\n The Tennessee commissioner and the members of the Alabama commission respectively claim the right to impose an inheritance or death succession tax based upon the value of all the property held in the trust at the time of the death of Mrs. Scales. Rightly the parties agreed and the state courts assumed that, consistently with the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, both States may not impose transfer taxes in respect of the same property.

Riley, \n302 \nU.S. 292, 297\n, 298 S., 58 S.Ct. 185, 187. No distinction is suggested between the securities covered by the relinquishment, January 11, 1929, of the right reserved to encroach upon and to direct transfer from the corpus and the small part to which the relinquishment did not extend. And, as the parties and the state courts have treated all alike, this Court may decide upon title and taxability as if the relinquishment covered all.\n The parties agree that, upon execution of the indenture, title, possession, and control passed completely to the trustee and so continued until the death of Mrs. Scales. There being no provision authorizing revocation, the grant was irrevocable. Perry on Trusts and Trustees (7th ed.)  104. 4 Bogert, Trusts and Trustees,  993. Keyes v.

McWilliams, 70 Cal. 449, 453, 11 P. 659; Strong v. Weir, 47 S.C. 307, 323, 25 S.E. 157. Unquestionably it presently vested full legal and equitable title in the trustee and beneficiaries, subject to be divested only by the exertion by Mrs. Scales of her power of appointment by will. Coolidge v. Long, \n282 \nU.S. 582, 597\n, 51 S.Ct. 306, 309; Marvin v. Smith, 46 N.Y. 571, 575; Carroll v. Smith, 99 Md. 653, 658 et seq., 59 A. 131; Boone v. Davis, 64 Miss. 133, 140, 8 So. 202. That power did not amount to an estate or interest in the trust property. United States v. Field, \n255 \nU.S. 257, 263\n, 41 S.Ct. 256, 257, 18 A.L.R. 1461; Porter v. Commissioner, \n288 \nU.S. 436, 441\n, 53 S.Ct. 451, 452. All doubt as to that is precluded by the clause of the indenture which provides that in the absence of disposition by her will the property shall continue to be held in trust for purposes there specified.\n The reserved authority to direct investment contemplates action as trustee and not control as owner. Reinecke v. Trust Co., \n278 \nU.S. 339, 346\n, 347 S., 49 S.Ct. 123, 125, 66 A.L.R. 397. The authority to remove the trustee and to appoint a successor detracts nothing from the plenary grant of title. See Bowditch v. Banuelos, 1 Gray, Mass., 220, 230. When read as it must be in connection with the provisions of the Alabama statute above referred to, that provision of the indenture does not reserve power to remove that trust securities from the State of Alabama.\n As the death of Mrs. Scales and taking effect of her will were coincident, the legal title remained in the trustee. The purposes Mrs. Scales intended to effect by the trusts defined by her will are like those she intended to serve by the trusts created by the indenture which, in absence of will, were to continue after death. Stripped of mere legalism, and taken according to substance, the will operated to amend and continue the trusts created by the indenture. Questions of power to tax are governed by the substance of things rather than by technical rules, \n\n[307 \nU.S. 357, 381]\n\u00a0\n concerning title. Tyler v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 497, 503\n, 50 S.Ct. 356, 359, 69 A.L.R. 758.\n It follows that save her right to income, Mrs. Scales, after her relinquishment, January 11, 1929, and at the time of her death, had no estate or interest in the securities held by the trustee. There is no basis for application of the fiction mobilia sequuntur personam. Wachovia Bank & Trust Co. v. Doughton, \n272 \nU.S. 567, 575\n, 47 S.Ct. 202, 203; Brooke v. Norfolk, \n277 \nU.S. 27, 29\n, 48 S.Ct. 422; Safe Deposit & Trust Co. v. Virginia, \n280 \nU.S. 83, 92\n, 94 S., 50 S.Ct. 59, 60, 61, 67 A.L.R. 386; McMurtry v.

Wisconsin, \n240 \nU.S. 625\n, 36 S.Ct. 473 Tennessee may not impose the inheritance tax claimed in this suit by its Commissioner of Finance and Taxation.\n Moreover, if contrary to the indenture as above construed, it should be held that at the time of her death Mrs. Scales in addition to having power of appointment by will owned an interest in the trust property, Tenneessee would nevertheless be without power to impose a tax on the transfer of that interest because the intangibles in question had no situs in that State.\n Intangibles, like tangibles, may be so held and used outside the State of the domicil of the owner as to become taxable in the State where kept. See e.g., New Orleans v. Stempel, \n175 \nU.S. 309\n, 20 S.Ct. 110; Bristol v. Washington County, \n177 \nU.S. 133\n, 143 et seq., 20 S.Ct. 585, 589; State Board of Assessors v.

The general rule of mobilia sequuntur personam must yield to the established fact of legal ownership, actual presence and control in a State other than that of the domicil of the owner. The phrase 'business situs' as used to support jurisdiction of a State \n\n[307 \nU.S. 357, 382]\n\u00a0\n other than that of the domicil of the owner to impose taxes on intangible personal property is a metaphorical expression of vague signification; its meaning is not limited to investment or actual use as an integral part of a business or activity, but may extend to the execution of trusts such as those created by the indenture and imposed on the trustee in this case. De Ganay v. Lederer, \n250 \nU.S. 376, 381\n, 382 S., 39 S.Ct. 524, 525, 526; New York ex rel. Whitney v. Graves, supra, \n299 \nU.S. 372\n et seq., 57 S.Ct. 238; Wheeling Steel Corp. v. Fox, supra, \n298 \nU.S. 211\n, 56 S.Ct. 777; First Bank Stock Corp. v. Minnesota, \n301 \nU.S. 234\n, 57 S.Ct. 677, 113 A.L.R. 228.\n The stock certificates, bonds or other documents evidencing the intangibles constituting the trust property were never held in Tennessee. Neither their issue or validity nor the enforcement or transfer, inter vivos or from the dead to the living, of any right attested or supported by them was at all dependent on the laws of that State. \n5\n From the beginning, the trust estate has been under the protection of, and necessarily the trusts have been and are being executed under, the laws of Alabama unaffected by those of any other State. See Hutchison v. Ross, 262 N.Y. 381, 394, 187 N.E. 65, 89 A.L.R. 1007; Sewall v. Wilmer, 132 Mass. 131, 137.\n At least since 1917, Mrs. Scales had no power to remove the trust or any of the trust property from Alabama. Exertion of any right or power reserved to her by the indenture was dependent on the laws of Alabama and not upon or subject to those of Tennessee, where she happened to have her domicil. Wachovia Bank & Trust Co. v. Doughton, ubi supra. Subject to the laws of Alabama, all transactions in which the trust properties were capable of being used were identified with that State. The securities, held there not only for safekeeping but as well for collection of income and principal, and subject to sale and reinvestment of proceeds, could not be more com- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 357, 383]\n\u00a0\n pletely localized anywhere. De Ganay v.

No one has doubted the constitutional power of a state to tax its domiciled residents on their shares of stock in a foreign corporation whose only property is real estate located elsewhere, Darnell v. Indiana, \n226 \nU.S. 390\n, 33 S.Ct. 120; Hawley v. Malden, \n232 \nU.S. 1\n, 34 S.Ct. 201, Ann.Cas.1916C, 842; cf. Kidd v. Alabama, \n188 \nU.S. 730\n, 23 S.Ct. 401; Corry v.

Durr, \n257 \nU.S. 99, 108\n, 42 S.Ct. 15, 16; cf. Gish v. Shaver, 140 Ky. 647, 650, 131 S.W. 515; Golden v. Munsinger, 91 Kan. 820, 823, 139 P. 379; Marquette v. Michigan Iron & Land Co., 132 Mich. 130, 92 N.W. 934, or to tax a mortgage of real estate located without the state, even though the land affords the only source of payment, see Kirtland v. Hotchkiss, \n100 \nU.S. 491\n; cf. Savings & Loan Society v. Multnomah County, \n169 \nU.S. 421\n, 18 S.Ct. 392; Bristol v. Washington County, \n177 \nU.S. 133\n, 20 S.Ct. 585; Paddell v. New York, \n211 \nU.S. 446\n, 29 S.Ct. 139, 15 Ann.Cas. 187. Each of these legal interests finds its only economic source in the value of the land, and the rights which are elsewhere subjected to the tax can be brought to their ultimate fruition only through some means of control of the land itself. But the means of control may be subjected to taxation in the state of its owner whether it be a share of stock or a contract or a mortgage. There is no want of jurisdiction to tax these interests where they are owned in the sense that the state lacks power to appropriate them to the payment of the tax. No court has condemned such action as so capricious, arbitrary or oppressive as to bring it within the prohibition of the Fourteenth Amendment, for it is universally recognized that these interests are of themselves in some measure clothed with the legal incidents of property enjoyed by their owner, in the state where he resides, through the benefit and protection of its laws. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] See Footnote 1, ante. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] See also Footnote 2, ante. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] No comparable right or power resided in the beneficiaries upon whom a tax was sought to be levied in Safe Deposit & Trust Co. v.

U.S.(1939)\nNo. 309\nArgued: November 8, 1939Decided: December 4, 1939\n\n\n\n\n[308 \nU.S. 271, 272]\n\u00a0\n Mr. J. L. London, of St. Louis, Mo., for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[308 \nU.S. 271, 274]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Warner W. Gardner, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[308 \nU.S. 271, 276]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n A writ of certiorari was granted1 to review the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit2 affirming a judgment of the District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri which awarded to a property owner, against the United States, compensation in condemnation less in amount than a sum fixed by an arrangement between the parties prior to the institution of the condemnation. This judgment provided for payment of the award into the registry of the court and that upon such payment the United States should be entitled to the relief sought. Although the issue was raised by the landowner, no pro- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 271, 277]\n\u00a0\n vision was made as to interest. The writ was granted to determine important questions of federal law as to the effect in condemnation, of prior agreements by the United States as to the amount of awards and as to the running of interest.\n This proceeding arose in the course of carrying out the protection from destructive floods of the alluvial valley of the Mississippi between Cape Girardeau, Missouri, and Head of Passes, Louisiana. This work of internal improvement was begun under the Flood Control Act of May 15, 1928. 3 The passage of this act followed the disastrous experience with the flood of 1927 and was based upon a comprehensive report and plan known as the Jadwin Plan, Major General Edgar Jadwin, then Chief of Engineers of the United States Army, being in charge of its development. \n4\n The plan covers the great alluvial valley of the Mississippi through its entire length from the Ohio to the delta. In essence, the plan in its entirety is based upon a levee system which constricts the water to a moderate degree and allows in periods of extreme floods the escape from some lower levees, known as fuse-plugs, of the water from the main channel to back waters and floodways.\n The particular portion of the plan involved here is known as the Birds Point-New Madrid Floodway. Prior to the passage of the Flood Control Act, there were levees along the west bank of the Mississippi between Birds Point, Missouri, and New Madrid, Missouri, which substantially followed the meanderings of the river. To get a greater area for the spreading of flood waters, the plan \n\n[308 \nU.S. 271, 278]\n\u00a0\n provided for a second levee to be set back about five miles from the riverbank levee running from Birds Point to St. Johns Bayou, just east of New Madrid. Near its upstream connection with the set-back levee the present riverbank levee would be lowered some five feet by what is called a fuse-plug, so that at high flood the water will begin to flow into the wide floodway below. It is expected that this enlarged channel will keep anticipated floods from rising above the levees protecting Cairo, Illinois. The set-back levee will confine its diverted water to the floodway area between the set-back levee and the riverside levee and will return the water to the Mississippi through a lower fuse-plug section where a gap is left in the levee system to permit complete drainage. The land involved in this condemnation is situated in this floodway immediately east of the set- back levee and about midway between Birds Point and New Madrid.\n The Flood Control Act stipulates that the United States 'shall provide flowage rights for additional destructive flood waters that will pass by reason of diversions from the main channel of the Mississippi River.' The same section authorizes the Secretary of War to 'cause proceedings to be instituted for the acquirement by condemnation of any lands, easements, or rights of way which ... are needed in carrying out this project ....' Jurisdiction of the proceeding is given to the United States district court for the district in which the property is located. Commissioners were authorized to view and value. It was further provided: 'When the owner of any land, easement, or right of way shall fix a price for the same which, in the opinion of the Secretary of War is reasonable, he may purchase the same at such price; ....'5\n There is the additional provision in Section 1 of this same Act, 33 U. S.C.A.  702a, that 'pending completion of any floodway, spillway, \n\n[308 \nU.S. 271, 279]\n\u00a0\n or diversion channel, the areas within the same shall be given the same degree of protection as is afforded by levees on the west side of the river contiguous to the levee at the head of said floodway.'\n Construction work began on the set-back levee on October 21, 1929, and was substantially complete on October 31, 1932. The riverside levee is maintained at its original height of about 58 feet and the upper fuse-plug, which is designed to admit water into the floodway, has not yet been created.\n In January, 1937, the Mississippi River attained its highest flood stage in recorded history. Late in that month the United States Army officer in charge of Memphis Engineers, District No. 1, directed a subordinate to proceed to the area and place the Birds Point-New Madrid Floodway in operation. These instructions were issued by the officer in charge of the district without orders from any superior. The directions were carried out after flood waters were trickling over the riverside levee into the floodway area through a natural crevasse and when pursuant to these orders an artificial crevasse was created by dynamiting the northern portion of the upper fuse-plug section. Later another artificial crevasse was created and other natural crevasses developed. Through these crevasses petitioner's land was flooded. As the river would have reached a stage sufficiently high to overtop the riverside levee, even with extraordinary high-water maintenance, the land of the petitioner would have been flooded without the crevassing. The set-back levee did confine the diverted water to the floodway. It increased its depth and destructiveness on petitioner's land. After the flood subsided, the riverside levee, including the upper fuse-plug section, was restored to its previous height.\n Prior to the institution of this action, orders had been issued by the Secretary of War, under the provisions of \n\n[308 \nU.S. 271, 280]\n\u00a0\n Section 4 of the Flood Control Act, to purchase this tract of land. A letter containing the offer for the flowage rights here involved, dated January 14, 1932, had been received by the petitioner and the offer accepted by him within an agreed extension of the limited time. The letter, so far as pertinent, reads as follows:\n'2. I am accordingly directed by the Chief of Engineers, U.S. Army, to offer you Thirty-one thousand six hundred eighty-one and 98\/100-Dollars ($31,681.98) for a perpetual flowage easement as contemplated by the Act of May 15, 1928, over your land designated as Tract No. 243, as indicated on the inclosed plat, this being the maximum amount that can be offered you under the above authorization.\n\n'3. Should this offer be accepted, friendly condemnation proceedings will be entered in Court, with the request that an agreed verdict be awarded in the amount of this offer. Payment cannot be made without Court action as title cannot be cleared. Acceptance of this offer should expedite final settlement and reduce legal expenses.'\n\n After its acceptance, there was an attempted withdrawal of this offer by a letter of July 8, 1932, which advised the owner that 'after a careful review of the question of flowage over these tracts it was found by higher authority that the prices first suggested could not be properly recommended to the Court.'\n After this letter, a petition was filed by the United States to condemn over the land here in question a perpetual right, power easement, and privilege to overflow, as contemplated by said project and described in House Decument 90. After the appointment and report of the commissioners for the determination of an award, petitioner filed an answer and counterclaim. In the answer he set up that prior to the filing of the suit a 'written offer of settlement for the damages and for the purchase \n\n[308 \nU.S. 271, 281]\n\u00a0\n of an easement' for floodway purposes was made by the United States and accepted by petitioner. Petitioner further alleged an offer of title to the easement sought and a request for the payment of the agreed sum. Judgment against the United States was asked in that amount, 'with interest,' to be paid into court for the benefit of the defendants, in accordance with their respective rights and against the defendants for the perpetual flowage easements 'upon payment into Court' of the agreed sum. Changing the designation of the pleading from answer to counterclaim, these allegations were repeated as a counterclaim. The Court sustained a motion of the United States to strike this answer and counterclaim on the ground that the petitioner had waived his rights under the written agreement because of his failure to plead them prior to the entry of the interlocutory order allowing the condemnation and appointing commissioners. Subsequently the reports of the first and second commissions appointed to view the property were set aside for reasons which are immaterial here. To the report of the third commission, awarding $17,921.70, the petitioner renewed the objection that the agreement between the United States and him was decisive in fixing the award at $31,681.98; asked for interest 'from such time as the Court may find that plaintiff (the United States) appropriated the flowage easement in question' and sought new viewers to determine the award as claimed by petitioners or in the alternative that the Court enter judgment for the sum claimed with appropriate terms to create the flowage easement in the United States.\n Upon this exception a hearing was had and findings and judgment entered confirming this report and adjudging the condemnor the easement sought upon payment of the award. Nothing appeared in the order as to interest. By assignments of error on appeal to the Court of Appeals and in the statement of questions involved \n\n[308 \nU.S. 271, 282]\n\u00a0\n and reasons for granting the writ of certiorari, petitioner has preserved the issues of his right to an award in the agreed amount and to interest from the date found to mark the taking from him of the land.\n Determination of Value.-By answer and exception to the report of the commissioners, the petitioner pleaded the agreement on the value of the easement evidenced by the letter and acceptance referred to above. The Government contends that the 'relevance of the contract ... as a measure of the value of the easement is not in issue; the petitioner pitches his case solely on the proposition that he can enforce the contract.' With this contention we do not agree. In the answer, it is true judgment is prayed against the United States for the agreed amount. But a judgment is offered to the United States for the perpetual flowage easement upon payment of the sum into court. In the objection to the commissioners' report the prayer is for entry of a judgment in the agreed sum 'and upon payment of the same that the Court decree an appropriate judgment in favor of plaintiff for the said easement.' We construe the accepted offer as an agreement to fix the price at the named figure for the easement sought. Paragraph 3 of the letter shows condemnation was in mind.\n This action is brought under the provisions of Section 4 of the Flood Control Act. The jurisdiction of the Court to consider the landowner's contention depends upon the language of that Act, not upon the Tucker Act6 or the general statute on condemnation. \n7\n We have no doubt that the authority to purchase given to the Secretary of War is sufficiently broad to authorize a purchase of petitioner's interest in land subject to perfecting the title through condemnation. The effect of such an agreement \n\n[308 \nU.S. 271, 283]\n\u00a0\n is to fix the value of the easement when the authority of the Court is invoked against a party to the agreement to acquire good title. \n8\n In dealing with a stipulation to waive a requirement of filing a claim for tax refund with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, we held such waiver enforceable in the face of a statutory requirement for such filing. \n9\n The convenience of preparation for trial and the interest of orderly procedure was decisive there. Here the same reasons with the supporting language as to the power of purchase leads to the conclusion that the trial court erred in striking the answer and refusing the motion to determine the value at the agreed price. \n10\n We need not consider the counterclaim as the answer covers the entire subject of the determination of value.\n Interest.-Petitioner seeks interest on the judgment from the time of the taking or appropriation of the flowage easement. Petitioner fixes this appropriation at the time of the enactment of the Flood Control Act of May 15, 1928, on the theory that the passage of that act diminished immediately the value of this property because the plan contemplated the ultimate use of the floodway. Alternatively the date of the taking is fixed by petitioner as of October 21, 1929, when work began on the set- back levee or October 31, 1932, when the set-back levee was completed.\n There is no disagreement in principle. Just compensation is value at the time of the taking. The Congress, in other situations, has adopted the time of taking as the \n\n[308 \nU.S. 271, 284]\n\u00a0\n date for determination of value. \n11\n For the reason that compensation is due at the time of taking, the owner at that time, not the owner at an earlier or later date, receives the payment. \n12\n Unless a taking has occurred previously in actuality or by a statutory provision, which fixes the time of taking by an event such as the filing of an action,13 we are of the view that the taking in a condemnation suit under this statute takes place upon the payment of the money award by the condemnor. No interest is due upon the award. Until taking, the condemnor may discontinue or abandon his effort. 14 The determination of the award is an offer subject to acceptance by the condemnor and thus gives to the user of the sovereign power of eminent domain an opportunity to determine whether the valuations leave the cost of completion within his resources. \n15\n Condemnation is a means by which the sovereign may find out what any piece of property will cost. 'The owner is protected by the rule that title does \n\n[308 \nU.S. 271, 285]\n\u00a0\n not pass until compensation has been ascertained and paid ....'16 A reduction or increase in the value of property may occur by reason of legislation for or the beginning or completion of a project. Such changes in value are incidents of ownership. They cannot be considered as a 'taking' in the constitutional sense.\n In Brown v. United States17 this Court had occasion to consider whether interest should be allowed on the value of the property from the date of summons, the day fixed by the state statute to determine compensation and damages. In that case condemnation proceeded under the federal conformity statute which directs federal courts to conform to state practice and procedure, 'as near as may be.' \n18\n Interest, it was thought, was not governed by the conformity act,19 but should be allowed in accordance with the state law from the date of summons. This conclusion flowed from the acceptance by this Court, without question, of the day of summons as the date for the determination of value, the day of taking. \n20\n Here proceedings are under a Flood Control Act prescribing \n\n[308 \nU.S. 271, 286]\n\u00a0\n jurisdiction and procedure. Where the condemnation is free from statutory direction, as here, there would be no interest before the taking. \n21\n\u00a0\n\n This leaves for consideration the contention that there was a taking by the enactment of the legislation, when work began on the set-back levee or when that levee was completed. The mere enactment of legislation which authorizes condemnation of property cannot be a taking. Such legislation may be repealed or modified, or appropriations may fail. \n22\n\u00a0\n\n For completion of the set-back levee to amount to a taking, it must result in an appropriation of the property to the uses of the Government. 23 This levee is substantially complete. The Government has condemned the land upon which the set-back is built. The tract now in litigation lies between the set-back and riverbank levees. The Government could become liable for a taking, in whole or in part, even without direct appropriation, by such construction as would put upon this land a burden, actually experienced, of caring for floods greater than it bore prior to the construction. The riverbank levee at the fuse-plug has not been lowered from its previous height. Consequently the land is as well protected from destructive floods as formerly. We cannot conclude that the retention of water from unusual floods for a somewhat longer period or its increase in depth or destructiveness by reason of the set-back levee, has the effect of taking. We agree with the Court of Appeals that this is \n\n[308 \nU.S. 271, 287]\n\u00a0\n 'an incidental consequence' of the building of the set-back levee. \n24\n Nor can we conclude that a taking occurred through the act of the Army officers in dynamiting the levee during the emergency of the 1937 flood. It was restored to its previous height. Up until this time, the plan for a fuse-plug to permit the escape of destructive flood waters was not in effect. Indeed, the petitioner disclaims any contention that the crevassing of the levee by the Government was a taking. The taking, he urges, took place before and this use is only evidence of the control obtained by the prior taking.\n Reversed in part and affirmed in part. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \n308 \nU.S. 538\n, 60 S.Ct. 113, 84 L.Ed. --. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 102 F.2d 5, 105 F.2d 318. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] 45 Stat. 534, 33 U.S.C.  702a-702m, 33 U.S.C.A.  702a-702m. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] The plan is found in 'Flood Control in the Mississippi Valley,' H.R.

CORWIN(1939)\nNo. 391\nArgued: February 2, 1939Decided: February 27, 1939\n\n\n\n\n[306 \nU.S. 363, 364]\n\u00a0\n\n No. 391\n:\n The Attorney General, and Mr. Norman D. Keller, of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n Mr. Hugh W. McCulloch, of Chicago, Ill., for respondent.\n No. 482:\n Mr. E. J. Dimock, of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. Norman D. Keller, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\nNo. 391.\n The question is whether the entire value or only one-half the value of real property-purchased by a decedent with his own funds and held at his death by his wife and himself under a joint tenancy set up prior to 1916-may be included in the decedent's gross estate under the 1924 Revenue Act.\n In 1909, real estate in Illinois was conveyed to W. Francis Jacobs, the decedent, and Elizabeth C. Jacobs, his wife, 'as joint tenants' and this joint tenancy continued until decedent's death; the wife never contributed any part of, or consideration for, the joint property; decedent died June 17, 1924 (after the effective date of the 1924 Revenue Act), and as survivor the wife became sole owner in fee of the whole of the joint property.\n The Commissioner included the full value of the property in decedent's gross estate for taxation under the 1924 \n\n[306 \nU.S. 363, 365]\n\u00a0\n Act. As executrix, respondent paid the tax, and sought recovery in the District Court which held that the estate tax could be imposed only upon one-half of the joint property's total value. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Respondent construes the 1924 Revenue Act as taxing-by its terms-only one-half the value of the joint property, and contends that inclusion of the property's entire value for estate tax purposes would as retroactive taxation violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, U.S.C.A. Const.\n First. It is clear that Congress intended, by Section 302 of the 1924 Act, 2 to include in the gross estate of a decedent the full value at death of all property owned by him and any other in joint tenancy or by the entirety-irrespective of the date of the tenancy's creation-insofar as the property or consideration therefor is traceable to the decedent. Subdivision (h) of Section 302 specifically provided that the provisions of section 302 relating to joint tenancies should 'apply to the transfers, trusts, estates, interests, rights, powers, and relinquishment of powers, as ... described \n\n[306 \nU.S. 363, 366]\n\u00a0\n therein whether made, created, arising, existing, exercised or relinquished before or after the enactment of this Act.' (Italics supplied .) Section 302(h) was enacted in the 1924 Act after this Court, on May 1, 1922, had decided that the 1916 Act did not purport to impose an estate tax measured by the value of property held in joint tenancies created prior to the 1916 Act (39 Stat. 756). 3 'The clear language of the 1924 statute repels the notion that it has no application to joint tenancies created prior to September 8, 1916.'4\n Second. Here, decedent paid the entire purchase price of the joint property with his own individual funds and, therefore, the 1924 statute required the inclusion of the full value of the joint property in his gross estate. Contending that the tax as so applied is retroactive, respondent insists that the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment forbids such taxation. The reasoning is that a one-half interest in the joint property was transferred to, and vested in the wife in 1909; that the tax in question only applies to transfers; and that the one-half interest transferred to the wife in 1909 could not thereafter (1924) be taxed as a part of decedent's gross estate without retroactively applying the tax to the 1909 transfer.\n But the tax was not levied on the 1909 transfer and was not retroactive. At decedent's death in 1924, ownership and beneficial rights in the property which had \n\n[306 \nU.S. 363, 367]\n\u00a0\n existed in both tenants jointly changed into the single ownership of the survivor. This change in ownership, attributable to the special character of joint tenancies, was made the occasion for an excise, to be measured by the value of the property in which the change of ownership occurred. Had the tenancy not been created, this survivorship and change of ownership would not have taken place, but the tax does not operate retroactively merely because some of the facts or conditions upon which its application depends came into being prior to the enactment of the tax. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n Death duties or excises imposed upon the occasion of change in legal relationships to property brought about by death are ancient in origin. \n6\n Congress has the power to levy a tax upon the occasion of a joint tenant's acquiring the status of survivor at the death of a co-tenant. In holding that the full value of an estate by the entirety may constitutionally be included in a decedent's gross estate for estate tax purposes, this Court said: 'The question ... is, not whether there has been, in the strict sense of that word, a 'transfer' of the property by the death of the decedent, or a receipt of it by right of succession, but whether the death has brought into being or ripened for the survivor, property rights of such character as to make appropriate the imposition of a tax upon that result (which Congress may call a transfer tax, a death duty or anything else it sees fit), to be measured, in whole or in part, by the value of such rights. ...\n'At ... (the co-tenant's) death, however, and because of it, ... ( the survivor) for the first time, became \n\n[306 \nU.S. 363, 368]\n\u00a0\n entitled to exclusive possession, use and enjoyment; she ceased to hold the property subject to qualifications imposed by the law relating to tenancy by the entirety, and became entitled to hold and enjoy it absolutely as her own; and then, and then only, she acquired the power, not theretofore possessed, of disposing of the property by an exercise of her sole will. Thus the death of one of the parties to the tenancy became the 'generating source' of important and definite accessions to the property rights of the other. These circumstances, together with the fact, the existence of which the statute requires, that no part of the property originally had belonged to the wife, are sufficient, in our opinion, to make valid the inclusion of the property in the gross estate which forms the primary base for the measurement of the tax.'7\n\n Thereafter, it was further decided that the full value of the property passing to a survivor under a tenancy by the entirety created prior to the estate tax of 1916 could be included in the gross estate. \n8\n Congress-it has been held-may also constitutionally apply an estate tax to the whole of a joint tenancy created after the 1916 Act,9 and to half of a joint tenancy created prior to the 1916 Act, where the decedent alone had furnished consideration for the joint property. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n It is urged that these decisions do not support the tax here upon the full value of the joint property, because \n\n[306 \nU.S. 363, 369]\n\u00a0\n this tenancy was created prior to the estate tax law of 1916. Respondent relies upon differences in the nature of tenancies by the entirety and joint tenancies in order to remove the present case from the application of these prior adjudications. Since a joint tenant's interest in realty is severable and subject to sale, the argument is that upon the death of a co- tenant the survivor actually receives nothing more than the decedent's one- half interest and therefore no more can be subjected to a death duty. On the other hand, respondent explains the permissible taxation of the whole of a tenancy by the entirety by reference to the 'amiable fiction' 11 of the common law, under which ownership of a husband and wife in tenancy by the entirety is deemed a single individual unity and each owns all and every part of the property so held. By virtue of this feudal fiction of complete ownership in each of two persons, the surviving tenant by the entirety is conceived to be the recipient of all the property upon the death of the co-tenant, and therefore-it is said-all the property can be taxed.\n The constitutionality of an exercise of the taxing power of Congress is not to be determined by such shadowy and intricate distinctions of common law property concepts and ancient fictions. \n12\n The Constitution grants \n\n[306 \nU.S. 363, 370]\n\u00a0\n Congress the 'Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts, and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare.' U.S.C.A.Const. art. 1,  8, cl. 1. No more essential or important power has been conferred upon the Congress and the presumption that an Act of Congress is valid applies with added force and weight to a levy of public revenue. \n13\n\u00a0\n\n In addition, there is sufficient substantial similarity between joint tenancies and tenancies by the entirety to have moved Congress to treat them alike for purposes of taxation. Practical necessities-and taxation is 'eminently practical'14-may well have led Congress to group different types of joint ownership together for taxation rather than to afford different treatment to each varying shade of such ownership. A tenancy by the entirety 'is essentially a joint tenancy, modified by the common law theory that husband and wife are one person.' \n15\n Only a fiction stands between the two. Survivorship is the predominant and distinguishing feature of each. The 'grand incident of joint estate is the doctrine of survivorship, 'by which, when two or more persons are seized of a joint estate, ... the entire tenancy upon the decease of any of them remains to the survivors, and at length to the last survivor; and he shall be entitled to the whole estate, whatever it may be'.' 16\n While it is true that until the death of decedent here each joint tenant possessed the right to sever the joint tenancy, each was nevertheless subjected to the hazard of losing the complete estate to the other as survivor. Prior to decedent's death, his wife had no right to dispose of her interest by will, nor could it pass to her legal \n\n[306 \nU.S. 363, 371]\n\u00a0\n heirs. She might survive and thereby obtain a complete fee to the property with attendant rights of possession and disposition by will or otherwise. Until the death of her co-tenant, the wife could have severed the joint tenancy and thus have escaped the application of the estate tax of which she complains. Upon the death of her co-tenant she for the first time became possessed of the sole right to sell the entire property without risk of loss which might have resulted from partition or separate sale of her interest while decedent lived. There was-at his death-a distinct shifting of economic interest,17 a decided change for the survivor's benefit. This termination of a joint tenancy marked by a change in the nature of ownership of property was designated by Congress as an appropriate occasion for the imposition of a tax. Neither the amount of the tax nor its application to the survivor's change of status and ownership, was in any manner dependent upon the date of the joint tenancy's creation, whether before, or after, 1916. It is immaterial that Congress chose to measure the amount of the tax by a percentage of the total value of the property, rather than by a part, or by a set sum for each such change. The wisdom both of the tax and of its measurement was for Congress to determine.\n No. 482 involves provisions of the 1926 Revenue Act (44 Stat. 9) substantially identical to those of the 1924 Act considered above. Here, also, a joint tenancy (in personal property) was created by man and wife prior to 1916. However, not all of the joint property was contributed by the decedent, but a portion was contributed to the tenancy by the wife who survived. This property \n\n[306 \nU.S. 363, 372]\n\u00a0\n which she transferred to the tenancy had in turn been previously given to her-without consideration-by decedent before the creation of the joint tenancy. At decedent's death in 1930, an estate tax was assessed and paid upon the full value of the joint property, including that part contributed by the survivor but ultimately traceable to the decedent.\n The District Court held that the full value of the joint property was taxable, 18 and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. \n19\n\u00a0\n\n The contention that the 1926 tax is unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment because imposed upon the total value of the joint tenancy at decedent's death is without merit, for reasons stated in No. 391.\n However, there is here the further argument that the courts below erred in construing the 1926 Act to require the inclusion in the gross estate of that part of the joint property (shares of stock) contributed to the joint tenancy by the survivor, but which had been paid for and given to her by decedent prior to the creation of the tenancy.\n Although subdivision (h) of Section 302 of the 1926 Act, 26 U.S.C.A.  411(h), specifically required inclusion in the gross estate of the full value of the joint property at death in proportion to the decedent's contribution to the purchase price, petitioner relies upon that part of subdivision (e) which excepts 'such part (of the joint property) ... as may be shown to have originally belonged to ... (the survivor) and never to have been received or acquired by the latter from the decedent for less than an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth.' Petitioner insists that this exception should be read 'except such parts thereof as may be shown to have originally belonged to (the sur- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 363, 373]\n\u00a0\n vivor) and never after the passage of this Act to have been received or acquired by the latter from the decedent for less than an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth.'\n The surviving joint tenant in this case comes squarely within the governing statutory provision because she 'received' and 'acquired' all of the property contributed by her to the joint tenancy 'from the decedent for less than an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth.' This language adopted by Congress clearly and unambiguously indicates the purpose to tax the entire value of a joint tenancy under circumstances shown by this record. We are without authority to add language to the statute directly contrary to such a clearly expressed purpose.\n The judgment in No. 391 is reversed and that in No. 482 is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, Mr. Justice BUTLER, and Mr. Justice ROBERTS think that the judgment in No. 391 should be affirmed and that in No. 482 should be reversed.\n It has long been the settled doctrine of this court that Congress cannot retroactively tax, as testamentary, a transfer consummated in accordance with existing law before the adoption of a system of estate taxation, and where the parties, at the time of the transaction, had no notice of intent to tax it as a transfer in contemplation of death or to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after death. \n1\n In order to avoid holding taxing acts \n\n[306 \nU.S. 363, 374]\n\u00a0\n unconstitutional on this ground, the court has often construed them as applying prospectively only. \n2\n Reliance is placed by the government on decisions sustaining inclusion in the estate of one spouse of the entire value of an estate by the entireties. In the earlier cases wherein the exaction was upheld the act operated prospectively and affected only such an estate arising after passage of the statute,3 or the estate came into being after the adoption of a system of taxation which might well include such a transfer within its scope. 4 Subsequently the inclusion of the entire value in the taxable estate of one spouse was sustained where the tenancy by the entireties antedated the passage of the estate tax acts. \n5\n The decision was based upon the peculiar nature of a tenancy by the entireties as expounded in Tyler v. United States. A transfer tax measured by one-half the value of an estate in joint tenancy has been approved although the estate was created prior to the adoption of the system of estate taxes;6 but the court has never passed upon the validity of such a tax measured by the value of the entire joint estate. There are marked differences between a tenancy by the entireties and a joint tenancy in respect of the power of one tenant to destroy the joint estate, to transfer or encumber his interest and otherwise obtain the fruits of it. In order to prevent evasion Congress may include the value of the entire estate in the gross estate as a measure of the tax where the estate originates after \n\n[306 \nU.S. 363, 375]\n\u00a0\n adoption of the law. \n7\n But it may not retroactively apply such measure to an estate created at a time when its creators had no reason to expect that such a tax would be laid in view of the settled rules of property. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 7 Cir., 97 F.2d 784. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] The 1924 Act imposed a tax (Sec. 301, Act of 1924, 43 Stat. 253, 303, 26 U.S.C.A.  410 note) 'upon the transfer of the net estate of every decedent dying after' the Act's enactment, and included (Sec. 302, 26 U.S. C.A.  411 note) in each gross estate the value of 'the interest ... (in property) held as joint tenants by the decedent and any other person, or as tenants by the entirety by the decedent and spouse, ... except such part thereof as may be shown to have originally belonged to such other person and never to have been received or acquired by the latter from the decedent for less than a fair consideration in money or money's worth: Provided, That where such property or any part thereof, or part of the consideration with which such property was acquired, is shown to have been at any time acquired by such other person from the decedent for less than a fair consideration in money or money's worth, there shall be excepted only such part of the value of such property as is proportionate to the consideration furnished by such other person ....' \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Shwab v.

Respondent relies upon language of the Knox case to support the contention that Sec. 302 of the 1924 Act is retroactive in its effect on joint tenancies such as the one here. However, the actual judgment of the Court in that case went no further than to hold that the terms of the 1916 Act there considered did not require the inclusion-in gross estates- of the value of property held in joint tenancies created prior to the enactment of that particular law. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] Gwinn v.

STATE REVENUE COMMISSION OF GEORGIA(1939)\nNo. 260\nArgued: December 16, 1938Decided: January 30, 1939\n\n\n\n\n[306 \nU.S. 72, 73]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Allan Watkins and Edgar Watkins, both of Atlanta, Ga., for appellant.\n Messrs. O. H. Dukes, of Valdosta, Ga., and M. J. Yeomans, of Atlanta, Ga., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question is whether, as applied in this case by the highest court of the State, the Georgia Maintenance Tax Act1 violates the commerce clause of article 1,  8, cl. 3, or the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, U.S.C.A.\n Appellant is an Ohio corporation engaged exclusively in interstate transportation as a common carrier of property for hire by motor vehicles, including hauling between points in Georgia and points in other States. A certificate of convenience and necessity issued by the Interstate Commerce Commission authorizing appellant's in \n\n[306 \nU.S. 72, 74]\n\u00a0\n terstate transportation in Georgia,2 does not extend to transportation over rural post roads, which are roads not included in the state highway system over which United States mail is carried. \n 3\n\u00a0\n\n Appellant owns for use in its business about 100 pieces of equipment consisting of trucks and tractors with manufacturer's rated capacity of a ton and a half and two tons and trailers having factory weight of 4,000 pounds. If used to haul not for hire, the tax on each ton-and-a-half motor vehicle is $15; on each two-ton vehicle, $30; and on each trailer, $30. But when used to haul either as a common or contract carrier for hire, the taxes are respectively, $50, $75, and $50.  3.\n For the collection of tax on one of appellant's two-ton trucks, the state revenue commission obtained from the superior court of Fulton County an execution on which it caused the sheriff to levy upon that vehicle. Appellant gave a bond to the sheriff with an affidavit of illegality. \n4\n In order to avoid seizure of all of appellant's equipment, the state commission allowed it to deposit in escrow the amount claimed under the Act on account of other equipment and agreed that levy should be made only on the one truck. The commission demurred; the superior court sustained the demurrer and dismissed the affidavit. The supreme court affirmed. 186 Ga. 228, 197 S.E. 887.\n In addition to the description of appellant's equipment, operations, and use of Georgia highways given above, the statements of the affidavit of illegality, so far as concerns the issues here to be decided, may be summarized as follows:\n The Act directs that upon payment of the maintenance tax the director of the motor vehicles division of the state \n\n[306 \nU.S. 72, 75]\n\u00a0\n commission shall issue a tag ( 9), and that the money derived from the sale of these tags shall be allocated to the United States rural postal roads division of the Georgia highway department.  11. Thus, no part of it is applicable to highways over which appellant operates. The maintenance taxes on its equipment for each year will be about $6,000. In addition, the Georgia laws require it to pay $3 for a license tag5 and $25 for a public service tag6 for each vehicle and six cents per gallon of gasoline purchased in Georgia;7 it annually buys in that State about 90, 000 gallons. Two-thirds of the gasoline tax is for maintenance of state aid highways. \n8\n Appellant hauls in seven States; annually its trucks travel an average of 6,870,000 miles of which 725,000, less than 11 per cent of the total, are in Georgia. The 1936 total taxes collected by Georgia amounted to $30,058,092.68, of which motor vehicles bore $19,207,909.59 in license and fuel taxes.\n In conclusion, the affidavit asserts that the tax in question is an unreasonable fee for appellant's use of the roads and is therefore repugnant to the commerce clause, and that it discriminates against carriers for hire in favor of carriers not for hire and for that reason violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S.C.A. Const.\n\n 1. \nIs the Act repugnant to the commerce clause?\n With exceptions not material here, it requires that all who own or have exclusive right to use for more than 30 days a motor bus, truck,9 or trailer 'shall pay a maintenance tax for the operation ... upon and over the public \n\n[306 \nU.S. 72, 76]\n\u00a0\n roads of this State' ( 1) according to a schedule ( 3) which specifies the amount of the tax on each vehicle. The Act makes no distinction between vehicles used in intrastate commerce and those used in interstate commerce. It discriminates in favor of equipment used not for hire. It lays upon trucks and tractors taxes graduated according to manufacturer's rated capacities and upon trailers amounts graduated according to factory weights. The tax imposed on appellant is the same as if it operated exclusively in intrastate commerce of carried on both intrastate and interstate transportation.\n It is elementary that a State may not impose a tax on the privilege of engaging in interstate commerce. Sprout v. South Bend, \n277 \nU.S. 163, 171\n, 48 S.Ct. 502, 504, 62 A.L.R. 45; Interstate Transit, Inc., v. Lindsey, \n283 \nU.S. 183, 185\n, 51 S.Ct. 380; Gwin, White & Prince, Inc. v. Henneford, \n305 \nU.S. 434\n, 59 S.Ct. 325; decided January 3, 1939, and cases there cited; also those cited in the concurring opinion. But, consistently with the commerce clause, a State may impose upon vehicles used exclusively for interstate transportation a fair and reasonable tax as compensation for the privilege of using its highways for that purpose. The applicable principle is stated in Hendrick v. Maryland, \n235 \nU.S. 610\n, 35 S.Ct. 140. We there said (pages 623, 624, 35 S.Ct. page 142): 'In view of the many decisions of this court there can be no serious doubt that where a state at its own expense furnishes special facilities for the use of those engaged in commerce, interstate as well as domestic, it may exact compensation therefor. The amount of the charges and the method of collection are primarily for determination by the state itself; and so long as they are reasonable and are fixed according to some uniform, fair, and practical standard, they constitute no burden on interstate commerce.' That rule has been applied in many cases. See e.g. Kane v. New Jersey, \n242 \nU.S. 160, 168\n, 169 S., 37 S.Ct. 30, 32, 33; Clark v. Poor, \n274 \nU.S. 554, 557\n, 47 S.Ct. 702, 703; Sprout v.

Bingaman, \n298 \nU.S. 407, 412\n, 56 S.Ct. 756, 758. While ordinarily state action is deemed valid unless the contrary appears, we have held that to sustain a charge by the State for the use or privilege of using its roads for interstate transportation, it must affirmatively appear that the charge is exacted as compensation or to pay the cost of policing its highways. Sprout v. South Bend, supra; Interstate Transit, Inc. v. Lindsey, supra, 186, 51 S.Ct. page 381; Ingels v. Morf, \n300 \nU.S. 290, 294\n, 57 S.Ct. 439, 441.\n The scope and language of the challenged enactment unmistakably disclose intention of the State to require payment of compensation for the privilege of operating over its roads the specified vehicles for the transportation of property. It contains no hint of hostility to interstate commerce or of purpose to impose a charge on the privilege or business of interstate transportation. The exaction is not to be deemed offensive to the commerce clause merely because the State, in the conduct of its fiscal affairs, chooses to use part or all of the proceeds for purposes other than the construction, improvement, or maintenance of its highways. Clark v. Poor, supra, page 557, 47 S.Ct. page 703; Morf v. Bingaman, supra, 412, 56 S.Ct. page 758.\n The affidavit of illegality fails to allege any facts tending to show that a reasonable charge for the privilege is less than the amount exacted for it. Appellant does not claim that the privilege to operate for a year 100 pieces of its equipment over any or all the State's roads is not worth $ 6,000, the amount of the taxes in controversy. It does not disclose what the taxes in question amount to per truck, tractor, or trailer mile, per ton hauled, or per ton mile, nor does it compare the amount of the taxes with total operating expenses or with operating revenues. The figures furnished indicate that the tax imposed on account of the use of each vehicle amounts to about 20 cents a day and that, on appellant's business in 1936, it was about eight mills per vehicle mile. The \n\n[306 \nU.S. 72, 78]\n\u00a0\n amounts paid for license tags, public service tags, and taxes on gasoline are without significance in this case. Interstate Busses Corp. v. Blodgett, \n276 \nU.S. 245, 251\n, 252 S., 48 S.Ct. 230, 231. The allegation to the effect that in 1936 motor vehicles in Georgia bore, in license and fuel taxes, over 62 per cent of the total taxes collected by the State is too vague for use in any estimate of or study for the ascertainment of the value of appellant's use, or of its privilege to use, the State's roads.\n Appellant's failure to disclose whether it fully availed itself of the privilege to use the roads leaves the figures reflecting actual use without foundation and worthless as a measure or indication of the value of that privilege. And, in view of the seemingly low charge for the operation of its vehicles per day or mile, its failure to furnish evidentiary details material to the issue of reasonableness makes against its contention that the challenged exactions so exceed the worth of the granted use of the roads that they are to be deemed taxes on the privilege of carrying on its business of interstate transportation and tends to confirm appellee's claim that they constitute pay for the specified operations over the State's roads.\n We find that the challenged enactment does not violate the commerce clause.\n\n 2. \nIs the Act repugnant to the equal protection clause? Appellant insists that it is because of the higher taxes imposed on those who haul for hire. But it fails to show lack of facts sufficient to justify the discrimination. In the absence of proof to the contrary, it is to be assumed that the use of the roads by one hauling not for hire is generally limited to transportation of his own property as an incident to his occupation or business and that it is substantially less than that of one who is engaged in the business of common carrier thereon for hire. As hauling not for hire is likely to be occasional and accessory and as hauling for hire is a business the success \n\n[306 \nU.S. 72, 79]\n\u00a0\n of which depends on the loading of the vehicles used and mileage made by them, the classification complained of may not be held arbitrary or without reasonable foundation.

Miller, both of Harrisburg, Pa., and Herbert B. Cohen, of York, Pa., for appellants.\n Mr. Clarence W. Miles, of Baltimore, Md., for appellee. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 104, 107]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice REED, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from the decree of a three-judge district court granting a permanent injunction against the enforcement of temporary rates. Sec. 266, Jud.Code, 28 U.S.C.A.  380.\n The appellants are five named persons, individually and as members of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, and the Utility Consumers League of York, Pennsylvania, intervening defendant below, an unincorporated association of consumers of electric current in the territory served by the appellee. The latter is a public utility corporation organized under the laws of Pennsylvania, which generates, transmits, distributes and sells electric energy approximately 30,000 customers in and about York, Pennsylvania.\n An investigation to determine the reasonableness of appellee's rates was instituted on January 27, 1936. During its progress the state legislature recodified the utility law of Pennsylvania. Act of May 28, 1937, P.L. 1053, Title 66, P.S.Pa.  1101 et seq. It enacted a temporary rate section, 310, which is the source of this controversy.\n Acting under Sec. 310, the commission, after notice and argument, issued a temporary rate order on July 13, 1937, requiring the utility to file rate schedules which would effect a reduction of approximately $435, 000 in annual gross operating revenues. This order was replaced by another on July 27, 1937, which commanded an identical reduction. This time the commission itself prescribed a \n\n[307 \nU.S. 104, 108]\n\u00a0\n schedule of rates. The utility filed a bill in equity in a statutory court in the Middle District of Pennsylvania. On October 15, 1937, a permanent injunction issued. \n1\n The Commission did not appeal. On November 30, 1937, another order was issued seeking to establish the same temporary rates and to secure the same reduction in gross revenues as the orders of July 13 and 27.\n On December 14, 1937, the utility filed a bill in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to enjoin this order. A three-judge court was convened under Sec. 266 of the Judicial Code. By stipulation of the parties the application for an interlocutory injunction brought to hearing on January 17, 1938, was treated as an application for a permanent injunction. On October 14, 1938, a permanent injunction issued.\n The court concluded as a matter of law that the utility had no plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the state courts; that the order is void because the 'commission acted in direct violation of the mandatory provisions of the Public Utility Act which requires rates for (the company) to be fixed under paragraph (b) of section 310'; that the order is unconstitutional because (1) it violates the procedural requirements of due process, (2) it fails to permit the utility to earn a fair return on the fair value of its property used and useful in the public service, (3) it confiscates the company's property, and (4) it is not supported by substantial evidence. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n Jurisdiction of the Statutory Court.-Except as modified by the Johnson Act, 3 jurisdiction exists in a statutory court, called pursuant to Sec. 266 of the Judicial Code, to hear and finally determine bills in equity seeking tem- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 104, 109]\n\u00a0\n porary and permanent injunctions against the order of a state administrative commission on the ground of irreparable injury. \n4\n By this amendatory act, where the order attacked as violative of the Federal Constitution affects the rates of a public utility, does not interfere with interstate commerce and has been made after notice and hearing, the jurisdiction of the district court to enjoin its enforcement is withdrawn, unless no 'plain, speedy and efficient remedy may be had, at law or in equity, in the courts of such State.' No challenge to the jurisdiction was made in the statutory court or on appeal. In response to questions from the bench, counsel for the commission conceded that there was no remedy in the state courts which would satisfy the Johnson Act.\n The reason for this concession lies, so far as a remedy in equity is concerned, in the provision of the Pennsylvania statute forbidding an injunction against an order, 'except in a proceeding questioning the jurisdiction of the commission.' \n5\n The bill in certain allegations attacks the section of the Public Utility Law under which this order issued as violative of the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S.C.A.Const., in that it empowered the commission to fix non-compensatory and discriminatory temporary rates, in an arbitrary manner. In one sense this questions the ju- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 104, 110]\n\u00a0\n risdiction of the commission. If Sec. 310 is invalid, there is no other provision to authorize temporary rates. Jurisdiction is a word of uncertain meaning. As used in Sec. 1111, supra, it apparently refers to proceedings by the commission under the terms of the statute. In this use it would permit an injunction, equitable grounds being shown, where the public utility is not covered by the act. Otherwise, action in excess of the powers of the commission, such as a confiscatory rate, might be deemed beyond its jurisdiction. At any rate, without an authoritative determination by the state courts, we cannot say, for this character of proceeding, that the remedy in the state courts is plain, speedy and efficient. 6 The remedy at law by appeal is ineffective to protect the utility's position pendente lite. The supersedeas does not postpone the application of the temporary rates. \n7\n The statutory court had jurisdiction of the bill.\n Statutory Basis for the Order.-Sec. 3108 contains several subsections. The commission fixed the temporary rates under subsection (a). The district court concluded as a matter of law that this action was invalid because they could only be fixed under subsection (b). The two subsections are set out below. \n9\n In its opinion, without \n\n[307 \nU.S. 104, 111]\n\u00a0\n discussing Sec. 310(b), the court declared Sec. 310(a) unconstitutional because it permitted the commission to fix a temporary rate based upon the single factor of original cost less depreciation. 10 The commission, however, did not confine itself to that one element in setting the fair value of the appellee's property, for the purpose of temporary rates, at $ 5,250,000. It gave weight to reproduction cost, original cost, going concern value and the necessity for working capital, and it allowed on this rate base a return of more than six per cent. This, of course, \n\n[307 \nU.S. 104, 112]\n\u00a0\n satisfies the requirement of Sec. 310(a) that the temporary rates shall produce not less than 5% On the 'original cost, less accrued depreciation.'\n Appellee's first contention is that the decree may be sustained for the sole reason that the commission should have proceeded under subsection ( b) because the appellee does not have continuing property records. As the conclusion of the lower court on this point is not supported by a state decision, we analyze for ourselves the provisions of the sections. It is clear from the language of Sec. 310(a) that it is applicable not only to public utilities whose reports to the commission show the original cost of their physical property but also to those whose original cost is not so shown. The last clause of the section authorizes the commission to estimate such cost. There is no provision in 310(a) which limits its application to those utilities which maintain the continuing property records of Sec. 502.11 Section 310(b), see note 9, furnishes a partial alternative for Sec. 310(a). Where there are no continuing property records, as provided by Sec. 502, the commission must in fixing the temporary rate arrange for an least a five per cent return on original cost under (a) or the return of an operating income under (b) equal to that for the year 1935 or a subsequent year, as determined by the commission. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 104, 113]\n\u00a0\n Appellee urges next that the section permits the commission to disregard present cost, depreciate original cost, omit indirect and overhead items of construction, and exclude allowances for working capital or going concern value. Although these items were considered by the commission, the appellee contends that the order is invalid because Sec. 310(a) might have been complied with by providing a return of 5% On the original cost depreciated. The argument seems to be that a statute which permits an unconstitutional determination is invalid, even though it is actually applied in a constitutional manner. \n12\n\u00a0\n\n The commission drew the order in accord with the prior ruling of the Middle District Court on a former order in this rate proceeding. \n13\n The former order had also fixed temporary rates but had not set out the findings of value deemed essential by the court. Although the reversal of the commission's order had actually turned on the failure to show the factual basis for the rates, as the district court had stated that compliance with Smyth v. Ames14 was necessary in temporary rate making, the commission based the order now under review on evidence requisite under that rule. By taking this position, it interprets the statute as requiring consideration of elements other than original cost in fixing temporary rates. It is not suggested that the commission omitted consideration of any necessary element in the present order. If we assume with the appellee that the constitutionality of a \n\n[307 \nU.S. 104, 114]\n\u00a0\n delegation of rate making authority is to be tested by what a rate making body may rightfully do under the delegation rather than what it does, appellee's case is advanced not one whit. We have here an interpretation of the Pennsylvania statute by the board charged with its enforcement that it must weigh all the essential elements of valuation required by our past decisions.\n There is nothing in the language of Sec. 310(a) which requires a different construction. The commission is authorized to fix temporary rates. There is no requirement as to how the rates are to be determined, except that they shall be sufficient to return a given minimum-not less than 5% On the original cost, less depreciation. The language authorizing the fixing of temporary rates is cast, except as to the limitation just referred to, in much the same pattern as the language of Sec. 309, 66 P.S. Pa.  1149, authorizing the determination of permanent rates. The latter section reads: '... the commission shall determine the just and reasonable rates ....' A different construction would raise the novel and important question of the constitutionality of a temporary rate, based solely on depreciated original cost, with provision for recoupment of the loss from insufficient temporary rates. \n15\n In the absence of an \n\n[307 \nU.S. 104, 115]\n\u00a0\n authoritative state decision, we are reluctant to accept a construction which brings forward that issue, particularly when the case may reasonably be determined upon the interpretation of the officials of the state charged with the administration of the act. \n16\n This course observes the very salutary rule that 'this Court will not decide an issue of constitutionality if the case may justly and reasonably be decided under a construction of the statute under which the act is clearly constitutional.' \n 17\n\u00a0\n\n Confiscation.-There remains for examination the appellee's argument that the decree of the district court enjoining the enforcement of the order should be sustained because it is confiscatory. The commission, as of November 30, 1937, found the rate base, revenue, expenses and rate, as set out below. \n18\n Appellee urges here that the commission's figures are erroneous in the following particulars: (1) The rate base should be $5,866, 081; (2) the rate should be 7 1\/2 per cent; (3) two items of expense, disallowed by the commission should be added to the operating expenses, (a) some increase in annual salaries and (b) rate case expenses on books to November \n\n[307 \nU.S. 104, 116]\n\u00a0\n 15, 1937; (4) allowance should be made for a prospective loss of annual profit by reason of the loss of a large customer, through abandonment of railway service by York Railways Company.\n\n\n (1)\n The commission estimated the original cost as of December 31, 1936, at $4,576,169.73. The company estimated the original cost as of November 30, 1936, exclusive of financing charges, at $4,619,364 and its book cost as of December 31, 1936, at $4,578,793. If, to the highest of these items, we add $164,000 for working capital and $142,851.07, representing net additions to September 30, 1937, the amounts claimed by the company, the original cost rate base is found to be not more than $4, 926,215.07.\n The commission excluded the cost of financing because there was no evidence of any actual expenditures for such purpose or of any studies of such cost. We find no error in this. \n19\n There was here no foundation for an estimate. 20 Appellee's suggestion that evidence supporting its claim is found in the capitalization chart of York Railways Company, the owner of appellee's common stock, is not accepted. This shows the discount, $298, 825, paid by the parent company on $2,706,000 face amount of bonds of various issues between 1909 and 1925. It appears that $1,027,904 of the proceeds was expended for construction work of the York Edison Company, apparently appellee's predecessor. Nothing is shown as to the cost of this money to the appellee. It may have given notes for or been charged with this exact amount, without a finance charge. The financing cost to appellee may have been covered by the interest rate. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 104, 117]\n\u00a0\n The commission made no specific allowance for going concern value. It did, however, state that it had weighed the going concern value with other factors to determine fair value. It gave practical effect to this consideration when it fixed fair value several hundred thousand dollars in excess of its average of original and reproduction cost, both depreciated. In the computations by the company of original and reproduction costs, allowances were made for the overhead expense of creating the aggregate of land, buildings, and equipment, making up the utility. No tangible evidence of any unusual situation justifying any definite further allowance appears in the testimony of appellee's witness Seelye. The plant of the utility without the utilization of its production by the community would be of little value. Expenditures to secure customers through advertisement and solicitation, as well as to install connections do not appear separate from the ordinary operating and construction costs. The appellee points to the character of the territory served, the company's ability to earn, the efficiency of the management, the adequate available power supply and the excellent capital structure as indicative of a going concern value above tangible property plus overhead. To appraise these elements apart from and in addition to reasonable cost figures would require evidence of a failure on the part of the commission to give reasonable weight to these factors. This evidence is lacking here. \n21\n\u00a0\n\n For depreciated reproduction cost as of November 30, 1936, the commission accepted the estimate of the company for direct costs, $3,981, 347. It added 19% $756,456, \n\n[307 \nU.S. 104, 118]\n\u00a0\n for indirect costs and reached a total of $4,737,803. This finding reduced the indirect costs from the 24.3 per cent claimed by the company. Evidence was introduced before the commission supporting each percentage estimate. The amount of these indirect costs likely to be incurred is too uncertain for us to conclude that the percentage adopted is erroneous. 22 We cannot see that the failure of the commission's witness Bierman to inspect the property made less valuable his estimate on the proper percentage to be applied for indirect costs. These indirect costs are of the character of interest, supervision, cost of financing, taxes and legal expense.\n The utility states that the commission, in fixing the reproduction cost, erred by refusing to consider the effect of a claimed increase of prices. The commission, on November 30, 1937, fixed reproduction cost upon a computation based by the utility upon prices as of November 30, 1936. This showed a gross cost of $5,572,134, depreciated and reduced by the commission, as explained in the preceding paragraph, to $4,737,803. The utility presented a further computation, showing as of May 31, 1937, that increased prices, due to a rising level, would increase the gross cost to $ 6,019,832. The argument is that the later estimate should have been considered. \n23\n Proportionally reduced to accord with the action of the commission, this latter figure would become $5,118,465. If to this higher reproduction cost we add working capital, there appears a reproduction cost depreciated figure of $5,282,465.\n It is furthermore to be observed that the commission's figures do not differ far as to fair value, from the estimate of an important witness for the utility, Mr. Seelye, who testified on March 12, 1937, that the fair value was not less than $5,500,000 and said later in answer to the com- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 104, 119]\n\u00a0\n missioner's question that the fair value, in his opinion was $5,500,000. This estimate was reiterated on December 20, 1937, in the affidavits of Mr. Seelye and Mr. Wayne, the President of the company, in support of the motion for temporary injunction.\n For the purpose of passing upon the issue of confiscation in the temporary rates, we shall accept $5,500,000 as the fair value of the property as of November 30, 1937.\n\n\n (2)\n The rate of return was fixed by the commission at six per cent. Witnesses for the utility brought out facts deemed applicable in the determination of a proper rate of return on the fair value of the property. Their evidence took cognizance of the yield of bonds, preferred and common stocks of selected comparable utilities, the stagnant market for new issues, prevailing cost of money, the implications of the possible substitution of some governmentally operated or financed utilities for those privately owned and the dangers of a fixed schedule of rates in the face of possible inflation. From these factors they deduced that a proper rate of return would be from 7.8 per cent to 8 per cent. An accounting expert of the commission countered with tables showing yields of bonds of utilities; the yield to maturity of Pennsylvania public utility securities, approved by the commission between July 1, 1933, and May 7, 1937, long term and actually sold for cash to non-affiliated interests; yield of Pennsylvania electric utilities; financial and operating statistics of Pennsylvania electric utilities; money rates, and other material information. Utilities Comm., \n292 \nU.S. 290, 308\n, 54 S. a reasonable rate of return.\n It must be recognized that each utility presents an individual problem. \n24\n The answer does not lie alone in \n\n[307 \nU.S. 104, 120]\n\u00a0\n average yields of seemingly comparable securities or even in deductions drawn from recent sales of issues authorized by this same commission. Yields of preferred and common stocks are to be considered, as well as those of the funded debt. When bonds and preferred stocks of well seasoned companies can be floated at low rates, the allowance of an over all rate return of a modest percentage will bring handsome yields to the common stock. Certainly the yields of the equity issues must be larger than that for the underlying securities. In this instance, the utility operates in a stable community, accustomed to the use of electricity and close to the capital markets, with funds readily available for secure investment. Long operation and adequate records make forecasts of net operating revenues fairly certain. Under such circumstances a six per cent return after all allowable charges cannot be confiscatory.\n\n\n (3)\n and (4). The utility urges that two items of expense and a prospective loss should be added to the operating expenses, allowed by the commission, of $1,382,829. The most important of these items is the rate case expenses. The company by its Exhibit 21 shows these incurred to November 15, 1937, to be 78,374.50. The commission from Exhibit 23 found them to be $127,935 for the twelve months ending September 30, 1937. The difference probably comes from the expenses before and after the period considered by the commission. We assume the higher figures to be correct. As the commission concluded that the prior rates of the company were obviously excessive, it allowed nothing for expense in defending them. Consequently there is no discussion of the reasonableness of the amount of the company's charge and we accept them as reasonable. Even where the rates in effect are excessive, on a proceeding by a commission to determine reasonableness, we are of the view that the utility should be allowed its fair and proper \n\n[307 \nU.S. 104, 121]\n\u00a0\n expenses for presenting its side to the commission. We do not refer to expense of litigation in the courts. 'A different case would be here if the company's complaint had been unfounded, or if the cost of the proceeding had been swollen by untenable objections.' \n25\n\u00a0\n\n In the allowance of these expenses, the period over which they are to be amortized will depend upon the character of services received or disbursements made. There could rarely be an anticipation of annually recurring charges for rate regulation. Under the circumstances here presented where full statistics on investment, inventory and labor requirements have been made which, as cumulated, will form largely the basis of all future negotiations, we are of the opinion that amortization over a ten year period is reasonable. \n26\n As such an adjustment produces an estimated return very close to the reasonable rate, even with the addition to the operating expenses of the other items of increased salaries, $20, 593, and prospective loss of annual profit, $15,089, we do not enter into a discussion of them. Experience will add its weight to the other evidence on further hearing. The note below shows the calculation. \n27\n\u00a0\n\n At best, these estimates are prophecies of expected returns. The incalculable factors of business activity, un- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 104, 122]\n\u00a0\n anticipated demand or forbearance, substitution and other variables lead us to approximations. We are satisfied the reduction required is not shown to be confiscatory.\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER, concurring.\n The decree below was clearly wrong. But in reversing it, the Court's opinion appears to give new vitality needlessly to the mischievous formula for fixing utility rates in Smyth v. Ames, \n169 \nU.S. 466\n, 18 S.Ct. 418. The force of reason, confirmed by events, has gradually been rendering that formula moribund by revealing it to be useless as a guide for adjudication. Experience has made it overwhelmingly clear that Smyth v. Ames and the uses to which it has been put represented an attempt to erect temporary facts into legal absolutes. The determination of utility rates- what may fairly be exacted from the public and what is adequate to enlist enterprise-does not present questions of an essentially legal nature in the sense that legal education and lawyers' learning afford peculiar competence for their adjustment. These are matters for the application of whatever knowledge economics and finance may bring to the practicalities of business enterprise. The only relevant function of law in dealing with this intersection of government and enterprise is to secure observance of those procedural safeguards in the exercise of legislative powers which are the historic foundations of due process.\n Mr. Justice Bradley nearly fifty years ago made it clear that the real issue is whether courts or commissions and legislatures are the ultimate arbiters of utility rates (dissenting in Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry. Co. v. Minnesota, \n134 \nU.S. 418, 461\n, 10 S.Ct. 702, 703). Whatever may be thought of the wisdom of a broader judicial role in the controversies between public utilities and the public, there can be no \n\n[307 \nU.S. 104, 123]\n\u00a0\n doubt that the tendency, for a time at least, to draw fixed rules of law out of Smyth v. Ames has met the rebuff of facts. At least one important state has for decades gone on its way unmindful of Smyth v. Ames, and other states have by various proposals sought to escape the fog into which speculations based on Smyth v. Ames have enveloped the practical task of administering systems of utility regulation.\n Smyth v. Ames should certainly not be invoked when it is not necessary to do so. The statute under which the present case arose represents an effort to escape Smyth v. Ames at least as to temporary rates. It is the result of a conscientious and informed endeavor to meet difficulties engendered by legal doctrines which have been widely rejected by the great weight of economic opinion,1 by authoritative legislative investigations,2 by utility commissions throughout the country,3 and by impressive judicial dissents. 4 As a result of this long process of experience and reflection, the two states in which utilities play the biggest financial part-New York and Pennsylvania-have evolved the so- called recoupment scheme for temporary rate-fixing (thereby avoiding some of the most \n\n[307 \nU.S. 104, 124]\n\u00a0\n wasteful aspects of rate litigation) as a fair means of accommodating public and private interests. It is a carefully guarded device for securing 'a judgment from experience as against a judgment from speculation,' Tanner v. Little, \n240 \nU.S. 369, 386\n, 36 S.Ct. 379, 384, in dealing with a problem of such elusive economic complexity as the determination of what return will be sufficient to attract capital in the special setting of a particular industry and at the same time be fair to the public dependent on such enterprise.\n That this Court should not 'decide an issue of constitutionality if the case may justly and reasonably be decided under a construction of the statute under which the act is clearly constitutional' is, as an abstract proposition, basic to our judicial obligation. But this is not a formal doctrine of self-restraint. Its rationale is avoidance of conflict with the legislature. The opinion from which the preceding quotation is taken and the decisions to which it refers are all cases in which constitutionality was in obvious jeopardy. It is one thing to avoid unconstitutionality even at the cost of a tortured statutory construction. It is quite another to recognize the validity of a statute directed expressly to the situation in hand and so employed by the state authorities, when constitutionality of that statute is as incontestably clear as the decision of the New York Court of Appeals has demonstrated it to be in sustaining the sister statute of the Pennsylvania Act, Bronx Gas & Electric Co. v. Maltbie, 271 N.Y. 364, 3 N.E.2d 512. The Court's opinion in the present case does not avoid issues of constitutionality. It accepts the much more dubious constitutional doctrines of Smyth v. Ames and its successors to solve the very easy constitutional issues raised by the Pennsylvania Act.\n Mr. Justice BLACK concurs in the above views. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Edison Light & Power Co. v.

The District Court adjudged the defendants entitled to recover on the counterclaim and appointed a special master to take the necessary accounting. As the decree is not a final one so far as the counterclaim is concerned, the appellees move to dismiss the appeal. The motion is denied. The decree denied a permanent injunction and this Court has jurisdiction of a direct appeal from that part of the decree by virtue of the express provision of the statute. Judicial Code,  266, 28 U.

Ct. 8, 9.\n Since 1931 appellant, Frank Eichholz, has operated freight trucks in interstate commerce between the States of Missouri, Iowa and Kansas and has maintained terminal facilities in St. Louis, Missouri, Kansas City, Kansas, and other places in Kansas and Iowa. Prior to the passage of the Federal Motor Carrier Act of 1935 (49 U.S.C.  301 et seq., 49 U.S.C.A.  301 et seq.), he obtained a permit from the Public Service Commission of Missouri 'to operate as a freight carrying motor carrier over an irregular route' between points in Missouri and points beyond that State, 'exclusively in interstate commerce'. He did not seek or obtain from the Commission an intrastate permit.\n On the passage of the federal act, appellant applied for a permit from the Interstate Commerce Commission and that application was still pending at the time of the hearing below and argument here.\n When the state permit was granted, and thereafter, there was in force Rule No. 44 of the Public Service Commission which provided as follows: 'No driver or operator operating under an interstate permit shall accept for transportation within this state any person or property known to be destined to a point within the State of Missouri. If such interstate carrier accepts within Missouri a passenger whose destination is beyond the limits of the State of Missouri, such passenger shall not be permitted to terminate his trip within the State of Missouri; and if such interstate carrier accepts within Missouri property destined to a point beyond the limits of the State of Missouri such property shall not be terminated within the State of Missouri.'\n In December, 1936, after hearing, the Commission revoked appellant's permit, holding this rule to have been violated. Its decision was based upon a finding that ap- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 268, 271]\n\u00a0\n pellant had unlawfully engaged in intrastate commerce under the pretense of transacting interstate business; that as a subterfuge he had hauled freight originating in St. Louis, Missouri, and destined to Kansas City, Missouri, and vice versa, through his terminal in Kansas City, Kansas, which was located less than one-half mile from the Missouri state line. The Commission stated that the testimony showed an industrious solicitation by appellant for the transportation of freight between St. Louis, Missouri and Kansas City, Missouri, on the basis of his quoted interstate rate between such cities as set forth in his tariff filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission, which rate was much lower than the established rate for intrastate carriers operating between these cities, and that by such means a large volume of business had been developed. It appeared that he was carrying freight at the interstate first-class rate of sixty cents per cwt. between St. Louis, Missouri, and Kansas City, Missouri, through his terminal at Kansas City, Kansas, while the similar intrastate freight rate established by the Public Service Commission between the two cities in Missouri was ninety-two cents per cwt.\n On the challenge in this suit of the validity of the Commission's order, the District Court, 23 F.Supp. 587, 593, heard the evidence of the parties and found that the carriage of property from St. Louis, Missouri, to Kansas City, Kansas, and thence back into Kansas City, Missouri, for delivery, was not 'the normal, regular, or usual route' for shipping merchandise between the two cities in Missouri; that the route used by appellant to his terminal at Kansas City, Kansas, was through Kansas City, Missouri, and that the same traffic-ways were used in making deliveries of merchandise after it had been hauled in the first instance to the terminal; that after reaching the terminal in Kansas City, Kansas, appellant in many instances did not unload the merchandise, that much of such shipments was in \n\n[306 \nU.S. 268, 272]\n\u00a0\n carload lots, and that the method employed was to haul the merchandise to his terminal in Kansas City, Kansas, 'where a new driver, either with the same tractor and trailer, or with another tractor and the same trailer, would return the merchandise to Kansas City, Missouri'; that in some instances merchandise was actually unloaded at the depot in Kansas City, Kansas, and then distributed to the consignees in Kansas City, Missouri, but that this was 'a negligible percentage of the shipment between Missouri points'; and that the method of operation which appellant employed was designed to afford shippers the benefit of a lower rate and was not in good faith.\n First.-By Section 5268(a) of the Missouri Bus and Truck Act (Laws of 1931, pp. 307, 308, Mo.St.Ann.  5268(a), p. 6684), the State declared it to be unlawful for any common carrier by motor to furnish service within the State without first having obtained from the Commission a certificate of public convenience and necessity. By Section 5268(b) it was declared unlawful for any motor carrier (with certain exceptions not material here) to use any of the public highways of the State in interstate commerce without first having obtained a permit from the Commission. It was provided that in determining whether such a permit should be issued, the Commission should give consideration 'to the kind and character of vehicles permitted over said highway' and should require the filing 'of a liability insurance policy or bond' in such sum and upon such conditions as the Commission might deem necessary to protect adequately the interest of the public in the use of the highway. The statute also authorized the Public Service Commission to prescribe regulations governing motor carriers.\n Appellant's complaint did not attack these statutes; on the contrary he asserted that he had fully complied with their provisions. His complaint was of the or- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 268, 273]\n\u00a0\n der of the Commission revoking his permit. We confine ourselves to the question thus presented.\n Second.-When the Commission revoked the permit, the Interstate Commerce Commission had not acted upon appellant's application under the Federal Motor Carrier Act and meanwhile the authority of the state body to take appropriate action under the state law to enforce reasonable regulations of traffic upon the state highways had not been superseded. H. P. Welch Company v. New Hampshire, \n306 \nU.S. 79\n, 59 S.Ct. 438, 83 L.Ed. --, decided January 30, 1939; compare McDonald v. Thompson, \n305 \nU.S. 263\n, 59 S. Ct. 176, decided December 5, 1938\n\n\n Third.-Appellant did not seek from the state commission a certificate entitling him to do an intrastate business. Under the Commission's rule, he had his choice either to refrain from carrying property between points in Missouri or to secure a certificate of public convenience and necessity as an intrastate carrier. The validity of the requirement of such a certificate to promote the proper and safe use of the state highways is not open to question. Hendrick v. Maryland, \n235 \nU.S. 610, 622\n, 35 S.Ct. 140, 142; Morris v. Duby, \n274 \nU.S. 135, 143\n, 47 S.Ct. 548, 549; Clark v.

South Bend, \n277 \nU.S. 163, 169\n, 48 S.Ct. 502, 504, 62 A.L.R. 45.\n Rule 44 was plainly designed to provide a safeguard against the use of an interstate permit to circumvent the requirement of a certificate for intrastate traffic. The rule simply sought to hold to his choice the one who had sought and obtained a permit exclusively for interstate transportation. Appellant was entirely free to conduct that transportation if he did not engage in the intrastate business for which he had deliberately refrained from qualifying himself. We cannot see that the rule on its \n\n[306 \nU.S. 268, 274]\n\u00a0\n face imposed any improper burden upon interstate commerce and the question is whether it did so through the application that the Commission has made of it.\n Appellant insists that the hauling from St. Louis over the state line to Kansas City, Kansas, of merchandise consigned to persons in Kansas City, Missouri, and hauling it back again to its intended destination in Kansas City, Missouri, was actually interstate transportation.

Stroud, \n267 \nU.S. 404\n, 45 S.Ct. 243. That fact, however, does not require the conclusion that the State's action for the protection of its intrastate commerce was invalid.

We may assume that Congress could regulate interstate transportation of the sort here in question, whatever the motive of those engaging in it. But in the absence of the exercise of federal authority, and in the light of local exigencies, the State is free to act in order to protect its legitimate interests even though interstate commerce is directly affected.

If appellant's hauling of the merchandise in question across the state line was not in good faith but was a mere subterfuge to evade the State's requirement as to intrastate commerce, there is no ground for saying that the prohibition of the use of the interstate permit to cover such transactions, and the application of the Commission's rule prohibiting them in the absence of an intrastate certificate, was an unwarrantable intrusion into the federal field or the subjection of interstate commerce to any unlawful restraint. And if the prohibition of such transactions was valid, the Commission was undoubtedly entitled to enforce it by revoking appellant's permit for breach of \n\n[306 \nU.S. 268, 275]\n\u00a0\n the condition upon which it was issued and accepted by appellant.\n Fourth.-The ultimate question is thus one of fact, whether the transactions of appellant were of the character described by the Commission and in the findings of the District Court.\n The transcript of the record before the Commission was introduced before the court, but neither that evidence nor the additional evidence taken by the court is presented in extenso by the record here. The parties properly filed, in connection with this appeal, condensed statements of the evidence upon which they respectively relied. An examination of these statements discloses no reason for disturbing the court's findings.\n Appellant stresses the fact that he had selected his terminal in Kansas City, Kansas, at the beginning of his operations as a motor carrier, about 1932, and that it was a convenient and proper location. But that fact does not alter the nature of the transactions under review. There was a variance in the testimony as to the extent of the appellant's business which was conducted in violation of his permit, but there was adequate basis for the court's finding that it was a considerable portion of his operations and justified the action of the Commission.\n The decree of the District Court so far as it denies an injunction is affirmed.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","32":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nELECTRIC STORAGE BATTERY CO. v.

Shimadzu \n307 \nU.S. 5\n (1939) ]\n\n\n[307 \nU.S. 616, 7]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Hugh M. Morris, of Wilmington, Del., for petitioner.\n Messrs. George Whitefield Betts, Jr., of New York City, and Edmund B. Whitcomb, of Toledo, Ohio, for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The courts below have held valid and infringed certain claims of three patents 1 granted to Genzo Shimadzu, a citizen and resident of Japan. The earliest is for a method of forming a finely divided and, consequently, more chemically reactive, lead powder. The second is for a method or process of manufacturing a fine powder composed of lead suboxide and metallic lead and for the product of \n\n[307 \nU.S. 616, 8]\n\u00a0\n the process. The third is for an apparatus for the continuous production of lead oxides in the form of a dry fine powder. Such powder is useful in the manufacture of plates for storage batteries.\n The bill was filed by the respondents as patentee and exclusive licensee. The answer denied that Shimadzu was the first inventor; asserted knowledge and use of the invention by the petitioner in the United States more than two years prior to the dates of the applications; and pleaded that earlier patents procured by Shimadzu in Japan avoided the United States patents as the former were for the same inventions and each was granted more than a year prior to the filing of the corresponding application in this country. The case was tried, the District Court found the facts, stated its conclusions, and entered a decree for the respondents,2 which the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 3 The petitioner sought certiorari alleging that the case presents three questions, one which should be settled by this court and two which were decided below contrary to our adjudications.\n The questions are: In an infringement suit by the owner of a patent for an invention, made but not patented or published abroad, to restrain an innocent use, the inception of which antedates the application for patent, may the plaintiff prove that his actual date of invention was earlier than the commencement of the asserted infringing use? Is the delay of the patentee in this case in applying for patent a bar to relief for alleged infringement? Does commercial use of the patented process and apparatus in the alleged infringer's plant for more than two years prior to the application for patent preclude redress? \n\n[307 \nU.S. 616, 9]\n\u00a0\n No controversy of fact is involved as the petitioner concedes it must accept the concurrent findings of the courts below. \n4\n The relevant facts lie within a narrow compass.\n The inventions which are the basis of the patents were conceived by Shimadzu and reduced to practise in Japan not later than August 1919. He did not disclose the inventions to anyone in the United States before he applied for United States patents. Application was presented for No. 1,584, 149 on January 30, 1922; for No. 1,584,150 on July 14, 1923; and for No. 1, 896,020 on April 27, 1926. The inventions were not patented or described in a printed publication in this or any foreign country prior to the filing of the applications. The petitioner, without knowledge of Shimadzu's inventions, began the use of a machine, which involved both the method and the apparatus of the patents, at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, early in 1921 and attained commercial production in June 1921. Over the objection of the petitioner the respondents were permitted by testimony, and by the introduction of contemporaneous drawings and note books, to carry the date of invention back to August 1919, and the courts below fixed that as the date of invention and reduction to practise in Japan.\n First. The petitioner asserts that R.S.  4886, 4887, and 4923,5 considered together, require one who has made \n\n[307 \nU.S. 616, 10]\n\u00a0\n an invention abroad to take as his date of invention the date of his application in the United States unless, prior thereto, the invention has been communicated and described to someone in this country, or has been patented abroad. The respondents insist that the sections have no such force. They say that where the alleged infringer is not acting under the supposed protection of a prior patent, but is using an unpatented process or device, the holder of a patent for a foreign invention, like the holder of one for an invention made here, may show novelty by proving that his invention antedated his application and the infringing use.\n The solution of the issue requires examination of two of the sections in the light of their development from earlier patent statutes.\n R.S.  4886, as it stood when the patents were granted,6 was:\n'Any person who has invented or discovered any new and useful art, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvements thereof, not known or used by others (in this country), ( before his invention or discovery thereof), and not patented or described in any printed publication in this or any foreign country, before his invention or discovery thereof, (or more than two years prior to his application), and not in public use or on sale (in this country) for more than two years prior to his application, unless the same is proved to have been abandoned, may, upon payment of the fees required by law, and other due proceeding had, obtain a patent therefor.'\n\n The legislative history of the section may be briefly outlined. The Patent Act of 17907 authorized the grant \n\n[307 \nU.S. 616, 11]\n\u00a0\n of a patent to 'any person or persons' who made an invention 'not before known or used.' The succeeding Act of 17938 confined the privilege to 'a citizen or citizens of the United States', but the Act of 18009 conferred it on any alien who, at the time of his application, had resided for two years within the United States. By the Act of 183610 it was provided that a patent might be obtained by 'any person or persons.' The Act of 1870,11 which was carried into the Revised Statutes, added the words 'in this country' as they appear in the first bracket in the foregoing quotation. The Act of 189712 added the three other bracketed clauses.\n The requirement of the Act of 1790 was that the discovery be 'not before known or used.' The Act of 1793 amended this to read 'not known or used before the application.' The Act of 1800 altered the provision so that the petitioner had to swear that his invention had not 'been known or used either in this or any foreign country.' The Act of 1836 changed the knowledge and use clause to read 'not known or used by others before his or their discovery or invention thereof.'\n These successive alterations throw into relief the fact that the section makes the criterion of novelty the same whether the invention was conceived abroad or in this country. The test is whether the invention was 'known or used by others in this country, before his invention or discovery thereof.' The elements which preclude patentability are a patent, or a description in a printed publication in this or any foreign country, which antedates the invention or discovery of the applicant. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 616, 12]\n\u00a0\n None of the statutes has ever embodied as an element the place of invention or discovery, but the change effected by the Act of 1836, and carried forward in all succeeding statutes, is the fixation of the actual date of the inventive act as the date prior to which the invention must have been known or used to justify denial of a patent for want of novelty. The omission of any limitation as to the place of invention or discovery precludes a ruling imposing such a limitation, especially so since the Act of 1870 expressly limited the area of prior knowledge or use to this country.\n The provisions of R.S.  4886 which affect the question are not modified by R.S.  4887, the purpose of which is to permit the filing of applications for the same invention in foreign countries and in the United States. It derives from Section 25 of the Act of 1870.13\n The second paragraph of the section, which was added by the Act of 190314 to comply with reciprocal agreements with foreign countries, gives the same force and effect to the filing of an application in a foreign country as it would have if filed here on the date on which the application for patent was first filed in the foreign country, provided that the domestic application is filed within twelve months of the foreign filing date. The last sentence of the paragraph expressly preserves the bars of more than two years' prior patenting, description in a printed publication before the filing of application in this country, and public use, more than two years before such filing. But the section does not contain any provision which precludes proof of facts respecting the actual date of invention in a foreign country to overcome the prior knowledge or use bar of  4886.\n The petitioner also relies upon R.S.  4923, 35 U.S.C.A.  72, which provides that if the patentee, at the time of his application, \n\n[307 \nU.S. 616, 13]\n\u00a0\n believed himself the original or first inventor, his patent shall not be refused or held void by reason of the invention having been known or used in a foreign country, before his invention or discovery, if it had not been patented or described in a printed publication. The effect of this section is that in an interference between two applicants for United States patent, or in an infringement suit where the alleged infringer relies upon a United States patent, the application and patent for the domestic invention shall have priority despite earlier foreign knowledge and use not evidenced by a prior patent or a description in a printed publication.\n The section, on its face, is without application where the litigation is between the patentee of a foreign invention, or his assignee, and an alleged infringer who defends only in virtue of prior knowledge or use not covered by a patent.\n While this court has never been called upon to decide the precise question presented, the lower federal courts have refused to extend  4923 to such a case. They have held that  4886 does not limit the plaintiff to the date of application in this country but that he may prove the invention was in fact made at an earlier date, as could the owner of an invention made in the United States. \n15\n\u00a0\n\n There is force in the petitioner's argument that the distinction seems illogical. Thus, if a diligent domestic inventor applies, in good faith believing himself to be the first inventor, Section 4923 assures him a patent and gives it priority, despite prior foreign use, even though that use is evidenced by a patent applied for after the invention made in this country. The foreign applicant or patentee \n\n[307 \nU.S. 616, 14]\n\u00a0\n cannot carry the date of his invention back of the date of application in this country, as the holder of a later patent for an invention made here would be permitted to do in order to establish priority. On the other hand, a domestic inventor who is willing to dedicate his invention to the public may be held as an infringer by reason of the later patenting of an invention abroad which antedates the invention and use in this country; and so is put in a worse position vis a vis a foreign inventor who subsequently secures a patent, and succeeds in establishing an earlier date of invention, than he would occupy if he had promoted his own interest by procuring a patent.\n We have no way of knowing whether the discrimination results from inadvertence or from some undisclosed legislative policy, but, in order to redress the disadvantage under which one in the petitioner's situation suffers, we should have to read into the law words which plainly are missing. \n16\n We cannot thus rewrite the statute. \n17\n Moreover, Sections 4886 and 4887 have repeatedly been amended and other portions of the patent act have been revised and amended from time to time since the decisions pointing out that Section 4886 did not prevent the foreign inventor from carrying back his date of invention beyond the date of his application. Congress has not seen fit to amend the statute in this respect and we must assume that it has been satisfied with, and adopted, the construction given to its enactment by the courts. \n18\n\u00a0\n\n[307 \nU.S. 616, 15]\n\u00a0\n We are of opinion that the courts below were right in not limiting Shimadzu's date of invention to the date of his application but allowing him to show an earlier actual date.\n Second. A patent is not validly issued if the invention 'is proved to have been abandoned.' \n19\n Abandonment may be evidenced by the express and voluntary declaration of the inventor;20 it may be inferred from negligence or unexplained delay in making application for patent;21 it may be declared as a consequence of the inventor's concealing his invention and delaying application for patent in an endeavor to extend the term of the patent protection beyond the period fixed by the statute. \n22\n In any case, the question whether the invention has been abandoned is one of fact. \n 23\n\u00a0\n\n Referring to a Japanese patent applied for November 27, 1920, and issued May 10, 1922, the District Court found (17 F.Supp. 47): 'We are not concerned with the motives which prompted him ... to confine it (the Japanese patent) to the single step of mechanical removal of the dust from the drum, and to withhold the really essential steps of the invention for later patenting. It is sufficient to say that he had the right to do this if he chose.' Taken in connection with the court's finding that Shimadzu's inventions were conceived and reduced to practise in August 1919 this finding is said to convict him of intentional and inexcusable concealment. In the light of the record we are unable so to hold. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 616, 16]\n\u00a0\n R.S.  492024 makes abandonment an affirmative defense which must be pleaded and proved. \n25\n Admittedly the defense was not pleaded and the respondents assert, without contradiction, that it was not relied upon in brief or argument in the courts below. The petitioner explains its failure so to plead by saying that, when it filed its answer, it believed that certain of the Japanese patents issued to Shimadzu covered the identical inventions described in the patents in suit and invalidated the latter because application was not made in this country within one year of the grant of the foreign patents as required by R.S.  4887. The claim is that the refusal to sustain this defense and the assignment of August 1919 as the date of invention, took petitioner by surprise; and that the question of Shimadzu's concealment of his invention from 1919 until he made his applications in the United States did not emerge until the District Court's decision was rendered.\n We think this is not a sufficient excuse for not pleading the defense. Alternative and inconsistent defenses may be pleaded. \n26\n Certainly if the petitioner was surprised it could at least have requested an opportunity to amend its answer. If the defense had been pleaded originally or by amendment the respondents would have had an opportunity to meet it by proof and this they appear not to have been afforded. We have a finding which seems not to have been addressed to this issue; and no findings as to the circumstances which led to the delay in filing applications. In the circumstances we think we are not justified in assigning to the findings below the force of a finding that Shimadzu, with intent, concealed \n\n[307 \nU.S. 616, 17]\n\u00a0\n his invention and delayed making applications for the purpose of unduly extending the life of his patents,-a defense not pleaded.\n Third. If a valid patent is to issue, the invention must not have been in public use in this country for more than two years prior to the filing of the application. \n27\n Such public use is an affirmative defense to be pleaded and proved. \n28\n The respondents insist that it was not pleaded in this case and that the findings respecting the defense, on which the petitioner relies, are unsupported by the evidence. We cannot agree with either position.\n Although not required so to do, the respondents in their bill pleaded with respect to each of the patents that the invention had not been in public use for more than two years before application filed. The petitioner denied the allegation as to each patent and, in addition, alleged that it was successfully making and selling the product of the invention in its plant long before it ever learned of Shimadzu's existence or his inventions, and further asserted that 'the claims of said letters patent are invalid and void because the subject matter thereof was, prior to the alleged invention thereof by Shimadzu, and for more than two years prior to his application dates, known to and used by the defendant at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, ...' Upon the trial, employes of the petitioner described an early apparatus and process used in 1918 and 1919 and abandoned in the latter year when experiments began towards employment of the apparatus and process the petitioner now uses. They testified to the increasing perfection of the apparatus and process during the early months of 1921, and that commercial production was accomplished sometime between \n\n[307 \nU.S. 616, 18]\n\u00a0\n April and June of that year. Former employes of the petitioner were called by the respondents and described this apparatus and process as used and practised in the petitioner's plant in Philadelphia subsequent to the date of Shimadzu's applications, but the evidence indicates that, after its perfection in 1921, the same apparatus has been used, and the same process practised, from that date to the present. This is the apparatus and process which the courts below have held to infringe. The District Court found 'commercial production by the Hardinge mill with its forced air draft undoubtedly involved the use of the plaintiff's patent, and June, 1921, may be fixed as the date when that began.' The respondents insist that this does not amount to a finding of prior public use, distinguishing between the court's phrase 'commercial production' and the designation 'public use' found in the statute. We think the position is untenable.\n The finding of the District Court appears under a heading in its opinion entitled 'Alleged Prior Public Use.' As originally promulgated the finding fixed January 1921 as the date of commercial production. The respondents sought a rehearing and asked that the finding as to commercial production in January 1921 be revised. A rehearing was granted and the District Judge filed a memorandum amending his opinion. In this he said: 'As to the second statement of fact, it may be said at once that it was never intended by the Court to make a finding of a prior public use (in the statutory sense of that term) by the defendant in January 1921.' After discussing the use of the apparatus in the early months of 1921, the court said: 'It is therefore plain that there is no evidence of anything beyond an experimental use by the defendant earlier than about the middle of the year 1921. It is entirely possible that the word 'January' in \n\n[307 \nU.S. 616, 19]\n\u00a0\n the second statement of fact referred to above is a mere typographical error and that what the Court had in mind was, 'June'. However that may be and in order to avoid any possible misunderstanding as to the scope of the finding, I will amend it to read 'Commercial production by the Hardinge mill with its forced air draft undoubtedly involved the use of the plaintiff's patent, and June, 1921, may be fixed as the date when that began.\"\n Both parties appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals. That the respondents understood the force and effect of the finding as to prior use is evident from their assignments, one of which is that the District Court erred 'in finding and adjudging that commercial production by the Hardinge mill with its forced draft involving the use of plaintiff's patent began in June 1921.'\n It remains to determine whether the commercial use found is, in contemplation of law, a public use within the meaning of R.S.  4886. We hold that it is.\n The earlier Acts provided that the bar should consist in public use or sale 'with the applicant's consent or allowance prior to the application.' \n29\n The Act of 183930 altered the clause to read 'no patent shall be held to be invalid' except upon proof that 'such ... prior use has been for more than two years prior to such application for a patent.' This court construed the later Act, which has been carried forward into the revised statutes, as rendering prior public use a bar whether the use was with or without the consent of the patentee. \n31\n\u00a0\n\n Decisions turning on prior public use have been numerous both in this court and in other federal courts; and the definition of such use, formulated when the statute made only use by consent a bar, has been adopted in \n\n[307 \nU.S. 616, 20]\n\u00a0\n instances where the use was without consent or knowledge of the applicant for patent. \n32\n\u00a0\n\n A mere experimental use is not the public use defined by the Act,33 but a single use for profit, not purposely hidden, is such. \n34\n The ordinary use of a machine or the practise of a process in a factory in the usual course of producing articles for commercial purposes is a public use. \n35\n\u00a0\n\n In the present case the evidence is that the petitioner, since June 1921, has continuously employed the alleged infringing machine and process for the production of lead oxide powder used in the manufacture of plates for storage batteries which have been sold in quantity. There is no finding, and we think none would have been justified, to the effect that the machine, process, and product were not well known to the employes in the plant, or that efforts were made to conceal them from anyone who had a legitimate interest in understanding them. \n36\n This use, begun more than two years before Shimadzu applied for patents 1,584,150 and 1,896,020, invalidated the claims in suit.\n Fourth. The defense of prior public use is not made out against patent 1,584,149, for which application was \n\n[307 \nU.S. 616, 21]\n\u00a0\n filed January 30, 1922. The defendant's commercial production commenced about six months earlier. The District Court held the patent valid and infringed. Its claims cover merely a process for the production of a finely divided chemically reactive lead powder by introducing relatively large masses of lead into a rotatable vessel, rotating the vessel at a relatively low speed, forming the powder by attrition resulting from the rubbing of the masses against each other, and blowing the powder from the vessel by a current of air. The process and apparatus covered by the other two patents in issue involve use and control of an air current and use and control of temperature within the receptacle for the oxidation of the lead. With respect to 1,584,149 the trial court said:\n'Whether or not '149 is for the same process as U.S. patent '150 is immaterial, so far as the question of validity of either is concerned. There is no double patenting involved. The two patents issued on the same day. They both expired on the same day. There can be no extension of the monopoly and one is not prior art against the other.\n\n'The fact that '149 does not disclose the oxidizing function of the air or refer to the highly important element of the process having to do with the temperature control necessary to its successful operation might throw doubt upon its validity in view of the prior art. This is, of course, upon the assumption that it is not for the same invention as '150. The whole matter however is rather academic since '149 is coincident in duration with '150, and the defendant's process infringes the somewhat more precise, if not narrower, claims of '150.\n\n'This patent is therefore held valid and infringed.'\n\n The holding was assigned as error in the Circuit Court of Appeals and is specified as error in the petition for certiorari. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 616, 22]\n\u00a0\n In view of our decision as to 1,584,150 and of the basis of the decision below respecting 1,584,149, we think the petitioner is entitled to a reexamination of the questions of the validity and infringement of the latter.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be reversed and the cause remanded to the District Court with directions to dismiss the bill as to Nos. 1,584,150 and 1,896,020, and to proceed, in the light of the dismissal as to those patents, to determine whether 1,584,149 is valid and infringed.\n It is so ordered.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Patents Date granted Claims 1,584,149 5\/11\/1926 1 and 2 1,584,150 5\/11\/1926 1-4, 6, 8-13 1,896,020 1\/31\/1933 10 and 11 \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 17 F.Supp. 42. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] 3 Cir., 98 F.2d 831.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] At the trial the respondents relied, to some extent, upon an adjudication in an interference proceeding between Shimadzu and Hall, an employe of the petitioner who in 1924 applied for a patent for a process of producing finely powdered mixed lead and lead oxide.

Shimadzu   \n307 \nU.S. 5\n (1939)  ]\n\n\n[307 \nU.S. 5\n, 7]\n\u00a0\n  Mr. Hugh M. Morris, of Wilmington, Del., for petitioner.\n  Messrs. George Whitefield Betts, Jr., of New York City, and Edmund B. Whitcomb, of Toledo, Ohio, for respondents.\n\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  The courts below have held valid and infringed certain claims of three patents 1 granted to Genzo Shimadzu, a citizen and resident of Japan. The earliest is for a method of forming a finely divided and, consequently, more chemically reactive, lead powder. The second is for a method or process of manufacturing a fine powder composed of lead suboxide and metallic lead and for the product of \n\n[307 \nU.S. 5\n, 8]\n\u00a0\n the process. The third is for an apparatus for the continuous production of lead oxides in the form of a dry fine powder. Such powder is useful in the manufacture of plates for storage batteries.\n  The bill was filed by the respondents as patentee and exclusive licensee. The answer denied that Shimadzu was the first inventor; asserted knowledge and use of the invention by the petitioner in the United States more than two years prior to the dates of the applications; and pleaded that earlier patents procured by Shimadzu in Japan avoided the United States patents as the former were for the same inventions and each was granted more than a year prior to the filing of the corresponding application in this country. The case was tried, the District Court found the facts, stated its conclusions, and entered a decree for the respondents,2 which the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 3 The petitioner sought certiorari alleging that the case presents three questions, one which should be settled by this court and two which were decided below contrary to our adjudications.\n  The questions are: In an infringement suit by the owner of a patent for an invention, made but not patented or published abroad, to restrain an innocent use, the inception of which antedates the application for patent, may the plaintiff prove that his actual date of invention was earlier than the commencement of the asserted infringing use? Is the delay of the patentee in this case in applying for patent a bar to relief for alleged infringement? Does commercial use of the patented process and apparatus in the alleged infringer's plant for more than two years prior to the application for patent preclude redress? \n\n[307 \nU.S. 5\n, 9]\n\u00a0\n  No controversy of fact is involved as the petitioner concedes it must accept the concurrent findings of the courts below. \n4\n The relevant facts lie within a narrow compass.\n  The inventions which are the basis of the patents were conceived by Shimadzu and reduced to practise in Japan not later than August 1919. He did not disclose the inventions to anyone in the United States before he applied for United States patents. Application was presented for No. 1,584, 149 on January 30, 1922; for No. 1,584,150 on July 14, 1923; and for No. 1, 896,020 on April 27, 1926. The inventions were not patented or described in a printed publication in this or any foreign country prior to the filing of the applications. The petitioner, without knowledge of Shimadzu's inventions, began the use of a machine, which involved both the method and the apparatus of the patents, at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, early in 1921 and attained commercial production in June 1921. Over the objection of the petitioner the respondents were permitted by testimony, and by the introduction of contemporaneous drawings and note books, to carry the date of invention back to August 1919, and the courts below fixed that as the date of invention and reduction to practise in Japan.\n  First. The petitioner asserts that R.S.  4886, 4887, and 4923,5 considered together, require one who has made \n\n[307 \nU.S. 5\n, 10]\n\u00a0\n an invention abroad to take as his date of invention the date of his application in the United States unless, prior thereto, the invention has been communicated and described to someone in this country, or has been patented abroad. The respondents insist that the sections have no such force. They say that where the alleged infringer is not acting under the supposed protection of a prior patent, but is using an unpatented process or device, the holder of a patent for a foreign invention, like the holder of one for an invention made here, may show novelty by proving that his invention antedated his application and the infringing use.\n  The solution of the issue requires examination of two of the sections in the light of their development from earlier patent statutes.\n  R.S.  4886, as it stood when the patents were granted,6 was:\n'Any person who has invented or discovered any new and useful art, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvements thereof, not known or used by others (in this country), ( before his invention or discovery thereof), and not patented or described in any printed publication in this or any foreign country, before his invention or discovery thereof, (or more than two years prior to his application), and not in public use or on sale (in this country) for more than two years prior to his application, unless the same is proved to have been abandoned, may, upon payment of the fees required by law, and other due proceeding had, obtain a patent therefor.'\n\n  The legislative history of the section may be briefly outlined. The Patent Act of 17907 authorized the grant \n\n[307 \nU.S. 5\n, 11]\n\u00a0\n of a patent to 'any person or persons' who made an invention 'not before known or used.' The succeeding Act of 17938 confined the privilege to 'a citizen or citizens of the United States', but the Act of 18009 conferred it on any alien who, at the time of his application, had resided for two years within the United States. By the Act of 183610 it was provided that a patent might be obtained by 'any person or persons.' The Act of 1870,11 which was carried into the Revised Statutes, added the words 'in this country' as they appear in the first bracket in the foregoing quotation. The Act of 189712 added the three other bracketed clauses.\n  The requirement of the Act of 1790 was that the discovery be 'not before known or used.' The Act of 1793 amended this to read 'not known or used before the application.' The Act of 1800 altered the provision so that the petitioner had to swear that his invention had not 'been known or used either in this or any foreign country.' The Act of 1836 changed the knowledge and use clause to read 'not known or used by others before his or their discovery or invention thereof.'\n  These successive alterations throw into relief the fact that the section makes the criterion of novelty the same whether the invention was conceived abroad or in this country. The test is whether the invention was 'known or used by others in this country, before his invention or discovery thereof.' The elements which preclude patentability are a patent, or a description in a printed publication in this or any foreign country, which antedates the invention or discovery of the applicant. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 5\n, 12]\n\u00a0\n  None of the statutes has ever embodied as an element the place of invention or discovery, but the change effected by the Act of 1836, and carried forward in all succeeding statutes, is the fixation of the actual date of the inventive act as the date prior to which the invention must have been known or used to justify denial of a patent for want of novelty. The omission of any limitation as to the place of invention or discovery precludes a ruling imposing such a limitation, especially so since the Act of 1870 expressly limited the area of prior knowledge or use to this country.\n  The provisions of R.S.  4886 which affect the question are not modified by R.S.  4887, the purpose of which is to permit the filing of applications for the same invention in foreign countries and in the United States. It derives from Section 25 of the Act of 1870.13\n  The second paragraph of the section, which was added by the Act of 190314 to comply with reciprocal agreements with foreign countries, gives the same force and effect to the filing of an application in a foreign country as it would have if filed here on the date on which the application for patent was first filed in the foreign country, provided that the domestic application is filed within twelve months of the foreign filing date. The last sentence of the paragraph expressly preserves the bars of more than two years' prior patenting, description in a printed publication before the filing of application in this country, and public use, more than two years before such filing. But the section does not contain any provision which precludes proof of facts respecting the actual date of invention in a foreign country to overcome the prior knowledge or use bar of  4886.\n  The petitioner also relies upon R.S.  4923, 35 U.S.C.A.  72, which provides that if the patentee, at the time of his application, \n\n[307 \nU.S. 5\n, 13]\n\u00a0\n believed himself the original or first inventor, his patent shall not be refused or held void by reason of the invention having been known or used in a foreign country, before his invention or discovery, if it had not been patented or described in a printed publication. The effect of this section is that in an interference between two applicants for United States patent, or in an infringement suit where the alleged infringer relies upon a United States patent, the application and patent for the domestic invention shall have priority despite earlier foreign knowledge and use not evidenced by a prior patent or a description in a printed publication.\n  The section, on its face, is without application where the litigation is between the patentee of a foreign invention, or his assignee, and an alleged infringer who defends only in virtue of prior knowledge or use not covered by a patent.\n  While this court has never been called upon to decide the precise question presented, the lower federal courts have refused to extend  4923 to such a case. They have held that  4886 does not limit the plaintiff to the date of application in this country but that he may prove the invention was in fact made at an earlier date, as could the owner of an invention made in the United States. \n15\n\u00a0\n\n  There is force in the petitioner's argument that the distinction seems illogical. Thus, if a diligent domestic inventor applies, in good faith believing himself to be the first inventor, Section 4923 assures him a patent and gives it priority, despite prior foreign use, even though that use is evidenced by a patent applied for after the invention made in this country. The foreign applicant or patentee \n\n[307 \nU.S. 5\n, 14]\n\u00a0\n cannot carry the date of his invention back of the date of application in this country, as the holder of a later patent for an invention made here would be permitted to do in order to establish priority. On the other hand, a domestic inventor who is willing to dedicate his invention to the public may be held as an infringer by reason of the later patenting of an invention abroad which antedates the invention and use in this country; and so is put in a worse position vis a vis a foreign inventor who subsequently secures a patent, and succeeds in establishing an earlier date of invention, than he would occupy if he had promoted his own interest by procuring a patent.\n  We have no way of knowing whether the discrimination results from inadvertence or from some undisclosed legislative policy, but, in order to redress the disadvantage under which one in the petitioner's situation suffers, we should have to read into the law words which plainly are missing. \n16\n We cannot thus rewrite the statute. \n17\n Moreover, Sections 4886 and 4887 have repeatedly been amended and other portions of the patent act have been revised and amended from time to time since the decisions pointing out that Section 4886 did not prevent the foreign inventor from carrying back his date of invention beyond the date of his application. Congress has not seen fit to amend the statute in this respect and we must assume that it has been satisfied with, and adopted, the construction given to its enactment by the courts. \n18\n\u00a0\n\n[307 \nU.S. 5\n, 15]\n\u00a0\n  We are of opinion that the courts below were right in not limiting Shimadzu's date of invention to the date of his application but allowing him to show an earlier actual date.\n  Second. A patent is not validly issued if the invention 'is proved to have been abandoned.'19 Abandonment may be evidenced by the express and voluntary declaration of the inventor;20 it may be inferred from negligence or unexplained delay in making application for patent;21 it may be declared as a consequence of the inventor's concealing his invention and delaying application for patent in an endeavor to extend the term of the patent protection beyond the period fixed by the statute. \n22\n In any case, the question whether the invention has been abandoned is one of fact. \n 23\n\u00a0\n\n  Referring to a Japanese patent applied for November 27, 1920, and issued May 10, 1922, the District Court found (17 F.Supp. 47): 'We are not concerned with the motives which prompted him * * * to confine it (the Japanese patent) to the single step of mechanical removal of the dust from the drum, and to withhold the really essential steps of the invention for later patenting. It is sufficient to say that he had the right to do this if he chose.' Taken in connection with the court's finding that Shimadzu's inventions were conceived and reduced to practise in August 1919 this finding is said to convict him of intentional and inexcusable concealment. In the light of the record we are unable so to hold. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 5\n, 16]\n\u00a0\n  R.S.  492024 makes abandonment an affirmative defense which must be pleaded and proved. \n25\n Admittedly the defense was not pleaded and the respondents assert, without contradiction, that it was not relied upon in brief or argument in the courts below. The petitioner explains its failure so to plead by saying that, when it filed its answer, it believed that certain of the Japanese patents issued to Shimadzu covered the identical inventions described in the patents in suit and invalidated the latter because application was not made in this country within one year of the grant of the foreign patents as required by R.S.  4887. The claim is that the refusal to sustain this defense and the assignment of August 1919 as the date of invention, took petitioner by surprise; and that the question of Shimadzu's concealment of his invention from 1919 until he made his applications in the United States did not emerge until the District Court's decision was rendered.\n  We think this is not a sufficient excuse for not pleading the defense. Alternative and inconsistent defenses may be pleaded. \n26\n Certainly if the petitioner was surprised it could at least have requested an opportunity to amend its answer. If the defense had been pleaded originally or by amendment the respondents would have had an opportunity to meet it by proof and this they appear not to have been afforded. We have a finding which seems not to have been addressed to this issue; and no findings as to the circumstances which led to the delay in filing applications. In the circumstances we think we are not justified in assigning to the findings below the force of a finding that Shimadzu, with intent, concealed \n\n[307 \nU.S. 5\n, 17]\n\u00a0\n his invention and delayed making applications for the purpose of unduly extending the life of his patents,-a defense not pleaded.\n  Third. If a valid patent is to issue, the invention must not have been in public use in this country for more than two years prior to the filing of the application. \n27\n Such public use is an affirmative defense to be pleaded and proved. \n28\n The respondents insist that it was not pleaded in this case and that the findings respecting the defense, on which the petitioner relies, are unsupported by the evidence. We cannot agree with either position.\n  Although not required so to do, the respondents in their bill pleaded with respect to each of the patents that the invention had not been in public use for more than two years before application filed. The petitioner denied the allegation as to each patent and, in addition, alleged that it was successfully making and selling the product of the invention in its plant long before it ever learned of Shimadzu's existence or his inventions, and further asserted that 'the claims of said letters patent are invalid and void because the subject matter thereof was, prior to the alleged invention thereof by Shimadzu, and for more than two years prior to his application dates, known to and used by the defendant at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, * * *' Upon the trial, employes of the petitioner described an early apparatus and process used in 1918 and 1919 and abandoned in the latter year when experiments began towards employment of the apparatus and process the petitioner now uses. They testified to the increasing perfection of the apparatus and process during the early months of 1921, and that commercial production was accomplished sometime between \n\n[307 \nU.S. 5\n, 18]\n\u00a0\n April and June of that year. Former employes of the petitioner were called by the respondents and described this apparatus and process as used and practised in the petitioner's plant in Philadelphia subsequent to the date of Shimadzu's applications, but the evidence indicates that, after its perfection in 1921, the same apparatus has been used, and the same process practised, from that date to the present. This is the apparatus and process which the courts below have held to infringe. The District Court found 'commercial production by the Hardinge mill with its forced air draft undoubtedly involved the use of the plaintiff's patent, and June, 1921, may be fixed as the date when that began.' The respondents insist that this does not amount to a finding of prior public use, distinguishing between the court's phrase 'commercial production' and the designation 'public use' found in the statute. We think the position is untenable.\n  The finding of the District Court appears under a heading in its opinion entitled 'Alleged Prior Public Use.' As originally promulgated the finding fixed January 1921 as the date of commercial production. The respondents sought a rehearing and asked that the finding as to commercial production in January 1921 be revised. A rehearing was granted and the District Judge filed a memorandum amending his opinion. In this he said: 'As to the second statement of fact, it may be said at once that it was never intended by the Court to make a finding of a prior public use (in the statutory sense of that term) by the defendant in January 1921.' After discussing the use of the apparatus in the early months of 1921, the court said: 'It is therefore plain that there is no evidence of anything beyond an experimental use by the defendant earlier than about the middle of the year 1921. It is entirely possible that the word 'January' in \n\n[307 \nU.S. 5\n, 19]\n\u00a0\n the second statement of fact referred to above is a mere typographical error and that what the Court had in mind was, 'June'. However that may be and in order to avoid any possible misunderstanding as to the scope of the finding, I will amend it to read 'Commercial production by the Hardinge mill with its forced air draft undoubtedly involved the use of the plaintiff's patent, and June, 1921, may be fixed as the date when that began.\"\n  Both parties appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals. That the respondents understood the force and effect of the finding as to prior use is evident from their assignments, one of which is that the District Court erred 'in finding and adjudging that commercial production by the Hardinge mill with its forced draft involving the use of plaintiff's patent began in June 1921.'\n  It remains to determine whether the commercial use found is, in contemplation of law, a public use within the meaning of R.S.  4886. We hold that it is.\n  The earlier Acts provided that the bar should consist in public use or sale 'with the applicant's consent or allowance prior to the application.'29 The Act of 183930 altered the clause to read 'no patent shall be held to be invalid' except upon proof that 'such * * * prior use has been for more than two years prior to such application for a patent.' This court construed the later Act, which has been carried forward into the revised statutes, as rendering prior public use a bar whether the use was with or without the consent of the patentee. \n31\n\u00a0\n\n  Decisions turning on prior public use have been numerous both in this court and in other federal courts; and the definition of such use, formulated when the statute made only use by consent a bar, has been adopted in \n\n[307 \nU.S. 5\n, 20]\n\u00a0\n instances where the use was without consent or knowledge of the applicant for patent. \n32\n\u00a0\n\n  A mere experimental use is not the public use defined by the Act,33 but a single use for profit, not purposely hidden, is such. \n34\n The ordinary use of a machine or the practise of a process in a factory in the usual course of producing articles for commercial purposes is a public use. \n35\n\u00a0\n\n  In the present case the evidence is that the petitioner, since June 1921, has continuously employed the alleged infringing machine and process for the production of lead oxide powder used in the manufacture of plates for storage batteries which have been sold in quantity. There is no finding, and we think none would have been justified, to the effect that the machine, process, and product were not well known to the employes in the plant, or that efforts were made to conceal them from anyone who had a legitimate interest in understanding them. \n36\n This use, begun more than two years before Shimadzu applied for patents 1,584,150 and 1,896,020, invalidated the claims in suit.\n  Fourth. The defense of prior public use is not made out against patent 1,584,149, for which application was \n\n[307 \nU.S. 5\n, 21]\n\u00a0\n filed January 30, 1922. The defendant's commercial production commenced about six months earlier. The District Court held the patent valid and infringed. Its claims cover merely a process for the production of a finely divided chemically reactive lead powder by introducing relatively large masses of lead into a rotatable vessel, rotating the vessel at a relatively low speed, forming the powder by attrition resulting from the rubbing of the masses against each other, and blowing the powder from the vessel by a current of air. The process and apparatus covered by the other two patents in issue involve use and control of an air current and use and control of temperature within the receptacle for the oxidation of the lead. With respect to 1,584,149 the trial court said:\n'Whether or not '149 is for the same process as U.S. patent '150 is immaterial, so far as the question of validity of either is concerned. There is no double patenting involved. The two patents issued on the same day. They both expired on the same day. There can be no extension of the monopoly and one is not prior art against the other.\n\n'The fact that '149 does not disclose the oxidizing function of the air or refer to the highly important element of the process having to do with the temperature control necessary to its successful operation might throw doubt upon its validity in view of the prior art. This is, of course, upon the assumption that it is not for the same invention as '150. The whole matter however is rather academic since '149 is coincident in duration with '150, and the defendant's process infringes the somewhat more precise, if not narrower, claims of '150.\n\n'This patent is therefore held valid and infringed.'\n\n  The holding was assigned as error in the Circuit Court of Appeals and is specified as error in the petition for certiorari. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 5\n, 22]\n\u00a0\n  In view of our decision as to 1,584,150 and of the basis of the decision below respecting 1,584,149, we think the petitioner is entitled to a reexamination of the questions of the validity and infringement of the latter.\n  The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be reversed and the cause remanded to the District Court with directions to dismiss the bill as to Nos. 1,584,150 and 1,896,020, and to proceed, in the light of the dismissal as to those patents, to determine whether 1,584,149 is valid and infringed.\n  It is so ordered.\n  Reversed and remanded. \nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n]  Patents  Date granted  Claims    1,584,149 5\/11\/1926 1 and 2    1,584,150 5\/11\/1926 1-4, 6, 8-13    1,896,020 1\/31\/1933 10 and 11  \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 17 F.Supp. 42.  \n[\nFootnote 3\n] 3 Cir., 98 F.2d 831.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] At the trial the respondents relied, to some extent, upon an adjudication in an interference proceeding between Shimadzu and Hall, an employe of the petitioner who in 1924 applied for a patent for a process of producing finely powdered mixed lead and lead oxide.

Darby, Jr., of New York City, for petitioners.\n Mr. George Whitefield Betts, Jr., of New York City, for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was a suit in equity by the respondents for alleged infringement of a patent. The District Court held claim \n\n[307 \nU.S. 241, 242]\n\u00a0\n 1 valid but not infringed and claim 2 invalid. \n1\n Instead of dismissing the bill without more, it entered a decree adjudging claim 1 valid but dismissing the bill for failure to prove infringement.\n The respondents did not appeal, but filed in the Patent Office a disclaimer of claim 2. The petitioners appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals from so much of the decree as adjudicated claim 1 valid. The appeal was dismissed on the ground that the petitioners had been awarded all the relief to which they were entitled, the litigation having finally terminated in their favor. \n2\n The court was of opinion that the decree would not bind the petitioners in subsequent suits on the issue of the validity of claim 1.\n We granted certiorari because of an alleged conflict of decision. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n A party may not appeal from a judgment or decree in his favor, for the purpose of obtaining a review of findings he deems erroneous which are not necessary to support the decree. \n4\n But here the decree itself purports to adjudge the validity of claim 1, and though the adjudication was immaterial to the disposition of the cause, it stands as an adjudication of one of the issues litigated. We think the petitioners were entitled to have this portion of the decree eliminated, and that the Circuit Court of Appeals had jurisdiction,5 as we have held this court has,6 to entertain the appeal, not for the purpose of passing on the merits, but to direct the reformation of the decree. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 241, 243]\n\u00a0\n The judgment is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the Circuit Court of Appeals with instructions to entertain the appeal and direct the District Court to reform its decree in accordance with the views herein expressed.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] D.C., 23 F.Supp. 920. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 2 Cir., 100 F.2d 403. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Electrical Fittings Corp. v.

HELVERING(1939)\nNo. 26\nArgued: Decided: November 6, 1939\n\n\n\n Mr. Harry C. Weeks, of Fort Worth, Tex., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Frank Murphy, Atty. Gen., and Arnold Raum, Sp. Asst. Atty. Gen., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case presents the same issue as is involved in No. 1, Helvering v. Wilshire Oil Co., Inc., \n308 \nU.S. 90\n, 60 S.Ct. 18, except that it arises under the Revenue Act of 1932, 47 Stat. 169. In computing its taxable net income under that Act, petitioner deducted certain development expenditures as it had done since its organization in 1925. But it refused to take these same deductions in computing net income for the purpose of applying the 50 per cent limitation on the depletion allowance, as provided in  114(b)(3) of the \n\n[308 \nU.S. 104, 105]\n\u00a0\n 1932 Act, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 519.1 That section, so far as material here, was the same as  114(b)(3) of the 1928 Act, 45 Stat. 791, 821, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 384. And Treasury Regulations 77, Art. 221(h) promulgated under the 1932 Act2 defined 'net income ... from the property' as used in  114(b)(3) so as to require 'development costs' of the kind here involved to be deducted from 'gross income from the property'.3 The Board of Tax Appeals held that petitioner need not deduct these \n\n[308 \nU.S. 104, 106]\n\u00a0\n development expenditures in applying the 50 per cent limitation on depletion allowance (36 B.T.A. 1327) and the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed (5 Cir., 102 F.2d 596). Since we have this day decided in Helvering v. Wilshire Oil Co., Inc., supra, that comparable regulations under the 1928 Act were lawful, a fortiori those here involved are valid and binding on petitioner. The judgment of the court below was therefore right and is\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice BUTLER and Mr. Justice REED took no part in the consideration or disposition of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] That section provided:\n'In the case of oil and gas wells the allowance for depletion shall be 27 1\/2 percentum of the gross income from the property during the taxable year, excluding from such gross income an amount equal to any rents or royalties paid or incurred by the taxpayer in respect of the property. Such allowance shall not exceed 50 per centum of the net income of the taxpayer (computed without allowance for depletion) from the property, except that in no case shall the depletion allowance be less than it would be if computed without reference to this paragraph.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Section 23(l) of the Revenue Act of 1932, 26 U.S.C.A.Int.Rev.Code,  23(m), provided:\n'In computing net income there shall be allowed as deductions:\n\n'(l) Depletion.-In the case of mines, oil and gas wells, other natural deposits, and timber, a reasonable allowance for depletion and for depreciation of improvements, according to the peculiar conditions in each case; such reasonable allowance in all cases to be made under rules and regulations to be prescribed by the Commissioner, with the approval of the Secretary. ...' \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Treasury Regulations 77, Art. 221(h) provided:\n\"Net income of the taxpayer (computed without allowance for depletion) from the property,' as used in section 114(b)(2), (3), and (4) and articles 221 to 248, inclusive, means the 'gross income from the property' as defined in paragraph (g) less the allowable deductions attributable to the mineral property upon which the depletion is claimed and the allowable deductions attributable to the processes listed in paragraph (g) insofar as they relate to the product of such property, including overhead and operating expenses, development costs properly charged to expense, depreciation, taxes, losses sustained, etc., but excluding any allowance for depletion. ...' \n\n\n\n\n\n","36":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFAIRBANKS v. UNITED STATES(1939)\nNo. 65\nArgued: February 28, 1939Decided: March 27, 1939\n\n\n\n Messrs. William Stanley, of Washington, D.C., and Arthur F. Driscoll, of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. Andrew D. Sharpe, Sp. Asst. to Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Both courts below ruled that gain derived by the petitioner from redemption of bonds during 1927, 1928 and \n\n[306 \nU.S. 436, 437]\n\u00a0\n 1929 was not 'capital gain' within the meaning of the controlling statutes.\n No contest exists concerning the facts. The narrow point as counsel agree is this-Must the redemption of bonds before maturity by the issuing corporation be treated as tantamount to a sale or exchange of capital assets within the meaning of section 208(a)(1), Revenue Act 1926, and section 101(c)(1), Revenue Act 1928.1\n If redemption amounts to sale or exchange, the petitioner's gain was subject to taxation at the twelve and one-half per cent rate; otherwise, under normal and surtax rates.\n Payment and discharge of a bond is neither sale nor exchange within the commonly accepted meaning of the words. The courts below found no sufficient reason for disregarding this and rightly applied the statutes under that view.\n The Tax Acts of 1921, 1924, 1926, 1928 and 1932 contain like definitions of capital gain. From 1921 to 1929 the Commissioner held that such gain did not arise from redemption. In 1929 the Board of Tax Appeals held otherwise. Werner v. Commissioner, 15 B.T.A. 482. But in 1932 it definitely overruled that determination. Watson v. Commissioner, 27 B.T.A. 463. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 436, 438]\n\u00a0\n The revenue Act 1934 (May 10, 1934, c. 277, 48 Stat. 680, 714-715) provides-\n'Sec. 117. ( 101.) Capital gains and losses.\n\n'(a) General rule. In the case of a taxpayer, other than a corporation, only the following percentages of the gain or loss recognized upon the sale or exchange of a capital asset shall be taken into account in computing net income: ...\n\n'(f) Retirement of bonds, etc. For the purposes of this title ( chapter), amounts received by the holder upon the retirement of bonds, debentures, notes, or certificates or other evidences of indebtedness issued by any corporation (including those issued by a government or political subdivision thereof), with interest coupons or in registered form, shall be considered as amounts received in exchange therefor.' 26 U. S.C.A.  101(a, f).\n\n What we regard as the correct meaning of the definition of capital gain in the Revenue Act 1921 and its four successors is accentuated by long-continued executive construction, also the last conclusion of the Board of Tax Appeals.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals below was right in holding that by the Act 1934 Congress did not attempt to construe the prior Acts and purposely made a material addition thereto. In Averill v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 101 F.2d 644, decided Dec. 28, 1938, the Circuit Court of Appeals First Circuit acted upon a different view. This conflict caused us to bring up the present cause notwithstanding the application for certiorari had been denied earlier in the term.\n The challenged judgment must be\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Revenue Act 1921 (November 23, 1921, c. 136, 42 Stat. 227, 232) provides-\n'Sec. 206. (a) That for the purpose of this title:\n\n'(1) The term 'capital gain' means taxable gain from the sale or exchange of capital assets consummated after December 31, 1921.'\n\n This provision without material change was reenacted by Revenue Act 1924 (June 2, 1924, c. 234, sec. 208(a)(1), 43 Stat. 253, 262); Revenue Act 1926 (February 26, 1926, c. 27, sec. 208(a)(1), 44 Stat. 9, 19); Revenue Act 1928 (May 29, 1928, c. 852, sec. 101(c)(1), 45 Stat. 791, 811, 26 U.S.C.A.  101 note); Revenue Act of 1932 (June 6, 1932, c. 209, sec. 101(c)(1), 47 Stat. 169, 191, 26 U.S.C.A.  101 note). \n\n\n\n\n","37":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFEDERAL POWER COMMISSION v.

Newport Electric Corp. v. Federal Power Commission, 2 Cir., 97 F.2d 580. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 156, 158]\n\u00a0\n The sole issue before us is whether an order of the Federal Power Commission, denying an application under Section 203(a)1 of the Federal Power Act, as amended, 16 U.S.C.A.  824b(a), is reviewable under Section 313(b) of that Act, 16 U.S.C.A.  825l(b).\n The Inland Power & Light Company, an Oregon corporation, owns three hydro-electric projects in Oregon and Washington, two of which are operated under license of the Federal Power Commission, and the third, under a permit issued by the Secretary of the Interior. The Pacific Power & Light Company, a Maine corporation, is engaged in generating and distributing electric energy in Washington and Oregon, and owns and operates facilities for interstate transmission of electricity. The Inland and Pacific Companies filed a joint application with the Power Commission for approval, under Sections 8 and 203 of the Act, 16 U.S.C.A.  801, 824b, of a proposed transfer of all the assets, including licenses, of Inland to Pacific, and of the termination of Inland's existence. Having found after due hearing and consideration that 'applicants have failed to establish that said transfer will be consistent with the public interest within the contemplation of Section 203(a) of the Federal Power Act', e Commission ordered that 'the application be and the same hereby is denied.'\n Invoking Section 313(b) of the Federal Power Act, the applicants initiated the present proceedings in the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to review the \n\n[307 \nU.S. 156, 159]\n\u00a0\n order of the Commission as unwarranted in law and unsupported in its findings. The exact scope of the prayer is postponed for later consideration. The Power Commission challenged the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court of Appeals by a motion to dismiss the petition on the ground that the court was without jurisdiction under Section 313(b), since the order sought to be set aside was negative in character. The denial of that motion brought the case here.\n If the Federal Power Act had formally taken over the statutory provisions of the Urgent Deficiencies Act pertaining to review of orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission, the decision in Rochester Telephone Corp. v. United States, \n307 \nU.S. 125\n, 59 S.Ct. 754, 83 L.Ed. --, would dispose of this case and sustain the assumption of jurisdiction below. But the Power Act contains a distinctive formulation of the conditions under which resort to the courts may be made and Congress determines the scope of jurisdiction of the lower federal courts. Section 313(b) provides that 'Any party to a proceeding under this chapter aggrieved by an order issued by the Commission in such proceeding may obtain a review of such order in the Circuit Court of Appeals of the United States'. The denial by the Commission of approval of the application by petitioners of the transfer of Inland to Pacific as not 'consistent with the public interest' was an 'order,' and the petitioners were 'aggrieved' by it since without such approval the transfer was forbidden. Section 203(a). Thus the statutory scheme of the Power Act only reinforces the analysis made in the Rochester case.\n But it is urged that review of the Power Commission's order does not present a 'Case' or 'Controversy', because the court itself cannot lift the prohibition of the statute by granting permission for the transfer, nor order the Commission to grant such permission. And so it is \n\n[307 \nU.S. 156, 160]\n\u00a0\n claimed that any action of a court in setting aside the order of the Commission would be an empty gesture, since without permission a transfer would be unlawful. But this proves too much. In none of the situations in which an action of the Interstate Commerce Commission or of a similar federal regulatory body comes for scrutiny before a federal court can judicial action supplant the discretionary authority of a commission. A federal court cannot fix rates nor make divisions of joint rates nor relieve from the long-short haul clause nor formulate car practices. So here it is immaterial that the court itself cannot approve or disapprove the transfer. The court has power to pass judgment upon challenged principles of law insofar as they are relevant to the disposition made by the Commission. '... a judgment rendered will be a final and indisputable basis of action as between the Commission and the defendant.' Interstate Commerce Commission v. Baird, \n194 \nU.S. 25, 38\n, 24 S.Ct. 563, 566. In making such a judgment the court does not intrude upon the province of the Commission, while the constitutional requirements of 'Case' or 'Controversy' are satisfied. For purposes of judicial finality there is no more reason for assuming that a Commission will disregard the direction of a reviewing court than that a lower court will do so.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] No public utility shall sell, lease, or otherwise dispose of the whole of its facilities subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, or any part thereof of a value in excess of $50,000, or by any means whatsoever, directly or indirectly, merge or consolidate such facilities or any part thereof with those of any other person, or purchase, acquire, or take any security of any other public utility, without first having secured an order of the Commission authorizing it to do so. ...

Counsel do not question the right of the state to collect this tax from the user, etc., but they say that, in the circumstances here disclosed, the officers may not compel appellant to serve as an agent for collecting the tax as they are threatening to do.\n The trial court, three judges, dismissed the bill upon motion.\n It appears-\n Appellant, an Illinois corporation, is engaged in manufacturing and selling comptometers in that state and delivering these to purchasers in various parts of the Union. As stated by the court below its method of doing business with respect to California purchasers is substantially as follows:\n'Pursuant to a separate contract made with each, the exclusive right to solicit orders in California is granted to two general agents, each of whom is allotted a separate section of the State. Under this contract the only compensation paid to a general agent consists of commissions on sales made. Each general agent may employ sub-agents and also a demonstrator for the purpose of demonstrating and instructing respecting the comptometers, provided such employment is approved by plaintiff. Likewise, plaintiff agrees by this contract to pay the rent of an office for each general agent, provided the lease to the same has been approved by it, such of- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 62, 65]\n\u00a0\n fice to be used exclusively in furthering its business; also agrees to pay part of the traveling expenses incurred by each general agent, his sub- agents and demonstrators while traveling on business trips authorized by plaintiff, and also to reimburse each general agent to the extent of part of the monies advanced to a subagent and, in addition, in the amount of $ 40.00 per month toward the salary of a demonstrator. Plaintiff assumes no other financial obligation with respect to subagents and demonstrators. Under this contract the general agent must devote his entire time and attention to soliciting orders for plaintiff. All orders taken must be submitted to and approved by plaintiff, all sales and deliveries must be made by, and all bills for such orders as are accepted must be rendered by, the plaintiff. The general agent is prohibited from making collections and all payments must be made directly to plaintiff. The contract further requires the general agent to maintain certain records, and make certain reports and make a specified minimum number of calls on prospective customers.'\n\n And further 'That each of these two general agents maintains an office in this State, the lease to such office designating the plaintiff as lessee therein, the rent for the same being paid by plaintiff, while all other expenses of maintaining such office are paid by the general agent. As soon as an order is accepted a particular machine is appropriated for that purpose in plaintiff's shipping department in Illinois. All machines sold for delivery in California are shipped from one of plaintiff's distributing points outside of the State. Sometimes machines are forwarded directly to the purchasers, while in other instances, in order to secure reduced freight charges, large groups of machines are shipped to the general agent who makes delivery to the respective purchasers. The only machines kept by plaintiff in California are those used as \n\n[306 \nU.S. 62, 66]\n\u00a0\n demonstrators. Plaintiff has never qualified to do intrastate business in California.'\n The Use Tax Act (sec. 6, St.Cal.1937, p. 1938) directs retailers maintaining a place of business in the state, and making sales of tangible personal property for storage, use or other consumption therein, to collect from the purchaser the tax imposed.\n Appellant presents for our consideration two points: (1) The statute as construed and applied by the appellees to the appellant is repugnant to Art. 1, section 8, clause 3 of the Federal Constitution, U.S.C.A. (2) The threatened enforcement of the statute would deprive appellant of his property without Due Process of Law contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S.C.A.\n The argument is this-\n The appellant, an Illinois corporation, carried on no intrastate operations in California and is not subject to its jurisdiction. Such business as it transacts in California is interstate in character. California, therefore, lacks the power to require it (1) to act as the state's collecting agent with respect to use tax which may become due from California storers, users or consumers, or (2) to insure payment of such tax if it fails to make collections from the tax debtors, or (3) otherwise to act as a 'retailer' as defined by the Act and the appellees. The treatment of the appellant as a retailer subject to the provisions of the California Use Tax Act is a direct burden upon interstate commerce prohibited by the Federal Constitution. Numerous provisions of the statute, if applied, would deprive appellant of its property without due process of law.\n The trial court thought that both contentions were foreclosed by what was said and ruled in Bowman et al. v. Continental Oil Co., \n256 \nU.S. 642, 650\n, 41 S.Ct. 606, 609, Monamotor Oil Co. v. Johnson et al., \n292 \nU.S. 86, 93\n, 95 S., 54 S.Ct. 575, 578, and Henneford et al. v. Silas Mason Co. et al., \n300 \nU.S. 577, 582\n, 583 S., 57 S.Ct. 524, 526, 527. And we agree with that conclusion. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 62, 67]\n\u00a0\n Henneford v. Silas Mason Co. upheld a Washington statute similar to the one under consideration. The opinion declared (pages 582, 583, 57 S.Ct. page 526)-\n'The tax is not upon the operations of interstate commerce, but upon the privilege of use after commerce is at an end.\n\n'Things acquired or transported in interstate commerce may be subjected to a property tax, nondiscriminatory in its operation, when they have become part of the common mass of property within the state of destination. ... This is so, indeed, though they are still in the original packages. ... For like reasons they may be subjected, when once they are at rest, to a nondiscriminatory tax upon use or enjoyment. ... A tax upon the privilege of use or storage when the chattel used or stored has ceased to be in transit is now an impost so common that its validity has been withdrawn from the arena of debate.'\n\n Bowman v. Continental Oil Company recognized the right of the state to require a distributor 'to render detailed statements of all gasoline received, sold, or used by it, whether in interstate commerce or not, to the end that the state may the more readily enforce said excise tax to the extent that it has lawful power to enforce it as above stated.' (Page 609.)\n Monamotor Oil Co. v. Johnson upheld an Iowa statute. The complainant there sought an injunction prohibiting tax officers from requiring the distributor of motor oil received from another state to pay into the state treasury the tax levied upon the consumer. This Court said (pages 93, 95, 54 S.Ct. page 578), 'There is no substance in the claim that the statutes impose a burden upon interstate commerce, .... The statute in terms imposes the tax on motor vehicle fuel used or otherwise disposed of in the state. Instead of collecting the tax from the user through its own officers, the state makes the distributor its agent for that \n\n[306 \nU.S. 62, 68]\n\u00a0\n purpose. This is a common and entirely lawful arrangement. ... The statute obviously was not intended to reach transactions in interstate commerce, but to tax the use of motor fuel after it had come to rest in Iowa, and the requirement that the appellant as the shipper into Iowa shall, as agent of the state, report and pay the tax on the gasoline thus coming into the state for use by others on whom the tax falls imposes no unconstitutional burden either upon interstate commerce or upon the appellant.'\n The challenged judgment must be affirmed.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS took no part in the consideration or decision of this cause. \n\n\n\n","39":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFIRST CHROLD CORPORATION v.

Palmer Hutcheson and Gaius G. Gannon, both of Houston, Tex., for petitioner.\n Mr. Glenn R. Lewis, of San Angelo, Tex., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question for determination in this proceeding is the validity, as applied to this petitioner, of a statute of the State of Texas levying an annual franchise tax on all corporations chartered or authorized to do business in Texas, measured by a graduated charge upon such proportion of the outstanding capital stock, surplus and undivided profits of the corporation, plus its long term obligations, as the gross receipts of its Texas business bear to the total gross receipts from its entire business.\n The Court of Appeals1 affirmed the judgment of the District Court, upholding the validity of the tax. On account of an alleged probable conflict with the principles underlying certain decisions of this Court certiorari was granted. \n2\n The applicable provisions of the statute appear below. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n[308 \nU.S. 331, 333]\n\u00a0\n By Article 7057b of the Revised Civil Statutes of Texas, Vernon's Ann. Civ.St.Tex., art. 7057b, any corporation which may be required to pay any franchise or other privilege tax may pay it under written protest and bring suit within a limited time thereafter in any court of competent jurisdiction in Travis County, Texas, against the public official charged with the duty of collecting such tax, the State Treasurer and the Attorney General, for its recovery. This suit was instituted in the District Court of the United States, Western District, Austin Division, against the state officials authorized to be made defendants. Defendants joined in a demurrer on the ground that no cause of action was set out in the petition.\n Petitioner owns and operates a large manufactory of motor vehicles in Michigan and assembly plants in Texas. No parts for the automobiles produced by petitioner are manufactured at any point within Texas. The manufactured parts are shipped to petitioner's assembly plants in Texas and are there assembled. The assembled vehicles are sold in intrastate commerce to various dealers who in turn sell the vehicles to the public. A relatively small number of completed vehicles are shipped into Texas and later sold in intrastate commerce along with large quantities of motor parts and accessories. Without undertaking to be precise, the gross receipts from business done in Texas for the year in question amounted to approximately $34,000,000. Petitioner's total gross re- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 331, 334]\n\u00a0\n ceipts were about $888,000,000. The ratio of Texas receipts to total receipts was 3.85 per cent. Petitioner's total taxable capital was $600, 000,000 . The value of all assets located in Texas was somewhat over $3, 000,000, while the value of the capital allocated to Texas as a base for taxation by the statutory formula would be in excess of $23,000,000.\n For the taxable year beginning May 1, 1936, a franchise tax was tendered Texas in the sum of $1,224, computed on the actual net book balue of all of petitioner's assets in Texas. On demand and under protest an additional franchise tax and penalty was paid in the sum of $7,529, based on the allocation to Texas of capital as calculated by the statutory formula. This suit was brought to recover the alleged unlawful exaction.\n This exaction, petitioner pleads, is calculated from a formula that results in the levy of a tax on assets used in petitioner's interstate business in violation of Article I, Section 8, of the Constitution U.S.C.A. It is further alleged that the tax operates to deprive petitioner of its property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment because it must pay a tax on property neither located nor used within the State of Texas and on activities beyond the borders of Texas.\n The statute calls the excise a franchise tax. It is obviously payment for the privilege of carrying on business in Texas. \n4\n There is no question but that the State has the power to make a charge against domestic or foreign corporations for the opportunity to transact this intrastate business. \n5\n The exploitation by foreign corporations \n\n[308 \nU.S. 331, 335]\n\u00a0\n of intrastate opportunities under the protection and encouragement of local government offers a basis for taxation as unrestricted as that for domestic corporations. In laying a local privilege tax, the state sovereignty may place a charge upon that privilege for the protection afforded. When that charge, as here, is based upon the proportion of the capital employed in Texas, calculated by the percentage of sales which are within the state, no provision of the Federal Constitution is violated.\n The motor vehicles for the marketing of which the privilege is used are concededly sold in intrastate commerce. The tax here levied is not for the privilege of engaging in any transaction across state lines or activity carried on in another state. It is much like that upheld in Bass, Ratcliff & Gretton, Limited, v. State Tax Commission. \n6\n In that case a tax was laid for the privilege of doing business in New York determined, for corporations which did not transact all their business within that state, by a percentage of that part of the net income which is calculated by the proportion which the aggregate of specified classes of property within the state bears to all the property of the corporation. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n In National Leather Company v. Massachusetts8 this Court upheld a tax for the privilege of doing business in a state by a corporation of an amount 'equal to five dollars per thousand upon the value of the corporate excess employed by it within the Commonwealth.' This excess was defined as 'such proportion of the fair cash value of all the shares constituting the capital stock ... as the value of the assets, both real and personal, employed in any business within the Commonwealth ... bears to the value of the total assets of the corporation.' The National Leather Company, a Maine corporation, owned the stock of two \n\n[308 \nU.S. 331, 336]\n\u00a0\n other Maine corporations. Their plants were in Massachusetts. On the assumption that the situs of the stock followed the domicile of the owner, the taxpayer challenged the inclusion of the Maine stock in the basis for the local tax. This Court held that Massachusetts was free to use the stock for the calculation of the local tax. Similar methods of determining privilege taxes were left to the states in International Shoe Company v. Shartel9 and New York v. Latrobe. \n10\n The Constitution recognizes the dual interests of the national and state governments and permits taxes for local privileges upon the intrastate activities of the farflung enterprises which gain large benefits from the nationwide market, protected by the commerce clause. We reject petitioner's contention that constitutionality of state taxation turns on so narrow an issue as whether local assets rather than local gross receipts are used in a taxing formula.\n In a unitary enterprise, property outside the state, when correlated in use with property within the state, necessarily affects the worth of the privilege within the state. Financial power inherent in the possession of assets may be applied, with flexibility, at whatever point within or without the state the managers of the business may determine. For this reason it is held that an entrance fee may be properly measured by capital wherever located. \n11\n The weight, in determining the value of the intrastate privilege, given the property beyond the state boundaries is but a recognition of the very real effect its existence has upon the value of the privilege granted within the taxing state. This was recognized by this Court in Great Atlantic & \n\n[308 \nU.S. 331, 337]\n\u00a0\n Pacific Tea Company v. Grosjean12 where an occupation or license tax on chain stores was graduated 'on the number of stores or mercantile establishments' included under the same management 'whether operated in this State or not.' We said: 'The law rates the privilege enjoyed in Louisiana according to the nature and extent of that privilege in the light of the advantages, the capacity, and the competitive ability of the chain's stores in Louisiana considered not by themselves, as if they constituted the whole organization, but in their setting as integral parts of a much larger organization.' \n13\n This same rule applies here. James v. Dravo Contracting Company14 contains nothing contrary to this view. The statute under consideration there levied a privilege tax 'equal to two per cent of the gross income of the business.' In so far as it was upon receipts in other states for work done in other states, it was conceded to be outside of the taxing power of the statute.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS is of opinion that the judgment complained of should be reversed.\n Mr. Justice BLACK and Mr. Justice DOUGLAS concur in the result. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Ford Motor Co. v.

Wood, both of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. Charles Fahy, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case presents the question of the propriety of the action of the Circuit Court of Appeals in remanding a cause to the National Labor Relations Board for the purpose of setting aside its findings and order, and issuing \n\n[305 \nU.S. 364, 366]\n\u00a0\n proposed findings, and making its decision and order upon reconsideration.\n The National Labor Relations Board, on December 22, 1937, entered an order against petitioner directing it to desist from described practices and to offer reinstatement, with back pay, to certain discharged employees.\n On January 7, 1938, the Board filed its petition in No. 182 (called the Board's proceeding) in the Circuit Court of Appeals, seeking the enforcement of its order, and at the same time filed the transcript of the record.\n On April 4, 1938, petitioner asked leave to adduce additional evidence. On April 11, 1938, petitioner filed its answer to the Board's petition, alleging that the order was invalid and asking that it be set aside upon the grounds, among others, that the Board had failed to accord petitioner a full and fair hearing, and that the Board had not itself considered the evidence but had adopted as its own a decision prepared by its subordinates without affording petitioner any opportunity to be heard thereon. It was also alleged that the findings were not supported by the evidence. Petitioner moved for a commission to take the depositions of witnesses, and served interrogatories upon the Board.\n On May 2, 1938, after our decision in Morgan v. United States, April 25, 1938, \n304 \nU.S. 1\n, 58 S.Ct. 773, the Board filed a motion for leave to withdraw its petition for enforcement and the transcript of record, without prejudice. The Board stated that, should its motion be granted, it would set aside its order, would issue proposed findings with permission to the parties to file exceptions and present argument, and thereafter make its decision and order. On May 5, 1938, the court granted the Board's motion. On May 6, 1938, the Board served notice on petitioner of its intention to vacate its findings and order of December 22, 1937, but later in view of petitioner's objection held that action under advisement. On May 9, 1938, the or \n\n[305 \nU.S. 364, 367]\n\u00a0\n der of May 5th was amended so far as it permitted the withdrawal of the transcript of record and the court directed that the transcript remain on file. On June 2, 1938, the Board purported to withdraw its petition for enforcement. On June 4, 1938, the petitioner moved to vacate the order of May 5th. That motion was denied on June 10, 1938, with a stay of the withdrawal of the Board's petition pending application here for writ of certiorari. \n305 \nU.S. 585\n, 59 S.Ct. 80, 83 L.Ed. --.\n Meanwhile, on May 4, 1938, the petitioner filed with the Circuit Court of Appeals in No. 183 (called the petitioner's proceeding) its petition asking the court to review and set aside the Board's order of December 22, 1937. On May 9, 1938, the court directed that the transcript of record filed in the Board's proceeding should be deemed to have been filed in the petitioner's proceeding to review as of the date of May 4th. On June 2, 1938, the Board filed a motion to vacate that order of May 9th. At the same time the Board moved that in the event of a denial of that motion the case should be remanded to the Board for further proceedings.\n On June 10, 1938, the court entered its order denying certain motions of the petitioner for leave to amend its petition for review, denying the Board's motion to vacate the order of May 9th, and granting the Board's motion of June 2d-'to remand this cause to the National Labor Relations Board for the purpose of setting aside its findings and order of December 22, 1937, and issuing proposed findings, and making its decision and order upon a reconsideration of the entire case'.\n Because of the importance of the questions presented in relation to the scope of the court's jurisdiction and its appropriate exercise, certiorari was granted to review the order of May 5th, granting the Board's motion to withdraw its petition for enforcement, and the order of \n\n[305 \nU.S. 364, 368]\n\u00a0\n June 10th, remanding the cause as above stated. October 10, 1938\n\n\n First. The authority conferred upon the Board by Section 10(d)1 of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  160(d), to modify or set aside its findings and order, ended with the filing in court of the transcript of record. Upon the filing of the transcript in connection with the Board's petition for enforcement, and notice, the Circuit Court of Appeals had jurisdiction of the proceeding as provided in Section 10(e) of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  160(e), as follows:\n'Upon such filing (of the transcript), the court shall cause notice thereof to be served upon such person, and thereupon shall have jurisdiction of the proceeding and of the question determined therein, and shall have power to grant such temporary relief or restraining order as it deems just and proper, and to make and enter upon the pleadings, testimony, and proceedings set forth in such transcript a decree enforcing, modifying, and enforcing as so modified, or setting aside in whole or in part the order of the Board. ... The findings of the Board as to the facts, if supported by evidence, shall be conclusive. If either party shall apply to the court for leave to adduce additional evidence and shall show to the satisfaction of the court that such additional evidence is material and that there were reasonable grounds for the failure to adduce such evidence in the hearing before the Board, its member, agent, or agency, the court may order such additional evidence to be taken before the Board, its member, agent, or agency, and to be made a part of the transcript. The Board may modify its findings as to the \n\n[305 \nU.S. 364, 369]\n\u00a0\n facts, or make new findings, by reason of additional evidence so taken and filed, and it shall file such modified or new findings, which, if supported by evidence, shall be conclusive, and shall file its recommendations, if any, for the modification or setting aside of its original order. The jurisdiction of the court shall be exclusive and its judgment and decree shall be final, except that the same shall be subject to review ...'.\n\n Under Section 10(f), 29 U.S.C.A.  160(f), the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court of Appeals is of the same character and scope in a proceeding for review brought by a person aggrieved by an order of the Board as the jurisdiction which the court has in a proceeding instituted by the Board for enforcement. \n 2\n\u00a0\n\n While Section 10(f) assures to any aggrieved person opportunity to contest the Board's order, it does not require an unnecessary duplication of proceedings. The aim of the Act is to attain simplicity and directness both in the administrative procedure and on judicial review. Where the Board has petitioned for enforcement under Section 10(e) \n\n[305 \nU.S. 364, 370]\n\u00a0\n and the jurisdiction of the court has attached, no separate proceeding is needed on the part of the person thus brought into the court. The breadth of the jurisdiction conferred upon the court to set aside or modify in whole or in part the Board's order, or to permit new evidence to be taken, necessarily implies that the party proceeded against is entitled to raise all pertinent questions and to obtain any affirmative relief that is appropriate. Here, petitioner in the Board's proceeding had sought affirmative relief and had taken steps to establish that right. Considering the scope and purpose of the jurisdiction of the court in a proceeding under Section 10(e), and the position and rights of the person proceeded against, we are unable to conclude that the Board has an absolute right to withdraw its petition at its pleasure. We think that permission to withdraw must rest in the sound discretion of the court to be exercised in the light of the circumstances of the particular case. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n While in the instant case there are two proceedings, separately carried on the docket, they were essentially one so far as any question as to the legality of the Board's order was concerned. Petitioner's answer in the Board's proceeding presented substantially the same objections as those raised in petitioner's proceeding for review. The present contentions of the parties are largely addressed to procedural distinctions, but if we follow the course of the two proceedings we find that there is really but one ultimate question and that is with respect to the court's \n\n[305 \nU.S. 364, 371]\n\u00a0\n final action in remanding the cause to the Board for further proceedings.\n Before the court on May 5th granted the Board's motion to withdraw its petition, the other proceeding had been instituted by the filing of the petition for review on May 4th. That proceeding was taken by petitioner as a person aggrieved by the order of December 22, 1937, and was doubtless prompted by the Board's motion to withdraw its own petition. As the transcript of the record of the administrative proceeding had already been certified and filed, it was within the court's control. The order of May 5th was amended on May 9th so as to preclude the withdrawal of the transcript, and on the same day the court ordered that the transcript be deemed to be filed in the petitioner's proceeding as of May 4th. We see no reason to doubt the power of the court to retain the transcript or to amend its order of May 5th accordingly, and certiorari has not been sought by the Board in relation to the order of May 9th. Our decision In re Matter of the National Labor Relations Board, \n304 \nU.S. 486\n, 58 S.Ct. 1001, is not apposite. There the transcript had not been filed, the court had not acquired jurisdiction of the subject matter, and the Board still had the authority conferred upon it by Section 10(d). In the circumstances of the present case we think it is clear that the court was possessed of exclusive jurisdiction of the administrative proceeding 'and of the question determined therein', sec. 10(e), and thus of the power of 'enforcing, modifying, and enforcing as so modified, or setting aside in whole or in part the order of the Board'. Sec. 10(f). As on the Board's petition the court could grant affirmative relief to the person against whom the Board's order was directed, so on the court's entertaining the petition of that person for review the Board could seek not merely to have the petition denied but to have its order enforced, regardless of any separate proceeding to that end. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 364, 372]\n\u00a0\n It thus appears that neither the order of May 5th, granting the Board permission to withdraw its petition, nor the attempt of the Board on May 6th to reassume control of the administrative proceeding, nor the Board's withdrawal of its petition on June 2d, accomplished anything of substance, as the Board, in the presence of the court's continued and exclusive jurisdiction, remained without authority to deal with its order. And any question as to the propriety of the court's order of May 5th became one of merely academic interest after the court by its order of June 10th remanded the cause to the Board. We turn to the consideration of that order.\n Second. The cause was remanded to the Board for the purpose 'of setting aside its findings and order of December 22, 1937, and issuing proposed findings, and making its decision and order upon a reconsideration of the entire case'. The Board in its application for the remand stated that it would take that course. The specified purpose qualified the court's order. It created a condition which the Board was bound to observe. If the Board within a reasonable time failed to set aside its findings and order, we have no doubt that the court could vacate its order of remand and proceed with its consideration of the petition to review. The propriety of the order of remand must be considered in that aspect.\n Third. If the court itself had set aside the findings and order of the Board upon the ground, as asserted by petitioner, that the Board had not considered the evidence and made its own findings, but had adopted as its own a decision proposed by its subordinates without affording petitioner any opportunity to be heard thereon, the court could have remanded the cause for further proceedings in conformity with its opinion. That ground being sufficient for setting aside the order there is no principle of procedure in relation to the review either of judicial decrees or administrative orders which would require the court to examine other grounds of attack. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 364, 373]\n\u00a0\n It is familiar appellate practice to remand causes for further proceedings without deciding the merits, where justice demands that course in order that some defect in the record may be supplied. \n4\n Such a remand may be made to permit further evidence to be taken or additional findings to be made upon essential points. \n5\n So, when a District Court has not made findings in accordance with our controlling rule (Equity Rule 70 1\/2, 28 U. S.C.A. following section 723) it is our practice to set aside the decree and remand the cause for further proceedings. \n6\n The jurisdiction to review the orders of the Labor Relations Board is vested in a court with equity powers, and while the court must act within the bounds of the statute and without intruding upon the administrative province, it may adjust its relief to the exigencies of the case in accordance with the equitable principles governing judicial action. The purpose of the judicial review is consonant with that of the administrative proceeding itself,-to secure a just result with a minimum of technical requirements. The statute with respect to a judicial review of orders of the Labor Relations Board follows closely the statutory provisions in relation to the orders of the Federal Trade Commission, and as to the latter it is well established that the court may remand the cause to the Commission for further proceedings to the end that valid and essential findings may be made. Federal Trade Commission v. Curtis Publishing Co., \n260 \nU.S. 568, 580\n, 583 S., 43 S.Ct. 210, 214; International Shoe Company v. Federal Trade Commission, \n280 \nU.S. 291, 297\n, 50 S.Ct. 89, 91; Federal Trade Commission v. Royal Milling Co., \n288 \nU.S. 212, 218\n, 53 S.Ct. 335, 337; Procter \n\n[305 \nU.S. 364, 374]\n\u00a0\n & Gamble Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, 6 Cir., 11 F.2d 47, 48, 49; Ohio Leather Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, 6 Cir., 45 F.2d 39, 42.7 Similar action has been taken under the National Labor Relations Act in Agwilines, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Board, 5 Cir., 87 F.2d 146, 155. See, also, National Labor Relations Board v. Bell Oil & Gas Co., 5 Cir., 91 F. 2d 509, 515. The 'remand' does not encroach upon administrative functions. It means simply that the case is returned to the administrative body in order that it may take further action in accordance with the applicable law. See Federal Radio Commission v. Nelson Brothers Co., \n289 \nU.S. 266, 278\n, 53 S.Ct. 627, 633.\n Such a remand does not dismiss or terminate the administrative proceeding. If findings are lacking which may properly be made upon the evidence already received, the court does not require the evidence to be reheard. Federal Trade Commission v. Curtis Publishing Co., supra; International Shoe Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, supra. If further evidence is necessary and available to supply the basis for findings on material points, that evidence may be taken. Federal Trade Commission v. Royal Milling Co., supra; Procter & Gamble Company v. Federal Trade Commission, supra; Ohio Leather Company v. Federal Trade Commission, supra; Agwilines, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Board, supra. Whatever findings or order may subsequently be made will be subject to challenge if not adequately supported or the Board has failed to act in accordance with the statutory requirements.\n Fourth. The present controversy thus comes to the narrow point that instead of setting aside the Board's findings and order, the court has allowed the Board itself \n\n[305 \nU.S. 364, 375]\n\u00a0\n to set them aside. The contention on that ground is without substance. In either event the findings and order are vacated. Petitioner's objection to the order because of lack of due hearing results in the abandonment of the findings and order and petitioner will thus be completely freed from any determination they contain or any obligation they impose.\n Petitioner says that the Board has not confessed error. This is immaterial if the assailed findings and order are set aside. Nor is it important that the court has not held the findings and order to be void. It is elementary that the court is not bound to determine questions which have become academic.\n There is nothing in the statute, or in the principles governing judicial review of administrative action, which precludes the court from giving an administrative body an opportunity to meet objections to its order by correcting irregularities in procedure, or supplying deficiencies in its record, or making additional findings where these are necessary, or supplying findings validly made in the place of those attacked as invalid. The application for remand in this instance was not on frivolous grounds or for any purpose that might be considered dilatory or vexatious. Petitioner had raised a serious question as to the validity of the findings and order. The Board properly recognized the gravity of the contention and sought to meet it by voluntarily doing what the court could have compelled. That was in the interest of a prompt disposition, and whatever delay has resulted is due to petitioner's resistance to that course.\n Petitioner insists that it had other objections to the Board's conduct of the proceeding. But it was not necessary for the court to consider them, as the setting aside of the findings and order carried with it the opportunity for reconsideration and the making of a new record. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 364, 376]\n\u00a0\n What findings or order would thus be made became a matter of conjecture and in any event these and the manner of arriving at them would be subject to any justified criticism.\n As the substantial question is presented by the order of June 10th, the writ of certiorari in No. 182 is dismissed. The order of June 10th in No. 183 is affirmed. It is so ordered.\n Writ of certiorari in No. 182 dismissed and order in 183 affirmed.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS did not hear the argument and took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 10(d), provides:\n'(d) Until a transcript of the record in a case shall have been filed in a court, as hereinafter provided, the Board may at any time, upon reasonable notice and in such manner as it shall deem proper, modify or set aside, in whole or in part, any finding or order made or issued by it'. \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Section 10(f) provides:\n'(f) Any person aggrieved by a final order of the Board granting or denying in whole on in part the relief sought may obtain a review of such order in any circuit court of appeals of the United States in the circuit wherein the unfair labor practice in question was alleged to have been engaged in ... by filing in such court a written petition praying that the order of the Board be modified or set aside.

Norwood, of Tallahassee, Fla., Lucien H. Boggs, of Jacksonville, Fla., and George C. Gibbs, of Tallahassee, Fla., for appellants.\n\n\n[307 \nU.S. 66, 68]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Thomas G. Haight, of Jersey City, N.J., Louis D. Frohlich, of New York City, Frank Wideman, of Washington, D.C., and Herman Finkelstein, of New York City, for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from the order of a three-judge court refusing to dismiss a bill of complaint on motion for failure to set out facts sufficient to show Federal or equity jurisdiction, or to constitute a cause of action, and granting an interlocutory injunction against the enforcement of a Florida statute aimed at combinations fixing the price for the privilege of rendering privately or publicly for profit copyrighted musical compositions. Sec. 266, Jud.Code, 28 U.S.C.A.  380.\n The appellant, the state Attorney General and various State Attorneys, are officers of the State of Florida charged with the enforcement of the act. The appellees, complainants below, are the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, an unincorporated association organized under the laws of the State of New York; Gene Buck as president of the Society; various corporations publishing musical compositions; a number of authors and composers of copyrighted music; and several next of kin of deceased composers and authors. This suit was brought by complainants on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated, members of the Society, too numerous to make it practicable to join them as plaintiffs in a matter of common and general interest. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n One of the rights given by the Copyright Act is the exclusive right to perform copyrighted musical compositions in public for profit. \n2\n The bill of complaint alleges that users of musical compositions had refused to recog- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 66, 69]\n\u00a0\n nize this statutory right and to pay royalties for public performances for profit, and that authors, composers and publishers were unable, individually, to enforce their exclusive right because of the expense of detecting and suing for infringement throughout the United States. The Society was founded in 1914 to license performance of copyrighted music for profit and otherwise protect the copyrights. The state statute was directed at organizations like the Society and became effective on June 9, 1937.3 So far as is important here, the statute makes it unlawful for owners of copyrighted musical compositions to combine into any corporation, association or other entity to fix license fees 'for any use or rendition of copyrighted vocal or instrumental musical compositions for private or public performance for profit,' when the members of the combination constitute 'a substantial number of the persons, firms or corporations within the United States' owning musical copyrights. It declares the combination an unlawful monopoly, the price-fixing in restraint of trade, and the collection of license fees and all contracts by the combination illegal.\n The bill attacked the statute as contrary to the Constitution and laws of the United States and the constitution of Florida. More specifically, it urged that the law impinged upon rights given by the Copyright Act of 1909, deprived complainants of rights without due process of law and without the equal protection of the laws, impaired the obligation of contracts already executed, and operated as an ex post facto law.\n There was a formal allegation that the matter in controversy exceeded $ 3,000, exclusive of interest and costs. In addition, the bill alleged that the three publishers owned copyrights of a value in excess of $1,000,000 while each of the individual complainants owned copyrights \n\n[307 \nU.S. 66, 70]\n\u00a0\n worth in excess of $100,000; that it would cost each individual more than $ 10,000 to create an agency in Florida to protect himself against infringement by unauthorized public performances for profit, to issue licenses and to check on the accuracy of uses reported; that fees collected in 1936 in Florida amounted to $59,306.81 and that similar sums were expected in the future; and that in 1936 each of the three publishers received more than $50,000 from the Society and each individual more than $ 5,000.\n A motion for a temporary injunction was made on February 7, 1938, the same day the bill was filed. Voluminous affidavits were presented in support of the motion. They tend to substantiate the allegations of the complaint on the value of the copyrights and the income from the Society. Each publisher posed that it had received more than $50,000 from the Society in 1936, that its contract with the Society had a value in excess of $200,000, and that to fix prices on each composition for each use in Florida would require an expenditure of more than $25,000. The affidavits of the individuals showed annual incomes to them from the Society of from $ 3,000 to $9,000; contracts with the Society which the affiants valued in the thousands of dollars and an expense, in one instance, as high as $5, 000 to comply with the requirements of the Florida statute.\n On March 3, 1938, the appellants moved to dismiss on several grounds: ( 1) absence of jurisdictional amount; (2) failure to state a cause of action; (3) want of equity and other objections not strongly pressed at this time.\n The district court granted an interlocutory injunction and denied the motion to dismiss the bill. It thought that great damage would result unless the injunction issued and that there was grave doubt of the constitutionality of the act. Its findings of fact and conclusions of law were filed about a month and a half after the \n\n[307 \nU.S. 66, 71]\n\u00a0\n per curiam decision. It found that 'the matter in controversy exceeds $3, 000 exclusive of interest and costs.'\n Federal Jurisdiction.-The issue was raised in the lower court by a motion to dismiss on the ground that it affirmatively appears 'from the allegations of the bill ... that the jurisdictional amount of $3,000.00 ... is not involved ... in that it appears that the suit is brought for the benefit of the members of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers ... and it does not affirmatively appear that the loss of any member of said society due to the enforcement of (the challenged act) would amount to the ... necessary jurisdictional amount.' Other jurisdictional averments of the motion state that the Society cannot suffer any loss from the legislation because it affirmatively appears that the Society divides all its proceeds from licensing between its members and affiliates and 'therefore, the loss, if any, sustained due to the enforcement of said Florida laws would fall on the members of the Society, and not on the Society itself.' Finally the motion sets out the lack of jurisdiction because it affirmatively appears from the allegations of the bill that the jurisdictional amount is not involved 'because the plaintiffs have not shown the extent of loss or damage they would suffer by reason of the enforcement of said State law, as compared with the amount of profit they would make by the non-enforcement of said law.' As the form of the motion on the jurisdiction admitted the bill's statements, it was submitted on the allegations without the production of any evidence.\n This method of testing the jurisdiction properly raises the question. No issue is made as to the standing of the Society or its members to sue. The basis of the attack is that there is a lack of the essential allegations as to the value of the matter in controversy. As there is no statutory direction for procedure upon an issue of ju- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 66, 72]\n\u00a0\n risdiction, the mode of its determination is left to the trial court. \n4\n Both complainants and defendants were content to rest upon the bill and motion.\n The bill alleges that the value of the matter in dispute exceeds the jurisdictional amount. Such a general allegation when not traversed is sufficient, unless it is qualified by others which so detract from it that the court must dismiss sua sponte or on defendants' motion. \n5\n In this instance, the allegation is, in effect, traversed by the language of the motion which asserts that no plaintiff has shown loss from enforcement equal to the jurisdictional amount. No other allegations are denied. By this method of attack the facts set out in the bill are left unchallenged for the court to accept as true without further proof. The burden of showing by the admitted facts that the federal court has jurisdiction rests upon the complainants. If there were any doubt of the good faith of the allegations, the court might have called for their justification by evidence. \n6\n In view of the unchallenged facts, federal jurisdiction will be adequately established, if it appears that for any member, who is a party, the matter in controversy is of the value of the jurisdictional amount,7 or, if to the aggregate of all the members in this representative suit, the matter in controversy is of that value.\n This Society, an unincorporated association with a membership of more than a thousand of the leading authors, composers and publishers of music, has received by assignment and possesses, for a five-year period which covers the time here involved, the 'exclusive right to \n\n[307 \nU.S. 66, 73]\n\u00a0\n publicly perform for profit' musical compositions owned by its members. Licenses are issued by the Society to users in Florida 'for the public performance for profit' of these compositions. After payment of expenses and royalties for similar rights to foreign associates, and retention of certain reserves, the receipts from licenses are divided among the members in amounts and by classifications fixed by the articles of association and the Board of Directors. The Society undertakes to protect itself and its members from piracies of the rights assigned to it. The Society has, in the absence of the challenged legislation and without now giving consideration to other objections as to the legality of its organization, a right to license which may be injuriously affected by the Florida statute. Whether this right to license flows from its limited ownership of the copyrights or by authority of its members is immaterial here. We find it unnecessary to decide whether this unincorporated association has standing to sue and confine our decision to the amount in controversy between the members of the Society and the defendants. Members, both corporate copyright owners and individual composers of music and lyrics, are plaintiffs. They represent all other members. As the members own the copyrights, less the limited assignment to the Society of the right of public performance for profit, and share in the earnings through mandatory distribution under the articles of association and not by way of dividends, they are proper parties to e action. \n8\n These members are real \n\n[307 \nU.S. 66, 74]\n\u00a0\n parties in interest. Because of the interposition of the statute they cannot in combination license production and collect fees in Florida. Unless the relief sought, the invalidation of the statute, is obtained, the members cannot conduct their business through the medium of the Society. They have a common and undivided interest in the matter in controversy in this class suit. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n The essential matter in controversy here is the right of the members, in association through the Society, to conduct the business of licensing the public performance for profit of their copyrights. This method of combining for contracts is interdicted by the Florida statute. It is not a question of taxation or regulation but prohibition. Under such circumstances, the issue on jurisdiction is the value of this right to conduct the business free of the prohibition of the statute. \n10\n To determine the value of this right the District Court had the admitted facts that more than three hundred contracts expiring in 1940 were in existence between the Society and the Florida users; that in 1936 alone almost sixty thousand dollars was collected from the users, and that similar sums were expected for the remainder of the term. While the net profits of the business in Florida is not shown, the business of the Society, as a whole, is profitable. The three publisher parties receive more than $150,000 yearly and \n\n[307 \nU.S. 66, 75]\n\u00a0\n individuals more than $5,000 per year each. The cost of compliance with its requirements is evidence also of the value of the right of freedom from the act. \n11\n The complainants, other than the Society, allege without traverse that the cost to each one of providing individually in Florida the services now provided by the Society for each member would exceed $10, 000. Whether this is annually, for the length of the agreement or for some other term is not shown. From these facts, the finding of the District Court that the matter in controversy-the value of the aggregate rights of all members to conduct their business through the Society-exceeds $3,000 in value is fully supported.\n McNutt v. General Motors Acceptance Corporation12 differs. There the State of Indiana had passed an act regulating, not prohibiting, the business of the Acceptance Corporation. The right for which protection was sought was the right to be free of regulation. It was to be measured by the loss, if any, following enforcement of regulation. This was not alleged or proved. In KVOS, Inc. v. Associated Press,13 relief was sought to enjoin alleged pirating, by radio, of news furnished by the Associated Press to its members. The right for which protection was sought was 'the right to conduct those enterprises free of' interference. On the issue of the value of this right, it was deposed only that the Associated Press received more than $8,000 per month for news in the territory served by the broadcasting station and was in danger of losing the payments. The Associated Press was a non-profit corporation, operated without the purpose of profiting from its services to members and equitably dividing the expenses \n\n[307 \nU.S. 66, 76]\n\u00a0\n among them. The damage in the Associated Press case was to its members and this was not shown. Neither was it alleged or proved that any member threatened to withdraw or to reduce its payments.\n Failure to State a Cause of Action.-The motion to dismiss also presents generally the issue whether the bill states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. By the submission of the motion this issue was left to the Court on the facts alleged in the bill. The elaboration of these facts, contained in the affidavits supporting and objecting to the motion for temporary injunction, is not available for consideration, as these affidavits are a part of the record only for the purpose of determining the propriety of a temporary injunction. \n14\n Whether to grant or refuse a motion to dismiss before answer, is largely a matter of discretion for the court below. \n15\n Where the bill makes an attack upon the constitutionality of a state statute, supported by factual allegations sufficiently strong, as here, to raise 'grave doubts of the constitutionality of the Act' in the mind of the trial court, the motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action should be denied. This bill sets out that the exercise of rights granted by the Federal Copyright Act to control the performance of compositions for profit is prohibited by the statute; that existing contracts are impaired; property taken without compensation; recovery on extra state contracts denied and the equal protection and due process clauses of the 14th Amendment, U.S.C.A.Const., violated in manners specifically pleaded. Drastic penalties for violation \n\n[307 \nU.S. 66, 77]\n\u00a0\n of the act are provided. \n16\n The manner in and extent to which the challenged statute offends or complies with the applicable provisions of the Constitution will be clearer after final hearing and findings. \n17\n The findings here were on the motion for interlocutory injunction and on the issue of jurisdiction.\n Other Assignments.-The other material assignments of error to the interlocutory order specified on the appeal are addressed (1) to the lack of equity in the bill, (2) to the exercise of discretion in ordering a temporary injunction, (3) to the lack of findings before the order of temporary injunction and (4) to the failure to strike from the bill allegations as to certain sections which deal with contract relations between the Society and users of the musical compositions because these sections are not enforced by the state officers. We treat of them briefly: ( 1) It is clear that there is equitable jurisdiction to prevent irreparable injury, if the sections of the state statute outlawing the Society raise issues of constitutionality. The heavy penalties for violation and the prohibition of the issue of licenses or collection of fees show the need to protect complainants. \n18\n (2) Upon the conclusion that the motion to dismiss should be overruled, there was no abuse of discretion in granting an interlocutory injunction. \n19\n The damage before final judgment from the enforcement of the act as shown by the affidavits would be irreparable. The allegations in the bill of threats of enforcement and the declaration in the affidavit of the \n\n[307 \nU.S. 66, 78]\n\u00a0\n Attorney General of the State, the officer charged with supervision of enforcement,20 of readiness and willingness 'to prosecute any violations of said act,' sufficiently establish the immediate danger from enforcement. 21 No objection appears as to the adequacy of the bond or the other terms of the injunction. These remain under the control of the lower court. Ordinarily it would be expected that where a temporary injunction is considered necessary to protect the rights of complainants against the allegedly unconstitutional action of state officers, under a statute, a final order would follow with all convenient speed. (3) The order of the trial court was entered April 5, 1938. The findings of fact and conclusions of law were not filed until May 17, 1938, after the first assignment of errors had pointed out the omission and after the appeal was allowed. The original assignment of error, which had relied upon the failure to comply with Equity Rule 701\/2, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723, was amended to show subsequent compliance but no assignment of error was made on account of the fact that the findings were out of time. The objection was taken in the statement of points to be relied upon on the appeal and in appellants' brief in the specification of errors to be urged. Better practice dictates the filing of the finding of facts and conclusions of law before or contemporaneously with the order or decree. It would be useless, however, to reverse the order granting the temporary injunction and remand the cause. The temporary injunction would now be in order. (4) In answer to the fourth objection it may be said that the issue like that of constitutionality can be more satisfactorily disposed of upon final hearing.\n Affirmed. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 66, 79]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK, dissenting.\n I believe the decree enjoining and suspending Florida's law prohibiting monopolistic price fixing should be reversed because\n\n\n (1)\n No showing has been made that casts any doubt upon a State's power to prohibit monopolistic price fixing,\n\n\n (2)\n Complainants (appellees here) failed to sustain their burden of showing $3,000.00 in controversy, as required by statute.\n\n\n (3)\n The court below failed to require a bond or other conditions adequate to protect the people in Florida who might be injured by the injunction. First. Do general allegations of unconstitutionality,1 similarly general affidavits and general findings by the trial court show that the Florida statute against monopolistic price fixing is 'novel, if not unique'2 State legislation, and raise such 'grave constitutional questions' that a Federal court should suspend the statute to permit complainants to continue exacting monopoly tribute from the public until the court hears evidence?\n The enjoined Attorney General and prosecuting attorneys of Florida do not have, and expressly disclaim any duty to enforce the statute against appellees unless they combine to fix monopolistic prices. Therefore, this injunction cannot rest upon the alleged unconstitutionality of any provisions of the statute other than those prohibiting monopolistic price fixing. And allegations of the \n\n[307 \nU.S. 66, 80]\n\u00a0\n bill attacking other provisions of the statute raise only moot questions. If this record can be said to raise any 'grave', 'novel', or 'unique' question at all, that question is whether a State has power to prohibit price fixing by monopolies in restraint of trade.\n If the issue is not narrowed to this single point, approval is given to the enjoining of State officials from action which they have no duty to perform and have solemnly disclaimed both here and in the District Court. \n3\n In the absence of an interpretation by the Florida Supreme Court, to what more authoritative source or evidence may a Federal court turn for the meaning of the statute, than to the decision of the highest State official charged with its enforcement? He has determined that, so far as he and the prosecuting attorneys under him are concerned, appellees may license their compositions as they please, may combine to detect and punish infringers and may operate in Florida at will, provided only that they abandon monopolistic price fixing. Even as to the statutory prohibition against price fixing, all that is before us, a practice more desirable and more in keeping with our dual form of government, previous decisions,4 and the trend of Congressional legislation,5 would be to refrain from Federal judicial interference until the State courts are presented with an opportunity to define the statutory duties of appellants. 'And ... the presumption is in all cases that the state courts will do what the Constitution and laws of the United States require.' \n6\n\u00a0\n\n[307 \nU.S. 66, 81]\n\u00a0\n Judicially restraining these Florida officials from action which they declare they cannot and will not take, denies to Florida the traditional respect that has been accorded State officials by this Court. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n Even according to the comparatively new judicial formula here applied, the only issue is whether 'novel ... unique' or 'grave constitutional questions' are raised by the charge that these state officials will perform their sole duty under the Florida statute of prosecuting appellees for violations of the prohibitions against monopolistic price fixing. Paraphrasing this formula, the question here actually becomes: When complainants charge in a Federal Court of Equity that a State has passed, and its officers are about to enforce, a law against monopolistic price fixing, is there so much doubt about the power of the State to prohibit monopolistic price fixing that operation of the law must enjoined and effect denied to it until evidence is heard by the Court?\n Here, both the very bill upon which the injunction now approved was granted and affidavits of record establish beyond dispute appellees' flagrant violation of the Florida law by combining to fix prices. This combination apparently includes practically all (probably 95%) American and foreign copyright owners controlling rendi- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 66, 82]\n\u00a0\n tion of copyrighted music for profit in the United States. Not only does this combination fix prices through a self-perpetuating board of twenty- four directors, but its power over the business of musical rendition is so great that it can refuse to sell rights to single compositions, and can, and does require purchasers to take, at a monopolistically fixed annual fee, the entire repertory of all numbers controlled by the combination. And these fees are not the same for like purchasers even in the same locality. Evidence shows that competing radio stations in the same city, operating on the same power and serving the same audience, are charged widely variant fees for identical performance rights, not because of competition, but by the exercise of monopoly power. Since it appears that music is an essential part of public entertainment for profit, radio stations or other businesses arbitrarily compelled to pay discriminatory fees are faced with price fixing practices that could destroy them, because the Society has a monopoly of practically all-if not completely all-available music. When consideration is also given to the fact that an arbitrarily fixed lower rate is granted to a favored station itself controlled by another instrument of public communication-a newspaper-the ultimate possibilities for control of the channels of public communication and information are apparent.\n We have here a price fixing combination that actually wields the power of life and death over every business in Florida, and elsewhere, dependent upon copyrighted musical compositions for existence. Such a monopolistic combination's power to fix prices is the power to destroy. Should a Court of Equity grant this combination the privilege of violating a State anti-monopoly law?8 Does a \n\n[307 \nU.S. 66, 83]\n\u00a0\n State law prohibiting such a combination present 'grave constitutional questions'?\n It is my position that a State law prohibiting monopolistic price fixing in restraint of trade is not 'novel' and 'unique' and raises no 'grave constitutional questions.' The constitutional right of the States to pass laws against monopolies should now be beyond possibility of controversy. 'That state legislatures have the right ... to prevent unlawful combinations to prevent competition and in restraint of trade, and to prohibit and punish monopolies, is not open to question',9 and few have challenged the power of State legislatures to ordain that 'competition, not combination, should be the law of trade.' \n10\n Surely, there is presently no basis to doubt that power d to assert that its exercise raises 'grave constitutional questions.' As recently as 1937, this Court held that Porto Rico, with legislative powers not equal to, but 'nearly as extensive as those exercised by any State legislature,' could prohibit monopolistic price fixing as one of the 'rightful subjects of legislation' upon which legislatures act. \n11\n\u00a0\n\n If the States have somehow lost their historic power to prohibit monopolistic price fixing combinations before \n\n[307 \nU.S. 66, 84]\n\u00a0\n presentation of evidence to a Federal court, at what point in our history and in what manner did they lose it? The people have not exercised their exclusive authority, by Constitutional amendment, to strip the States of their power over price fixing combinations and thus raise monopoly above the traditional power of legislative bodies.\n It was expressly conceded at the bar that Florida had the Constitutional power to prohibit price fixing combinations unless the copyright laws limited this power. And, since argument of the present case, a decision rendered by us February 13, this year, made clear the principle that the copyright laws grant no immunity to copyright owners from statutes prohibiting monopolistic practices and agreements. We there declared that 'An agreement illegal (by statute) because it suppresses competition is not any less so because the competitive article is copyrighted.' \n12\n\u00a0\n\n'Due process' has been judicially endowed with great elasticity in relation to property rights, but it is inconceivable that it would afford refuge for monopolies deemed undesirable by the people's representatives. When a legislature as a matter of public policy determines to prohibit monopolistic combinations, we cannot, under any doctrine of 'due process', rightfully 'review their economics or their facts.' \n13\n And, although 'due process' is invoked, can evidence either add to or take from the legislative power to permit, regulate or prohibit monopolies in the public interest?\n\n Several of the general allegations in the bill are relied upon to justify suspension of the Florida statute until evidence is heard by a court. It is said the court should hear evidence because the 'bill sets out that the exercise of rights granted by the Federal Copyright Act to control \n\n[307 \nU.S. 66, 85]\n\u00a0\n the performance of compositions for profit is prohibited by the statute ....' But what evidence can the court hear that will assist it in comparing the statute with the copyright laws? The Florida statute does not even purport to prohibit the 'performance of compositions for profit,' and the enjoined officials have neither threatened, nor do they intend, to prohibit such performance. It is said the bill alleges 'that existing contracts are impaired' by the statute. But no contracts can be affected unless involving prohibited monopolistic price fixing. That the Florida law prohibits the continuation and execution of monopoly practices in pursuance of price fixing agreements made before the law was passed, can be no basis for constitutional objection. \n14\n\u00a0\n\n It is said the bill alleges 'property taken without compensation.' If the statute, of itself, takes property, (and no charge of unconstitutional application of the statute is made) is evidence required to show the manner of the taking? It is said the bill alleges that the statute violates 'equal protection.' But the sole thing threatened is prosecution of an admitted price fixing combination-comprised of practically all the musical copyright owners and publishers in the nation. '... if an evil ( of monopoly) is specially experienced in a particular branch of business, the Constitution embodies no prohibition of laws confined to the evil, or doctrinaire requirement that they should be couched in all-embracing terms. It does not forbid the cautious advance, step by step, and the distrust of generalities which sometimes have been the weakness, but often the strength, of English legislation.' \n15\n It is said a drastic penalty is provided for prac- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 66, 86]\n\u00a0\n ticing price fixing. What evidence will serve to enlighten the Court on the statutory penalty? That penalty is set out clearly in the statute. If it invalidates the statute, that determination should be made now.\n The present case illustrates how the recently fashioned judicial formula under which State laws must be enjoined if 'grave constitutional questions' are presented in a complaint, actually results in an automatic judicial suspension of State statutes upon any general complaint to a Federal court. The apparently inevitable operation of this formula runs counter to the Tenth Amendment intended to preserve the control of the States over their own local legislation, and opens the door to further evasions of the Eleventh Amendment protecting the States from suits in Federal courts. \n16\n A lower Federal court's refusal in its 'discretion' to suspend a State statute was recently reversed because 'grave constitutional questions'-requiring evidence-were deemed raised by charges that the statute by requiring citrus fruit cans to be truthfully labeled violated the Constitution. \n17\n And here, where the District Court enjoined a State law in its 'discretion', the injunction is stained by a holding that evidence should be heard because 'grave constitutional questions' are involved. However the lower court's 'discretion' may be exercised, the formula apparently achieves but one result-State statutes are suspended.\n Careful scrutiny of appellees' bill for injunction reveals no allegations indicating that Florida's power to prohibit monopolistic price fixing would, even under the formula applied, be altered by proof of any 'particular economic facts ... which are ... properly the sub- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 66, 87]\n\u00a0\n ject of evidence and of findings.' 18 True, the bill alleges that the statute of Florida and similar legislation enacted by other States were 'sponsored by an organized group ... for their own selfish aggrandizement ... without an adequate hearing being afforded to complainants and others similarly situated,' and that 'in truth and in fact, (the statute) was enacted not in the public interest ....' Appellees also allege that 'unless the enforcement of this State statute is restrained ... other States, in addition to Florida, Montana, Washington, Nebraska and Tennessee, may enact similar statutes ... all of which would work undue hardship on complainants and would violate the spirit of the Constitution ....' These are some of the strongest-if not the strongest-of the bill's allegations deemed to raise 'grave constitutional questions.' Is the temporary injunction approved so that the Federal court in Florida may hear evidence on what constitutes the public interest of Florida? Shall the court hear evidence to determine whether or not 'unless the enforcement of this statute is restrained' other States, 'in addition to Florida', may similarly prohibit appellees' monopoly'\n It is difficult to perceive how in the future-under this formula-any State law, directly or indirectly affecting property, can become effective until injunction proceedings have dragged their weary way through Federal courts. All State statutes might hereafter well substitute for the expression 'to take effect within' a certain period of time, the words 'to take effect after the Federal courts have heard evidence to determine' their reasonableness (wisdom). And the formula likewise fits Congressional enactments. Had the pronouncement of this formula not been the culmination of gradual judicial advances, it would have been everywhere recognized as a \n\n[307 \nU.S. 66, 88]\n\u00a0\n revolutionary departure from our constitutional form of government, under which the wisdom of legislation, within the field of legislative action, was left to the judgment of elected representatives of the people.\n Florida can find little comfort in the admonition that 'Ordinarily it would be expected that where a temporary injunction is considered necessary ... a final order would follow with all convenient speed.' This law has now already been suspended for a year, and experience demonstrates that injunctive suspension of State laws and State action can hang in the courts for many years before receiving final disposition. \n19\n\u00a0\n\n Second. Jurisdictional Amount.\n These eleven appellees alleged in their bill for injunction that they sued on behalf of themselves and the more than 1,000 other (American) members of the Society. No determination is made here 'that for any member, who is a party, the matter in controversy is of the value of the jurisdictional amount'-$3,000. However, while appellees are not aided in establishing the jurisdictional amount by the 'allegation that (they) ... sued on behalf of others similarly situated,'20 the Court nevertheless holds that the jurisdictional amount is in controversy in 'the value of the aggregate rights of all members' (including the more than 1,000 who have not appeared in person) to combine and fix prices in Florida.\n'Assuming that such a case as this may be called a class action, and ... could be maintained as such ... yet that it may be properly a class action does not affect the rule against aggregation (of claims for making up the jurisdictional amount), because (such aggregation) ... is necessarily only applicable to those class actions in which several claimants to a fund are joined as plaintiffs asserting common and undivided rights therein.' \n21\n Appellees assert no common and undivided rights in any fund22 or property;23 'the amount payable to each (by the Society) depends upon his contract alone.' \n24\n Neither does appellees' bill seek, as would the traditional class or representative bill in equity, to protect group rights all claimed under and traceable to a single decree,25 or rights 'which ... (no one plaintiff) can enforce in the absence of the' others because derived from a single security instrument. \n26\n In this proceeding, all that members of the Society have in common is their alleged right to violate with impunity the Florida statute against price fixing. Unless opposition to and violation of the statute can be their bond of unity, appellees have 'separate and distinct demands ... (united) for convenience and economy in a single suit, (and) it is essential that the demand of each be of the requisite jurisdictional amount.' \n27\n\u00a0\n\n[307 \nU.S. 66, 89]\n\u00a0\n Permissible joinder of many plaintiffs as a matter of convenience and economy is not a means of enlarging the jurisdiction of the District Court. Rule 38, under which this class or representative suit was brought, did \n\n[307 \nU.S. 66, 90]\n\u00a0\n not, in fact could not, extend that jurisdiction which depends solely upon Acts of Congress. 28\n\n A common desire to disregard a State law cannot serve as a common and undivided interest for purposes of Federal jurisdiction;29 otherwise, all who oppose such a law can aggregate the values of their alleged individual rights so to disregard the law, in order that they may escape the courts of a State and bring its law before a Federal court. And the fact that a State law inflicts pecuniary loss upon members of a non-profit association because of their membership does not permit aggregation of the members' pecuniary interests as a basis for attack upon the law in a Federal court by some members 'on behalf and with the authority of all.' \n30\n Here, the individual members have made no showing of what they as individuals have at stake-or of what all the members as a class stand to lose by virtue of the Florida law.\n The enjoined State officials have only the duty to prosecute appellees if they continue to fix prices (i.e., to issue licenses) through monopolistic combinations, and these officials have expressly disavowed any intention to do more. \n31\n Appellees are left free to form such combinations as they please in Florida for the purpose of protecting against copyright infringements. They are here deprived by the Florida statute only of the right to com- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 66, 91]\n\u00a0\n bine to fix prices, and the value of that right must determine the amount in controversy. 32 That right was the object which appellees' bill for injunction sought to protect from allegedly unconstitutional interference. 33 Yet, there is no evidence at all in the record from which even an inference can be drawn as to the amount, if any, individual appellees or other members might lose in Florida by selling or licensing their copyrighted articles individually (which the law permits) instead of fixing prices by monopolistic combination (which the law prohibits). No showing was made that appellees ever have made or ever will make any profit from the operations of the Society in Florida. As stated by the majority opinion, the record discloses that the business of the Society in the entire United States and sixteen foreign countries is a profitable one. But we cannot assume from this that its Florida operations are as a unit profitable. In fact, the record shows only that the entire Society had sixty thousand dollars$worth of contracts in Florida in 1936. We are not told what ratable share of this sixty thousand dollars would come to any individual in the division of the entire amount among the forty-five thousand odd members affiliated with the Society (in America and abroad). Each individual member's gross income from Florida might be less than $1. 50 per year.\n The loss of a right to an annual gross income of $1.50 cannot amount to the loss of a right valued at ten thousand dollars-as appellees allege- on the theory that it would cost ten thousand dollars to collect the $1.50 income individually. And it is, of course, possible that if the Society in fact has no net income from Florida but operates there at a loss, each member's ratable share of \n\n[307 \nU.S. 66, 92]\n\u00a0\n income from the Society will actually be increased when the unprofitable Florida operations cease because of the statute. Measuring the amount in controversy on the above theory, jurisdiction might be obtained by a Federal court to enforce rights of a value far less than the jurisdictional $3,000 required by Congress. For illustration, a statute might prohibit parking of automobiles on certain city streets; an automobile owner assailing the law might be admitted to the jurisdiction of the Federal court by alleging that it would cost him more than three thousand dollars to purchase a parking lot in which to park off the streets of the prohibited area. He would thus 'comply' with the statute and abandon the streets in obedience to it. \n34\n I do not believe that jurisdiction of a Federal court can be rested on measurements of the imagined cost of what a complainant conceivably could, but certainly would never do as an alternative to action forbidden by statute.\n The statutory monetary standard is precise and the amount in controversy therefore cannot be conjectural. 'It is impossible to foresee into what mazes of speculation and conjecture we may not be led by a departure from the simplicity of the statutory provision.\n'Accordingly, this court has uniformly been strict to adhere to and enforce it.' \n35\n\u00a0\n\n[307 \nU.S. 66, 93]\n\u00a0\n Without proof of the amount each appellee or member has in issue, how can the 'aggregate amount' be fixed at any figure?\n\n Rigid enforcement of the jurisdictional requirement will limit the interference of Federal courts in State legislation and will accord with the policy of Congress in narrowing the jurisdiction of Federal courts by successive increases in the jurisdictional amount. \n36\n 'The policy of the statute calls for its strict construction.' \n37\n Since no individual complainant has established that he has the statutory jurisdictional amount in controversy, to rest jurisdiction of a Federal court on no more than the unified desire of many complainants to violate a State statute prohibiting monopolistic price fixing, does constitute a 'novel, if not unique,' and 'grave' judicial departure from the jurisdictional requirement fixed by Congress. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 66, 94]\n\u00a0\n ests the injunction may affect.' \n38\n The injunction here was not granted upon conditions that would protect the interests of all who might be affected by it. It neither ordered the monopoly tribute exacted by appellees to be paid into court during suspension of the Florida statute, nor required a bond for the benefit of, and adequate to indemnify those who must pay this tribute until the court permits the statute to go into effect.\n Nevertheless, this Court now refuses to correct the grossly unjust failure to protect those who may suffer irreparable injury from the suspension of the Florida law on the ground that 'No objection appears as to the adequacy of the bond or the other terms of the injunction. These remain under the control of the lower court.' However, the lower court has already exercised its control resulting in manifestly injurious error apparent on the record. \n39\n And as 'upon this appeal in equity the whole case is before us, we can render such decree as under all the circumstances may be proper.' \n40\n Litigation is not a game in which justice can be awarded only to the alert and fastidious objector, particularly when-as here-a court suspends statutory rights of members of the public who, not being in court, have no opportunity to object. The injustice to the public apparent on this record violates the rudimentary principles of equity and fair play. We should neither condone nor permit it.\n They who attack the constitutionality of a law, obtain its judicial suspension, and then continue to violate its \n\n[307 \nU.S. 66, 95]\n\u00a0\n terms, should not benefit by the suspension, in the event the law is later held constitutional. Otherwise, a judicially granted period of immunity will reward litigants who unsuccessfully assail the constitutionality of legislation. Seemingly, the time has arrived when despite our constitutional system of government no State law can become effective until a Federal court hears evidence on its constitutionality. The courts- responsible for this fundamental change-should at least protect citizens of an enacting State from disobedience to a State law permitted by an erroneous or improvident interlocutory injunction.\n The interlocutory injunction should be vacated. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Equity Rule 38, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Act of March 4, 1909, Sec. 1(e), c. 320, 35 Stat. 1075, 17 U.S.C.

Bangs, of New York City, for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n We are asked to say whether the State of New York may constitutionally tax the relinquishment at death, by a domiciled resident of the state, of a power to revoke a trust of intangibles held by a Colorado trustee.\n Decedent in 1924, while a resident of Colorado, transferred and delivered to Denver National Bank of Denver, Colorado, certain bonds to be held upon specified trusts with specified powers in the trustee to administer the trust and to invest and reinvest the trust fund. So far as now material, the trust indenture provided that the trustee should pay over the income to decedent's daughter for life and afterward to the daughter's children until \n\n[307 \nU.S. 383, 385]\n\u00a0\n each had reached the age of twenty-five years, when a proportionate share of the principal of the trust fund was to be paid over to such child. In default of such children the principal was to revert to decedent and pass under her will. She reserved the right to remove the trustee, to change any beneficiary of the trust, and to revoke the trust and revest herself with the title to the property, the trustee in that event undertaking to assign and deliver to her all the securities then constituting the trust fund.\n After creating the trust decedent became and remained a domiciled resident of New York, where she died in 1931 without appointing new beneficiaries of the trust or revoking it. Until her death the trust was administered by the bank at its offices in Colorado, and the paper evidences of the intangibles-corporate bonds-comprising the trust fund remained in the possession of the trustee in Colorado.\n Following her death the taxing authorities of Colorado assessed a tax on the transmission at death of the trust fund. Proceedings in New York for the assessment of estate taxes on the transfer of the trust fund at decedent's death resulted in an order of the Surrogate confirming the assessment under  249-n, 249-r (as amended by Laws 1931, c. 62) of the New York Tax Law. Consol. Laws, ch. 60 1 On appeal the New York \n\n[307 \nU.S. 383, 386]\n\u00a0\n Court of Appeals, In re Brown's Estate, 274 N.Y. 10, 8 N.E.2d 42, reversed the order of the Surrogate, holding that so far as the provisions of the New York Tax Law purport to include the intangible trust property in the gross estate they infringe due process by imposing a tax on property whose situs is outside the state. We granted certiorari November 14, 1938, the question involved being of public importance. \n305 \nU.S. 667\n, 59 S.Ct. 151, 83 L.Ed. --.\n The essential elements of the question presented here are the same as those considered in Curry v. McCanless, \n307 \nU.S. 357\n, 59 S.Ct. 900, 83 L. Ed. --, decided this day. As is there pointed out, the power of disposition of property is the equivalent of ownership. It is a potential source of wealth and its exercise in the case of intangibles is the appropriate subject of taxation at the place of the domicile of the owner of the power. The relinquishment at death, in consequence of the non- exercise in life, of a power to revoke a trust created by a decedent is likewise an appropriate subject of taxation. Saltonstall v.

McCanless, supra, we cannot say that the legal interest of decedent in the intangibles held in trust in Colorado was so \n\n[307 \nU.S. 383, 387]\n\u00a0\n dissociated from her person as to be beyond the taxing jurisdiction of the state of her domicile more than her other rights in intangibles. Her right to revoke the trust and to demand the transmission to her of the intangibles by the trustee and the delivery to her of their physical evidences was a potential source of wealth, having the attributes of property. As in the case of any other intangibles which she possessed, control over her person and estate at the place of her domicile and her duty to contribute to the support of government there afford adequate constitutional basis for imposition of a tax measured by the value of the intangibles transmitted or relinquished by her at death. Curry v. McCanless, supra, and cases cited.\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES, dissenting.\n I think that the decision in this case pushes the fiction of mobilia sequuntur personam to an unwarranted extreme and thus unnecessarily produces an unjust result.\n The same property is subjected to an inheritance or transfer tax by two States. The decedent, in 1924, while a resident of Colorado, created a trust in certain securities, consisting of federal, state and other bonds. The trustee was a Denver bank. The income of the trust property was payable to the settlor's daughter during her life and thereafter to her children until they respectively arrived at the age of twenty-five years, when they were to have the principal in equal shares. If the daughter left no children, the trust estate was to revert to the settlor. The settlor reserved the right to change the beneficiaries, to revoke the trust, and to remove the trustee. The legal title to the securities was thus vested in the trustee, which entered upon its administration and continued it both \n\n[307 \nU.S. 383, 388]\n\u00a0\n before and after the settlor's death. There was no revocation of the trust or change of beneficiary or trustee, or diversion of the income from the use of the daughter, and the beneficiaries were all living when the settlor died.\n Prior to her death, the settlor removed to New York. The trust res continued to be in Colorado. An inheritance tax upon the decedent's property situated in Colorado, and including the bonds held there in trust, was imposed by that State. The New York Court of Appeals has held, and I think rightly, that this trust property was not subject to an estate tax in New York. In re Brown's Estate, 274 N.Y. 10, 8 N.E.2d 42.\n It is true that the Constitution of the United States contains no specific provision against double taxation, but the Constitution does impose limitations upon the taxing power of a State which I think are applicable and should prevent a double exaction in this case.\n The principle governing the application of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S.C.A.Const., to the State's taxing power is well established. That principle, as repeatedly declared by this Court, and apparently not disputed now, is that it is 'essential to the validity of a tax that the property shall be within the territorial jurisdiction of the taxing wer'. Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Kentucky, \n199 \nU.S. 194, 204\n, 26 S.Ct. 36, 37, 4 Ann.Cas. 493. What is meant is that due process in taxation requires that the property shall be attributable to the domain of the State which imposes the tax. This rule has its most familiar illustration in the case of land which, to be taxable, must be within the limits of the taxing State. The fact that the owner is domiciled within a State, if the land is elsewhere, does not give the State of his domicile the authority to tax. In Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Kentucky, supra, we held that the principle against the taxability of land within another jurisdiction applies with equal cogency to tangible personal property having an actual situs outside the State's domain. True, the fiction expressed in the maxim mobilia \n\n[307 \nU.S. 383, 389]\n\u00a0\n sequuntur personam might have seemed to justify such a tax on personal property by the State of the owner's domicile. But as said in Pullman's Car Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n141 \nU.S. 18, 22\n, 11 S.Ct. 876, 877, 878: 'The old rule, expressed in the maxim mobilia sequuntur personam, by which personal property was regarded as subject to the law of the owner's domicil, grew up in the Middle Ages, when movable property consisted chiefly of gold and jewels, which could be easily carried by the owner from place to place, or secreted in spots known only to himself. In modern times, since the great increase in amount and variety of personal property, not immediately connected with the person of the owner, that rule has yielded more and more to the lex situs,-the law of the place where the property is kept and used'.\n The rule thus established that the State of the owner's domicile cannot tax tangible personal property which has an actual situs in another State was applied by this Court to an inheritance or transfer tax in the case of Frick v. Pennsylvania, \n268 \nU.S. 473\n, 45 S.Ct. 603, 604, 42 A.L.R. 316. There the Court held, without division, that to tax the transfer of tangible personal property having an actual situs in another State 'contravenes the due process ... clause of the Fourteenth Amendment'. The importance of this limitation of state power is obvious in view of the interrelation of the States under the bond of the Constitution, and of the opportunities for oppressive taxation if States attempt to tax property or transfers of property not properly attributable to their own domain. 'The limits of state power are defined in view of the relation of the states to each other in the Federal Union'. Burnet v. Brooks, \n288 \nU.S. 378, 401\n, 53 S.Ct. 457, 463, 86 A.L.R. 747.\n But while the question was thus settled as to tangible personal property, the fiction of mobilia sequuntur personam still persists in a general sense as to intangibles, embracing securities, thus permitting taxation by the States of the owner's domicile although the owner may \n\n[307 \nU.S. 383, 390]\n\u00a0\n keep the securities in another State. Blodgett v. Silberman, \n277 \nU.S. 1, 9\n, 14 S., 16, 48 S.Ct. 410, 413, 415. This general rule proceeds in the view that intangibles, as such, are incapable of an actual physical location and that to attribute to them a 'situs' is to indulge in a metaphor. Still, in certain circumstances the use of the metaphor is appropriate. New York ex rel. Whitney v. Graves, \n299 \nU.S. 366, 372\n, 57 S. Ct. 237, 238.\n The fact that this rule of convenience may generally be applied does not justify the conclusion that intangibles can never be so effectively localized in another State as to withdraw them from the taxing power of the domiciliary State. The proper use of a legal fiction is to prevent injustice and it should not be unnecessarily extended so as to work an injury. Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Kentucky, supra, 199 U.S. at page 208, 26 S.Ct. at page 39, 4 Ann.Cas. 493.\n As we said in Safe Deposit & Trust Co. v. Virginia, \n280 \nU.S. 83, 92\n, 50 S.Ct. 59, 60, 67 A.L.R. 386, the fiction of mobilia sequuntur personam 'must yield to established fact of legal ownership, actual presence and control elsewhere, and ought not to be applied if so to do would result in inescapable and patent injustice whether through double taxation, or otherwise'. In that case, a resident of Virginia had transferred certain securities to the Safe Deposit & Trust Company of Baltimore in trust for his minor sons. The donor reserved to himself a power of revocation. He died without having exercised it. Virginia undertook to impose an ad valorem tax upon the entire corpus of the trust estate and this Court held that as the securities were subject to taxation in Maryland, where they were in the actual possession of the trustee, the holder of the legal title, they had no legal situs for taxation in Virginia 'unless the legal fiction mobilia sequuntur personam was (is) applicable and controlling'. The Virginia court had held that the two beneficiaries in conjunction with the administrator of the father's estate really owned the trust fund and that by reason of the fiction its taxable situs followed them. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 383, 391]\n\u00a0\n This Court refused to accept that view and denied the right of taxation to Virginia, saying: 'It would be unfortunate, perhaps amazing, if a legal fiction originally invented to prevent personalty from escaping just taxation should compel us to accept the irrational view that the same securities were within two states at the same instant and because of this to uphold a double and oppressive assessment'.\n That was a case of an ad valorem property tax. But the power to impose an inheritance or transfer tax, as well as the power to impose an ad valorem property tax, depends upon the property being attributable to the domain of the taxing State. Frick v. Pennsylvania, supra, 268 U.S. at page 492, 45 S.Ct. at page 605, 42 A.L.R. 316.\n In the instant case, the legal title to the property in question is in the Colorado trustee, the trust was created under the Colorado law and its administration is subject to the control of Colorado. To say that these securities are not as effectively localized in Colorado, as were the furniture, pictures and other art treasures of Mr. Frick in New York and Massachusetts, where alone their transfer could be taxed, would be to ignore realities and to make important rights turn upon a verbal distinction.\n Upon what ground then is it maintained that these securities are within the taxing power of New York? Solely, it appears, upon the ground that the indenture creating the trust in Colorado reserved to the settlor a power of revocation. This unexercised power is treated as carried by the settlor into New York and hence as bringing in its train the entire corpus of the trust property. That results, as already noted, in giving the fiction an oppressive operation. But, aside from that practical aspect, if through the trust in Colorado the securities have been effectively localized in that State, why should an unexercised power of revocation alter their status? Mr. Frick did not even need to revoke an instrument, for at \n\n[307 \nU.S. 383, 392]\n\u00a0\n any time he could have removed his furniture and art treasures from New York and Massachusetts to his domicile in Pennsylvania. But that obvious control, while unexercised, did not detract from the taxing power of the States where the property was, or permit taxation by the domiciliary State.\n It is said that the power of disposition is equivalent to ownership, and that its relinquishment at death is an appropriate subject of taxation. The case of federal taxation is not analogous as there are no state boundaries to be considered when the federal tax is laid. Nor are state cases relevant when there is no attempted extraterritorial application of a state statute, and it is not necessary again to review the authorities cited in the dissenting opinion in Curry v. McCanless, \n307 \nU.S. 357\n, 59 S. Ct. 900, 83 L.Ed. --, decided this day. For the present purpose it is sufficient to note that under the principle established in Frick v. Pennsylvania, supra, it is not enough to say that a power of disposition is equivalent to ownership, for ownership by a resident of a State gives that State no authority to tax property not attributable to its domain. Mr. Frick owned his property in New York and Massachusetts but still his own State of Pennsylvania could not tax its transfer.\n The fundamental question is thus not one of a reserved but unexercised power of revocation or of an ultimate control in an owner, but whether securities, classed as intangibles, are necessarily and in all circumstances subject to a different rule from that obtaining in the case of tangible personal property. It is not perceived that there is a sound basis for such an invariable distinction, which is foreign to common thought and practical needs. When confronted with the question as to tangible personal property, we did not hesitate to limit the application of the fiction, and it is regrettable that we can not deal with the fiction in a similar fashion in such a case as this, where \n\n[307 \nU.S. 383, 393]\n\u00a0\n we have an effective localization of securities through a trust created in a State other than that of the settlor's domicile at the time of death, and where in that other State the trustee holds title and possession and has been and is administering the trust subject to its laws.\n I think that the judgment of the Court of Appeals of New York should be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, Mr. Justice BUTLER and Mr. Justice ROBERTS concur in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n]  249-n imposes a tax at specified rates upon the net estate of every person dying a resident of the state.

In his income tax return for that year he included his salary as subject to the New York state income tax imposed by Art. 16 of the Tax Law of New York (Consol. Laws, c. 60). Subdivision 2f of  359, since repealed, exempted from the tax 'Salaries, wages and other compensation received from the United States of officials or employees thereof, including persons in the military or naval forces of the United States. ...' Petitioners, \n\n[306 \nU.S. 466, 476]\n\u00a0\n New York State Tax Commissioners, rejected respondent's claim for a refund of the tax based on the ground that his salary was constitutionally exempt from state taxation because the Home Owners' Loan Corporation is an instrumentality of the United States Government and that he, during the taxable year, was an employee of the federal government engaged in the performance of a governmental function.\n On review by certiorari the Board's action was set aside by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York, People ex rel. O'Keefe v. Graves, 253 App.Div. 91, 1 N.Y.S.2d 195, whose order was affirmed by the Court of Appeals. 278 N.Y. 691, 16 N.E.2d 404. Both courts held respondent's salary was free from tax on the authority of New York ex rel. Rogers v. Graves, \n299 \nU.S. 401\n, 57 S.Ct. 269, which sustained the claim that New York could not constitutionally tax the salary of an employee of the Penama Rail Road Company, a wholly-owned corporate instrumentality of the United States. We granted certiorari December 19, 1938, \n305 \nU.S. 592\n, 59 S.Ct. 252, 83 L.Ed. --, the constitutional question presented by the record being of public importance.\n The Home Owners' Loan Corporation was created pursuant to  4(a) of the Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933, 48 Stat. 128, 12 U.S.C.  1461 et seq., 12 U.S.C.A.  1461 et seq., which was enacted to provide emergency relief to home owners, particularly to assist them with respect to home mortgage indebtedness. The corporation, which is authorized to lend money to home owners on mortgages and to refinance home mortgage loans within the purview of the Act, is declared by  4(a), 12 U.S.C.A.  1463(a), to be an instrumentality of the United States. Its shares of stock are wholly government-owned.  4(b). Its funds are deposited in the Treasury of the United States, and the compensation of its employees is paid by drafts upon the Treasury. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 466, 477]\n\u00a0\n For the purposes of this case we may assume that the creation of the Home Owners' Loan Corporation was a constitutional exercise of the powers of the federal government. Cf. Kay v. United States, \n303 \nU.S. 1\n, 58 S.Ct. 468. As that government derives its authority wholly from powers delegated to it by the Constitution, its every action within its constitutional power is governmental action, and since Congress is made the sole judge of what powers within the constitutional grant are to be exercised, all activities of government constitutionally authorized by Congress must stand on a parity with respect to their constitutional immunity from taxation. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 432; Van Brocklin v. Tennessee, \n117 \nU.S. 151\n, 158-159, 6 S.Ct. 670, 674; South Carolina v. United States, \n199 \nU.S. 437, 451\n, 452 S., 26 S.Ct. 110, 112, 4 Ann.Cas. 737; Helvering v. Gerhardt, \n304 \nU.S. 405\n, 412-415, 58 S.Ct. 969, 971-973. And when the national government lawfully acts through a corporation which it owns and controls, those activities are governmental functions entitled to whatever tax immunity attaches to those functions when carried on by the government itself through its departments. See McCulloch v. Maryland, supra, pages 421, 422 of 4 Wheat.; Smith v. Kansas City Title Co., \n255 \nU.S. 180, 208\n, 41 S.Ct. 243, 248; Federal Land Bank v. Crosland, \n261 \nU.S. 374\n, 43 S.Ct. 385, 29 A.L.R. 1; New York ex rel. Rogers v. Graves, supra.\n The single question with which we are now concerned is whether the tax laid by the state upon the salary of respondent, employed by a corporate instrumentality of the federal government, imposes an unconstitutional burden upon that government. The theory of the tax immunity of either government, state or national, and its instrumentalities, from taxation by the other, has been rested upon an implied limitation on the taxing power of each, such as to forestall undue interference, through the exercise of that power, with the govern- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 466, 478]\n\u00a0\n mental activities of the other. That the two types of immunity may not, in all respects, stand on a parity has been recognized from the beginning, McCulloch v. Maryland, supra, pages 435, 436 of 4 Wheat., and possible differences in application, deriving from differences in the source, nature and extent of the immunity of the governments and their agencies, were pointed out and discussed by this Court in detail during the last term. Helvering v. Gerhardt, supra, pages 412, 413, 416, 58 S.Ct. pages 972, 973.\n So far as now relevant, those differences have been thought to be traceable to the fact that the federal government is one of delegated powers in the exercise of which Congress is supreme; so that every agency which Congress can constitutionally create is a governmental agency. And since the power to create the agency includes the implied power to do whatever is needful or appropriate, if not expressly prohibited, to protect the agency, there has been attributed to Congress some scope, the limits of which it is not now necessary to define, for granting or withholding immunity of federal agencies from state taxation. See Van Allen v. Assessors, 3 Wall. 573, 583, 585; Bank of New York v. Supervisors of New York County, 7 Wall. 26, 30, 31; Thomson v.

Bekins, \n304 \nU.S. 27, 52\n, 58 S.Ct. 811, 815. Whether its power to grant tax exemptions as an incident to the exercise of powers specifically granted by the Constitution can ever, in any circumstances, extend beyond the con- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 466, 479]\n\u00a0\n stitutional immunity of federal agencies which courts have implied, is a question which need not now be determined.\n Congress has declared in  4 of the Act that the Home Owners' Loan Corporation is an instrumentality of the United States and that its bonds are exempt, as to principal and interest, from federal and state taxation, except surtaxes, estate, inheritance and gift taxes. The corporation itself, 'including its franchise, its capital, reserves and surplus, and its loans and income,' is likewise exempted from taxation; its real property is subject to tax to the same extent as other real property. But Congress has given no intimation of any purpose either to grant or withhold immunity from state taxation of the salary of the corporation's employees, and the Congressional intention is not to be gathered from the statute by implication. Cf. Baltimore National Bank v. State Tax Comm., supra.\n It is true that the silence of Congress, when it has authority to speak, may sometimes give rise to an implication as to the Congressional purpose. The nature and extent of that implication depend upon the nature of the Congressional power and the effect of its exercise. \n1\n But \n\n[306 \nU.S. 466, 480]\n\u00a0\n there is little scope for the application of that doctrine to the tax immunity of governmental instrumentalities. The constitutional immunity of either government from taxation by the other, where Congress is silent, has its source in an implied restriction upon the powers of the taxing government. So far as the implication rests upon the purpose to avoid interference with the functions of the taxed government or the imposition upon it of the economic burden of the tax, it is plain that there is no basis for implying a purpose of Congress to exempt the federal government or its agencies from tax burdens which are unsubstantial or which courts are unable to discern. Silence of Congress implies immunity no more than does the silence of the Constitution. It follows that when exemption from state taxation is claimed on the ground that the federal government is burdened by the tax, and Congress has disclosed no intention with respect to the claimed immunity, it is in order to consider the nature and effect of the alleged burden, and if it appears that there is no ground for implying a constitutional immunity, there is equally a want of any ground for assuming any purpose on the part of Congress to create an immunity.\n The present tax is a non-discriminatory tax on income applied to salaries at a specified rate. It is not in form or substance a tax upon the Home Owners' Loan Corporation or its property or income, nor is it paid by the corporation or the government from their funds. It is measured by income which becomes the property of the taxpayer when received as compensation for his services; and the tax laid upon the privilege of receiving it is paid from his private funds and not from the funds of the government, either directly or indirectly. The theory, which once won a qualified approval, that a tax on income is legally or economically a tax on its source, is no longer tenable, New York ex rel. Cohn v. Graves, \n300 \nU.S. 308, 313\n, 314 S., 57 S.Ct. 466, 467, 108 A.L.R. 721; Hale v. State Board, \n302 \nU.S. 95, 108\n, 58 S.Ct. 102, 106; Helver- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 466, 481]\n\u00a0\n ing v. Gerhardt, supra; cf. Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, \n269 \nU.S. 514\n, 46 S. Ct. 172; Fox Film Corp. v. Doyal, \n286 \nU.S. 123\n, 52 S.Ct. 546; James v. Dravo Contracting Co., supra, page 149, 58 S.Ct. page 216; Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corp., \n303 \nU.S. 376\n, 58 S.Ct. 623, and the only possible basis for implying a constitutional immunity from state income tax of the salary of an employee of the national governmentor of a governmental agency is that the economic burden of the tax is in some way passed on so as to impose a burden on the national government tantamount to an interference by one government with the other in the performance of its functions.\n In the four cases in which this Court has held that the salary of an officer or employee of one government or its instrumentality was immune from taxation by the other, it was assumed, without discussion, that the immunity of a government or its instrumentality extends to the salaries of its officers and employees. \n2\n This assumption, made with respect to the salary of a governmental officer \n\n[306 \nU.S. 466, 482]\n\u00a0\n in Dobbins v. Commissioners of Erie County, 16 Pet. 435, and in Collector v. Day, 11 Wall. 113, was later extended to confer immunity on income derived by a lessee from lands leased to him by a government in the performance of a governmental function, Gillespie v. Oklahoma, \n257 \nU.S. 501\n, 42 S.Ct. 171; Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., \n285 \nU.S. 393\n, 52 S.Ct. 443, and cases cited, although the claim of a like exemption from tax on the income of a contractor engaged in carrying out a government project was rejected both in the case of a contractor with a state, Metcalf & Eddy v. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 466, 483]\n\u00a0\n Mitchell, supra, and of a contractor with the national government, James v. Dravo Contracting Co., supra.\n The ultimate repudiation in Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corp., supra, of the doctrine that a tax on the income of a lessee derived from a lease of government owned or controlled lands is a forbidden interference with the activities of the government concerned led to the reexamination by this Court, in the Gerhardt case, of the theory underlying the asserted immunity from taxation by one government of salaries of employees of the other. It was there pointed out that the implied immunity of one government and its agencies from taxation by the other should, as a principle of constitutional construction, be narrowly restricted. For the expansion of the immunity of the one government correspondingly curtails the sovereign power of the other to tax, and where that immunity is invoked by the private citizen it tends to operate for his benefit at the expense of the taxing government and without corresponding benefit to the government in whose name the immunity is claimed. See Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, supra, pages 523, 524, 46 S.Ct. page 174; James v. Dravo Contracting Co., supra, pages 156-158, 58 S.Ct. pages 219, 220. It was further pointed out that, as applied to the taxation of salaries of the employees of one government, the purpose of the immunity was not to confer benefits on the employees by relieving them from contributing their share of the financial support of the other government, whose benefits they enjoy, or to give an advantage to that government by enabling it to engage employees at salaries lower than those paid for like services by other employers, public or private,3 but to \n\n[306 \nU.S. 466, 484]\n\u00a0\n prevent undue interference with the one government by imposing on it the tax burdens of the other.\n In applying these controlling principles in the Gerhardt case the Court held that the salaries of employees of the New York Port Authority, a state instrumentality created by New York and New Jersey, were not immune from federal income tax, even though the Authority be regarded as not subject to federal taxation. It was said that the taxpayers enjoyed the benefit and protection of the laws of the United States and were under a duty, common to all citizens, to contribute financial support to the government; that the tax laid on their salaries and paid by them could be said to affect or burden their employer, the Port Authority, or the states creating it, only so far as the burden of the tax was economically passed on to the employer; that a non-discriminatory tax laid on the income of all members of the community could not be assumed to obstruct the function which New York and New Jersey had undertaken no perform, or to cast an economic burden upon them, more than does the general taxation of property and income which, to some extent, incapable of measurement by economists, may tend to raise the price level of labor and materials. \n4\n The Court concluded \n\n[306 \nU.S. 466, 485]\n\u00a0\n that the claimed immunity would do no more than relieve the taxpayers from the duty of financial support to the national government in order to secure to the state a theoretical advantage, speculative in character and measurement and too unsubstantial to form the basis of an implied constitutional immunity from taxation.\n The conclusion reached in the Gerhardt case that in terms of constitutional tax immunity a federal income tax on the salary of an employee is not a prohibited burden on the employer makes it imperative that we should consider anew the immunity here claimed for the salary of an employee of a federal instrumentality. As already indicated, such differences as there may be between the implied tax immunity of a state and the corresponding immunity of the national government and its instrumentalities may be traced to the fact that the national government is one of delegated powers, in the exercise of which it is supreme. Whatever scope this may give to the national government to claim immunity from state taxation of all instrumentalities which it may constitutionally create, and whatever authority Congress may possess as incidental to the exercise of its delegated powers to grant or withhold immunity from state taxation, Congress has not sought in this case to exercise such power. Hence these distinctions between the two types of immunity cannot affect the question with which we are now concerned. The burden on government of a non-discriminatory income tax applied to the salary of the employee of a government or its instrumentality is the same, whether a state or national government is concerned. The determination in the Gerhardt case that the federal income tax imposed on the employees of the Port Authority was not a burden on the Port Authority made it unnecessary to consider whether the Authority itself was immune from federal taxation; the claimed immunity failed because even if the Port Authority were \n\n[306 \nU.S. 466, 486]\n\u00a0\n itself immune from federal income tax, the tax upon the income of its employees case upon it no unconstitutional burden.\n Assuming, as we do, that the Home Owners' Loan Corporation is clothed with the same immunity from state taxation as the government itself, we cannot say that the present tax on the income of its employees lays any unconstitutional burden upon it. All the reasons for refusing to imply a constitutional prohibition of federal income taxation of salaries of state employees, stated at length in the Gerhardt case, are of equal force when immunity is claimed from state income tax on salaries paid by the national government or its agencies. In this respect we perceive no basis for a difference in result whether the taxed income be salary or some other form of compensation, or whether the taxpayer be an employee or an officer of either a state or the national government, or of its instrumentalities. In no case is there basis for the assumption that any such tangible or certain economic burden is imposed on the government concerned as would justify a court's declaring that the taxpayer is clothed with the implied constitutional tax immunity of the government by which he is employed. That assumption, made in Collector v. Day, supra, and in New York ex rel. Rogers v. Graves, supra, is contrary to the reasoning and to the conclusions reached in the Gerhardt case and in Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, supra; Group No. 1 Oil Corporation v. Bass, \n283 \nU.S. 279\n, 51 S.Ct. 432; James v. Dravo Contracting Co., supra; Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corp., supra; McLoughlin v. Commissioner, \n303 \nU.S. 218\n, 58 S.Ct. 539. In their light the assumption can no longer be made. Collector v. Day, supra, and New York ex rel. Rogers v. Graves, supra, are overruled so far as they recognize an implied constitutional immunity from income taxation of the salaries of officers or employees of the national or a state government or their instrumentalities. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 466, 487]\n\u00a0\n So much of the burden of a nondiscriminatory general tax upon the incomes of employees of a government, state or national, as may be passed on economically to that government, through the effect of the tax on the price level of labor or materials, is but the normal incident of the organization within the same territory of two governments, each possessing the taxing power. The burden, so far as it can be said to exist or to affect the government in any indirect or incidental way, is one which the Constitution presupposes, and hence it cannot rightly be deemed to be within an implied restriction upon the taxing power of the national and state governments which the Constitution has expressly granted to one and has confirmed to the other. The immunity is not one to be implied from the Constitution, because if allowed it would impose to an inadmissible extent a restriction on the taxing power which the Constitution has reserved to the state governments.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES concurs in the result.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER, concurring.\n I join in the Court's opinion but deem it appropriate to add a few remarks. The volume of the Court's business has long since made impossible the early healthy practice whereby the Justices gave expression to individual opinions. 1 But the old tradition still has relevance when an important shift in constitutional doctrine is announced after a reconstruction in the membership of the Court. Such shifts of opinion should not derive from mere private judgment. They must be duly mindful of the necessary demands of continuity in civilized society. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 466, 488]\n\u00a0\n A reversal of a long current of decisions can be justified only if rooted in the Constitution itself as an historic document designed for a developing nation.\n For one hundred and twenty years this Court has been concerned with claims of immunity from taxes imposed by one authority in our dual system of government because of the taxpayer's relation to the other. The basis for the Court's intervention in this field has not been any explicit provision of the Constitution. The States, after they formed the Union, continued to have the same range of taxing power which they had before, barring only duties affecting exports, imports, and on tonnage. \n2\n Congress, on the other hand, to lay taxes in order 'to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States', Art. 1, Sec. 8, U.S.C.A.Const., can reach every person and every dollar in the land with due regard to Constitutional limitations as to the method of laying taxes. But, as is true of other great activities of the state and national governments, the fact that we are a federalism raises problems regarding these vital powers of taxation. Since two governments have authority within the same territory, neither through its power to tax can be allowed to cripple the operations of the other. Therefore state and federal governments must avoid exactions which discriminate against each other or obviously interfere with one another's operations. These were the determining considerations that led the great Chief Justice to strike down the Maryland statute as an unambiguous measure of discrimination against the use by the United States of the Bank of the United States as one of its instruments of government.\n The arguments upon which McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, rested had their roots in actuality. But they have been distorted by sterile refinements unrelated \n\n[306 \nU.S. 466, 489]\n\u00a0\n to affairs. These refinements derived authority from an unfortunate remark in the opinion in McCulloch v. Maryland. Partly as a flourish of rhetoric and partly because the intellectual fashion of the times indulged a free use of absolutes, Chief Justice Marshall gave currency to the phrase that 'the power to tax involves the power to destroy.' Id., at page 431 of 4 Wheat. This dictum was treated as though it were a constitutional mandate. But not without protest. One of the most trenchant minds on the Marshall court, Justice William Johnson, early analyzed the dangerous inroads upon the political freedom of the States and the Union within their respective orbits resulting from a doctrinaire application of the generalities uttered in the course of the opinion in McCulloch v. Maryland. \n3\n The seductive cliche that the power to tax involves the power to destroy was fused with another assumption, likewise not to be found in the Constitution itself, namely the doctrine that the immunities are correlative-because the existence of the national government implies immunities from state taxation, the existence of state governments implies equivalent immunities from federal taxation. When this doctrine was first applied Mr. Justice Bradley registered a powerful dissent,4 the force of which gathered rather than lost strength with time. Collector v. Day, 11 Wall. 113, 128, 20.Ed. 122. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 466, 490]\n\u00a0\n All these doctrines of intergovernmental immunity have until recently been moving in the realm of what Lincoln called 'pernicious abstractions'. The web of unreality spun from Marshall's famous dictum was brushed away by one stroke of Mr. Justice Holmes's pen: 'The power to tax is not the power to destroy while this Court sits'. Panhandle Oil Co. v. Mississippi, \n277 \nU.S. 218, 223\n, 48 S.Ct. 451, 453, 56 A.L.R. 583 (dissent ). Failure to exempt public functionaries from the universal duties of citizenship to pay for the costs of government was hypothetically transmuted into hostile action of one government against the other. A succession of decisions thereby withdrew from the taxing power of the States and Nation a very considerable range of wealth without regard to the actual workings of our federalism,5 and this, too, when the financial needs of all governments began steadily to mount. These decisions have encountered increasing dissent. \n6\n In view of the powerful pull of our decisions upon the courts charged with maintaining the constitutional equilibrium of the two other great English federalisms, the Canadian and the Australian courts were at first inclined to follow the earlier doctrines of this Court regarding intergovernmental immunity. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n[306 \nU.S. 466, 491]\n\u00a0\n Both the Supreme Court of Canada and the High Court of Australia on fuller consideration-and for present purposes the British North America Act, 30 & 31 Vict., c. 3, and the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act, 63 & 64 Vict., c. 12, raise the same legal issues as does our Constitution8- have completely rejected the doctrine of intergovernmental immunity. \n9\n In this Court dissents have gradually become majority opinions, and even before the present decision the rationale of the doctrine had been undermined. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n The judicial history of this doctrine of immunity is a striking illustration of an occasional tendency to encrust unwarranted interpretations upon the Constitution and thereafter to consider merely what has been judicially said about the Constitution, rather than to be primarily controlled by a fair conception of the Constitution. Judicial exegesis is unavoidable with reference to an organic act like our Constitution, drawn in many particulars with purposed vagueness so as to leave room for the unfolding future. But the ultimate touchstone of constitutionality is the Constitution itself and not what we \n\n[306 \nU.S. 466, 492]\n\u00a0\n have said about it. \n11\n Neither Dobbins v. Commissioners of Erie County, 16 Pet. 435, and its offspring, nor Collector v. Day, supra, and its, can stand appeal to the Constitution and its historic purposes. Since both are the starting points of an interdependent doctrine, both should be, as I assume them to be, overruled this day. Whether Congress may, by express legislation, relieve its functionaries from their civic obligations to pay for the benefits of the State governments under which they live is matter for another day.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER, dissenting.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and I are of opinion that the Home Owners' Loan Corporation, being an instrumentality of the United States heretofore deemed immune from state taxation, 'it necessarily results,' as held in New York ex rel. Rogers v. Graves, 1937, \n299 \nU.S. 401\n, 57 S.Ct. 269, 272, 'that fixed salaries and compensation paid to its officers and employees in their capacity as such are likewise immune'; and that the judgment of the state court, unquestionably required by that decision, should be affirmed.\n From the decision just announced, it is clear that the Court has overruled Dobbins v. Commissioners of Erie County, 1842, 16 Pet. 435, Collector v. Day, 1871, 11 Wall. 113, New York ex rel. Rogers v. Graves, supra, and Brush v. Commissioner, 1937, \n300 \nU.S. 352\n, 57 S.Ct. 495, 108 A.L.R. 1428. Thus now it appears that the United States has always had power to tax salaries of state officers and employees and that \n\n[306 \nU.S. 466, 493]\n\u00a0\n similarly free have been the States to tax salaries of officers and employees of the United States. The compensation for past as well as for future service to be taxed and the rates prescribed in the exertion of the newly disclosed power depend on legislative discretion not subject to judicial revision. Futile indeed are the vague intimations that this Court may protect against excessive or destructive taxation. Where the power to tax exists, legislatures may exert it to destroy, to discourage, to protect or exclusively for the purpose of raising revenue. See e.g. Veazie Bank v. Fenno, 8 Wall. 533, 548; McCray v. United States, \n195 \nU.S. 27\n, 53 et seq., 24 S.Ct. 769, 775, 1 Ann.Cas. 561; Magnano Co. v. Hamilton, \n292 \nU.S. 40\n, 44 et seq., 54 S.Ct. 599, 601; Cincinnati Soap Co. v. United States, \n301 \nU.S. 308\n, 57 S.Ct. 764\n\n\n Appraisal of lurking or apparent implications of the Court's opinion can serve no useful end for, should occasion arise, they may be ignored or given direction differing from that at first seemingly intended. But safely it may be said that presently marked for destruction is the doctrine of reciprocal immunity that by recent decisions here has been so much impaired. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The failure of Congress to regulate interstate commerce has generally been taken to signify a Congressional purpose to leave undisturbed the authority of the states to make regulations affecting the commerce in matters of peculiarly local concern, but to withhold from them authority to make regulations affecting those phases of it which, because of the need of a national uniformity, demand that their regulation, if any, be prescribed by a single authority.

Commissioners of Erie County, 16 Pet. 435, a Pennsylvania tax, nominally laid upon the office of the captain of a federal revenue cutter, but roughly measured by the salary paid to the officer, ws held invalid. The Court seems to have rested its decision in part on the ground that a tax on the emoluments of his office was the equivalent of a tax upon an activity of the national government, and in part on the ground that it was an infringement of the implied superior power of Congress to fix the compensation of government employees without diminution by state taxation.\n'In Collector v. Day, 11 Wall. 113, this Court held that the salary of a state probate judge was constitutionally immune from federal income tax on the grounds that the salary of an officer of a state is exempt from federal taxation if the function he performs as an officer is exempt, citing Dobbins v. Commissioner of Erie County, supra, and that there was an implied constitutional restriction upon the power of the national government to tax a state in the exercise of those functions which were essential to the maintenance of state governments as they were organized at the time when the Constitution was adopted. The possibility that a non-discriminatory tax upon the income of a state officer did not involve any substantial interference with the functioning of the state government was not discussed either in this or the Dobbins case.\n\n In New York ex rel. Rogers v. Graves, \n299 \nU.S. 401\n, 57 S.Ct. 269, the question was whether the salary of the general counsel of the Panama Rail Road Company was exempt from state income tax because the railroad company was an instrumentality of the federal government. The sole question raised by the taxing state was whether the railroad company was a government instrumentality. The Court, having found that the railroad company was such an instrumentality, disposed of the matter of tax exemption of the salary of its employees by declaring: 'The railroad company being immune from state taxation, it necessarily results that fixed salaries and compensation paid to its officers and employees in their capacity as such are likewise immune.' New York ex rel. Rogers v. Graves, supra, page 408, 57 S.Ct. page 272. \n In Brush v. Commissioner, \n300 \nU.S. 352\n, 57 S.Ct. 495, 108 A.L.R. 1428, the applicable treasury regulation upon which the government relied exempted from federal income tax the compensation of 'state officers and employees' for 'services rendered in connection with the exercise of an essential governmental function of the State.' The Court held that the maintenance of the public water system of New York City was an essential governmental function, and in determining whether the salary of the engineer in charge of that project was subject to federal income tax the Court declared, citing New York ex rel. Rogers v. Graves, supra, page 408, 57 S.Ct. page 272: 'The answer depends upon whether the water system of the city was created and is conducted in the exercise of the city's governmental functions. If so, its operations are immune from federal taxation and, as a necessary corollary, 'fixed salaries and compensation paid to its officers and employees in their capacity as such are likewise immune.\" Brush v. Commissioner, supra, page 360, 57 S.Ct. page 495. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The fact that the expenses of the one government might be lessened if all those who deal with it were exempt from taxation by the other was thought not to be an adequate basis for tax immunity in Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, \n269 \nU.S. 514\n, 46 S.Ct. 172, 70.Ed. 384; Group No. 1 Oil Corp. v. Bass, \n283 \nU.S. 279\n, 51 S.Ct. 432; Burnet v. Jergins Trust, \n288 \nU.S. 508\n, 53 S.Ct. 439; James v.

HELVERING(1939)\nNo. 49\nArgued: December 5, 1939Decided: December 18, 1939\n\n\n\n Messrs. Herman A. Fischer and Delbert A. Clithero, both of Chicago, Ill., for petitioner.\n Mr. Arnold Raum, Sp. Asst. to Atty. Gen., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The case is here to review a decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit (103 F.2d 110) \n\n[308 \nU.S. 355, 356]\n\u00a0\n reversing an order of the Board of Tax Appeals (37 B.T.A. 314) which had overruled a deficiency assessment by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue in petitioner's income tax return for 1933. We granted certiorari, \n308 \nU.S. 531\n, 60 S.Ct. 73, 84 L.Ed. --, because of an alleged conflict between the decision below and that of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Smith v. Higgins, 102 F.2d 456; Id., \n308 \nU.S. 536\n, 60 S.Ct. 88, 84 L.Ed. --.\n The facts are undisputed, and, for purposes of our decision, may be thus abridged: In 1926 Griffiths, the petitioner, paid one Lay $100,000 for some stock. The investment was unprofitable, and the upshot of a complicated series of transactions was allowance to Griffiths by the Commissioner of a deductible loss of $92,500 for the year 1931 resulting from a sale of the stock by Griffiths to a family corporation. Thereafter, in 1932, Griffiths got wind of the fact that Lay had defrauded him in the 1926 sale. Negotiations were begun for a settlement of Griffiths' claim against Lay, and by January 1933, Griffiths' lawyer had devised an arrangement for such a settlement. The gist of the arrangement was this: Griffiths was to reacquire the shares, convey them to a corporation newly created for the purpose of furthering the scheme and wholly controlled by Griffiths, which in turn was to transfer the stock back to Lay for $100, 000 to be paid by him, and that sum was to be paid over by the corporation to Griffiths in annual installments for forty years, with interest on the deferred payments. \n1\n The \n\n[308 \nU.S. 355, 357]\n\u00a0\n essentials of this scheme were carried out. Its purpose-to disguise by intervening elaborations what in fact was a rescission of the original purchase by Griffiths for $100,000-was made more manifest by these facts: Griffiths personally re-acquired and transferred the shares to Lay without revealing the existence of the new corporation, gave Lay a personal release of all claims against him, and personally received from Lay the $ 100,000 which he then turned over to the corporation.\n On these findings the Commissioner ruled that Griffiths, having been allowed a deduction for loss attributable to the stock purchased from Lay and having now recouped that loss through settlement of his claim against Lay, was subject to tax for the amount of the settlement in 1933. We think the Commissioner was right, and that the Circuit Court of Appeals properly reversed the Board of Tax Appeals.\n The facts leave little scope for legal explication. Griffiths had a claim for fraud against Lay which, when satisfied, wiped out the loss for which he had received an earlier deduction. Had satisfaction of the claim come to him without any conduit, it would have indisputably been his income. The claim having been recognized by Lay and cast into a form realizable by Griffiths, a lawyer's ingenuity devised a technically elegant arrangement whereby an intricate outward appearance was given to the simple sale from Griffiths to Lay and the passage of money from Lay to Griffiths. That was the crux of the business to Griffiths, and that is the crux of the business to us.\n We cannot too often reiterate that 'taxation is not so much concerned with the refinements of title as it is with actual command over the property taxed-the actual benefit for which the tax is paid.' Corliss v. Bowers, \n281 \nU.S. 376, 378\n, 50 S.Ct. 336. And it makes no difference that such \n\n[308 \nU.S. 355, 358]\n\u00a0\n 'command' may be exercised through specific retention of legal title or the creation of a new equitable but controlled interest, or the maintenance of effective benefit through the interposition of a subservient agency. Cf. Gregory v. Helvering, \n293 \nU.S. 465\n, 55 S.Ct. 266, 97 A.L.R. 1355. 'A given result at the end of a straight path,' this Court said in Minnesota Tea Co. v. Helvering, \n302 \nU.S. 609, 613\n, 58 S.Ct. 393, 395, 'is not made a different result because reached by following a devious path.' Legislative words are not inert, and derive vitality from the obvious purposes at which they are aimed, particularly in the provisions of a tax law like those governing installment sales in  44 of the Revenue Act of 1932. Taxes cannot be escaped 'by anticipatory arrangements and contracts however skilfully devised ... by which the fruits are attributed to a different tree from that on which they grew.' Lucas v. Earl, i\n81 \nU.S. 111, 115\n, 50 S.Ct. 241. What Lay gave Griffiths in reality got, and on that he must be taxed. The judgment is\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Of the total sum paid, $15,000 was to be applied by the corporation in payment of a personal indebtedness owed by Griffiths. This sum, of course, was clearly income to petitioner. The remainder was to be paid in installments by the corporation to Griffiths.

They asserted a right under the bonds to be paid in Dutch guilders, and asked that their claims-based upon guilder value-be allowed for $37,335,525.12. The trustee in bankruptcy contended, and the courts below held that the Joint Resolution of June 5, 1933,1 made the bonds dischargeable by payment of current legal tender United States money,2 and petitioners' claims were accordingly allowed for $21,638,000, the face amount of their bonds in dollars.\n These bonds, secured by a trust mortgage, were issued and sold in the United States in 1912. Purchasers paid and the railroad received United States dollars, and until 1936 interest was regularly paid in dollars.\n The asserted right to guilder payment rests upon a provision of the bonds concededly granting holders an \n\n[307 \nU.S. 247, 250]\n\u00a0\n option to elect. payment in dollars, guilders, pounds, marks, or francs. This multiple currency provision was authorized by the following terms of the mortgage securing the bonds:\n'... the ...

In addition, future use of such proscribed provisions was expressly prohibited, whether actually contained in an obligation payable in money of the United States or separately 'made with respect thereto.' This proscription embraced 'every provision' purporting to give an obligee a right to require payment in (1) gold; (2) a particular kind of coin or currency of the United States; or (3) in an amount of United States money measured by gold or a particular kind of United States coin or currency.\n Having thus unmistakably stamped illegality upon both outstanding and future contractual provisions designed to require payment by debtors in a frozen money value rather than in a dollar of legal tender current at date of payment, Congress-apparently to obviate any possible misunderstanding as to the breadth of its objective-added, with studied precision, a catchall second sentence sweeping in 'every obligation', existing or future, 'payable in money of the United States', irrespec- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 247, 253]\n\u00a0\n tive of 'whether or not any such provision is contained therein or made with respect thereto.' The obligations hit at by Congress were those 'payable in money of the United States.' All such obligations were declared dischargeable 'upon payment, dollar for dollar, in any coin or currency (of the United States) which at the time of payment is legal tender for public and private debts.' It results that if petitioners' claims rest upon 'obligation(s) ... payable in money of the United States', by the terms of the Resolution they shall be discharged upon payment of current legal tender dollars equal to the number of dollars promised in gold or a particular kind of money. Decision must therefore turn upon the nature of the 'obligation(s) ... incurred' by the railroad in its bond contracts of 1912\n\n\n These bonds provide that, 'For a description of the property and franchises mortgaged, the nature and extent of the security, the rights of the holders of said bonds under the same and the terms and conditions upon which such bonds are issued and secured, reference is made to the ... Mortgage.' In determining the nature of the railroad's obligation, we, accordingly, look both to the mortgage and the bonds.\n It appears that-\n The railroad executed the mortgage in 1912 to the Guaranty Trust Company of New York as trustee, to secure forty-year mortgage bonds 'limited to an aggregate principal amount of One Hundred Million Dollars ($ 100,000,000.00) at any one time outstanding ... to be payable on the first day of January, 1952, with interest at the rate of five per cent per annum payable semi-annually ...'; the bonds are payable optionally in foreign currencies as indicated above; registration in New York is required of bonds subjected to registration; to be valid all bonds must be authenticated by the Guaranty Trust Company in New York; non-coupon bonds and \n\n[307 \nU.S. 247, 254]\n\u00a0\n coupon bonds are interchangeable upon request, but non-coupon bonds contain no option for payment in foreign currencies; the New York trustee is granted broad supervisory powers (for the benefit of the bondholders) over finances and operations of the railroad; the railroad is required to keep an office in New York where bonds and coupons can be presented for payment, but is not required to keep any foreign offices; in the event of default in payment of bonds or coupons, the New York trustee is authorized, through its agents or attorneys, to take charge of the mortgaged property, to sell under foreclosure proceedings in the United States, and to protect bondholders' interests by employment of attorneys and institution of judicial proceedings either in law or equity, 'for the equal benefit of all holders of ... outstanding bonds and coupons'; should the Guaranty Trust Company resign as Trustee, the bondholders may designate another which, however, 'must always be a trust company having an office in the Borough of Manhattan, in the City of New York, N.Y.'\n The mortgaged property is located in the United States; the trustee was required to be a New York trust company; enforcement of the trust security, collection of bonds and interest, employment of attorneys, institution of legal proceedings and distribution of assembled assets, were all responsibilities placed upon the trustee located in New York, and obviously contemplated that any necessary judicial proceedings would be had in this country under the governing law of the United States. Both the mortgage and bonds are domestic obligations, and the law of this country must determine their interpretation, their nature, and the obligations enforceable under them. \n4\n The Joint Resolution thus must govern if the \n\n[307 \nU.S. 247, 255]\n\u00a0\n bonds are, within its terms, 'obligation(s) ... payable in money of the United States.'\n In their construction of the bonds, petitioners urge that each of the alternative promises to pay in a foreign currency is a separate and independent 'obligation' to pay. From this, they argue that the only 'obligation' for which enforcement is here sought is one 'payable' in guilders which must be treated as though it were an entirely separate and independent promise of the railroad. But the railroad undertook only a single obligation to repay the money it borrowed. Repayment of that money might be called for in any one, but only one, of the five different types of money. This, however, did not divide the railroad's undertaking to repay into five separate and independent obligations to repay the same loan. Payment under the contract in any one of the currencies selected by the bondholder would discharge the entire single obligation of the debtor. Payment in guilders, after payment in guilders was elected, would nonetheless discharge an obligation which prior to such election and payment was an obligation also payable in United States dollars. The language of the Joint Resolution was intended to refer to a monetary obligation its entirety. That which the Joint Resolution made dischargeable was the debt-the monetary obligation to pay. This debtor's obligation was a monetary obligation. The foreign currencies promised were not bartered for as commodities, but their function was that of money to be paid in countries in which they were legal tender and upon them interest was to be paid. \n5\n Interest is not paid on commodities but on monetary obligations. And these \n\n[307 \nU.S. 247, 256]\n\u00a0\n promises in alternative currencies were not separate and independent contracts or obligations, but were parts of one and the same monetary obligation of the debtor.\n The point is made, however, that this obligation of the railroad was never payable in United States money because the option to receive payment in dollars has has never been exercised. Conceding that one meaning of 'payable' is 'capable of being paid', petitioners nevertheless urge that the use of this meaning should not be attributed to Congress, but that instead we must narrow and restrict 'payable' to mean an absolute and unconditional obligation. But the railroad, since the day its bonds were issued, was under obligation to hold itself prepared to pay United States money-or any one of the optional currencies. And, on the date the Resolution went into effect, no election had been made so that the railroad was, at that time, still under obligation to pay dollars. If prior to election by the holders the railroad was under no obligation to pay United States money, it was likewise under no obligation to pay any money, United States or otherwise, although it then had outstanding a $100, 000,000 mortgage on all of its properties. Neither in logic nor law can it be said that the railroad's promise, secured by a $100,000,000 mortgage, to pay in any one of five currencies was not an obligation payable in any currency until express election of payment in a particular currency was made. Legal rights and obligations came into existence when the contracts for purchase of the bonds were completed. Since the words 'obligation(s ) ... payable in money of the United States' are clearly broad enough to require inclusion of these multiple currency obligations, there is no justification here for restricting the meaning of these words of the Resolution. Consideration of the evils aimed at leaves no doubt but that such restriction would do violence to the intention of the Congress.\n The report of the Senate Committee on the Resolution opens with words revealing its purpose. It is there stated \n\n[307 \nU.S. 247, 257]\n\u00a0\n that 'Certain questions of interpretation have arisen with respect to the legislation empowering the President to prevent the withdrawal and hoarding of gold and the provision of the Thomas amendment6 making all coins and currencies legal tender for all debts. Additional and immediate legislation is necessary to remove the disturbing effect of this uncertainty and to insure the success of the policy by closing possible legal loopholes and removing inconsistencies.' \n7\n (Italics supplied.) The comprehensive language of the Resolution was intended-as by its terms it did-to close 'legal loopholes' contributing to 'dislocation of the domestic economy which would be caused by such a disparity of conditions in which, it is insisted, those debtors under gold clauses should be required to pay $1.69 in currency while respectively receiving their taxes, rates, charges, and prices on the basis of $1 of that currency.' \n8\n Here, the admitted purpose of the multiple currency provision supplementing the gold clause was the same as that of the gold clause itself, that is, to afford creditors of United States debtors on domestic money obligations contractual protection against possible depreciation of United States money. It was a plan, wholly legal when contrived, specifically designed to require debtors to pay 1912 gold dollars or fixed amounts in foreign currencies which were the exact equivalents of gold dollars in 1912. In purpose, pattern and, as shown here, in result, the multiple currency provision is identical with the practice Congress declared to be against public policy, and it furthers a mischief which the Resolution was enacted to end.\n The mischief Congress intended to end will not end if the multiple currency provision of these bonds is held to \n\n[307 \nU.S. 247, 258]\n\u00a0\n be unaffected by the Resolution. Congress sought to outlaw all contractual provisions which require debtors, who have bound themselves to pay United States dollars, to pay a greater number of dollars than promised. The Resolution intended that debtors under obligation to pay dollars should not have their debts tied to any fixed value of particular money, but that their entire obligations should be measured by and tied to the actual number of dollars promised, dollar for dollar. A multiple currency provision was inserted in these bonds in order to tie this debtor to a fixed value of particular money, and, relying upon this provision, petitioners demand more dollars than promised in the bonds. The provision is thus clearly at cross purposes with the Resolution. By a simple mathematical calculation translating guilder value into dollar value, petitioners will, if the Resolution is not applied to them, enforce the obligations of this debtor, not dollar for dollar as the Resolution provides, but more than a dollar and a half for every dollar borrowed, and the purpose of Congress, that no such premium need be paid, will be completely defeated.\n When the Joint Resolution was enacted the railroad had by its promise assumed obligations to pay its bonds in dollars; its obligations were therefore 'payable in money of the United States' and so fall squarely within the letter, as well as the spirit of the Resolution making obligations dischargeable by payment of current United States legal tender money.\n There remains the argument of petitioners that the Resolution, if construed to forbid enforcement of the option to demand payment in guilders, nullifies contractual rights in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, U.S.C.A. But, as has already been pointed out, the contracts on which the claims for guilders rest are domestic obligations, controlled by and to be interpreted under the law of the United States. And contracts be- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 247, 259]\n\u00a0\n tween private parties cannot create vested rights which serve to restrict and limit an exercise of a constitutional power of Congress. \n9\n These bonds and their securing mortgage were created subject not only to the exercise by Congress of  constitutional power 'to coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin,' (U.S.C.A.Const. art. 1,  8, cl. 5) but also to 'the full authority of the Congress in relation to the currency.' The extent of that authority of Congress has been recently pointed out: 'The broad and comprehensive national authority over the subjects of revenue, finance and currency is derived from the aggregate of the powers granted to the Congress, embracing the powers to lay and collect taxes, to borrow money, to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states, to coin money, regulate the value thereof, and of foreign coin, and fix the standards of weights and measures, and the added express power 'to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution' the other enumerated powers.' \n10\n\u00a0\n\n Under these powers, Congress was authorized-as it did in the Resolution-to establish, regulate and control the national currency and to make that currency legal tender money for all purposes, including payment of domestic dollar obligations with options for payment in foreign currencies. Whether it was 'wise and expedient' to do so was, under the Constitution, a determination to be made by the Congress. \n11\n The Resolution that made these creditors' bonds dischargeable in the same United States legal tender which other creditors in this country must accept, does not contravene the Fifth Amendment. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 247, 260]\n\u00a0\n Our conclusion that the Joint Resolution makes petitioners' claims in bankruptcy allowable dollar for dollar renders consideration of subsidiary questions unnecessary.\n The judgments are\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE, dissenting.\n Without considering the question whether the bondholders in these cases have properly exercised their options, I cannot agree that the Joint Resolution of Congress of June 5, 1933, has set at naught the promise of the bonds to pay guilders to the holders at their election.\n In each case the bonds contain alternative and mutually exclusive undertakings. The holder could if he wished demand payment in United States gold dollars of a fixed standard or their equivalent in United States currency. The alternative promise is for payment abroad of specified amounts of any one of several foreign currencies, without reference to their gold value at the time of payment. Its performance is as independent of gold or gold value as if it had called for the delivery of a specified amount of wheat, sugar or coffee, or the performance of specified services.\n Any construction of the gold clause resolution which would in the circumstances of the present case preclude payment in foreign money would equally forbid performance of an alternative promise calling for the delivery of a commodity or the rendition of services. Hence the decisive question is whether the resolution admits of a construction which would compel one whose contract stipulates for delivery at his option of a cargo of sugar to accept instead payment of a specified amount in legal tender dollars, merely because by the terms of his contract he might have demanded, though he did not, an equal number of gold dollars. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 247, 261]\n\u00a0\n When the Joint Resolution was adopted there were many obligations of American citizens payable abroad exclusively in foreign currency, and the attendant devaluation of the dollar greatly increased the burden of performance of such contracts through the necessity of purchasing with depreciated dollars the foreign exchange required for their fulfillment. But it must be conceded that Congress did not undertake to relieve any American citizen of that burden, and it is not contended that the Joint Resolution provided for the discharge of any obligations payable in foreign currency, not measured in gold, except in the case where the promise to pay in foreign money is an alternative for the promise to pay in dollars. After devaluation of the dollar the burden on American citizens of meeting obligations abroad by payment in foreign currencies may well have been as great whether the undertaking was unconditional or to pay upon a condition which had happened, or whether the obligation was to pay in a foreign currency or to supply goods which must be acquired by the expenditure of depreciated dollars.\n We can find nothing in the legislative history of the Joint Resolution or its language to suggest any Congressional policy to relieve from the one form of obligation more than another, or to indicate that the resolution was aimed at anything other than provisions calling for payment in gold value or gold dollars or their equivalent, which Congress explicitly named and described as the evil to be remedied, both in the Joint Resolution itself and in the committee reports attending its adoption. See Sen.Rep.No.99, 73d Cong., 1st Sess.; H.R.Rep.No.169, 73d Cong., 1st Sess.\n The Joint Resolution of Congress and the committee reports make no mention of obligations dischargeable in foreign currencies or by delivery of commodities or performance of services. If it was the purpose of Congress \n\n[307 \nU.S. 247, 262]\n\u00a0\n to control such obligations through the exercise of its power to regulate the value of money, that fact must be discoverable from the language of the resolution or from some underlying public policy, to which its words and the records of Congress give no clue. Shortly before the adoption of the resolution, Congress had authorized the President to devalue the dollar. By appropriate legislation and executive action, gold payments by the Treasury had been suspended, the hoarding of gold and its exportation had been prohibited, and all persons had been required to deliver gold owned by them to the Treasury. See Norman v. Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co., \n294 \nU.S. 240\n, 295 et seq., 55 S.Ct. 407, 410, 95 A.L.R. 1352. It was obvious that these measures, aimed at the suppression of the use of gold as a standard of currency value, would fail of their purpose unless all payments in gold of the established standard or its equivalent were outlawed. The reports of the Congressional committees recommending the adoption of the resolution indicate clearly enough that such was its purpose. They give no hint that more was intended. See Sen.Rep.No.99, 73d Cong., 1st Sess ; H.R.Rep.No.169, 73d Cong., 1st Sess.\n The recitals of the Joint Resolution declare that it is aimed at 'the holding of or dealing in gold' and the 'provisions of obligations which purport to give the obligee a right to require payment in gold or a particular kind of coin or currency of the United States, or in an amount in money of the United States measured thereby.' No other purpose is suggested. The enacting part of the resolution proscribes 'every provision ... which purports to give the obligee a right to require payment in gold or a particular kind of coin or currency, or in an amount in money of the United States measured thereby', and declares 'Every obligation, heretofore or hereafter incurred, whether or not any such provision is contained therein or made with respect thereto, shall be \n\n[307 \nU.S. 247, 263]\n\u00a0\n discharged upon payment, dollar for dollar, in any coin or currency which at the time of payment is legal tender ....' 'Obligation', it states, 'means an obligation ... payable in money of the United States'. Thus the resolution proclaims that it is aimed at gold clauses and declares, if language is to be taken in its plain and most obvious sense, that provisions requiring payment in gold dollars or measured by gold are illegal and that every promise or obligation 'payable in money of the United States' (not in guilders) shall be discharged 'dollar for dollar' in legal tender currency.\n To arrive at the conclusion that the resolution compels that present bondholders to accept dollars instead of the guilders for which they have contracted, it is necessary to say that 'obligation', which the Joint Resolution defines as obligation 'payable in money of the United States' and requires to be discharged 'dollar for dollar' in legal tender, includes the obligation payable in guilders. This difficulty is bridged by recourse to a major operation of statutory reconstruction. It is said that 'obligation' means, not the obligation or promise which is defined by the resolution as that 'payable in money of the United States' and in which the gold clause provision is 'contained' and 'with respect' to which the provision is 'made', but includes all obligations, although not dischargeable in money of the United States or in gold, which may be written into the instrument or document containing alternative promises, one of which is to pay in dollars. The 'obligation' of the resolution 'with respect' to which the gold clause is 'made' is thus treated as synonymous with the instrument containing the multiple obligations, and all the provisions in it (not alone the promise to pay dollars) are now held to be dischargeable in dollars merely because one of the alternative promises 'contained' a provision payable in 'money of the United States', although the bondholder is entitled by his contract to demand performance of a promise to pay guild- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 247, 264]\n\u00a0\n ers not measured by gold. Thus, starting with a resolution avowedly directed at gold clauses, we are brought to the extraordinary conclusion that a promise to pay foreign currency is void if expressed in an instrument containing an alternative promise to pay in money of the United States whether of gold standard or not.\n The argument is not persuasive, because it rests both upon a strained and unnatural construction of the resolution and upon an assumption that there was a Congressional policy to strike down provisions for the alternative discharge of dollar obligations by payment in foreign currency not tied to gold, which lends no support in the language of the Joint Resolution or its legislative history. It seems fair to suppose that if Congress proposed to end all possibility of creating an international market for bonds payable in dollars or alternatively abroad in foreign currencies, both without gold value, it would have given some more explicit indication of that purpose than is exhibited by the Joint Resolution. Even if we assume that Congress would have struck down such alternative currency clauses had it considered the matter, we are not free to do what Congress might have done but did not, or what we may think it ought to have done to lessen the rigors of our own currency devaluation for those who had made contracts for payment abroad in foreign currency without gold value. DP In any case it seems plain that if Congress had made the attempt it would not have chosen to do so in terms which, if the Court's construction of the Joint Resolution be accepted, are broad enough to strike down every conceivable provision for payment in foreign currency, delivery of commodities, or performance of services as an alternative for a promise to pay dollars, whether of gold standard or not.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice BUTLER concur in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 48 Stat. 112, 31 U.S.C.  463, 31 U.S.C.A.  463. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 8 Cir., 98 F.2d 160; Chemical Bank & Trust Co. v.

S.C.  344(a), 28 U.S.C.A.  344(a).\n Section 4(e), 5(g), (m) of Tit. 2, c. 180 of Washington Laws of 1935 lay 'a tax for the act or privilege of engaging in business activities' upon every person (including corporations) 'engaging within this state in any business activity,' with exceptions not now material, at the rate of one-half of 1% of the 'gross income of the business.' As the record discloses, appellant has a place of business in the state of Washington from which it carries on its operations in marketing, in other states and foreign countries, apples and and pears grown in Washington and Oregon. Its entire business is that of marketing agent \n\n[305 \nU.S. 434, 436]\n\u00a0\n for fruit growers and growers' cooperative organizations in those states. As such it makes sales and deliveries of the fruit in other states and in foreign countries, collects the sales prices and remits the proceeds to its principals after deducting transportation charges, certain expense allowances and its own compensation. In the course of the business the fruit is shipped from the states of origin-approximately 25% from Oregon- to other states and foreign countries, sometimes directly to the purchasers, but more often it is consigned to appellant at extra-state points from which it is diverted by appellant to purchasers who buy the fruit while in transit, or where it is stored pending sale. Representatives of appellant at numerous points without the state negotiate sales of the fruit on behalf of appellant and on its approval execute written contracts of sale, effect delivery of the shipments to purchasers, collect the purchase price and remit it to appellant in Washington, where it is accounted for to the shippers. In conducting the business appellant sends to its representatives without the state daily bulletins listing the fruit, some of which is in transit interstate and some of which has already been placed in storage without the state, and it expends large amounts for communications by telephone, telegraph and cable between itself in Washington and its representatives outside the state.\n The entire Washington business is carried on by appellant under contract with an incorporated federation of twelve state cooperative growers' organizations. By this contract appellant is given exclusive authority to sell all apples and pears coming into the possession and control of the federation as agent for its members and to collect the proceeds of sale. Appellant undertakes to sell these products at prices fixed by the federation, to obtain their widest possible distribution, to attend to all traffic matters pertaining to shipment and transportation of the fruit, to effect delivery to purchasers and to collect and \n\n[305 \nU.S. 434, 437]\n\u00a0\n remit the sales prices. The stipulated compensation for the entire service is at the rate of 8 cents a box for apples sold and 10 cents a box for pears. According to the bill of complaint appellees assert that appellant is subject to the tax upon its entire gross revenue from the business, and they threaten to collect the tax and to impose penalties for its nonpayment. But on the trial it was stipulated that 'the state makes no claim' to the tax upon appellant's Oregon business, and we treat the decision and decree of the state court as concerned only with the validity of the tax measured by the amount of fruit shipped from Washington.\n The Supreme Court of Washington, conceding that the shipment of the fruit from the state of origin to points outside, and its sale there, involve interstate commerce, held nevertheless that appellant's activities in Washington in promoting the commerce were a local business, subject to state taxation as is other business carried on in the state, and it sustained the present levy, against attack under the commerce clause, as a tax upon those activities, citing Ficklen v. Shelby County Taxing District, \n145 \nU.S. 1\n, 12 S.Ct. 810, and American Manufacturing Co. v. St. Louis, \n250 \nU.S. 459\n, 39 S.Ct. 522\n\n\n We need not stop to consider which, if any, of appellant's activities in carrying on its business are in themselves transportation of the fruit in interstate or foreign commerce. For the entire service for which the compensation is paid is in aid of the shipment and sale of merchandise in that commerce. Such services are within the protection of the commerce clause, Robbins v. Shelby County Taxing District, \n120 \nU.S. 489\n, 7 S.Ct. 592; Caldwell v. North Carolina, \n187 \nU.S. 622\n, 23 S.Ct. 229; Real Silk Hosiery Mills v. Portland, \n268 \nU.S. 325\n, 45 S.Ct. 525; and the only question is whether the taxation of appellant's gross receipts derived from them is such an interference with interstate commerce as to bring the tax within the constitutional prohibition. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 434, 438]\n\u00a0\n While appellant is engaged in business within the state, and the state courts have sustained the tax as laid on its activities there, the interstate commerce service which it renders and for which the taxed compensation is paid is not wholly performed within the state. A substantial part of it is outside the state where sales are negotiated and written contracts of sale are executed, and where deliveries and collections are made. Both the compensation and the tax laid upon it are measured by the amount of the commerce-the number of boxes of fruit transported from Washington to purchasers elsewhere; so that the tax, though nominally imposed upon appellant's activities in Washington, by the very method of its measurement reaches the entire interstate commerce service rendered both within and without the state and burdens the commerce in direct proportion to its volume.\n The constitutional effect of a tax upon gross receipts derived from participation in interstate commerce and measured by the amount or extent of the commerce itself has been so recently and fully considered by this Court that it is unnecessary now to elaborate the applicable principles. Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, \n303 \nU.S. 250\n, 58 S.Ct. 546, 115 A.L.R. 944; Adams Manufacturing Co. v. Storen, \n304 \nU.S. 307\n, 58 S.Ct. 913, 117 A.L.R. 429; cf. Coverdale v. Arkansas- Louisiana Pipe Line Co., \n303 \nU.S. 604\n, 58 S.Ct. 736.\n It has often been recognized that 'even interstate business must pay its way' by bearing its share of local tax burdens, Postal Telegraph-Cable Co. v. Richmond, \n249 \nU.S. 252, 259\n, 39 S.Ct. 265, 266, and that in consequence not every local tax laid upon gross receipts derived from participation in interstate commerce is forbidden. See Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, supra, page 254 et seq., 58 S.Ct. at page 548, and cases cited. But it is enough for present purposes that under the commerce clause, in the absence of Congressional action, state taxation, whatever its form, is precluded if it discriminates against interstate commerce or \n\n[305 \nU.S. 434, 439]\n\u00a0\n undertakes to lay a privilege tax measured by gross receipts derived from activities in such commerce which extend beyond the territorial limits of the taxing state. Such a tax, at least when not apportioned to the activities carried on within the state, see Wisconsin & M. Ry. Co. v. Powers, \n191 \nU.S. 379\n, 24 S.Ct. 107; Maine v. Grand Trunk Ry. Co., \n142 \nU.S. 217\n, 12 S.Ct. 121, 163; Cudahy Packing Co. v. Minnesota, \n246 \nU.S. 450\n, 38 S.Ct. 373; United States Express Co. v. Minnesota, \n223 \nU.S. 335\n, 32 S.Ct. 211; cf. Ficklen v. Shelby County Taxing District, supra; American Manufacturing Co. v. St. Louis, supra, burdens the commerce in the same manner and to the same extent as if the exaction were for the privilege of engaging in interstate commerce and would, if sustained, expose it to multiple tax burdens, each measured by the entire amount of the commerce, to which local commerce is not subject.\n Here the tax, measured by the entire volume of the interstate commerce in which appellant participates, is not apportioned to its activities within the state. If Washington is free to exact such a tax, other states to which the commerce extends may, with equal right, lay a tax similarly measured for the privilege of conducting within their respective territorial limits the activities there which contribute to the service. The present tax, though nominally local, thus in its practical operation discriminates against interstate commerce, since it imposes upon it, merely because interstate commerce is being done, the risk of a multiple burden to which local commerce is not exposed. Adams Manufacturing Co. v. Storen, supra, pages 310, 311, 58 S.Ct. at page 915; cf. Fargo v. Michigan, \n121 \nU.S. 230\n, 7 S.Ct. 857; Philadelphia & Southern M.S.S. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n122 \nU.S. 326\n, 7 S.Ct. 1118; Galveston, H. & S.A. Ry. Co. v. Texas, \n210 \nU.S. 217, 225\n, 227 S., 28 S.Ct. 638, 639; Meyer v. Wells Fargo & Co., \n223 \nU.S. 298\n, 32 S.Ct. 218; Crew Levick Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n245 \nU.S. 292\n, 38 S.Ct. 126; Fisher's Blend Station v. State Tax Commission, \n297 \nU.S. 650\n, 56 S.Ct. 608; see Western Live Stock v. Bureau of \n\n[305 \nU.S. 434, 440]\n\u00a0\n Revenue, supra, page 260, 58 S.Ct. at page 550. Such a multiplication of state taxes, each measured by the volume of the commerce, would reestablish the barriers to interstate trade which it was the object of the commerce clause to remove. Unlawfulness of the burden depends upon its nature measured in terms of its capacity to obstruct interstate commerce, and not on the contingency that some other state may first have subjected the commerce to a like burden.\n Ficklen v. Shelby County Taxing District, supra, which the Washington Supreme Court thought sustained its decision, upheld a state license tax imposed upon the privilege of doing a brokerage business within the state and measured by the gross receipts of commissions from sales of merchandise shipped into the state for delivery after the sales were made. Although the tax, measured by gross receipts, to some extent burdened the commerce, it was held that the burden did not infringe the commerce clause. Since it was apportioned exactly to the activities taxed, all of which were intrastate, the tax was fairly measured by the value of the local privilege or franchise. New York, L.E. & W.R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n158 \nU.S. 431\n, 15 S.Ct. 896; American Manufacturing Co. v. St. Louis, supra; Utah Power & Light Co. v. Pfost, \n286 \nU.S. 165\n, 52 S.Ct. 548; Coverdale v. Arkansas-Louisiana Pipe Line Co., supra. Neither the tax in the Ficklen Case nor that upheld in American Manufacturing Co. v. St. Louis, supra, was open to the objection directed here to the present tax and sustained in Adams Manufacturing Co. v. Storen, supra, page 311, 58 S.Ct. at page 915, that the tax is measured by gross receipts from activities in interstate commerce conducted both within and without the taxing state and that the exaction is of such a character that if lawful it might be laid to the fullest extent by the states in which the merchandise is sold as well as by those from which it is shipped. See Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, supra, page 260, 58 S.Ct. at page 550. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 434, 441]\n\u00a0\n For more than a century, since Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419, 445, it has been recognized that under the commerce clause, Congress not acting, some protection is afforded to interstate commerce against state taxation of the privilege of engaging in it. Webber v. Virginia, \n103 \nU.S. 344\n; Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Texas, \n105 \nU.S. 460\n; Robbins v. Shelby County Taxing District, supra; Leloup v. Mobile, \n127 \nU.S. 640\n, 8 S.Ct. 1380; Brennan v. Titusville, \n153 \nU.S. 289\n, 14 S.Ct. 829; International Text-Book Co. v. Pigg, \n217 \nU.S. 91\n, 30 S.Ct. 481, 27 L.R.A., N.S., 493, 18 Ann.Cas. 1103; Fisher's Blend Station v. State Tax Commission, supra; Adams Manufacturing Co. v. Storen, supra. For half a century, following the decision in Philadelphia & S.M. Steamship Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n122 \nU.S. 326\n, 7 S.Ct. 1118, it has not been doubted that state taxation of local participation in interstate commerce, measured by the entire volume of the commerce, is likewise foreclosed. During that period Congress has not seen fit to exercise its constitutional power to alter or abolish the rules thus judicially established. Instead, it has left them undisturbed, doubtless because it has appreciated the destructive consequences to the commerce of the nation if their protection were withdrawn. Meanwhile Congress has accommodated its legislation, as have the states, to these rules as an established feature of our constitutional system. There has been left to the states wide scope for taxation of those engaged in interstate commerce, extending to the instruments of that commerce, to net income derived from it, and to other forms of taxation not destructive of it. See Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, supra, page 254 et seq., 58 S.Ct. at page 548, and cases cited.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice BUTLER.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and I concur in the result.\n Appellant is engaged exclusively in interstate commerce, a part of which is carried on in the State of Washington. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 434, 442]\n\u00a0\n For the privilege of doing that business the state statute purports to tax its gross earnings at the rate of one-half of one per cent. The exaction is plainly repugnant to the commerce clause. Philadelphia & Southern M.S.S. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n122 \nU.S. 326\n, 7 S.Ct. 1118; Galveston, H. & S.A. Ry. Co. v.

State Board, \n297 \nU.S. 441, 444\n, 56 S.Ct. 553, 554. Reversal appropriately may be based on citation of these decisions without more.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK, dissenting.\n'Equality is the theme that runs through all the sections of the statute'1 of the State of Washington here considered. The statute imposes a general, non-discriminatory tax-measured by gross receipts-upon all business operating in that State. The intended equality of the statute will become unequality by the judgment of this Court here, because appellant and all other businesses in Washington that receive income for selling Washington products in that and other States, are exempted from the tax. Appellant is exempted from past, present and future payments of this tax. Not so, however, as to past, present, or future payments by Washington businesses selling only to citizens of that State. They must bear the entire burden of the tax. Thus the judgment here, framed to prevent conjectured future, possible-not present and actual-discrimination against interstate commerce, makes of this statute with equality as its theme, an instrument of discrimination against Washington intrastate \n\n[305 \nU.S. 434, 443]\n\u00a0\n businesses. Appellant, a Washington agent or broker selling Washington products in that State and elsewhere, can now do so freed from this business tax. Washington agents and brokers selling the same products to Washington citizens (and all other local businesses) must pay. Washington's intra-state commerce thus will 'pay its way;'2 interstate commerce need not.\n\n In 1933, Washington's system of taxation failed to supply adequate revenue to support activities essential to the welfare of its people. Mounting delinquencies due to burdensome taxes on property led the State legislature to conclude that property taxes had to be reduced. This reduction was made. Then, forced to seek new sources of revenue,3 the State turned-as did many other States faced with similar needs4-to a general, non-discriminatory excise tax upon business carried on in Washington, measured by gross receipts. This general and non- discriminatory tax enabled 'the common schools of the state ... to operate the full school term.' \n5\n While those engaged in interstate businesses have enjoyed the property tax reduction in common with all Washington businesses, the exemption from taxation here granted appellant forces intra-state businesses to bear the entire burden of the \n\n[305 \nU.S. 434, 444]\n\u00a0\n excise that replaced the repealed property taxes. \n6\n Only intra-state business is required to contribute under this excise to the support of the State government that affords protection to both interstate and local business. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n Appellant, a Washington corporation, serves-under a contract made in Washington-as sales agent for Washington apple growers. Its agents sell these Washington-grown apples in Washington and other States. The Washington excise tax is measured by appellant's gross income-received in Washington-and earned solely by selling apples grown in and shipped from that State. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n No other State in which appellant's agents perform sales services has imposed a similar tax upon appellant measured by any part of its gross receipts. Such an eventually-if it should occur-is given the title of 'multiple taxation.' And such conjectured 'multiple taxation' would be-it is said-a violation of that Clause of the Constitution which gives Congress power to regulate commerce among the States. Thus far, Congress has not deemed it necessary to prohibit the States from \n\n[305 \nU.S. 434, 445]\n\u00a0\n levying taxes measured by gross receipts from interstate commerce. While there are strong logical grounds upon which this Court has based its invalidation of State laws actually imposing unjust, unfair, and discriminatory burdens against interstate commerce as such,9 the same grounds do not support a judicial regulation designed to protect commerce from validly enacted non-discriminatory State taxes which do not-but may sometime-prove burdensome. With reference to the possible invalidity of another phase of this same Washington tax program by reason of conjectured future taxes of other States, this Court has said:10 'A state, for many purposes, is to be reckoned as a self-contained unit, which may frame its own system of burdens and exemptions without heeding systems elsewhere. If there are limits to that power, there is no need to mark them now. It will be time enough to mark them when a taxpayer paying in the state of origin is compelled to pay again in the state of distination.'\n So here, if national regulation to prevent 'multiple taxation' is within the constitutional power of this Court, it would seem to be time enough to consider it when appellant or some other taxpayer is actually subjected to 'multiple taxation.'\n Unless we presuppose that the conjectured tax on appellant's gross income by another State would be valid, appellant has not even shown a hypothetical possibility of injury. Certainly, Washington's law, enjoying a strong presumption of constitutionality, would not be invalidated because of apprehension that another State might lay a tax on appellant's income which is invalid and unenforceable. Any other State's tax on appellant which \n\n[305 \nU.S. 434, 446]\n\u00a0\n directly discriminates against interstate commerce, could not (together with Washington's tax) create a 'multiple burden.' This is so, because such a discriminatory tax law, standing alone, would be held to violate the Commerce Clause. \n11\n Every State has the right to utilize gross receipts as the measure of taxes which it has the power to impose. \n12\n Washington-it is admitted-had the power to tax appellant save for the possibility of 'multiple taxation.' Since 'multiple taxation' can only result if another State passes a valid, non-discriminatory tax law, two non-discriminatory State laws when combined become invalid and discriminatory under the Commerce Clause, as a result of the judgment here. This is the consequence of departing from the sound position that State laws are not invalid under the Commerce Clause unless they actually discriminate against interstate commerce or conflict with a regulation enacted by Congress.\n Appellant is here specifically exempted from Washington's nondiscriminatory 'tax for the act or privilege of engaging in business activities' in Washington because of conjectured similar taxation of appellant in othr States. However, the principles announced in the first three cases relied on by the majority13 would constitute authority for exempting appellant's agents from a tax on the privilege of engaging in the business of selling and delivering apples 'in other States to which ( appellant's) commerce extends.' These principles were there applied by this Court to invalidate taxes on the privilege of negotiating interstate sales, levied by States in which the purchasers resided. In one of the cases (Caldwell v. North \n\n[305 \nU.S. 434, 447]\n\u00a0\n Carolina, decided in 1903), this Court observed (pages 632, 633, 23 S.Ct. page 233) 'that efforts to control commerce of this kind, in the interest of the states where the purchasers reside, have been frequently made in the form of statutes and municipal ordinances, but ... such efforts have been heretofore rendered fruitless by the supervising action of this court.' (Italics supplied.) The reasoning of these three cases, however, does not support the judgment here which invalidates a privilege tax levied, not by the State where the apples were purchased, but by the State where the apples were grown, where the appellant does business, and to which all proceeds from sales made by appellant are remitted. This is especially true since the three earlier decisions assumed that a privilege tax imposed by an interstate business's State of residence (such as this Washington tax on appellant) would be valid. In Robbins v. Shelby County Taxing District, supra, at page 498, 7 S.Ct. at page 596 the Court-in explaining that the levy by the State of purchase of a tax on the privilege of selling would discriminate against out of State businesses- said: 'it is presumable, ... (that) the merchants and manufacturers of other states in the places where they reside' are taxed for their licensed businesses there. In showing that 'the tax ... (was) discriminative against the merchants and manufacturers of other states' the Court also stated that '... it not only operates as a restriction upon interstate commerce, but ... it is intended to have that effect as one of its principal objects.' Appellant's business is exempted here from a privilege tax in its State of residence, and approval is given authorities exempting such business from privilege taxes in other States where appellant's activities are carried on. Thus, these three cases stand between appellant and conjectured 'multiple taxation' in other States where its agents sell apples. The exemption of interstate business from the type of State taxation here involved is now made complete. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 434, 448]\n\u00a0\n A business engaging in activities in two or more States should bear its part of the tax burdens of each. If valid, non-discriminatory taxes imposed in these States create 'multiple' burdens, such 'burdens' result from the political subdivisions created by our form of government. They are the price paid for governmental protection and maintenance in all States where the taxpayer does business. A State's taxes are not discriminatory if the State treats those engaged in interstate and intra- state business with equality and justice. If the combined valid and non- discriminatory taxes of many States raise a problem, only Congress has power to consider that problem and to regulate with respect to it. Neither a State, nor a State with the approval of this Court, has the constitutional power to enact rules to adjust and govern conflicting State interests in interstate commerce.\n Legislative inquiry might disclose to Congress that the speculative danger of injury to interstate commerce is more than offset by the certain injury to result from depriving States of a practical method of taxation. It might appear to Congress that the adoption of a rule against State taxes measured by interstate commerce gross receipts would deprive the States of a potent weapon useful in preventing evasion of State taxes.\n This Court's rule would permit Washington to tax appellant's net income. But determination and collection of taxes on net incomes are often very difficult because corporate profits and income may be isolated or hidden by accounting methods, holding companies and intercorporate dealings. A substantial portion of the nation's commerce is carried on by corporations with far-flung business activities in many States. Intercorporate relations may assume 'their rather cumbersome and involved nature for the purpose of evading (a State) ... tax' on income and to 'remove income from the state though still creating \n\n[305 \nU.S. 434, 449]\n\u00a0\n it within the state.' \n14\n Even 'profits themselves are not susceptible of ascertainment with certainty and precision except as a result of inquiries too minute to be practicable.' \n15\n\u00a0\n\n Congress might conclude that the States should not be prohibited from utilizing nondiscriminatory gross receipts taxes for State revenues, because there are 'justifications for the gross receipts tax. ... It has greater certitude and facility of administration than the net income tax, an important consideration to taxpayer and tax gatherer alike. And the volume of transactions indicated on the taxpayer's books may bear a closer relation to the cost of governmental supervision and protection than the annual profit and loss statement.' \n16\n\u00a0\n\n Only a comprehensive survey and investigation of the entire national economy-which Congress alone has power and facilities to make-can indicate the need for, as well as justify, restricting the taxing power of a State so as to provide against conjectured taxation by more than one State on identical income. A broad and deliberate legislative investigation-which no Court can make-may indicate to Congress that a wise policy for the national economy demands that each State in which an interstate business operates be permitted to apply a non-discrimi \n\n[305 \nU.S. 434, 450]\n\u00a0\n natory tax to the gross receipts of that business either because of its size and volume or partially to offset the tendency toward centralization of the nation's business. \n17\n Congress may find that to shelter interstate commerce in a tax exempt refuge-in the manner of the judgment here-is to grant that commerce a privileged status over intra-state business, contrary to the national welfare.\n It is indicated, however, that Washington might have validly apportioned its fair share of appellant's gross income for taxation. To say that a single State can-subject to supervision and approval by this Court-enact regulations apportioning its share of the taxable income from interstate commerce, is to transfer the constitutional power to regulate such commerce from Congress to the States and Federal courts to which the Constitution gives no such power. The Constitution contemplates that Congress alone shall provide for necessary national uniformity in rules governing foreign and interstate commerce. \n18\n Rules to further free trade among the States by apportionment or division of taxes on such commerce, are regulations. Both the necessity for such a rule, and the determination and enactment of a regulation to put it into effect, call for facilities and powers possessed neither by a State nor by the courts. A State legislature attempting to put upon interstate business its apportioned share of \n\n[305 \nU.S. 434, 451]\n\u00a0\n the burden of taxation is 'faced with the impossibility of allocating specifically the profits earned by the processes conducted within' the borders of the State. \n19\n If an 'apportionment' between States of taxes on interstate business is to be made, it cannot be accomplished without national inquiry and national action.\n While some formulas for apportionment devised by States have been approved by this Court,20 others have been invalidated. \n21\n A formula applied by Connecticut was held valid,22 but a similar formula was held invalid when adopted in North Carolina. \n23\n The litigation which has followed in the wake of State attempts at apportionment has confirmed, in the opinion of many, the wisdom of the Founders in denying to the States and courts, and granting to the Congress, exclusive power over interstate commerce. Departures from this principle have, as here, left intra-state businesses-usually comparatively small-to bear the entire burden of taxes invalidated as to interstate businesses, while interstate businesses- usually conducted on a large scale-have been exempted. Should Washington attempt an apportionment, the fate of its formula would be uncertain until this Court passes upon its fairness. A State's inability to obtain necessary data and information as a basis of a formula for apportionment between itself and the other forty-seven States, indicates in advance that its apportionment might be invalidated. When State statutes of apportionment come \n\n[305 \nU.S. 434, 452]\n\u00a0\n here this Court is unable to make the broad national inquiry necessary to reach an informed conclusion on this question of economic policy.\n But Congress has both the facilities for acquiring the necessary data, and the constitutional power to act upon it. 'The power over commerce ... was one of the primary objects for which the people of America adopted their government, and must have been contemplated in forming it.' \n24\n The 'disastrous experiences under the Confederation, when the states vied in discriminatory measures against each other'25 united the Constitutional Convention in the conviction that some branch of the Federal government should have exclusive power to regulate commerce among the States and with foreign nations. Our Constitution adopted by that Convention divided the powers of government between three departments, Congress, the Executive and the Judiciary. It allotted to Congress alone the 'Power ... To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several states, .... ' Congress is the only department of our government-State or Federal- vested with authority to determine whether 'multiple taxation' is injurious to the national economy; whether national regulations for division of taxes measured by interstate commerce gross receipts should or should not be adopted; and what regulations, if any, should protect interstate commerce from 'multiple taxation.' It 'is the function of this court to interpret and apply the law already en \n\n[305 \nU.S. 434, 453]\n\u00a0\n acted, but not, under the guise of construction, to provide a more comprehensive scheme of regulation than Congress has decided upon. Nor, in the absence of Federal action, may we deny effect to the laws of the state enacted within the field which it is entitled to occupy until its authority is limited through the exertion by Congress of its paramount constitutional power.' \n26\n\u00a0\n\n Until 1936,27 this Court had never stricken down-as violating the Commerce Clause-a uniform and non-discriminatory State privilege tax measured by gross receipts, and constituting an integral element of a comprehensive State tax program. In Philadelphia & S. Mail Steamship Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n122 \nU.S. 326\n, 7 S.Ct. 1118, decided half a century ago and relied upon to support the judgment here, this Court did not determine that such a general business tax-applied to all businesses within a State-could not be measured by interstate commerce gross receipts. On the contrary, the Court pointed out that the invalidated tax was 'a tax on transportation only' (page 345, 7 S.Ct. page 1124), and that even one engaged in transportation could 'like any other citizen, ... be personally taxed for the amount of his property or estate, without regard to the source from which it was derived, whether from commerce or banking or any other employment.' That, as the Court made clear, was 'an entirely different thing from laying a special tax upon his receipts in a particular employment.' (page 342, 7 S.Ct. page 1123) Since the Philadelphia & S. Mail Steamship Co. Case, this Court has sustained many State taxes measured by receipts both from interstate and intra-state commerce. \n28\n It was not until the decisions in the cases of Crew Levick Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n245 \nU.S. 292, 296\n, 38 S.Ct. 126, 128, and United States \n\n[305 \nU.S. 434, 454]\n\u00a0\n Glue Co. v. Oak Creek, \n247 \nU.S. 321, 329\n, 38 S.Ct. 499, 501, Ann.Cas.1918E, 748, decided 1917 and 1918, respectively, that this Court first tentatively announced, by way of dicta, a rule condemning State taxes based on gross receipts from interstate commerce. The full-blown rule under which the Federal courts strike down generally applied non- discriminatory State taxes measured by gross receipts from interstate commerce ripened into its present expanded form only eight months ago ( Adams Manufacturing Co. v. Storen, supra, May 16, 1938). This recent judicial restriction-still less than a year old-on the power of the States to levy general gross receipts taxes, cannot be justified or validated by claiming prestige from advanced age.\n Since the Constitution grants sole and exclusive power to Congress to regulate commerce among the States, repeated assumption of this power by the courts-even over a long period of years-could not make this assumption of power constitutional. April 25, 1938, this Court overruled and renounced an unconstitutional assumption of power by the Federal courts based on a doctrine extending back through an unbroken line of authority to 1842.29 In overruling, it was said: 'We merely declare that in applying the doctrine (declared unconstitutional) this Court and the lower courts have invaded rights which in our opinion are reserved by the Constitution to the several states.' At page 80, 58 S.Ct. at page 823. A century old rule had produced 'injustice and confusion' and 'the unconstitutionality of the course pursued ... (had become) clear ....' Pages 77, 78, 58 S. Ct. page 822. That decision rested upon the sound principle that the rule of stare decisis cannot confer powers upon the courts which the inexorable command of the Constitution says they shall not have. State obedience to an unconstitutional assumption of power by the judicial branch of government, \n\n[305 \nU.S. 434, 455]\n\u00a0\n and inaction by the Congress, cannot amend the Constitution by creating and establishing a new 'feature of our constitutional system.' No provision of the Constitution authorizes its amendment in this manner.\n It is as essential today, as at the time of the adoption of the Constitution, that commerce among the States and with foreign nations be left free from discriminatory and retaliatory burdens imposed by the States. It is of equal importance, however, that the judicial department of our government scrupulously observe its constitutional limitations and that Congress alone should adopt a broad national policy of regulation-if otherwise valid State laws combine to hamper the free flow of commerce. Doubtless, much confusion would be avoided if the courts would refrain from restricting the enforcement of valid, nondiscriminatory State tax laws. Any belief that Congress has failed to take cognizance of the problems of conjectured 'multiple taxation' or 'apportionment' by exerting its exclusive power over interstate commerce, is an inadequate reason for the judicial branch of government-without constitutional power-to attempt to perform the duty constitutionally reposed in Congress. I would return to the rule that-except for State acts designed to impose discriminatory burdens on interstate commerce because it is interstate-Congress alone must 'determine how far (interstate commerce) ... shall be free and untrammelled, how far it shall be burdened by duties and imposts, and how far it shall be prohibited.' \n30\n\u00a0\n\n For these and other reasons set out elsewhere31 I believe the judgment of the Supreme Court of Washington should be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Henneford v.

STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE(1939)\nNo. 295\nArgued: January 3, 1939Decided: January 30, 1939\n\n\n\n\n[306 \nU.S. 79, 80]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Richard F. Upton, of Concord, N.H., for appellant.\n Messrs. Dudley W. Orr, of Concord, N.H., and John E. Benton, of Washington, D.C., for the State of New Hampshire.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n A statute of New Hampshire1 declares unlawful the operation on its roads of motor vehicles for specified transportation by drivers who have been continuously on duty for more than 12 hours. By this appeal we are called on to decide whether, as applied in this case,  3, 4, and 8 are repugnant to the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S. C.A. Const. and whether  8 and 11 \n\n[306 \nU.S. 79, 81]\n\u00a0\n were superseded by the federal Motor Carrier Act, 1935,  204,2 and regulations prescribed under it by the Interstate Commerce Commission.\n The New Hampshire Act declares that the number of motor vehicles operated by carriers for hire has made regulation necessary to the end that its highways may be safer for use by the general public.  1. It requires common and contract carriers between points within the State to register their trucks with the public service commission.  2. Contract carriers include those, other than common carriers, who haul for hire by motor vehicle on any road of the State.  3. Exempted from the challenged regulation are those transporting products of their own manufacture or labor ( 3), and motor vehicles not principally engaged in the transportation of property for hire or operating exclusively in a city or town or within 10 miles of its limits or beyond the 10-mile limit on not more than two trips in 30 days.  4.\n Section 8 declares that 'It shall be unlawful for any driver to operate, or for the owner thereof to require or permit any driver to operate, any motor vehicle for the transportation of property for hire on the highways of this state when the driver has been continuously on duty for more than twelve hours, and after a driver has been continuously on duty for twelve hours it shall be unlawful for him or for the owner of the vehicle to permit him to operate any such motor vehicle on the highways of this state until he shall have had at least eight consecutive hours off duty.' Section 11 provides that for violations of the Act the commission shall have authority after notice and hearing, to suspend or revoke any registration certificate.\n Appellant is a Massachusetts corporation doing intrastate and interstate business as a common and contract \n\n[306 \nU.S. 79, 82]\n\u00a0\n carrier of freight for hire by motor vehicles over public highways in that State and in New Hampshire. Approximately 99 per cent of its business is interstate. It has terminals at Boston in Massachusetts, and at Manchester, Concord, and Claremont in New Hampshire. In 1937 it obtained from the New Hampshire commission registration certificates for 20 trucks. After notice and hearing, the commission, in a decision filed as of December 11, 1937, held appellant had violated the provisions of  8 and ordered that its certificates be suspended for five days. Appellant appealed to the state supreme court. That court upheld the challenged provisions and dismissed the appeal. 89 N.H. 428, 199 A. 886.\n\n 1. \nSections 3, 4, and 8 are not repugnant to the equal protection clause. The state court found that the purpose of  8 is 'to protect the users of the highways of this state from the danger likely to result to them from the operation thereon of trucks under the control of drivers suffering from the effects of fatigue.' (page 889.) Appellant's contention is that the discrimination between drivers of motor carriers for hire subject to  8 and those exempted by  3 and 4, has no fair or substantial relation to highway safety. It suggests, and we may assume, that the roads of New Hampshire are extensively used for transportation by trucks not regulated by  8; that drivers of them are just as susceptible to fatigue from long hours of continuous operation as are those operating the trucks used by appellant and other common carriers for hire, and that the dangers attributable to fatigued drivers are the same in one class of service as in another. Appellant has failed to show that, in operations to which  8 applies, continuous driving for more than 12 hours is not so much more prevalent than in those exempted ( 3, 4) as to constitute a reasonable basis for the differentiation. We are of opinion that, for reasons given above, those stated by the state supreme court in this case and by \n\n[306 \nU.S. 79, 83]\n\u00a0\n this Court in Dixie Ohio Express Co. v. Georgia Comm., \n306 \nU.S. 72\n, 59 S. Ct. 435, 83 L.Ed. --, decided this day, the classification in question does not conflict with the rule of equal protection.\n\n 2. \nAs applicable to the violations of the state law found to have been committed by appellant,  8 and 11 were not superseded by the federal Motor Carrier Act, 1935, 49 U.S.C.A.  301 et seq., or the regulations made under it by the Interstate Commerce Commission.\n That Act became law August 9, 1935. Under the caption 'General Duties and Powers of the Commission',  204(a), 49 U.S.C.A.  304(a), declares: 'It shall be the duty of the Commission ... to regulate' common and contract carriers by 'motor vehicle ... and to that end the Commission may establish reasonable requirements with respect to ... qualifications and maximum hours of service of employees, and safety of operation and equipment.' By order made under authority of that section December 29, 1937, the Commission prescribed regulations as to maximum hours of service of drivers of motor vehicles operated in interstate commerce by common and contract carriers. \n3\n These regulations were modified July 12, 19384 and their effective date has been postponed to January 31, 1939.5 With exceptions that need not be stated here, they declare that no common carrier shall permit or require any driver to remain on duty for more than 60 hours a week or more than 10 hours in any period of 24 consecutive hours. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n Appellant does not suggest that prior to congressional action the State was without power, for protection of persons and property, to regulate use of its roads as provided in  8, and to enforce obedience in accordance with  11. Cooley v. Board of Wardens, 12 How. 299, 320; \n\n[306 \nU.S. 79, 84]\n\u00a0\n Smith v. Alabama, \n124 \nU.S. 465\n, 8 S.Ct. 564; Cleveland &c. Ry. Co. v. Illinois, \n177 \nU.S. 514\n, 20 S.Ct. 722. The violations for which the state commission suspended appellant's registration certificates occurred after the effective date of the federal Act and before the Interstate Commerce Commission made its order. Without so deciding, we assume, so far as concerns the periods of continuous service condemned by the state commission, that when the federal regulations take effect they will operate to supersede the challenged provisions of the state statute. Then, the sole question is whether Congress intended that from the time of the federal enactment until effective action by the Commission, there should be no regulation of periods of continuous operation by drivers of motor vehicles hauling in interstate commerce. Our decisions provide no formula for discovering implied effect of federal statutes upon state measures such as that under consideration. Here, the way is made clear by the language and context considered in connection with existing conditions. Section 204(a) definitely imposes upon the Commission the duty to 'regulate' but merely authorizes it to establish reasonable requirements with respect to, inter alia, qualifications and maximum hours of service of employees and safety of operation and equipment. The distinction intended between duty imposed and action permitted is more striking in view of the matters that, along with qualifications and hours of service of drivers, are committed to the discretion of the Commission. They include transportation of baggage and express, uniform systems of accounts, records, and reports, and preservation of records.\n The roads belong to the State. There is need of local supervision of operation of motor vehicles to prevent collisions, to safeguard pedestrians, and the like. Unquestionably, reasonable regulation of periods of continuous driving is an appropriate measure. In view of the \n\n[306 \nU.S. 79, 85]\n\u00a0\n efforts of governmental authorities everywhere to mitigate the destruction of life, limb and property resulting from the use of motor vehicles, it cannot be inferred that Congress intended to supersede any state safety measure prior to the taking effect of a federal measure found suitable to put in its place. Its purpose to displace the local law must be definitely expressed. Mintz v. Baldwin, \n289 \nU.S. 346, 350\n, 53 S.Ct. 611, 613. The rule applicable is clearly stated in Illinois Cent. R.R. Co. v. Public Utilities Comm., \n245 \nU.S. 493, 510\n, 38 S.Ct. 170, 176. 'In construing federal statutes enacted under the power conferred by the commerce clause of the Constitution ... it should never be held that Congress intends to supersede or suspend the exercise of the reserved powers of a state, even where that may be done, unless, and except so far as, its purpose to do so is clearly manifested.' We have frequently applied that principle. See e.g. Reid v. Colorado, \n187 \nU.S. 137, 148\n, 23 S. Ct. 92, 96. Missouri Pacific Ry. v. Larabee Mills, \n211 \nU.S. 612\n, 621 et seq., 29 S.Ct. 214, 217; Missouri, Kansas & Texas Ry. Co. of Texas v.

In each, the facts differ so widely from those of the case before us that no discussion is required to show that it is not in point.\n Plainly Congress by mere grant of power to the Interstate Commerce Commission did not intend to supersede state police regulations established for the protection of the public using state highways.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Laws 1933, c. 106, as amended by c. 169. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 49 Stat. 546, 49 U.S.C.  304, 49 U.S.C.A.  304. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] 3 M.C.C. 665. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] Ex Parte No. MC-2, July 12, 1938. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] Ex Parte No. MC-2, December 22, 1938. \n[\nFootnote 6\n] Ex parte No. MC-2, July 12, 1938 (Rule 3(a) and (b)). \n\n\n\n\n","51":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nH.P.

Merrill, of Skowhegan, Me., for petitioners H. P. Hood & Sons and others.\n\n\n\n[307 \nU.S. 588, 590]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John M. Raymond, of Boston, Mass., and John W. Redmond, of Newport, Vt., for petitioner Whiting Milk Co.\n Mr. Robert H. Jackson, Sol. Gen., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These cases involve the constitutionality of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 19371 as applied in an order of the Secretary of Agriculture regulating the handling of milk in the Greater Boston, Massachusetts, Marketing Area.\n The petitioners, H. P. Hood & Sons, Inc., and Noble's Milk Company of No. 772 and Whiting Milk Company of No. 809, original defendants below, are engaged in handling milk in the marketing area in the current of interstate commerce or in a manner which burdens that commerce. Producers intervened as defendants, petitioner E. Frank Branon on the side of H. P. Hood & Sons and Chester D. Noyes beside the Whiting Company. The respondents, plaintiffs below, are the United States of America and the Secretary of Agriculture. The parties will be referred to as defendants and plaintiffs, respectively.\n It is unnecessary to detail the facts of each case. They are two of many instituted by the plaintiffs to secure obedience to the Order. On October 1, 1937, bills of complaint were filed in the District Court for the District of Massachusetts, 21 F.Supp. 321, for the purpose of enjoining Hood & Sons, Noble's Milk Company and \n\n[307 \nU.S. 588, 591]\n\u00a0\n Whiting Milk Company from violating the terms of Order No. 4 as amended. A temporary mandatory injunction issued on November 30, 1937. A supersedeas followed soon after, conditioned upon payment by the three handlers into the registry of the court of the amounts billed to them by the Market Administrator for equalization charges and marketing services under the Order. Answers to the bills asserted constitutional infirmities in the Act and fatal weaknesses in the Order as amended. A Special Master was charged with the duty of finding the facts in these and similar suits. His report was filed on January 27, 1939. Shortly thereafter, the District Court confirmed the report, sustained both the Act and the Order, and entered a decree for the plaintiffs. 26 F.Supp. 672. The defendants took an appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals and, after the cases were docketed, filed petitions for writs of certiorari. The writs were granted because important questions of Federal law undecided by this Court were involved and pending appeals in other cases with similar issues were ready for argument. \n306 \nU.S. 627\n, 59 S.Ct. 647, 83 L.Ed. --; \n306 \nU.S. 629\n, 59 S.Ct. 791, 83 L.Ed. --.\n The pertinent provisions of the Marketing Act have been summarized in United States v.

They will not be repeated here.\n Order No. 4, as amended, which the plaintiffs seek to enforce, is the culmination of an extended effort by the Secretary to work out a plan to regulate the marketing of milk in the Boston area. Order No. 4 was originally issued on February 7, 1936, under the Agricultural Adjustment Act. \n2\n All steps leading to its issuance were taken. On November 30, 1935, the Secretary gave notice of a public hearing on a proposed marketing agreement and order. Hearings were held. A marketing agreement was tentatively approved which handlers failed to accept. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 588, 592]\n\u00a0\n On January 25, 1936, the Secretary found and proclaimed that the purchasing power of milk could not be satisfactorily determined for the pre-war base period from available statistics in the Department of Agriculture, but could for the post-war period. August, 1919, to July, 1929, was declared the base period for the purpose of issuing an order. On February 5, 1936, the Secretary made a determination, as required by Section 8c(9), as to the necessity for issuing an order. The President approved the determination, and the Order issued. It remained in effect until August 1, 1936, shortly after the District Court for the District of Massachusetts held that the Act under which the Order was issued was unconstitutional. \n3\n On that day the Secretary suspended the Order for an indefinite time.\n After the passage of the Marketing Act, the Secretary, on June 24, 1937, gave notice of a hearing upon proposed amendments to Order No. 4. On the following day he terminated the suspension of the formal and administrative provisions as of July 1, and of the price-fixing provisions as of August 1. Hearings were held. A proposed marketing agreement failed of approval by the handlers. On July 17, 1937, a referendum took place. It will be discussed later at some length because of contentions which question its validity. On July 27, 1937, acting pursuant to Section 8c(9), the Secretary determined that the failure of the handlers to sign tended to prevent effectuation of the declared policy of the Act; that issuance of the proposed amendments to the Order was the only practical means of advancing the interests of milk producers in the area; and that the issuance was approved by over 70 percent of the producers who during May, 1937, were engaged in the production of milk for sale in the area. The President approved the determina- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 588, 593]\n\u00a0\n tion. On July 28, 1937, 'Order No. 4, Amendment No. 1' issued. In it the Secretary made findings upon the evidence introduced at the hearings upon the proposed amendments and ratified the original findings in so far as they were not in conflict with the new ones. He made no finding or proclamation, as he had in the original Order, that satisfactory statistics were not available for the pre-war period but were for the post- war period. It is not disputed that the latter was used as the base period for the purpose of computing the prices to be used in the amended Order.\n This amended Order is based upon the same principles discussed in United States v. Rock Royal Co-operative, \n307 \nU.S. 533\n, 59 S.Ct. 993, 83 L. Ed. --, and companion cases, decided today. It establishes a comprehensive scheme for the regulation of milk handled in interstate or foreign commerce in an area which includes Boston and 36 other cities or towns. A Market Administrator, appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture, is in charge. Producers and handlers are defined, the first as any person producing milk in conformity with the health regulations applicable to milk sold for consumption as milk in the marketing area, the second as all, including producers or associations of producers, who engage 'in such handling of milk, which is sold as milk or cream in the Marketing Area, as is in the current of interstate commerce or which directly burdens, obstructs or affects interstate or foreign commerce in milk and its products.'\n There are two use classifications, roughly, fluid and non-fluid. A price is stated for Class I or fluid milk; a formula, based primarily on the price of cream in Boston and casein in New York, is provided for the calculation of the Class II price for each delivery period. Minimum prices determine the value of all the milk delivered by all producers to all the handlers subject to the Order. Except to associations of producers for Class I milk, pay- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 588, 594]\n\u00a0\n ment to producers is made at a blended price. The Administrator computes the value of milk for each handler by multiplying the quantities used by him in each class by the class price, and by adding the two results. Then the values for all handlers are combined into one total. Adjustments are made for differentials. The adjusted total is divided by the total quantity of milk. The result is a weighted average price somewhere between the two class prices, known as the 'blended price.' Each handler pays his producers at the blended price. The amount paid to producers may be less, or it may be more, than the value of the milk sold by the handler. Equalization is made among handlers. As the Order puts it, after paying his own producers, each handler pays 'To producers, through the Market Administrator, by paying to or receiving from the Market Administrator, as the case may be, the amount by which payments made ... are less than, or exceed, the value of milk as required to be computed for such handler. ... '\n The defendants urge that the decree of the District Court should be reversed because of error under the Constitution, under the statute, under the Order itself. It is contended that the equalization provisions of the amended Order violate the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, U.S.C. A.Const.; that the price fixing features of the Act and Order constitute an invalid exercise of the power to regulate commerce and an invasion of the powers reserved to the states under the Tenth Amendment;4 and that the Act involves delegation of legislative power. The amendments to the Order are said to be void because an essential finding required by the statute is lacking. The referendum among producers is assailed as improperly conducted. And the defendants in No. 772 raise the point that the Market Administrator failed to comply with the provisions of the amended Order. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 588, 595]\n\u00a0\n Constitutionality. There is nothing to be added to the discussion of the constitutionality of the Act in United States v. Rock Royal Cooperative, \n307 \nU.S. 533\n, 59 S.Ct. 993, 83 L.Ed. --, decided today. The discussion there of the validity of the amended Order, in so far as similar issues are raised in this case, is also determinative.\n Order Amended without Finding as to Base Period. Order No. 4, as amended, is the controlling regulation in these cases. As authorized by Section 8e5 it used a post-war period as the base period to determine prices. The finding and proclamation by the Secretary as to the absence of statistics for the pre-war period, available for use, were made for the original issue of Order No. 4 but not for the amendments. Section 8c(17) makes certain sections, including 8e, applicable to amendments of orders. It reads thus: 'The provisions of this section, section 8d (608d), and section 8e (608e of this title) applicable to orders shall be applicable to amendments to orders. ...' Defendants contend that this requires a finding and proclamation under Section 8e each time an order which includes a post-war base period is amended in any particular.\n Ordinarily the base period of Section 2 is to be used. It is only after a finding that the purchasing power of the commodity during the period fixed in Section 2 cannot be satisfactorily determined from available statistics of the Department of Agriculture that the Secretary by Section 8e \n\n[307 \nU.S. 588, 596]\n\u00a0\n is authorized to find and proclaim the post-war base period. By Section 8c( 1) the Secretary is authorized to issue 'and from time to time amend' orders. Obviously, as a general clause to make all the provisions of sections 8c, 8d and 8e applicable to amendments, Section 8c(17) was adopted. Without it questions would have been pertinent as to the applicability to amended orders of various provisions in these sections. Doubt would arise as to the power to change the base period after it was once determined. There would seem to be no occasion to review the absence of satisfactory statistics, however, on a proposed amendment which does not involve any change in the base period. The requirement for finding and proclamation in adopting a base period is not intended to force the Secretary to go through a meaningless ritual. A determination of the necessity of using the post-war base period once made and proclaimed satisfies the conditions of sections 8c(17) and 8e for amendments, so long as no amendment is made which involves a change in the base period. This has been the administrative construction6 where amendments have been made to orders which had utilized a post-war base period. The plaintiffs show this by a series of references to the Federal Register which are not challenged. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n[307 \nU.S. 588, 597]\n\u00a0\n Validity of the Referendum. The referendum is challenged as conducted contrary to the terms of the Act. Section 8c(9)(B) authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to issue an order, notwithstanding the failure of handlers to approve a marketing agreement, if he makes certain determinations, one of them that the issuance is approved by at least two- thirds of the producers who, during a representative period, 'have been engaged in the production of such commodity for sale in the marketing area . ...'8 Under Section 8c(19) the Secretary 'may conduct a referendum among producers' to ascertain whether two-thirds approve. He restricted voting in the referendum under scrutiny to producers who had delivered milk to a station approved for the shipment of milk to the marketing area and which had shipped milk or cream to the marketing area during the representative period.\n It is said that the Secretary by this restriction disregarded the language of the statute as to producers eligible to vote and that the ballot was either accorded to producers not entitled to vote or denied to qualified producers. Specifically, the following errors are urged: (1) A large number of southern and western producers who delivered to stations shipping cream were not permitted to vote. (2) Many New England or Eastern New York producers voted who delivered to handlers at plants which shipped only cream in the representative period. (3) Many voted who produced milk on farms as to which no certificate of registration had been issued, as required by Sections 16A and 16C of the Massachusetts milk law. \n9\n (4) A number of approving producers delivered milk to stations which shipped less than 50 percent of their product to the Boston area. (5) Cooperatives cast votes in favor of the \n\n[307 \nU.S. 588, 598]\n\u00a0\n amendments to the Order solely through ballots cast by their boards of directors. Inclusion of the southern and western shippers of cream or elimination of any one of the remaining groups might have changed the result of the referendum.\n It does not seem profitable to expand each of the contentions of the defendants. The question is simply whether the statute was followed. It seems to us that it was.\n The Act does not supply the Secretary with detailed directions as to the manner of holding a referendum. Its language is general. The Secretary 'may conduct a referendum among producers.' \n10\n What producers? Those 'engaged in the production of (milk) for sale in the marketing area. ...' 11 Every producer who voted was so engaged. Each delivered milk to the plant of a handler licensed12 to distribute and sell fluid milk in the marketing area. The Order is aimed at the handling of milk marketed in the area. The problems to be solved are those engendered by the necessary, yet troublesome, surplus of fluid milk. Every handler to whom the voters delivered contributed to that surplus.\n The milk of the southern and western producers outside the milkshed could not be sent into the marketing area in fluid form, for their handlers were not licensed to sell milk in the area. The station in Indiana, used in the hearings as illustrative of the situation, held a license for the emergency shipments of sweet cream only. The exclusion of the southern and western producers, therefore, was proper. They are located outside the Boston milkshed; they do not produce any part of the burdensome surplus of fluid milk. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 588, 599]\n\u00a0\n There was no error in permitting the remaining groups of producers to vote. That some handlers to whom voting producers delivered milk shipped only cream during the representative period is immaterial. The farmers, it was found, cannot tell when they bring in their milk whether it will be sold by the handlers as milk or cream. As these handlers could have sent the fluid milk to the area, and in most instances did, at times other than the representative period, the milk delivered to them was a potential part of the surplus. The producers who lacked certificates of registration were properly included. Their milk was sold in the area by licensed handlers. \n13\n Nor can it make any difference that less than 50 percent of the milk of some stations was shipped the marketing area during the representative period. There is nothing in the Act that compels adopting 50 percent as determinative. It was enough that the handlers of these producers did send some part, and could have sent all.\n Two cooperatives voted for their members in favor of the amendments to the Order. \n14\n No poll was taken of the individual producer members. Nor was there any subsequent approval by them of the action taken on their behalf by the cooperatives. Section 8c(12) directs the Secretary to consider the approval or disapproval of cooperatives as the approval or disapproval of members. This is complete authority for the action of the Secretary. He need not require further referendums by cooperatives themselves. Presumably they will vote with an eye to the best interest of their members.\n Violation of Order. The decree directs the defendants to pay to the Market Administrator for distribution to the producers through the equalization fund the amounts \n\n[307 \nU.S. 588, 600]\n\u00a0\n which he had billed to them under the Order. The defendants H. P. Hood & Sons and Noble's Milk Company contend that the bills include in their computation milk plainly excluded by the terms of the Order because the product of dairies without the certificates of registration required by Massachusetts General Laws, (Ter. Ed.) Chapter 94, Sections, 16A et seq. Under these sections no person may sell milk known to have been produced on unregistered farms. It is not disputed that milk from such farms figured in the operation of the equalization pool. The explanation of the plaintiffs is that the Order covers this milk.\n The Administrator seeks payment on the basis of all milk received by licensed handlers for use in the Marketing Area. It was found that milk received at a country plant was included in the computation if the Administrator knew the plant was approved for shipment of fluid milk by a city or town of the marketing area. By statute handlers are required to have a license to handle milk in any town where an inspector of milk is appointed and a permit from the local board of health,15 and they must register with the director of the dairying division of the state department of agriculture. \n16\n\u00a0\n\n As the action of handlers forms the ground for the initiation of regulation under the Act17 and for classification, re- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 588, 601]\n\u00a0\n ports, calculation and payment under the Order,18 we conclude that the milk received by handlers for use in the area is the proper basis of computation. True, the reports are based on the delivery of milk by defined producers but in view of the terms of the Order as a whole, \n\n[307 \nU.S. 588, 602]\n\u00a0\n we are of the opinion the milk from unregistered farms must also be reported. The Act and Order regulate marketing. In violating the state health laws by knowingly selling milk from unregistered farms, producers and handlers may risk prosecution by the Massachusetts authorities. Nevertheless, the handlers must conform to the Order. It is the milk handled, not the milk produced, which is determinative. The Administrator was justified in using milk received at an approved plant for computation. It may be added that under the state and town regulations the municipalities in the marketing area, through their control over licenses and permits, have the power to supervise the handlers to see that they comply with the law forbidding sales from unlicensed farms. \n19\n\u00a0\n\n The further contention is made that the Secretary failed to make a finding as to the tendency of the rein \n\n[307 \nU.S. 588, 603]\n\u00a0\n statement of the original Order to effectuate the policy of the Act. This is conceded. The Order was reinstated in part as of July 1, 1937. It was thereafter amended after hearings and on July 28, 1937, the Order as amended was promulgated with the finding 'That the issuance of the amendment to the order and all of the terms and conditions of the order, as amended, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the act.' We are of the view that this finding cured any omission, if such a finding prior to reinstatement were necessary, as to which we express no opinion. While Order No. 4 was partly in effect prior to this amendment, the finding covered the entire Order No. 4 as amended, and the language of the Order promulgating the amendments is an approval of Order No. 4 as amended, as tending to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.\n Other contentions are made which have been considered but they do not seem to require any statement.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS.\n I regret that I cannot concur in the Court's disposition of these cases. I find it unnecessary to consider whether the order complied with the terms of the Act or whether the Act or the order deprived the appellees of their property without due process. I am of opinion that the Act unconstitutionally delegates legislative power to the Secretary of Agriculture.\n Valid delegation is limited to the execution of a law. If power is delegated to make a law, or to refrain from making it, or to determine what the law shall command or prohibit, the delegation ignores and transgresses the Constitutional division of power between the legislative and the executive branches of the government.\n In my view the Act vests in the Secretary authority to determine, first, what of a number of enumerated com- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 588, 604]\n\u00a0\n modities shall be regulated; second, in what areas the commodity shall be regulated; third, the period of regulation, and, fourth, the character of regulation to be imposed and, for these reasons, cannot be sustained.\n The statute is an attempted delegation to an executive officer of authority to impose regulations within supposed limits and according to supposed standards so vague as in effect to invest him with uncontrolled power of legislation. Congress has not directed that the marketing of milk shall be regulated. Congress has not directed that regulation shall be imposed throughout the United States or in any specified portion thereof. It has left the choice of both locations and areas to the Secretary. Congress has not provided that regulation anywhere shall become effective at any specified date, or remain effective for any specified period. Congress has permitted such a variety of forms of regulation as to invest the Secretary with a choice of discrete systems each having the characteristics of an independent and complete statute.\n Section 8c(2) provides that the Secretary may make orders in respect of eight specified agricultural products. It embodies no directions as to the specific conditions which shall move him to issue orders affecting each of the named commodities. The same section permits and promulgation of orders applicable to specified regions. It omits any restriction or direction as to the size or location of the area to be affected by a regional order. It leaves the Secretary free to determine when regulation shall become effective, when it shall be terminated throughout the United States or in any portion thereof.\n The supposed standards by which the Secretary is to be governed turn out, upon examination, to be no standards whatever. All of the choices mentioned are, according to the Act, to be made if the Secretary has reason \n\n[307 \nU.S. 588, 605]\n\u00a0\n to believe, or finds, that his proposed action will 'tend to effectuate the declared policy' of the Act. \n*\n\u00a0\n\n We turn, therefore, to Sec. 2, which declares the policy of the Congress to be: 'Through the exercise of the powers conferred upon the Secretary of Agriculture under this title (chapter), to establish and maintain such orderly marketing conditions for agricultural commodities in interstate commerce as will establish prices to farmers at a level that will give agricultural commodities a purchasing power with respect to articles that farmers buy, equivalent to the purchasing power of agricultural commodities in the base period', which base period is defined as a period of years antedating the passage of the Act. The section further declares the policy to be worked out through the Secretary to be 'To protect the interest of the consumer by (a) approaching the level of prices which it is declared to be the policy of Congress to establish in subsection (1) of this section by gradual correction of the current level at as rapid a rate as the Secretary of Agriculture deems to be in the public interest and feasible in view of the current consumptive demand in domestic and foreign markets, and (b) authorizing no action under this title which has for its purpose the maintenance of prices to farmers above the level which it is declared to be the policy of Congress to establish in subsection (1) of this section.'\n Assuming that any of these proposed ends or aims were in themselves capable of reasonable definition, it is, nevertheless, evident that the Secretary is to form a judgment by balancing a price raising policy against a consumer- protection policy, according to his views of feasibility and public interest.\n If then the separate objects to be attained were matters susceptible of a definite finding there would still be \n\n[307 \nU.S. 588, 606]\n\u00a0\n the inescapable result that, after such definite finding as to each proposed aim, there must be an exercise of judgment as to the extent to which that aim should be accomplished in the light of other and conflicting aims. And there would still remain the fact that the conclusion might be against any regulation by reason of the Secretary's restrained judgment that, in the circumstances, regulation is not 'feasible.'\n Enough has been said to show that a law is to come into being on the basis of the Secretary's sole judgment as to its probable effect upon the milk industry, its probable effect upon the consumer, its probable consonance with the public interest, and its feasibility. The resolution of all such problems is of the essence of law making.\n But if, as the Act discloses, the supposed standards whereby the Secretary is to ascertain the elements which are to determine his ultimate decision are themselves so vague that neither he nor anyone can accurately apply them, the unlimited nature of the delegation becomes even clearer.\n The first thing the Secretary is permitted to accomplish by regulation, so the statute declares, is the parity in purchasing power of the price to be received by producers with that received in the base period. This parity is to be in terms of things farmers purchase. A moment's reflection will show that any calculation of such parity is impossible. The things farmers purchase, the relative quantities in which they purchase them, and their price in terms of milk, vary from month to month and from year to year. Moreover, the Secretary is not to establish a parity between two past periods but is to regulate the industry in such fashion as will, in his opinion, produce for the future a parity of the purchasing power of milk with its purchasing power in the base period. The Secretary's conclusion must lie in the realm of hope or opinion and not in that of ascertained fact. The major objective of \n\n[307 \nU.S. 588, 607]\n\u00a0\n the Act is in truth to raise prices paid farmers for milk. The upward limit is really left to the Secretary's uncontrolled discretion.\n Turn now to another alleged standard which is to control the Secretary's action. He is not to raise prices so fast as to injure the interest of the consumer but is to raise them gradually by correction of the current level at as rapid a rate as he deems to be in the public interest and feasible in view of consumptive demand. It is fair to ask whether this constitutes a standard at all. What is the public interest? Must not Congress ascertain and declare it? What is feasible in the way of regulation? Is not this a matter for legislative judgment? How is anyone to tell whether the Secretary has disobeyed the mandate of Congress in these respects?\n There is in the Act a further delegation of power. Congress might, although committing to the Secretary's will and judgment the matters above enumerated, have directed him how to regulate the industry if he determined so to do. It might have considered the possible modes of regulation and provided which of them the Secretary should adopt. The Act does not such thing. It leaves to the Secretary the choice of different and mutually exclusive methods of control.\n Section 8c(5) applies to orders affecting milk and its products. Section 8c(7) refers to orders affecting any of the commodities named in the Act. The first requires that any order affecting milk must contain one, and may contain others, of seven specified conditions. The second requires that in any order there must be included one, and there may be included others, of four conditions. These sections give the Secretary the choice of three independent programs for raising the price of milk, namely, bargaining with handlers, stabilizing the retail price, or fixing prices to be paid producers. Within each, variation of the widest sort is allowed. Moreover, the Act permits alternative schemes for distributing amongst the \n\n[307 \nU.S. 588, 608]\n\u00a0\n producers the dollar value of milk sold in the area to which the Secretary's order applies. The differences between the permissible schemes are not matters of mere detail but are basic and fundamental.\n In respect of the choice of method, the only guide is the declaration of policy embodied in Section 2. If the Secretary is of opinion that one method is more likely to raise prices than another he is at liberty to put into the form of an order what is tantamount to a statute prescribing the method of his choice. Thus the Secretary is to decide not only whether there is to be a law but, as well, the nature of the law to be enacted.\n What was said concerning unconstitutional delegation of legislative power in Panama Refining Company v. Ryan, \n293 \nU.S. 388\n, 55 S.Ct. 241, and Schecter Poultry Corp. v. United States, \n295 \nU.S. 495\n, 55 S. Ct. 837, 97 A.L.R. 947, applies with equal force here. Comparison of the provisions of the Act respecting flue-cured tobacco, which are summarized in Mulford v. Smith, \n307 \nU.S. 38\n, 59 S.Ct. 648, 83 L. Ed. --, of the present Term, with those applicable to milk, will disclose the fundamental difference between the administrative character of the powers delegated in the case of tobacco and the legislative character of those delegated in the case of milk. No authority cited by the Government presents a situation comparable to that here disclosed. It would not be profitable to analyze each of the cases because in each the question of the nature of the statutory standard and its application in the administration of the statute involved depended upon the field which the legislation covers. Where delegation has been sustained the court has been careful to point out the circumstances which made it possible to prescribe a standard by which administrative action was confined and directed. Such a standard, as respects milk marketing, is lacking in the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937\n\n\n I think that the decree should be reversed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice BUTLER join in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act of June 3, 1937, 50$Stat. 246, 7 U.S.C.A.  601 et seq. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Act of May 12, 1933, 48 Stat. 31, as amended August 24, 1935, 49 Stat. 750, 7 U.S.C.A.  601 et seq. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] United States v.

Charles Hershenstein, Edward J. O'Mara, and James A. Hamill, all of Jersey City, N.J., for petitioners.\n Messrs. Morris L. Ernst. of New York City, and Spaulding Frazer, of Newark, N.J., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER:\n The judgment of the court in this case is that the decree is modified and as modified affirmed. Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER and Mr. Justice DOUGLAS took no part in the consideration or decision of the case. Mr. Justice ROBERTS has an opinion in which Mr. Justice BLACK concurs, and Mr. Justice STONE an opinion in which Mr. Justice REED concurs. The CHIEF JUSTICE concurs in an opinion. Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice BUTLER dissent for reasons stated in opinions by them respectively.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered an opinion in which Mr. Justice BLACK concurred.\n We granted certiorari as the case presents important questions in respect of the asserted privilege and immunity of citizens of the United States to advocate action pursuant to a federal statute, by distribution of printed matter and oral discussion in peaceable assembly; and the jurisdiction of federal courts of suits to restrain the abridgment of such privilege and immunity.\n The respondents individual citizens, unincorporated labor organizations composed of such citizens and a mem- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 496, 501]\n\u00a0\n bership corporation, brought suit in the United States District Court against the petitioners, the Mayor, the Director of Public Safety, and the Chief of Police of Jersey City, New Jersey, and the Board of Commissioners, the governing body of the city.\n The bill alleges that acting under a city ordinance forbidding the leasing of any hall, without a permit from the Chief of Police, for a public meeting at which a speaker shall advocate obstruction of the Government of the United States or a state, or a change of government by other than lawful means, the petitioners, and their subordinates, have denied respondents the right to hold lawful meetings in Jersey City on the ground that they are Communists or Communist organizations; that pursuant to an unlawful plan, the petitioners have caused the eviction from the municipality of persons they considered undesirable because of their labor organization activities, and have announced that they will continue so to do. It further alleges that acting under an ordinance which forbids any person to 'distribute or cause to be distributed or strewn about any street or public place any newspapers, paper, periodical, book magazine, circular, card or pamphlet', the petitioners have discriminated against the respondents by prohibiting and interfering with distribution of leaflets and pamphlets by the respondents while permitting others to distribute similar printed matter; that pursuant to a plan and conspiracy to deny the respondents their Constitutional rights as citizens of the United States, the petitioners have caused respondents, and those acting with them, to be arrested for distributing printed matter in the streets, and have caused them, and their associates, to be carried beyond the limits\u00f5of the city or to remote places therein, and have compelled them to board ferry boats destined for New York; have, with violence and force, interfered with the distribution of pamphlets discussing the rights of citizens \n\n[307 \nU.S. 496, 502]\n\u00a0\n under the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  151 et seq.; have unlawfully searched persons coming into the city and seized printed matter in their possession; have arrested and prosecuted respondents, and those acting with them, for attempting to distribute such printed matter; and have threatened that if respondents attempt to hold public meetings in the city to discuss rights afforded by the National Labor Relations Act, they would be arrested; and unless restrained, the petitioners will continue in their unlawful conduct. The bill further alleges that respondents have repeatedly applied for permits\u00f5to hold public meetings in the city for the stated purpose, as required by ordinance,1 although they do not admit the validity of the ordinance; but in execution of a common plan and purpose, the petitioners have consistently refused to issue any permits for meetings to be held by, or sponsored by, respondents, and have thus prevented the \n\n[307 \nU.S. 496, 503]\n\u00a0\n holding of such meetings; that the respondents did not, and do not, purpose to advocate the destruction or overthrow of the government of the United States, or that of New Jersey, but that their sole purpose is to explain to workingmen the purposes of the National Labor Relations\u00f5act, the benefits to be derived from it, and the aid which the Committee for Industrial Organization would furnish workingmen to that end; and all the activities in which they seek to engage in Jersey City were, and are, to be performed peacefully, without intimidation, fraud, violence, or other unlawful methods.\n The bill charges that the suit is to redress 'the deprivation, under color of state law, statute and ordinance, of rights privileges and immunities secured by the Constitution of the United States and of rights secured by laws of the United States providing for equal rights of citizens of the United States ....' It charges that the petitioners' conduct 'is in violation of their (respondents) rights and privileges as guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States.' It alleges that the petitioners' conduct has been 'in pursuance of an unlawful conspiracy ... to injure oppress threaten and intimidate citizens of the United States, including the individual plaintiffs herein, ... in the free exercise and enjoyment of the rights and privileges secured to them by the Constitution and laws of the United States. ...'\n The bill charges that the ordinances are unconstitutional and void, or are being enforced against respondents in an unconstitutional and discriminatory way; and that the petitioners, as officials of the city, purporting to act under the ordinances, have deprived respondents of the privileges of free speech and peaceable assembly secured to them, as citizens of the United States, by the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S.C.A.Const. It prays an injunction against continuance of petitioners' conduct. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 496, 504]\n\u00a0\n The bill alleges that the cause is of a civil nature, arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States, wherein the amount in controversy exceeds $3,000, exclusive of interest and costs; and is a suit in equity to redress the deprivation, under color of state law, statute and ordinance, of rights, privileges and immunities secured by the Constitution of the United States, and of rights secured by the laws of the United States providing for equal rights of citizens of the United States and of all persons within the jurisdiction of the United States.\n The answer denies generally, or qualifies, the allegations of the bill but does not deny that the individual respondents are citizens of the United States; denies that the amount in controversy 'as to each plaintiff and against each defendant' exceeds $3,000, exclusive of interest and costs; and alleges that the supposed grounds of federal jurisdiction are frivolous, no facts being alleged sufficient to show that any substantial federal question is involved.\n After trial upon the merits the District Court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law and a decree in favor of respondents. \n2\n In brief, the court found that the purposes of respondents, other than the American Civil Liberties Union, were the organization of unorganized workers into labor unions, causing such unions to exercise the normal and legal functions of labor organizations, such as collective bargaining with respect to the betterment of wages, hours of work and other terms and conditions of employment, and that these purposes were lawful; that the petitioners, acting in their official capacities, have adopted and enforced the deliberate policy of excluding and removing from Jersey City the agents of the respondents; have interfered with their right of passage upon the streets and access to the parks of the city; that these ends have been accomplished by force and violence \n\n[307 \nU.S. 496, 505]\n\u00a0\n despite the fact that the persons affected were acting in an orderly and peaceful manner; that exclusion, removal, personal restraint and interference, by force and violence, is accomplished without authority of law and without promptly bringing the persons taken into custody before a judicial officer for hearing.\n The court further found that the petitioners, as officials, acting in reliance on the ordinance dealing with the subject, have adopted and enforced a deliberate policy of preventing the respondents, and their associates, from distributing circulars, leaflets, or handbills in Jersey City; that this has been done by policemen acting forcibly and violently; that the petitioners propose to continue to enforce the policy of such prevention; that the circulars and handbills, distribution of which has been prevented, were not offensive to public morals, and did not advocate unlawful conduct, but were germane to the purposes alleged in the bill, and that their distribution was being carried out in a way consistent with public order and without molestation of individuals or misuse or littering of the streets. Similar findings were made with respect to the prevention of the distribution of placards.\n The findings are that the petitioners, as officials, have adopted and enforced a deliberate policy of forbidding the respondents and their associates from communicating their views respecting the National Labor Relations Act to the citizens of Jersey City by holding meetings\u00f5or assemblies in the open air and at public places; that there is no competent proof that the proposed speakers have ever spoken at an assembly where a breach of the peace occurred or at which any utterances were made which violated the canons of proper discussion or gave occasion for disorder consequent upon what was said; that there is no competent proof that the parks of Jersey City are dedicated to any general purpose other than the recreation of the public and that there is competent proof that the \n\n[307 \nU.S. 496, 506]\n\u00a0\n municipal authorities have granted permits to various persons other than the respondents to speak at meetings in the streets of the city.\n The court found that the rights of the respondents, and each of them, interfered with and frustrated by the petitioners, had a value, as to each respondent, in excess of $3,000, exclusive of interest and costs; that the petitioners' enforcement of their policy against the respondents caused the latter irreparable damage; that the respondents have been threatened with manifold and repeated persecution, and manifold and repeated invasions of their rights; and that they have done nothing to disentitle them to equitable relief.\n The court concluded that it had jurisdiction under Sec. 24(1)(12) and ( 14) of the Judicial Code;3 that the petitioners' official policy and acts were in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, and that the respondents had established a cause of action under the Constitution of the United States and under R.S.  1979, R.S.  1980, and R.S.  5508, as amended. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n The Circuit Court of Appeals concurred in the findings of fact; held the District Court had jurisdiction under Section 24(1) and (14) of the Judicial Code; modified the decree in respect of one of its provisions, and, as modified, affirmed it. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n By their specifications of error, the petitioners limit the issues in this court to three matters. They contend that the court below erred in holding that the District Court had jurisdiction over all or some of the causes of action stated in the bill. Secondly, they assert that the court erred in holding that the street meeting ordinance is unconstitutional on its face, and that it has been un- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 496, 507]\n\u00a0\n constitutionally administered. Thirdly, they claim that the decree must be set aside because it exceeds the court's power and is impracticable of enforcement or of compliance.\n First. Every question arising under the Constitution may, if properly raised in a state court, come ultimately to this court for decision. Until 1875,6 save for the limited jurisdiction conferred by the Civil Rights Acts, infra, federal courts had no original jurisdiction of actions or suits merely because the matter in controversy arose under the Constitution or laws of the United States; and the jurisdiction then and since conferred upon United States courts has been narrowly limited.\n Section 24 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.A.  41, confers original jurisdiction upon District Courts of the United States. Subsection (1) gives jurisdiction of 'suits of a civil nature, at common law or in equity , ... where the matter in controversy exceeds, exclusive of interest and costs, the sum or value of $3,000' and 'arises under the Constitution or laws of the United States.'\n The wrongs of which respondents complain are tortious invasions of alleged civil rights by persons acting under color of state authority. It is true that if the various plaintiffs had brought actions at law for the redress of such wrongs the amount necessary to jurisdiction under Section 24(1) would have been determined by the sum claimed in good faith. \n7\n But it does not follow that in a suit to restrain threatened invasions of such rights a mere averment of the amount in controversy confers jurisdiction. In suits brought under subsection (1) a traverse of the allegation as to the amount in controversy, or a motion to dismiss based upon the absence of \n\n[307 \nU.S. 496, 508]\n\u00a0\n such amount, calls for substantial proof on the part of the plaintiff of facts justifying the conclusion that the suit involves the necessary sum. \n8\n The record here is bare of any showing of the value of the asserted rights to the respondents individually and the suggestion that, in total, they have the requisite value is unavailing, since the plaintiffs may not aggregate their interests in order to attain the amount necessary to give jurisdiction. \n9\n We conclude that the District Court lacked jurisdiction under Section 24(1).\n Section 24(14) grants jurisdiction of suits\u00f5'at law or in equity authorized by law to be brought by any person to redress the deprivation, under color of any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State, of any right, privilege, or immunity, secured by the Constitution of the United States, or of any right secured by any law of the United States providing for equal rights\u00f5of citizens\u00f5of the United States, or of all persons within the jurisdiction of the United States.' \n10\n\u00a0\n\n The petitioners insist that the rights of which the respondents say they have been deprived are not within those described in subsection (14). The courts below have held that citizens of the United States possess such rights by virtue of their citizenship; that the Fourteenth Amendment secures these rights against invasion by a state, and authorizes legislation by Congress to enforce the Amendment. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 496, 509]\n\u00a0\n Prior to the Civil War there was confusion and debate as to the relation between United States citizenship and state citizenship. Beyond dispute, citizenship of the United States, as such, existed. The Constitution, in various clauses, recognized it11 but nowhere defined it. Many thought state citizenship, and that only, created United States citizenship. \n12\n\u00a0\n\n After the adoption of the Thirteenth Amendment a bill, which became the first Civil Rights Act,13 was introduced in the 39th Congress, the major purpose of which was to secure to the recently freed negroes all the civil rights secured to white men. This act declared that all persons born in the United States, and not subject to any foreign power, excluding Indians not taxed, were citizens of the United States and should have the same rights in every state to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, and give evidence, to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property, and to enjoy the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and property to the same extent as white citizens. None other than citizens of the United States were within the provisions of the Act. It provided that 'any person who, under color of any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, or custom, shall subject, or cause to be subjected, any inhabitant of any State ... to the deprivation of any right secured or protected by this act' should be guilty of a misdemeanor. It also conferred on district courts jurisdiction of civil actions by persons deprived of rights secured to them by its terms.\n By reason of doubts as to the power to enact the legislation, and because the policy thereby evidenced might be reversed by a subsequent Congress, there was intro- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 496, 510]\n\u00a0\n duced at the same session an additional amendment to the Constitution which became the Fourteenth.\n The first sentence of the Amendment settled the old controversy as to citizenship by providing that 'All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.' Thenceforward citizenship of the United States became primary and citizenship of a state secondary. \n14\n\u00a0\n\n The first section of the Amendment further provides: 'No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; ....'\n The second Civil Rights Act15 was passed by the 41st Congress. Its purpose was to enforce the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment, pursuant to the authority granted Congress by the fifth section of the amendment. By Section 18 it reenacted the Civil Rights Act of 1866\n\n\n A third Civil Rights Act, adopted April 20, 1871,16 provided 'That any person who, under color of any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage of any State, shall subject, or cause to be subjected, any person within the jurisdiction of the United States to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution of the United States, shall, any such law, statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage of the State to the contrary notwithstanding, be liable to the party injured in any action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress. ...' This with changes of the arrangement of clauses which were not intended to alter the scope of the provision became R.S.  1979, now Title 8,  43 of the United States Code, 8 U.S.C.A.  43. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 496, 511]\n\u00a0\n As has been said, prior to the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, there had been no constitutional definition of citizenship of the United States, or of the rights, privileges, and immunities secured thereby or springing therefrom. The phrase 'privileges and immunities' was used in Article IV, Section 2 of the Constitution, U.S.C.A., which decrees that 'The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States.'\n At one time it was thought that this section recognized a group of rights which, according to the jurisprudence of the day, were classed as 'natural rights'; and that the purpose of the section was to create rights of citizens of the United States by guaranteeing the citizens of every State the recognition of this group of rights by every other State. Such was the view of Justice Washington. \n17\n\u00a0\n\n While this description of the civil rights of the citizens of the States has been quoted with approval,18 it has come to be the settled view that Article IV, Section 2, does not import that a citizen of one state carries with him into another fundamental privileges and immunities which come to him necessarily by the mere fact of his citizenship in the state first mentioned, but, on the contrary, that in any state every citizen of any other state is to have the same privileges and immunities which the citizens of that state enjoy. The section, in effect, prevents a state from discriminating against citizens of other states in favor of its own. 19 \n\n[307 \nU.S. 496, 512]\n\u00a0\n The question now presented is whether freedom to disseminate information concerning the provisions of the National Labor Relations Act, to assemble peaceably for discussion of the Act, and of the opportunities and advantages offered by it, is a privilege or immunity of a citizen of the United States secured against State abridgment20 by Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment; and whether R.S.  1979 and Section 24(14) of the Judicial Code afford redress in a federal court for such abridgment. This is the narrow question presented by the record, and we confine our decision to it, without consideration of broader issues which the parties urge. The bill, the answer and the findings fully present the question. The bill alleges, and the findings sustain the allegation, that the respondents had no other purpose than to inform citizens of Jersey City by speech, and by the written word, respecting matters growing out of national legislation, the constitutionality of which this court has sustained.\n Although it has been held that the Fourteenth Amendment created no rights in citizens of the United States, but merely secured existing rights against state abridgment,21 it is clear that the right peaceably to assemble and to discuss these topics, and to communicate respecting them, whether orally or in writing, is a privilege inherent in citizenship of the United States which the Amendment protects. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 496, 513]\n\u00a0\n In the Slaughter-House Cases it was said, 16 Wall. page 79: 'The right to peaceably assemble and petition for redress of grievances, the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, are rights of the citizen guaranteed by the Federal Constitution.\n In United States v. Cruikshank, \n92 \nU.S. 542, 552\n, 553 S., the court said: 'The right of the people peaceably to assemble for the purpose of petitioning Congress for a redress of grievances, or for anything else connected with the powers or the duties of the National Government, is an attribute of national citizenship and, as such, under the protection of and guaranteed by, the United States. The very idea of a government, republican in form, implies a right on the part of its citizens to meet peaceably for consultation in respect to public affairs and to petition for a redress of grievances. If it had been alleged in these counts that the object of the defendants was to prevent a meeting for such a purpose, the case would have been within the statute, and within the scope of the sovereignty of the United States.'\n No expression of a contrary view has ever been voiced by this court.\n The National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  151 et seq., declares the policy of the United States to be to remove obstructions to commerce by encouraging collective bargaining, protecting full freedom of association and self-organization of workers, and, through their representatives, negotiating as to conditions of employment.\n Citizenship of the United States would be little better than a name if it did not carry with it the right to discuss national legislation and the benefits, advantages, and opportunities to accrue to citizens therefrom. All of the respondents' proscribed activities had this single end and aim. The District Court had jurisdiction under Section 24(14). \n\n[307 \nU.S. 496, 514]\n\u00a0\n Natural persons, and they alone, are entitled to the privileges and immunities which Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment secures for 'citizens of the United States.' \n22\n Only the individual respondents may, therefore, maintain this suit.\n Second. What has been said demonstrates that, in the light of the facts found, privileges and immunities of the individual respondents as citizens of the United States, were infringed by the petitioners, by virtue of their official positions, under color of ordinances of Jersey City, unless, as petitioners contend, the city's ownership of streets and parks is as absolute as one's ownership of his home, with consequent power altogether to exclude citizens from the use thereof, or unless, though the city holds the streets in trust for public use, the absolute denial of their use to the respondents is a valid exercise of the police power.\n The findings of fact negative the latter assumption. In support of the former the petitioners rely upon Davis v. Massachusetts, \n167 \nU.S. 43\n, 17 S.Ct. 731, 732. There it appeared that, pursuant to enabling legislation, the city of Boston adopted an ordinance prohibiting anyone from speaking, discharging fire arms, selling goods, or maintaining any booth for public amusement on any of the public grounds of the city except under a permit from the Mayor. Davis spoke on Boston Common without a permit and without applying to the Mayor for one. He was charged with a violation of the ordinance and moved to quash the complaint, inter alia, on the ground that the ordinance abridged his privileges and immunities as a citizen of the United States and denied him due process of law because it was arbitrary and unreasonable. His contentions were overruled and he was convicted. The judgment was \n\n[307 \nU.S. 496, 515]\n\u00a0\n affirmed by the Supreme Court of Massachusetts and by this court.\n The decision seems to be grounded on the holding of the State court that the Common 'was absolutely under the control of the legislature', and that it was thus 'conclusively determined there was no right in the plaintiff in error to use the common except in such mode and subject to such regulations as the legislature, in its wisdom, may have deemed proper to prescribe.' The Court added that the Fourteenth Amendment did not destroy the power of the states to enact police regulations as to a subject within their control or enable citizens to use public property in defiance of the constitution and laws of the State.\n The ordinance there in question apparently had a different purpose from that of the one here challenged, for it was not directed solely at the exercise of the right of speech and assembly, but was addressed as well to other activities, not in the nature of civil rights, which doubtless might be regulated or prohibited as respects their enjoyment in parks. In the instant case the ordinance deals only with the exercise of the right of assembly for the purpose of communicating views entertained by speakers, and is not a general measure to promote the public convenience in the use of the streets or parks.\n We have no occasion to determine whether, on the facts disclosed, the Davis Case was rightly decided, but we cannot agree that it rules the instant case. Wherever the title of streets and parks may rest, they have immemorially been held in trust for the use of the public and, time out of mind, have been used for purposes of assembly, communicating thoughts between citizens, and discussing public questions. Such use of the streets and public places has, from ancient times, been a part of the privileges, immunities, rights, and liberties of citizens. The privilege of a citizen of the United States to usethe \n\n[307 \nU.S. 496, 516]\n\u00a0\n streets and parks for communication of views on national questions may be regulated in the interest of all; it is not absolute, but relative, and must be exercised in subordination to the general comfort and convenience, and in consonance with peace and good order; but it must not, in the guise of regulation, be abridged or denied.\n We think the court below was right in holding the ordinance quoted in Note 1 void upon its face. \n23\n It does not make comfort or convenience in the use of streets or parks the standard of official action. It enables the Director of Safety to refuse a permit on his mere opinion that such refusal will prevent 'riots, disturbances or disorderly assemblage.' It can thus, as the record discloses, be made the instrument of arbitrary suppression of free expression of views on national affairs for the prohibition of all speaking will undoubtedly 'prevent' such eventualities. But uncontrolled official suppression of the privilege cannot be made a substitute for the duty to maintain order in connection with the exercise of the right.\n The bill recited that policemen, acting under petitioners' instructions, had searched various persons, including the respondents, and had seized innocent circulars and pamphlets without warrant or probable cause. It prayed injunctive relief against repetition of this conduct. The District Court made no findings of fact concerning such searches and seizures and granted no relief with respect to them. The Circuit Court of Appeals did not enlarge the terms of the decree but found that unreasonable searches and seizures had occurred and that the prohibitions of the Fourth Amendment had been taken over by the Fourteenth so as to protect citizens of the United States against such action. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 496, 517]\n\u00a0\n The decree as affirmed by the court below does not restrain any searches or seizures. In each of its provisions addressed to interference with liberty of the person, or to the conspiracy to deport, exclude, and interfere bodily with the respondents in pursuit of their peaceable activities, the decree contains a saving clause of which the following is typical: 'except in so far as such personal restraint is in accordance with any right of search and seizure.' In the light of this reservation we think there was no occasion for the Circuit Court of Appeals to discuss the question whether exemption from the searches and seizures proscribed by the Fourth Amendment is afforded by the privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth, and we have no occasion to consider or decide any such question.\n Third. It remains to consider the objections to the decree. Section A deals with liberty of the person and prohibits the petitioners from excluding or removing the respondents or persons acting with them from Jersey City, exercising personal restraint over them without warrant or confining them without lawful arrest and production of them for prompt judicial hearing, saving lawful search and seizure; or interfering with their free access to the streets, parks, or public places of the city. The argument is that this section of the decree is so vague in its terms as to be impractical of enforcement or obedience. We agree with the court below that the objection is not well founded.\n Section B deals with liberty of the mind. Paragraph 1 enjoins the petitioners from interfering with the right of the respondents, their agents and those acting with them, to communicate their views as individuals to others on the streets in an orderly and peaceable manner. It reserves to the petitioners full liberty to enforce law and order by lawful search and seizure or by arrest and production before a judicial officer. We think this paragraph unassailable. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 496, 518]\n\u00a0\n Paragraphs 2 and 3 enjoin interference with the distribution of circulars, handbills and placards. The decree attempts to formulate the conditions\u00f5under which respondents and their sympathizers may distribute such literature free of interference. The ordinance absolutely prohibiting such distribution is void under our decision in Lovell v. Griffin, supra, and petitioners so concede. We think the decree goes too far. All respondents are entitled to is a decree declaring the ordinance void and enjoining the petitioners from enforcing it.\n Paragraph 4 has to do with public meetings. Although the court below held the ordinance void, the decree enjoins the petitioners as to the manner in which they shall administer it. There is an initial command that the petitioners shall not place 'any previous restraint' upon the respondents in respect of holding meetings provided they apply for a permit as required by the ordinance. This is followed by an enumeration of the conditions under which a permit may be granted or denied. We think this is wrong. As the ordinance is void, the respondents are entitled to a decree so declaring and an injunction against its enforcement by the petitioners. They are free to hold meetings without a permit and without regard to the terms of the void ordinance. The courts cannot rewrite the ordinance, as the decree, in effect, does.\n The bill should be dismissed as to all save the individual plaintiffs, and Section B, paragraphs 2, 3 and 4, of the decree should be modified as indicated. In other respects the decree should be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice STONE.\n I do not doubt that the decree below, modified as has been proposed, is rightly affirmed, but I am unable to follow the path by which some of my brethren have attained that end, and I think the matter is of sufficient importance to merit discussion in some detail. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 496, 519]\n\u00a0\n It has been explicitly and repeatedly affirmed by this Court, without a dissenting voice, that freedom of speech and of assembly for any lawful purpose are rights of personal liberty secured to all persons, without regard to citizenship, by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S.C.A. Gitlow v. New York, \n268 \nU.S. 652\n, 45 S.Ct. 625; Whitney v. California, \n274 \nU.S. 357\n, 47 S.Ct. 641; Fiske v. Kansas, \n274 \nU.S. 380\n, 47 S.Ct. 655; Stromberg v. California, \n283 \nU.S. 359\n, 51 S.Ct. 532, 75 L.Ed.2d 117, 73 A.L.R. 1484; Near v. Minnesota, \n283 \nU.S. 697\n, 51 S.Ct. 625; Grosjean v. American Press Co., \n297 \nU.S. 233\n, 56 S.Ct. 444; De Jonge v. Oregon, \n299 \nU.S. 353\n, 57 S.Ct. 255; Herndon v. Lowry, \n301 \nU.S. 242\n, 57 S.Ct. 732, 81 L.ed. 1066; Lovell v. Griffin, \n303 \nU.S. 444\n, 58 S. Ct. 666. It has never been held that either is a privilege or immunity peculiar to citizenship of the United States, to which alone the priveleges and immunitites clause refers, Slaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall. 36; Duncan v. Missouri, \n152 \nU.S. 377, 382\n, 14 S.Ct. 570, 571; Twining b. New Jersey, \n211 \nU.S. 78, 97\n, 29 S.Ct. 14, 18; Maxwell v. Bugbee, \n250 \nU.S. 525\n, 538 40 S.Ct. 2,5; Hamilton bv. Regents of University of California, 293 US. 245, 261, 55 S.Ct. 197, 203, and neither can be brought within the protection of that clause without enlarging the category of privileges and immunities of United States citizenship as it has hitherto been defined.\n As will presently ppear, the right to maintain a suit in equity to restrain state officers, acting under a state law, from infringing the rights of freedom of speech and of assembly guaranteed by the due process clause, is given by Act of Congress to every person within the jurisdiction of the United States whether a citizen or not, and such a suit may be maintained in the district court without allegation or proof that the jurisdictional amount required by  24(1) of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.A.  41(1), is involved. Hence there is no occasion, for jurisdictional purposes or any other, to consider whether freedom of speech and of assembly are immunities secured by the privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to citizens of the United States, or to revive the contention, \n\n[307 \nU.S. 496, 520]\n\u00a0\n rejected by this Court in the Slaughter-House Cases, supra, that the privileges and immunities of United States citizenship, protected by that clause, extend beyond those which arise or grow out of the relationship of United States citizens to the national government. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[307 \nU.S. 496, 521]\n\u00a0\n That such is the limited application of the privileges and immunities clause seems now to be conceded by my brethren. But it is said that the freedom of respondents with which the petitioners have interfered is the 'freedom to disseminate information concerning the provisions of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  151 et seq., to assemble peace- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 496, 522]\n\u00a0\n ably for discussion of the Act, and of the opportunities and advantages offered by it', and that these are privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States secured against state abridgment by the privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. It has been said that the right of citizens to assemble for the purpose of petitioning Congress for the redress of grievances is a privilege of United States citizenship protected by the privileges and immunities clause. United States v. Cruikshank, \n92 \nU.S. 542, 552\n, 553 S.. We may assume for present purposes, although the step is a long and by no means certain one, see Maxwell v. Dow, \n176 \nU.S. 581\n, 20 S.Ct. 448, 494; Twining v. New Jersey, supra, that the right to assemble to discuss the advantages of the National Labor Relations Act is likewise a privilege secured by the privileges and immunities clause to citizens of the United States, but not to others, while freedom to assemble for the purpose of discussing a similar state statute would not be within the privileges and immunities clause. But the difficulty with this assumption is, as the record and briefs show, that it is an afterthought first emerging in this case after it was submitted to us for decision, and like most afterthoughts in litigated matters it is without adequate support in the record.\n The respondents in their bill of complaint specifically named and quoted Article IV,  2, now conceded to be inapplicable, and the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment as the provisions of the Constitution which secure to them the rights of free speech and assembly. They omitted the privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment from their quotation. They made no specific allegation that any of those whose freedom had been interfered with by petitioners was a citizen of the United States. The general allegation that the acts of petitioners complained of violate the rights of 'citizens of the United States, in- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 496, 523]\n\u00a0\n cluding the individual plaintiffs here', and other allegations of like tenor, were denied by petitioners' answer. There is no finding by either court below that any of respondents or any of those whose freedom of speech and assembly has been infringed are citizens of the United States, and we are referred to no part of the evidence in which their citizenship is mentioned or from which it can be inferred.\n Both courts below found, and the evidence supports the findings, that the purpose of respondents, other than the Civil Liberties Union, in holding meetings in Jersey City, was to organize labor unions in various industries in order to secure to workers the benefits of collective bargaining with respect to betterment of wages, hours of work and other terms and conditions of employment. Whether the proposed unions were to be organized in industries which might be subject to the National Labor Relations Act or to the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board does not appear. Neither court below has made any finding that the meetings were called to discuss, or that they ever did in fact discuss, the National Labor Relations Act. The findings do not support the conclusion that the proposed meetings involved any such relationship between the national government and respondents or any of them, assuming they are citizens of the United States, as to show that the asserted right or privilege was that of a citizen of the United States, and I cannot say that an adequate basis has been laid for supporting a theory-which respondents themselves evidently did not entertain-that any of their privileges as citizens of the United States, guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, were abridged, as distinguished from the privileges guaranteed to all persons by the due process clause. True, the findings refer to the suppression by petitioners of exhibits, one of which turns out to be a handbill advising workers they have the legal right, under \n\n[307 \nU.S. 496, 524]\n\u00a0\n the Wagner Act, to choose their own labor union to represent them in collective bargaining. But the injunction, which the Court now rightly sustains, is not restricted to the protection of the right, said to pertain to United States citizenship, to disseminate information about the Wagner Act. On the contrary it extends and applies in the broadest terms to interferences with respondents in holding any lawful meeting and disseminating any lawful information by circular, leaflet, handbill and placard. If, as my brethren think, respondents are entitled to maintain in this suit only the rights secured to them by the privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment-here the right to disseminate information about the National Labor Relations Act-it is plain that the decree is too broad. Instead of enjoining, as it does, interferences with all meetings \u00f5for all purposes and the lawful dissemination of all information, it should have confined its restraint to interferences with the dissemination of information about the National Labor Relations Act, through meetings or otherwise. The court below rightly omitted any such limitation from the decree, evidently because, as it declared, petitioners' acts infringed the due process clause, which guarantees to all persons freedom of speech and of assembly for any lawful purpose.\n No more grave and important issue can be brought to this Court than that of freedom of speech and assembly, which the due process clause guarantees to all persons regardless of their citizenship, but which the privileges and immunities clause secures only to citizens, and then only to the limited extent that their relationship to the national government is affected. I am unable to rest decision here on the assertion, which I think the record fails to support, that respondents must depend upon their limited privileges as citizens of the United States in order to sustain their cause, or upon so palpable an avoidance \n\n[307 \nU.S. 496, 525]\n\u00a0\n of the real issue in the case, which respondents have raised by their pleadings and sustained by their proof. That issue is whether the present proceeding can be maintained under  24(14) of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C. A.  41(14), as a suit for the protection of rights and privileges guaranteed by the due process clause. I think respondents' right to maintain it does not depend on their citizenship and cannot rightly be made to turn on the existence or non-existence of a purpose to disseminate information about the National Labor Relations Act. It is enough that petitioners have prevented respondents from holding meetings and disseminating information whether for the organization of labor unions or for any other lawful purpose.\n If it be the part of wisdom to avoid unnecessary decision of constitutional questions, it would seem to be equally so to avoid the unnecessary creation of novel constitutional doctrine, inadequately supported by the record, in order to attain an and easily and certainly reached by following the beaten paths of constitutional decision.\n The right to maintain the present suit is conferred upon the individual respondents by the due process clause and Acts of Congress, regardless of their citizenship and of the amount in controversy. Section 1 of the Civil Rights Act of April 20, 1871, 17 Stat. 13, provided that 'any person who, under color of any law, statute, ordinance ... of any State, shall subject, or cause to be subjected, any person within the jurisdiction of the United States to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution of the United States, shall ... be liable to the party injured in any action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress'. And it directed that such proceedings should be prosecuted in the several district or circuit courts of the United States. The right of action given by this section was later specifically limited to 'any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof', and was \n\n[307 \nU.S. 496, 526]\n\u00a0\n extended to include rights, privileges and immunities secured by the laws of the United States as well as by the Constitution. As thus modified the provision was continued as  1979 of the Revised Statutes and now constitutes  43 of Title 8 of the United States Code, 8 U.S.C.A.  43. It will be observed that the cause of action, given by the section in its original as well as its final form, extends broadly to deprivation by state action of the rights, privileges and immunities secured to persons by the Constitution. It thus includes the Fourteenth Amendment and such privileges and immunities as are secured by the due process and equal protection clauses, as well as by the privileges and immunities clause of that Amendment. It will also be observed that they are those rights secured to persons, whether citizens of the United States or not, to whom the Amendment in terms extends the benefit of the due process and equal protection clauses.\n Following the decision of the Slaughter-House Cases and before the later expansion by judicial decision of the content of the due process and equal protection clauses, there was little scope for the operation of this statute under the Fourteenth Amendment. The observation of the Court in United States v. Cruikshank, \n92 \nU.S. 542\n, 551, that the right of assembly was not secured against state action by the Constitution, must be attributed to the decision in the Slaughter-House Cases that only privileges and immunities peculiar to United States citizenship were secured by the privileges and immunities clause, and to the further fact that at that time it had not been decided that the right was one protected by the due process clause. The argument that the phrase in the statute 'secured by the Constitution' refers to rights 'created', rather than 'protected' by it, is not persuasive. The preamble of the Constitution, proclaiming the establishment of the Constitution in order to 'secure the \n\n[307 \nU.S. 496, 527]\n\u00a0\n Blessings of Liberty', uses the word 'secure' in the sense of 'protect' or 'make certain'. That the phrase was used in this sense in the statute now under consideration was recognized in Carter v. Greenhow, \n114 \nU.S. 317, 322\n, 5 S.Ct. 928, 930, 931, 962, where it was held as a matter of pleading that the particular cause of action set up in the plaintiff's pleading was in contract and was not to redress deprivation of the 'right secured to him by that clause of the constitution' (the contract clause), to which he had 'chosen not to resort'. See, as to other rights protected by the Constitution and hence secured by it, brought within the provisions of R.S.  5508, 18 U.S.C.A.  51; Logan v. United States, \n144 \nU.S. 263\n, 12 S.Ct. 617; In re Quarles and Butler, \n158 \nU.S. 532\n, 15 S.Ct. 959; United States v. Mosley, \n238 \nU.S. 383\n, 35 S.Ct. 904.\n Since freedom of speech and freedom of assembly are rights secured to persons by the due process clause, all of the individual respondents are plainly authorized by  1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 to maintain the present suit in equity to restrain infringement of their rights. As to the American Civil Liberties Union, which is a corporation, it cannot be said to be deprived of the civil rights of freedom of speech and of assembly, for the liberty guaranteed by the due process clause is the liberty of natural, not artificial, persons. Northwestern Nat. Life Insurance Co. v. Riggs, \n203 \nU.S. 243, 255\n, 27 S.Ct. 126, 129, 7 Ann.Cas. 1104; Western Turf Ass'n v. Greenberg, \n204 \nU.S. 359, 363\n, 27 S.Ct. 384, 385.\n The question remains whether there was jurisdiction in the district court to entertain the suit although the matter in controversy cannot be shown to exceed $3,000 in value because the asserted rights, freedom of speech and freedom of assembly, are of such a nature as not to be susceptible of valuation in money. The question is the same whether the right or privilege asserted is secured by the privileges and immunities clause or any other. When the Civil Rights Act of 1871 directed that suits for violation of  1 of that Act should be prosecuted \n\n[307 \nU.S. 496, 528]\n\u00a0\n in the district and circuit courts, the only requirement of a jurisdictional amount in suits brought in the federal courts was that imposed by  11 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat. 78, which conferred jurisdiction on the circuit courts of suits where 'the matter in dispute' exceeded $500 and the United States was a plaintiff, or an alien was a party, or the suit was between citizens\u00f5of different states; and it was then plain that the requirement of a jurisdictional amount did not extend to the causes of action authorized by the Civil Rights Act of 1871. By the Act of March 3, 1875, c. 137, 18 Stat. 470, the jurisdiction of the circuit courts was extended to suits at common law or in equity 'arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States' in which the matter in dispute exceeded $500. By the Act of March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1087, the circuit courts were abolished and their jurisdiction was transferred to the district courts, and by successive enactments the jurisdictional amount applicable to certain classes of suits was raised to $ 3,000. The provisions applicable to such suits, thus modified, appear as  24(1) of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  41(1), 28 U.S.C.A.  41(1).\n Meanwhile, the provisions conferring jurisdiction on district and circuit courts over suits brought under  1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 were continued as R.S.  563 and 629, and now appear as  24(14) of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  41(14), 28 U.S.C.A.  41(14). The Act of March 3, 1911, 36 Stat. 1087, 1091, amended  24(1) of the Judicial Code so as to direct that 'The foregoing provision as to the sum or value of the matter in controversy shall not be construed to apply to any of the cases mentioned in the succeeding paragraphs of this section'.2 Thus, \n\n[307 \nU.S. 496, 529]\n\u00a0\n since 1875, the jurisdictional acts have contained two parallel provisions, one conferring jurisdiction on the federal courts, district or circuit, to entertain suits 'arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States' in which the amount in controversy exceeds a specified value; the other, now  24(14) of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.A.  41(14), conferring jurisdiction on those courts of suits authorized by the Civil Rights Act of 1871, regardless of the amount in controversy.\n Since all of the suits thus authorized are suits arising under a statute of the United States to redress deprivation of rights, privileges and immunities secured by the Constitution, all are literally suits 'arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States'. But it does not follow that in every such suit the plaintiff is required by  24(1) of the Judicial Code to allege and prove that the constitutional immunity which he seeks to vindicate has a value in excess of $3,000. There are many rights and immunities secured by the Constitution, of which freedom of speech and assembly are conspicuous examples, which are not capable of money valuation, and in many instances, like the present, no suit in equity could be maintained for their protection if proof of the jurisdictional amount were prerequisite. We can hardly suppose that Congress, having in the broad terms of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 vested in all persons within the jurisdiction of the United States a right of action in equity for the deprivation of constitutional immunities, cognizable only in the federal courts, intended by the Act of 1875 to destroy those rights of action by withholding from the courts of the United States jurisdiction to entertain them.\n That such was not the purpose of the Act of 1875 in extending the jurisdiction of federal courts to causes of action arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States involving a specified jurisdictional amount, is evident from the continuance upon the statute books of \n\n[307 \nU.S. 496, 530]\n\u00a0\n s 24(14) side by side with  24(1) of the Judicial Code, as amended by the Act of 1875. Since the two provisions stand and must be read together, it is obvious that neither is to be interpreted as abolishing the other, especially when it is remembered that the 1911 amendment of  24(1) provided that the requirement of a jurisdictional amount should not be construed to apply to cases mentioned in s 24(14). This must be taken as legislative recognition that there are suits authorized by  1 of the Act of 1871 which could be brought under  24(14) after, as well as before, the amendment of 1875 without compliance with any requirement of jurisdictional amount, and that these at least must be deemed to include suits in which the subject matter is one incapable of valuation. Otherwise we should be forced to reach the absurd conclusion that  24(14) is meaningless and that a large proportion of the suits authorized by the Civil Rights Act cannot be maintained in any court, although jurisdiction of them, with no requirement of jurisdictional amount, was carefully preserved by  24(14) of the Judicial Code and by the 1911 amendment of  24(1). By treating  24(14) as conferring federal jurisdiction of suits brought under the Act of 1871 in which the right asserted is inherently incapable of pecuniary valuation, we harmonize the two parallel provisions of the Judicial Code, construe neither as superfluous, and give to each a scope in conformity with its history and manifest purpose.\n The practical construction which has been given by this Court to the two jurisdictional provisions establishes that the jurisdiction conferred by  24(14) has been preserved to the extent indicated. In Holt v. Indiana Mfg. Co., \n176 \nU.S. 68\n, 20 S.Ct. 272, suit was brought to restrain alleged unconstitutional taxation of patent rights. The Court held that the suit was one arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States within the meaning of  24(1) of the Judicial Code and that the United States Circuit Court \n\n[307 \nU.S. 496, 531]\n\u00a0\n in which the suit had been begun was without jurisdiction because the challenged tax was less than the jurisdictional amount. The Court remarked that the present  24(14) applied only to suits alleging deprivation of 'civil rights'. On the other hand, in Truax v. Raich, \n239 \nU.S. 33\n, 36 S.Ct. 7, L.R.A.1916D, 545, Ann.Cas.1917B, 283, affirming, D.C., 219 F. 273, this Court sustained the jurisdiction of a district court to entertain the suit of an alien to restrain enforcement of a state statute alleged to be an infringement of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because it discriminated against aliens in their right to seek and retain employment. The jurisdiction of a district court was similarly sustained in Crane v. Johnson, \n242 \nU.S. 339\n, 37 S.Ct. 176, Ann.Cas.1917B, 796, on the authority of Truax v. Raich, supra. The suit was brought in a district court to restrain enforcement of a state statute alleged to deny equal protection in suppressing the freedom to pursue a particular trade or calling. For the purposes of the present case it is important to note that the constitutional right or immunity alleged in these two cases was one of personal freedom, invoked in the Raich case by one not a citizen of the United States. In both cases the right asserted arose under the equal protection, not the privileges and immunities clause; in both the gist of the cause of action was not damage or injury to property, but unconstitutional infringement of a right of personal liberty not susceptible of valuation in money. The jurisdiction was sustained despite the omission of any allegation or proof of jurisdictional amount, pointedly brought to the attention of this Court.\n The conclusion seems inescapable that the right conferred by the Act of 1871 to maintain a suit in equity in the federal courts to protect the suitor against a deprivation of rights or immunities secured by the Constitution, has been preserved, and that whenever the right or immunity is one of personal liberty, not dependent for its existence upon the infringement of property rights, there \n\n[307 \nU.S. 496, 532]\n\u00a0\n is jurisdiction in the district court under  24(14) of the Judicial Code to entertain it without proof that the amount in controversy exceeds $3, 000. As the right is secured to 'any person' by the due process clause, and as the statute permits the suit to be brought by 'any person' as well as by a citizen, it is certain that resort to the privileges and immunities clause would not support the decree which we now sustain and would involve constitutional experimentation as gratuitous as it is unwarranted. We cannot be sure that its consequences would not be unfortunate.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES, concurring:\n With respect to the merits I agree with the opinion of Mr. Justice ROBERTS and in the affirmance of the judgment as modified. With respect to the point as to jurisdiction I agree with what is said in the opinion of Mr. Justice ROBERTS as to the right to discuss the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  151 et seq., being a privilege of a citizen of the United States, but I am not satisfied that the record adequately supports the resting of jurisdiction upon that ground. As to that matter, I concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice STONE.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS.\n I am of opinion that the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be reversed and the cause remanded to the District Court with instructions to dismiss the bill. In the circumstances disclosed, I conclude that the District Court should have refused to interfere by injunction with the essential rights of the municipality to control its own parks and streets. Wise management of such intimate local affairs, generally, at least, is beyond the competency of federal courts, and essays in that direction should be avoided. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 496, 533]\n\u00a0\n There was ample opportunity for respondents to assert their claims through an orderly proceeding in courts of the state empowered authoritatively to interpret her laws with final review here in respect of federal questions.\n Mr. Justice BUTLER.\n I am of opinion that the challenged ordinance is not void on its face; that in principle it does not differ from the Boston ordinance, as applied and upheld by this Court, speaking through Mr. Justice White, in Davis v. Massachusetts, \n167 \nU.S. 43\n, 17 S.Ct. 731, affirming the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, speaking through Mr. Justice Holmes, in Commonwealth v. Davis, 162 Mass. 510, 39 N.E. 113, 26 L.R.A. 712, 44 Am.St.Rep. 389, and that the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'The Board of Commissioners of Jersey City Do Ordain:\n'1.

It should not be forgotten that the Court, in deciding the case, did not deny the contention of the dissenting justices that the asserted freedom was in fact infringed by the state law. It rested its decision rather on the ground that the immunity claimed was not one belonging to persons by virtue of their citizenship. 'It is quite clear', the Court declared (16 Wall. page 74), 'that there is a citizenship of the United States, and a citizenship of a State, which are distinct from each other, and which depend upon different characteristics ... in the individual.' And it held that the protection of the privileges and immunities clause did not extend to those 'fundamental' rights attached to state citizenship which are peculiarly the creation and concern of state governments and which Mr. Justice Washington, in Corfield v. Coryell, 4 Wash.C.C. 371, 6 Fed.Cas. page 546, No. 3230, mistakenly thought to be guaranteed by Article IV,  2 of the Constitution. The privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States, it was pointed out, are confined to that limited class of interests growing out of the relationship between the citizen and the national government created by the Constitution and federal laws. Slaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 79; see Twining v. New Jersey, \n211 \nU.S. 78, 97\n, 98 S., 29 S.Ct. 14, 18.\n That limitation upon the operation of the privileges and immunities clause has not been relaxed by any later decisions of this Court. In re Kemmler, \n136 \nU.S. 436, 448\n, 10 S.Ct. 930, 934; McPherson v. Blacker, \n146 \nU.S. 1, 38\n, 13 S.Ct. 3, 11; Giozza v. Tiernan, \n148 \nU.S. 657, 661\n, 13 S.Ct. 721, 723; Duncan v. Missouri, \n152 \nU.S. 377, 382\n, 14 S.Ct. 570, 571. Upon that ground appeals to this Court to extend the clause beyond the limitation have uniformly been rejected, and even those basic privileges and immunities secured against federal infringement by the first eight amendments have uniformly been held not to be protected from state action by the privileges and immunities clause. Walker v. Sauvinet, \n92 \nU.S. 90\n; Hurtado v. California, \n110 \nU.S. 516\n, 4 S.Ct. 111, 292; Presser v. Illinois, \n116 \nU.S. 252\n, 6 S.Ct. 580; O'Neil v. Vermont, \n144 \nU.S. 323\n, 12 S.Ct. 693; Maxwell v. Dow, \n176 \nU.S. 581\n, 20 S.Ct. 448, 494; West v. Louisiana, \n194 \nU.S. 258\n, 24 S.Ct. 650; Twining v. New Jersey, supra; Palko v. Connecticut, \n302 \nU.S. 319\n, 58 S.Ct. 149.\n The reason for this narrow construction of the clause and the consistently exhibited reluctance of this Court to enlarge its scope has been well understood since the decision of the Slaughter-House Cases. If its restraint upon state action were to be extended more than is needful to protect relationships between the citizen and the national government, and if it were to be deemed to extend to those fundamental rights of person and property attached to citizenship by the common law and enactments of the states when the Amendment was adopted, such as were described in Corfield v. Coryell, supra, it would enlarge Congressional and judicial control of state action and multiply restrictions upon it whose nature, though difficult to anticipate with precision, would be of sufficient gravity to cause serious apprehension for the rightful independence of local government. That was the issue fought out in the Slaughter-House Cases, with the decision against enlargement. \n Of the fifty or more cases which have been brought to this Court since the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment in which state statutes have been assailed as violating the privileges and immunities clause, in only a single case was a statute held to infringe a privilege or immunity peculiar to citizenship of the United States. In that one, Colgate v. Harvey, \n296 \nU.S. 404\n, 56 S.Ct. 252, 102 A.L.R. 54, it was thought necessary to support the decision by pointing to the specific reference in the Slaughter-House Cases, supra, 16 Wall. page 79, to the right to pass freely from state to state, sustained as a right of national citizenship in Crandall v. Nevada, 6 Wall. 35, before the adoption of the Amendment.\n The cases will be found collected in Footnote 2 of the dissenting opinion in Colgate v. Harvey, \n296 \nU.S. 404, 445\n, 56 S.Ct. 252, 266, 102 A.L.R. 54. To these should be added Holden v. Hardy, \n169 \nU.S. 366\n, 18 S.Ct. 383; Ferry v. Spokane, P. & S.R.

BIMCO TRADING(1939)\nNo. 418\nArgued: February 6, 1939Decided: February 27, 1939\n\n\n\n On Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the Northern District of Florida. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 375, 376]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. H. E. Carter, of Tallahassee, Fla., Pat Whitaker, of Tampa, Fla., and George C. Gibbs, of Tallahassee, Fla., for appellants.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The case is here on appeal, under Section 266 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  380, 28 U.S.C.A.  380, to review the final decree of a three- judge District Court enjoining appellants, constituting the State Road Department of Florida, from enforcing against appellees relevant provisions of a Florida statute. Acts 1937, c. 18995, Fla.Comp.Gen.Laws Supp. c. cviii,  4151(512) to 4151(519). The statute provides for the inspection of all imported cement and the payment for such inspection of a fee of fifteen cents per hundred pounds. A motion to dismiss the bill having been overruled and appellants having elected to stand on the bill, a final decree was duly entered.\n At the threshold, a challenge to the jurisdiction of the District Court must be met. It derives from Section 265 of the Judicial Code, 28 U. S.C.  379, 28 U.S.C.A.  379, for it is claimed that the injunction in effect stayed proceedings in the Supreme Court of Florida. Disposition of this claim entails a quick narrative of the course of litigation disclosed by the record.\n On July 29, 1937, a petition for mandamus was filed in the Supreme Court of Florida by the State of Florida ex \n\n[306 \nU.S. 375, 377]\n\u00a0\n rel. Florida Portland Cement Company to compel appellants, members of the State Road Department, to enforce the statute in question, and on the same day an alternative writ of mandamus was issued. Appellants' demurrer, raising the constitutionality of the statute, was overruled on October 12, 1937. State ex rel. v. Hale, 129 Fla. 588, 176 So. 577. A peremptory writ of mandamus on November 17, 1937, directed appellants to enforce the statute. Meanwhile, on November 4, 1937, appellee Bimco Trading, Inc. filed its bill of complaint in this suit to enjoin the enforcement of the statute as forbidden, inter alia, by Article 1,  8, cl. 3, and Article 1 ,  10, cl. 2, of the Constitution, U.S.C.A. On November 27, 1937, the District Court granted an interlocutory injunction restraining appellants from enforcing the statute. Thereafter, appellants moved the Supreme Court of Florida to stay the mandamus proceedings pending an appeal to this Court from the order of the District Court, and on December 9, 1937, the Florida court ordered 'that all further proceedings and actions taken pursuant to the peremptory Writ of Mandamus heretofore issued in this cause, be and the same is hereby stayed until the final decision of the Supreme Court of the United States upon the constitutionality of the Act involved in this cause and until the further order of this Court.' This cause was then prosecuted with dispatch. On March 8, 1938, appellants' motion to dismiss, which had been filed on November 24, 1937, was overruled, and, appellants refusing to plead over, the District Court, on June 14, 1938, entered a final decree permanently enjoining the enforcement of the statute.\n To invoke Section 265 in these circumstances is to assert that a successful mandamus proceeding in a state court against state officials to enforce a challenged statute, bars injunctive relief in a United States district court against enforcement of the statute by state officials at the suit of \n\n[306 \nU.S. 375, 378]\n\u00a0\n strangers to the state court proceedings. This assumes that the mandamus proceeding bound the independent suitor in the federal court as though he were a party to the litigation in the state court. This, of course, is not so. Chase National Bank v. Norwalk, \n291 \nU.S. 431, 441\n, 54 S.Ct. 475, 479.\n Appellants are in effect contending that no proceedings are here available to bring the constitutionality of the Florida statute before this Court, once the state court directed its enforcement. The Supreme Court of Florida itself manifested no such strangling conception of Section 265. It did not deem the proceedings initiated below as a denial of the right of way of a state court through an obstructive exercise of authority by a United States court. On the contrary, in staying 'all further proceedings and actions' until this Court had finally passed upon its constitutionality, the Supreme Court of Florida recognized the propriety of the present proceedings as an orderly mode for invoking the ultimate judicial voice on constitutional issues. Therefore, Section 265 has no relevance here. That provision is an historical mechanism (Act of March 2, 1793, 1 Stat. 334, 335) for achieving harmony in one phase of our complicated federalism by avoiding needless friction between two systems of courts having potential jurisdiction over the same subject-matter. Wells Fargo & Co. v. Taylor, \n254 \nU.S. 175, 183\n, 41 S.Ct. 93, 96. The present record presents no occasion for bringing this safeguard into play.\n We turn, therefore, to the merits.\n After reciting that 'during the past twelve months approximately thirty per centum (30%) of all cement sold and used in Florida was manufactured in foreign countries and imported'; that cement is 'an integral part of the construction' of 'large numbers' of buildings; that 'much of the foreign manufactured cement ... brought into the State of Florida has been of inferior \n\n[306 \nU.S. 375, 379]\n\u00a0\n quality'; that 'the importation ... and use of foreign cement not only jeopardizes public safety but amounts to unfair competition being forced on this great industry in Florida', the legislature of that State, in 1937, enacted the statute in controversy. Section 1, Comp.Gen.Laws Supp.Fla.  4151(512), authorizes the State Road Department of Florida 'to fix a minimum standard for all cement offered for sale or sold or used' within the State. Section 2, Comp.Gen.Laws Supp.Fla.  4151(513), enforces obedience to standards of quality thus to be set by the Department by provisions for inspection and for exaction of an inspection fee of fifteen cents per hundred weight. It is this section which gives the statute teeth. But this section-the scheme for inspection and for the inspection fee- applies only to 'cement imported or brought into the State of Florida from any foreign Country ....' The statute thus renders the 70% domestic cement immune from its requirements of inspection and its attendant fee. According to the uncontested allegation of the bill of complaint, this inspection fee is 'sixty times the actual cost of inspection.' Apart from this allegation, the Government, appearing as amicus and more particularly on behalf of the national interest represented by the Trade Agreements Act, 48 Stat. 943, 19 U.S.C.  1351, 19 U.S.C.A.  1351, gives perspective to the size of the fifteen cent fee by comparing it with the duty of six cents per one hundred pounds fixed by the Hawley-Smoot Act of 1930, 46 Stat. 590, 602, 19 U.S.C.  1001, par. 205(b) 19 U.S.C.A.  1001, par. 205( b), and with the duty of four and one-half cents fixed by the Belgian Trade Agreement of 1935, 49 Stat. 3680, 3691; 19 U.S.C.  1351, 19 U.S.C.A .  1351\n\n\n As grounds for this discrimination in the incidence of an obviously onerous exaction as between foreign and domestic cement, the preamble of the statute states that 'it is of paramount importance to the public safety that only cement measuring up to a minimum standard should be offered for sale, sold or used in the state of Florida,' \n\n[306 \nU.S. 375, 380]\n\u00a0\n and that the importation 'amounts to unfair competition being forced on this great industry in Florida.' So far as public safety demands certain standards in the quality of cement, such safety is dependent on assurance of that quality by appropriate inspection no less of the 70% domestic cement than of the 30% obtained from abroad. That no Florida cement needs any inspection while all foreign cement requires inspection at a cost of fifteen cents per hundred weight is too violent an assumption to justify the discrimination here cisclosed. The other justification-the competitive effect of foreign cement in the Florida market-is rather a candid admission that the very purpose of the statute is to keep out foreign goods. The Supreme Court of Florida gives no reason resting in local conditions for what appears to be a transparent discrimination in the imposition of heavy inspection fees as between imported and domestic cement, and none has been offered by appellants. The context of a particular statute may justify distinctive treatment of phases of interstate or foreign commerce. The circumstances may negative apparent discrimination in the difference of treatment. Such was the situation in Territory of New Mexico ex rel. McLean & Co. v. Denver & Rio Grande R.R. Co., \n203 \nU.S. 38\n, 27 S.Ct. 1, referred to by the Florida Supreme Court. But this is not that kind of a case. According the statute every presumption of validity, no reasonable conjecture can here overcome the calculated discrimination against foreign commerce.\n Such assumption of national powers by a state has, ever since March 12, 1827 (Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419), been found to be in collision with the Constitution. It can never be pleasant to invalidate the enactment of a state, particularly when it bears the imprimatur of constitutionality by the highest court of the state. But it would not be easy to imagine a statute more clearly designed than the present to circumvent what the Com- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 375, 381]\n\u00a0\n merce Clause forbids. Cook v. Pennsylvania, \n97 \nU.S. 566\n, 567; Voight v. Wright, \n141 \nU.S. 62\n, 11 S.Ct. 855.

Saunders, of New Orleans, La., for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[308 \nU.S. 365, 367]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. William N. Bonner, of Houston, Tex., and W. D. Gordon, of Beaumont Tex., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit for specific performance of a contract to purchase a mineral lease brought by respondents, as vendors. The contract price was to be determined pursuant to a formula based upon the production of certain designated wells on the property. That price was fixed at $300,000 'if the average daily production of said wells for a period of fifteen days after completion is less than \n\n[308 \nU.S. 365, 368]\n\u00a0\n 3,000 barrels each, calculated on a 3\/8-inch choke according to the methods usually employed in gauging the capacity of oil wells.' In case the production, calculated in that manner, was more than 3,000 barrels per day, the purchase price was fixed at $400,000. The test was to be made jointly by a representative of respondents and a representative of petitioner; and 'in the event they fail to agree on the proper gauge', it was provided that 'Judge Hardin ... will appoint a reputable engineer to act as umpire.'\n The parties failed to agree on the proper gauge and Judge Hardin appointed W. L. Massey, a petroleum engineer, to make the test. \n1\n Massey conducted a test and submitted a written report, which without objection was admitted at the trial. That report stated that although 'the well will not make 3,000 barrels per day on such 3\/8' choke', it was 'capable of flowing merchantable oil at a rate much in excess of 3,000 barrels of oil per day on an open flow, or through any choke larger than a 5\/8' choke.' At the trial there was other testimony that the production 'through a 3\/8- inch choke' was not more than 3,000 barrels a day. The trial court held that the contract meant that the well was to be flowed through a 3\/8-inch choke. Accordingly it dismissed the bill, since on that interpretation it was clear that the production was not more than 3,000 barrels a day and since petitioner already had paid $300,000. On appeal, the Circuit Court of Appeals held that the test provided in the contract 'was not to measure the production through a 3\/8-inch choke, but to calculate on a 3\/8-inch choke the amount the well was capable of producing.' It then turned to the record and ascertained that Massey, the umpire appointed pur- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 365, 369]\n\u00a0\n suant to the agreement of the parties, had found that by using the 3\/8- inch choke as a base and 'building up therefrom by using other chokes to determine pressures and conditions' the well was capable of producing much in excess of 3,000 barrels of oil per day. Since that calculation by Massey was consistent with the Circuit Court of Appeals' interpretation of the formula in the contract, that court concluded that petitioner was liable to pay the higher amount provided in the contract, $400,000. It accordingly reversed the judgment directing the District Court to enter judgment for respondents for $100,000, the balance due under the contract, with interest, 5 Cir., 102 F.2d 519, 103 F.2d 519. We granted certiorari, limited to the question whether a new trial should not have been granted, \n308 \nU.S. 537\n, 60 S.Ct. 76, 84 L.Ed. --, on the assertion that the failure to remand for a new trial deprived petitioner of his day in court in violation of the rule of Saunders v. Shaw, \n244 \nU.S. 317\n, 37 S.Ct. 638.\n We conclude that the Circuit Court of Appeals committed no error.\n The fact that the case was tried by the District Court on an interpretation of the contract different from that of the Circuit Court of Appeals is not per se sufficient to cause a remand for a new trial under the rule of Saunders v. Shaw, supra. The production of the well was tested by the umpire in the manner provided in the contract and the results of that test were without objection admitted at the trial. Complete establishment of the facts necessary for application of the formula was thus made in the manner provided by the parties in their contract. To be sure, petitioner now asserts that on a new trial he would attack the competency and accuracy of the umpire's report-matters which were immaterial to the issues on the trial in view of the fact that it was not contested that no more than 3,000 barrels of oil a day could be produced through a 3\/8-inch choke. But the difficulty with petitioner's position is that he has not pre- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 365, 370]\n\u00a0\n served that point. On his petition for rehearing to the Circuit Court of Appeals, petitioner did not ask that court to allow him a new trial in order to attack the umpire's report. \n2\n Nor was that the ground upon which the petition for certiorari was predicated. For review by this Court was sought and granted on the ground that the Circuit Court of Appeals had decided the merits on facts not contained in the record and on a theory which had never been tried by the litigants. There was no intimation in the petition for certiorari that a new trial should be granted in order to afford petitioner an opportunity to attack the competency and accuracy of the umpire's report. It is well settled that this Court confines itself to the ground upon which the writ was asked or granted, the review here being no broader than that sought by the petitioner. Clark v. Williard, \n294 \nU.S. 211, 216\n, 55 S.Ct. 356, 358, 98 A.L.R. 347; Helvering v. Tex- Penn Oil Co., \n300 \nU.S. 481, 498\n, 57 S.Ct. 569, 577; Washington, Virginia & Maryland Coach Co. v.

F. & R. LAZARUS & CO.(1939)\nNo. 56\nArgued: November 14, 1939Decided: December 4, 1939\n\n\n\n Messrs. Frank Murphy, Atty. Gen., and Norman D. Keller, Sp. Asst. to Atty. Gen., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Murray Seasongood and Robert P. Goldman, both of Cincinnati, Ohio, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In computing its net taxable income for 1930 and 1931, respondent claimed depreciation on three buildings occupied and used in its business as a department store. \n\n[308 \nU.S. 252, 253]\n\u00a0\n During those years, the legal title to two of these properties and an assignment of a ninety-nine year lease to the third were in a bank as trustee for certain land-trust certificate holders. These properties had been transferred to the trustee by the respondent in 1928 and the trustee had at the same time leased all three back to respondent for ninety-nine years, with option to renew and purchase. In claiming the deduction, respondent insisted that the capital loss from wear, tear, and exhaustion of the buildings was falling upon it, thus entitling it to the statutory allowance for depreciation of buildings. \n1\n The Commissioner disallowed this deduction on the ground that the statutory right to depreciation follows legal title. Reviewing the evidence, the Board of Tax Appeals concluded that the transaction between respondent and the trustee bank was in reality a mortgage loan and ordered the deduction allowed,2 and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 3 Upon facts which it considered 'in all essential respects identical,' the Court of Appeals for the Dis- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 252, 254]\n\u00a0\n trict of Columbia held depreciation not allowable. 4 Because of the different results reached by the Courts of Appeal, we granted certiorari. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n The Federal income tax is aimed at net income determined from gross income less items such as necessary expenses incurred or capital consumed in earning it. Thus, the controlling statute permits a taxpayer in computing net income to deduct a 'reasonable allowance for ... exhaustion, wear and tear.' While it may more often be that he who is both owner and user bears the burden of wear and exhaustion of business property in the nature of capital, one who is not the owner may nevertheless bear the burden of exhaustion of capital investment. Where it has been shown that a lessee using property in a trade or business must incur the loss resulting from depreciation of capital he has invested, the lessee has been held entitled to the statutory deduction. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n Here, the taxpayer used business property in which it had a depreciable capital investment, provided it had not recovered its investment through a sale. The Board in substantial effect found that the instrument under which the taxpayer purported to convey legal ownership to the trustee bank was in reality given and accepted as no more than security for a loan on the property; the 'rent' stipulated in the concurrently executed ninety-nine year 'lease' back was intended as a promise to pay an agreed five per cent interest on the loan; and the 'depreciation fund' required by the 'lease' was intended as an amortization fund, designed to pay off the loan \n\n[308 \nU.S. 252, 255]\n\u00a0\n in forty-eight and one-half years. These findings are supported by evidence which permits, at most, conflicting inferences and are, therefore, conclusive here. And, unless the Board committed error of law we must affirm. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n We think the Board justifiably concluded from its findings that the transaction between the taxpayer and the trustee bank, in written form a transfer of ownership with a lease back, was actually a loan secured by the property involved. General recognition has been given the 'established doctrine that a court of equity will treat a deed, absolute in form, as a mortgage, when it is executed as security for a loan of money.' \n8\n In the field of taxation, administrators of the laws and the courts are concerned with substance and realities, and formal written documents are not rigidly binding. Congress has specifically emphasized the equitable nature of proceedings before the Board of Tax Appeals by requiring the Board to act 'in accordance with the rules of evidence applicable in courts of equity of the District of Columbia.' Revenue Act 1928,  601, 26 U.S.C.  611, 26 U.S.C.A.Int.Rev.Acts, page 456.\n The Government relies in part upon Senior v. Braden, \n295 \nU.S. 422\n, 55 S.Ct. 800, 100 A.L.R. 794. Whatever the significance of that case, it can have no application here. In the Braden case, the equitable doctrine-here controlling-of looking to extrinsic evidence behind a transfer absolute on its face to determine whether only a security transaction was contemplated by the parties, was neither invoked nor passed upon.\n Judgment below is\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice REED took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Revenue Act of 1928, c. 852, 45 Stat. 791, 799-800.

METROPOLITAN EDISON CO.(1939)\nNo. 486\nArgued: March 10, 1939Decided: April 3, 1939\n\n\n\n Miss Helen R. Carloss, Sp. Asst. to Atty. Gen., for Commissioner of Internal Revenue.\n Mr. Maurice Bower Saul, of Philadelphia, Pa., for respondent Metropolitan Edison Co. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 522, 523]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Edwin M. Sturtevant, of Baltimore, Md., for respondent Pennsylvania Water & Power Co.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These cases present the question whether, under the Revenue Acts of 1926 and 1928,1 a Pennsylvania corporation may deduct unamortized bond discount and expense in connection with redemption of the bonds of a subsidiary, all of whose assets it had previously acquired pursuant to local law. The court below answered this question in the affirmative. \n2\n By reason of a direct conflict of decision we granted the writ of certiorari. \n 3\n\u00a0\n\n The respondent in No. 486 is a Pennsylvania corporation supplying electric light and power in that state and also operating, through subsidiaries, a system which serves communities in Pennsylvania and Maryland. It filed consolidated returns for itself and its subsidiaries for 1927 and 1928. During 1928 the company retired certain bonds of Pennsylvania corporations which were formerly subsidiaries whose obligations the taxpayer had assumed when it took over their assets by transfers effected pursuant to an Act of the General Assembly of April 29, 1874, as amended and supplemented. \n4\n When these obligations were redeemed there existed, with respect to them, unamortized discount and expense aggregating $752,481.26, which the company in its return deducted from gross income. The Commissioner ruled against the deduc- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 522, 524]\n\u00a0\n tion and determined a deficiency. The Board of Tax Appeals sustained the Commissioner. 5 The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the Board holding that the transactions whereby the taxpayer acquired the assets and assumed the liabilities of its former subsidiaries, pursuant to the statute, constituted a merger, as a consequence of which the subsidiaries ceased to exist by operation of law whereas the taxpayer continued to exist and became liable for the subsidiaries' debts both under contract and by operation of law. The court, therefore, held that the unamortized discount and expense was deductible in respect of the subsidiary's bonds.\n In 1923 the respondent in No. 486 desired to erect a generating plant for electric energy. Wishing to finance it by a separate bond issue the respondent organized Metropolitan Power Company, a Pennsylvania corporation, as a wholly owned subsidiary. The taxpayer purchased, guaranteed, and sold, at the same price it had purchased, $3,250,000 of bonds of the subsidiary; purchased all of its stock and loaned it on open account approximately $3,000,000. The Power Company held no public franchises and, under a contract with the taxpayer, sold all of its electricity to the latter at a price sufficient to enable it merely to earn the costs of operation and other charges, including depreciation, taxes, and interest. In 1927, pursuant to State authority, the Power Company sold all its assets subject to its liabilities to the taxpayer, a deficit from operations being charged against the taxpayer's surplus. At the time of the transfer the taxpayer surrendered the stock of the Power Company for cancellation and the latter became inactive and was dissolved in 1928. The taxpayer assumed liability for the outstanding bonds of the Power Company payment of which it \n\n[306 \nU.S. 522, 525]\n\u00a0\n had originally guaranteed and, during 1927, called them for redemption and redeemed them. At the time of the redemption there remained unamortized discount and expense incurred in issuing the bonds aggregating $308,097.90 which the taxpayer deducted from its gross income. The Commissioner ruled against the deduction and the Board of Tax Appeals sustained him. \n6\n The Court of Appeals reversed the Board, holding that, while the transaction was not consummated under the state statute it nevertheless was under state law a de facto merger and, the taxpayer was accordingly entitled to the deduction.\n The respondent in No. 487 is a Pennsylvania corporation operating a hydro electric plant at Holtwood, Pennsylvania. In 1924 it desired to provide its customers with a more adequate supply by an auxiliary steam power plant. As its corporate powers did not permit steam generation of electricity it caused the incorporation of a Pennsylvania company, known as Holtwood Power Company, all of whose shares were purchased and owned by the respondent. With the proceeds of the sale of the Power Company's stock and those of a bond issue the steam plant was erected. This plant sold all its output to the taxpayer which agreed, in return, to pay the Power Company's costs and expenses and an allowance for depreciation, and to pay a sum to provide for amortization of debt, discount, and security issue expense, and the expenses attending the issue, registration and transfer of the capital stock and bonds, all interest on bonds and other indebtedness, and a sum sufficient to provide a net return of eight per cent. on the Power Company's stock. The steam plant was managed by the taxpayer's officers and employes without compensation and was operated as a department of the taxpayer. In 1927 the taxpayer \n\n[306 \nU.S. 522, 526]\n\u00a0\n surrendered certain corporate powers so as to be in a position to effect a merger or consolidation with its subsidiary under the Pennsylvania statutes. \n7\n Thereupon the Power Company conveyed all of its assets and franchises to the taxpayer pursuant to the Pennsylvania Act of 1874 as amended, the sole consideration being the delivery to the subsidiary of all its capital stock held by the taxpayer and the assumption by the taxpayer of the subsidiary's indebtedness. The subsidiary ceased to exist. In 1928 the taxpayer retired the bonds of its former subsidiary and charged off unamortized discount and expense in respect of them in the sum of $145,159.52 and, in its income tax return for that year, claimed a small deduction for amortization for a portion of the year prior to the retirement, and a deduction of the balance of the sum above mentioned as of the date when the retirement took place. The Commissioner disallowed the deduction and determined a deficiency. The Board of Tax Appeals sustained the ruling. \n8\n The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the Board.\n The petitioner concedes that if there has been a true merger or consolidation whereby the identity of the corporation issuing the bonds continues in the successor and the latter becomes liable for the debts of the former by operation of law, the successor may deduct amortization of discount and expense in respect of bonds issued by its predecessor as well as unamortized discount and expense on any of such bonds retired prior to maturity. \n9\n The \n\n[306 \nU.S. 522, 527]\n\u00a0\n rule is not applicable upon a mere sale by one corporation of all its assets to another which assumes the liabilities of the former. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n The contention of the petitioner is that the transactions in issue fall within the latter category. The respondents, on the other hand, insist that, in the light of the applicable statute of Pennsylvania and the decisions of her courts, the transactions constituted mergers in the proper acceptation of that term. The question, then, is solely one respecting the law of Pennsylvania.\n Until the complete revision of the corporation laws of the Commonwealth in 1933 there were but two statutes available to corporations seeking to merge or consolidate. The Act of April 29, 1874,  23, supra, so far as material, provides that any corporation, with the consent of its stockholders, may 'sell, assign, dispose of and convey to any corporation created under or accepting the provisions of this act, its franchises, and all its property, real, personal and mixed, and thereafter such corporation shall cease to exist, and the said property and franchises not inconsistent with this act, shall the thereafter be vested in the corporation so purchasing as aforesaid ....' The Act of May 3, 1909,11 permits what it terms a merger but what is in truth a consolidation to be effected by a joint agreement of two or more corporations approved by the stockholders setting forth the terms and conditions of the merger and consolidation and providing for the organization of a new corporation to which the franchises and property of the consolidating corporations are to be transferred. This act contemplates the issue of letters patent to the consolidated corporation, and the issue of new stock by it, in lieu of that of the old. The procedure \n\n[306 \nU.S. 522, 528]\n\u00a0\n under the Act of 1874 has repeatedly been referred to in the decisions of the Supreme Court of the Commonwealth as the 'short form' and that under the Act of 1909 as the 'long form' of merger. \n12\n\u00a0\n\n Inasmuch as the transfer of the franchises and assets is authorized by statute, it seems reasonably clear that the transferee is, as matter of law, liable for the obligation of the transferor. The cases indicate that this is so.13 The petitioner argues and the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has held to the contrary, in reliance on Merwine v. Mt. Pocono Light & Imp. Co., 304 Pa. 517, 156 A. 150, 152. That court thought the case indicated that the liability, if any, of the transferee was not under the statute but was only that of a fraudulent transferee under 13 Eliz., chap. 5. Action for a tort had been brought against the transferor prior to a transfer under the Act of 1874. After the conveyance the defendant filed a suggestion that the property had been conveyed in proceedings under the Act, that the defendant had ceased to exist, and that the action should be abated. The plaintiff sought to substitute the transferee as defendant. The trial court denied substitution and abated the action. The Supreme Court held that the termination of corporate existence of the defendant under the Act of 1874 did not abate the action, but that if the plaintiff recovered a judgment she could 'levy where defendant's assets liable for the judgment may be found', which seems to \n\n[306 \nU.S. 522, 529]\n\u00a0\n us to mean no more than that the assets after the conveyance remained subject to the transferor's liabilities. A transfer fully authorized by statute cannot be a fraudulent conveyance within the 13 Eliz.\n We are of opinion that a transfer without valuable consideration, with the intent that the transferor shall, as the statute provides, cease to exist, made in accordance with the statute, has all the elements of a merger and comes within the principle that the corporate personality of the transferor is drowned in that of the transferee. It results that the continuing corporation may deduct unamortized bond discount and expense in respect of the obligations of the transferring affiliate.\n A somewhat different question arises with respect to the transfer of assets of Metropolitan Power Company. It is admitted that this transfer was not made in accordance with the terms of the Act of 1874. No franchises were transferred because the Metropolitan Power Company held no public franchises of any kind. The transfer was merely of assets with the assumption of all the liabilities by the transferee. It is important to note, however, that amongst the liabilities assumed were bonds on which the parent company was already liable as guarantor. The court below has held, and we concur, that, under the law of Pennsylvania, the transfer in question constituted a de facto merger, even though the transfer did not comply with all the provisions of the Act of 1874, 14 and that, as matter of law, the taxpayer would be liable for the debts of the transferor.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Revenue Act of 1926,  200(d), 212(b), 232 and 234(a)(1)(2) and (4 ), 44 Stat. 9, 10, 23, 41, 42; Revenue Act of 1928,  23(a)(b) and (f), 41, 42, 43, 48, 45 Stat. 791, 799, 800, 805, 807, 26 U.S.C.A.  23(a, b, f), 41-43, 48. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Metropolitan Edison Co. v.

Keller, of Washington, D.C., for Commissioner of Internal Revenue.\n Mr. Ewing Everett, of New York City, for Owens and Obici.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The court below have given opposing answers to the question whether the basis for determining the amount of a loss sustained during the taxable year through injury to property not used in a trade or business, and therefore not the subject of an annual depreciation allowance, should be original cost or value immediately before the casualty. \n1\n To resolve this conflict we granted certiorari in both cases. \n305 \nU.S. 582\n, 59 S.Ct. 79, 83 L.Ed. --; \n305 \nU.S. 585\n, 59 S.Ct. 97, 83 L.Ed. --.\n In No. 180 the facts are that the respondent Donald H. Owens purchased an automobile at a date subsequent to March 1, 1913, and prior to 1934, for $1,825, and used it for pleasure until June 1934 when it was damaged in a collision. The car was not insured. Prior to the accident its fair market value was $225; after that event the fair market value was $ 190. The respondents filed a joint income tax return for the calendar year 1934 in which they claimed a deduction of $1635, the difference between cost and fair market value after the casualty. The Commissioner reduced the deduction to $35, the difference in market value before and after the collision. The Board of Tax Appeals sustained the taxpayers' claim and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed its ruling. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 468, 470]\n\u00a0\n In No. 318 it appears that the taxpayers acquired a boat, boathouse, and pier in 1926 at a cost of $5,325. In August 1933 the property, which had been used solely for pleasure, and was uninsured, was totally destroyed by a storm. Its actual value immediately prior to destruction was $3,905. The taxpayers claimed the right to deduct cost in the computation of taxable income. The Commissioner allowed only value at date of destruction. The Board of Tax Appeals held with the taxpayers but the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the Board's ruling.\n Decision in No. 180 is governed by the Revenue Act of 1934;2 in No. 318 by the Revenue Act of 1932.3 The provisions of both statutes touching the question presented are substantially the same and we shall refer only to those of the 1934 Act. Section 23(e)(3) permits deduction from gross income of losses 'of property not connected with the trade or business' of the taxpayer,' 'if the loss arises from ... casualty.' Subsection (h) declares that 'The basis for determining the amount of the deduction for losses sustained, to be allowed under subsection (e) ..., shall be the adjusted basis provided in section 113(b).' Section 113 is entitled 'Adjusted basis for determining gain or loss'; in subsection (a) it provides that 'The basis of property shall be the cost of such property', with exceptions not material. Subsection (b), to which 23(h) refers, is: 'Adjusted basis. The adjusted basis for determining the gain or loss from the sale or other disposition of property, whenever acquired, shall be the basis determined under subsection (a), adjusted as hereinafter provided. ( 1) General rule. Proper adjustment in respect of the property shall in all cases be made- ... (B) in respect of any period since February 28, 1913, for \n\n[305 \nU.S. 468, 471]\n\u00a0\n exhaustion, wear and tear, obsolescence, amortization, and depletion, to the extent allowed (but not less than the amount allowable) under this Act or prior income-tax laws.'\n The income tax acts have consistently allowed deduction for exhaustion, wear and tear, or obsolescence only in the case of 'property used in the trade or business.' The taxpayers in these cases could not, therefore, have claimed any deduction on this account for years prior to that in which the casualty occurred. For this reason they claim they may deduct upon the unadjusted basis,-that is,-cost. As the income tax laws call for accounting on an annual basis; as they provide for deductions for 'losses sustained during the taxable year'; as the taxpayer is not allowed annual deductions for depreciation of non-business property; as section 23( h) requires that the deduction shall be on 'the adjusted basis provided in section 113(b)', thus contemplating an adjustment of value consequent on depreciation; and as the property involved was subject to depreciation and of less value in the taxable year, than its original cost, we think section 113(b)(1)(B) must be read as a limitation upon the amount of the deduction so that it may not exceed cost, and in the case of depreciable non-business property may not exceed the amount of the loss actually sustained in the taxable year, measured by the then depreciated value of the property. The Treasury rulings have not been consistent, but this construction is the one which has finally been adopted. \n 4\n\u00a0\n\n In No. 180 judgment reversed.\n In No. 318 judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Helvering v.

REYNOLDS TOBACCO CO.(1939)\nNo. 328\nArgued: January 6, 1939Decided: January 30, 1939\n\n\n\n\n[306 \nU.S. 110, 111]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Paul A. Freund, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. J. G. Korner, Jr., of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The sole question for decision is whether gain accruing to a corporation consequent on the purchase and re- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 110, 112]\n\u00a0\n sale of its own shares constitutes gross income within the meaning of Section 22(a) of the Revenue Act of 1928.1\n The respondent, a New Jersey corporation, on occasions between 1921 and 1929, purchased its own Class B common stock for reasons of policy, such as the elimination of a very large single holding, the broadening of the ownership of the stock, and the support of the market to protect the investments of employee shareholders. This stock was resold from time to time. While held it was treated as treasury stock and the cost of it was entered in the accounts as 'Investments in Non-competitive Companies'. The books showed no increase or reduction of capital stock on account of purchases or sales. During 1929 the company sold shares acquired in that and prior years for a sum which exceeded cost by $286,581.21, which amount was entered in the books as a cash item and added to surplus. In its income tax return for 1929 the company listed this gain under the caption 'Other Items of Non-Taxable Income', as 'Profit R.J.R. Stock'.\n The Commissioner determined a deficiency in the tax paid for 1929 involving items not here in controversy and the company appealed to the Board of Tax Appeals where those items were adjusted. Before the case was closed the Commissioner by amended answer alleged that the taxpayer's net income should be increased by the amount of the 'net profit realized ... through trafficking in Class B common stock of the ... company', and claimed a resulting deficiency. He based his claim upon Treasury Regulation 74, Article 66, as amended by a Treasury decision of May 2, 1934,2 which states 'where a corporation deals in its own shares as it might in the shares of another corporation, the resulting gain or loss \n\n[306 \nU.S. 110, 113]\n\u00a0\n is to be computed in the same manner as though the corporation were dealing in the shares of another.'\n The Board, after finding the facts in detail, sustained the Commissioner. \n3\n The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the Board's ruling. \n4\n Because of asserted conflict we granted the writ of certiorari,5 \n305 \nU.S. 587\n, 59 S.Ct. 101, 83 L.Ed. --.\n Section 22(a) is: 'General definition. 'Gross income' includes gains, profits, and income derived from salaries, wages, or compensation for personal service, of whatever kind and in whatever form paid, or from professions, vocations, trades, businesses, commerce, or sales, or dealings in property, whether real or personal, growing out of the ownership or use of or interest in such property; also from interest, rent, dividends, securities, or the transaction of any business carried on for gain or profit, or gains or profits and income derived from any source whatever.' Section 62, 26 U.S.C.A.  62, directs the Commissioner, 'with the approval of the Secretary' of the Treasury, to 'prescribe and publish all needful rules and regulations for the enforcement of this title ( chapter).' Article 66 of Treasury Regulations 74, promulgated under the Act of 1928, so far as material, is: 'If ... the corporation purchases any of its stock and holds it as treasury stock, the sale of such stock will be considered a capital transaction and the proceeds of such sale will be treated as capital and will not constitute income of the corporation. A corporation realizes no gain or loss from the purchase or sale of its own stock.'\n Petitioner contends that, as Congress must be taken to have exercised its constitutional power to the fullest extent in laying the tax, Section 22(a) should be held to include the gain realized from sales of a corporation's own \n\n[306 \nU.S. 110, 114]\n\u00a0\n stock, and the quoted regulation cannot restrict the scope of the statutory definition. The respondent replies that such gain is capital gain and not income, as is demonstrated by the theory and practice of accounting6 and by court decisions. \n7\n The court below found it unnecessary to decide this issue, holding that whether the increment is income is at least a debatable question and the regulation was, therefore, proper as an interpretation of the meaning of the section. We agree that Section 22(a) is so general in its terms as to render an interpretative regulation appropriate. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n The administrative construction embodied in the regulation has, since at least 1920, been uniform with respect to each of the revenue acts from that of 1913 to that of 1932, as evidenced by Treasury rulings and regulations, and decisions of the Board of Tax Appeals. \n9\n In the \n\n[306 \nU.S. 110, 115]\n\u00a0\n meantime successive revenue acts have reenacted, without alteration, the definition of gross income as it stood in the Acts of 1913, 1916, and 1918. 10 Under the established rule Congress must be taken to have approved the administrative construction and thereby to have given it the force of law.\n The petitioner concedes that if nothing further appeared he would be bound to apply the statute in conformity to the regulation. He asserts, however, that the amendment adopted by the Treasury May 2, 1934, while this cause was pending before the Board, is controlling. By the amendment Article 66 is made to read: 'Whether the acquisition or disposition by a corporation of shares of its own capital stock gives rise to taxable gain or deductible loss depends upon the real nature of the transaction, which is to be ascertained from all its facts and circumstances. ...\n'But where a corporation deals in its own shares as it might in the shares of another corporation, the resulting gain or loss is to be computed in the same manner as though the corporation were dealing in the shares of another. ... Any gain derived from such transactions is subject to tax, and any loss sustained is allowable as a deduction where permitted by the provisions of applicable statutes.'\n\n Petitoner urges that the amendment operates retroactively and governs the ascertainment of gross income for taxable periods prior to the date of its promulgation, and, further, since Congress has reenacted Section 22(a) in the Revenue Acts of 1936 and 1938, 26 U.S.C.A.  22(a) it has approved the regu- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 110, 116]\n\u00a0\n lation as amended. We hold that the respondent's tax liability for the year 1929 is to be determined in conformity to the regulation then in force.\n Section 605 of the Revenue Act of 1928 provides that 'In case a regulation or Treasury decision relating to the internalrevenue laws is amended by a subsequent regulation or Treasury decision, made by the Secretary or by the Commissioner with the approval of the Secretary, such subsequent regulation or Treasury decision may, with the approval of the Secretary, be applied without retroactive effect.' \n11\n It is clear from this provision that Congress intended to give to the Treasury power to correct misinterpretations, inaccuracies, or omissions in the regulations and thereby to affect cases in which the taxpayer's liability had not been finally determined, unless, in the judgment of the Treasury, some good reason required that such alterations operate only prospectively. The question is whether the granted power may be exercised in an instance where, by repeated reenactment of the statute, Congress has given its sanction to the existing regulation.\n Since the legislative approval of existing regulations by reenactment of the statutory provision to which they appertain gives such regulations the force of law, we think that Congress did not intend to authorize the Treasury to repeal the rule of law that existed during the period for which the tax is imposed. We need not now determine whether, as has been suggested,12 the alteration of the existing rule, even for the future, requires a legislative declaration or may be shown by reenactment of the statutory provision unaltered after a change in the ap- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 110, 117]\n\u00a0\n plicable regulation. As the petitioner points out, Congress has, in the Revenue Acts of 1936 and 1938, retained Section 22(a) of the 1928 Act in haec verba. From this it is argued that Congress has approved the amended regulation. It may be that by the passage of the Revenue Act of 1936 the Treasury was authorized thereafter to apply the regulation in its amended form. But we have no occasion to decide this question since we are of opinion that the reenactment of the section, without more, does not amount to sanction of retroactive enforcement of the amendment, in the teeth of the former regulation which received Congressional approval, by the passage of successive Revenue Acts including that of 1928\n\n\n The judgment is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] c. 852, 45 Stat. 791, 797, 26 U.S.C.A.  22(a). \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Treasury decision 4430, XIII-1 Cumulative Bulletin 36. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] R.

Frank Murphy, Atty. Gen., and Arnold Raum, Sp. Asst. Atty. Gen., for petitioner.\n Mr. Joseph D. Brady, of Los Angeles, Cal., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case presents the question whether respondent, Wilshire Oil Company, Inc., in computing its net income for the years 1929 and 1930 for the purpose of applying the 50 per cent limitation on depletion allowance under  114(b)(3) of the Revenue Act of 1928, 45 Stat. 791, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 384, may refuse to take as deductions certain development expenditures,1 where it has deducted those development \n\n[308 \nU.S. 90, 93]\n\u00a0\n expenditures in computing its taxable net income for those years. The Board of Tax Appeals held for the respondent (35 B.T.A. 450) and that decision was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, one judge dissenting (9 Cir., 95 F.2d 971). Because of the importance of the problem of the scope of the Commissioner's rule-making power and because of an asserted conflict of the decision below with the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. F.H.E. Oil Co., 102 F.2d 596, we granted certiorari, \n306 \nU.S. 628\n, 59 S. Ct. 773.\n Respondent is engaged in the business of producing oil and gas from its various properties. In computing taxable net income in its returns for 1929 and 1930 respondent, pursuant to the regulations, deducted development expenditures in the respective amounts of $606,051.66 and $279, 927.04. But it refused to make those deductions in determining its 'net income ... from the property' for the same years, when computing allowable depletion under  114(b) (3) of the Revenue Act of 1928.2 \n\n[308 \nU.S. 90, 94]\n\u00a0\n That section provides:\n'In the case of oil and gas wells the allowance for depletion shall be 27 1\/2 per centum of the gross income from the property during the taxable year. Such allowance shall not exceed 50 per centum of the net income of the taxpayer (computed without allowance for depletion) from the property, except that in no case shall the depletion allowance be less than it would be if computed without reference to this paragraph.'\n\n By virtue of  23 of the Revenue Act of 1928, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev. Acts, page 356, companies like respondent were allowed as deductions in computing net income a 'reasonable allowance for depletion ... according to the peculiar conditions in each case; such reasonable allowance in all cases to be made under rules and regulations to be prescribed by the Commissioner, with the approval of the Secretary.' Pursuant to that rule- making power the phrase 'net income of the taxpayer (computed without allowance for depletion)' as used in  114(b)(3) was defined by Treasury Regulations 74, Art. 221(i) promulgated under the 1928 Act as meaning 'gross income from the sale of oil and gas' less certain deductions including 'development expenses (if the tax- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 90, 95]\n\u00a0\n payer has elected to deduct development expenses) ... but excluding any allowance for depletion'. For 1925 respondent, having the option to treat these expenses as deductions for development expenses or as charges to the capital account returnable through depletion,3 chose the former.\n On these facts it would seem that Treasury Regulations 74, Art. 221(i) would require respondent to deduct development expenses in computing 'net income' as used in  114(b)(3), since respondent fell clearly within the class described therein.\n But respondent contends that these regulations as applied to it for the taxable years in question are invalid. Its argument runs as follows: ( 1) The phrase 'net income ... from the property' present in  114(b)(3) originated in  234(a)(9) of the Revenue Act of 1921, 42 Stat. 227, 256 and was reenacted without change in  204(c) of the 1924 Act, 43 Stat. 253, 260, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 10. It was also carried over into  204(c)(2) of the 1926 Act, 44 Stat. 9, 16, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 154, when Congress adopted the present so-called percentage depletion formula. Shortly after the enactment of the Revenue Act of 1921, Treasury Regulations were issued defining net 'income ... from the property' as meaning gross income from the property less 'operating expenses'.4 A similar definition was given in the Treasury Regulations issued under the Revenue Act of 1924.5 The admitted Treasury practice under those two Acts \n\n[308 \nU.S. 90, 96]\n\u00a0\n was to permit net income from the property to be computed without regard to development expenditures. Hence respondent argues, the meaning of the phrase 'net income ... from the property' had acquired a plain and definite meaning, known to the Congress; thus when that phrase was reenacted in the 1924 Act, the Congress intended it to have the meaning which administrative practice had given it. And, the argument continues, that meaning having been adopted by the Congress in the 1924 Act, it clung to the same phrase in the 1926 Act6 and in the 1928 Act, especially since the Commissioner prior to February 15, 19297 never did undertake by regulation or decision to give that phrase a meaning different from that which had been consistently applied under the earlier Acts.\n\n\n (2)\n Secondly, respondent contends that the fact that it deducted development expenses in computing taxable net income does not mean that it is required to make the same deductions for the 'net income' computation under  114(b)(3) for the reason that it had no free choice in the first of these computations. In that connection it points out that it was required to make these deductions from gross income by reason of its election in its 1925 return to treat these expenses as deductions for development expenses rather than as charges to capital account returnable through depletion, an election binding for all subsequent years. In that posture of the \n\n[308 \nU.S. 90, 97]\n\u00a0\n case it argues that the attempted change in the regulations here involved has a retroactive effect, as applied to, it and withdraws one of the important inducements offered by the Commissioner in connection with the election which respondent made in its 1925 return.\n We do not think that respondent's position is tenable.\n As to respondent's claim of retroactivity, it is true that the election made in connection with its 1925 return was known to be binding for all subsequent years. It is likewise true that it was made at a time when Treasury practice did not require deduction of development expenses in making the computation under  114(b)(3). But that is no basis for a claim of retroactivity. Treasury Regulations 74, Art. 221(i) which required the deduction of development expenses for the purpose of the computation under  114(b)(3) were issued February 15, 1929 under the 1928 Act. These regulations applied prospectively only and did not purport to reach back to earlier years when the taxpayer relied on a different rule or practice. Tax statutes and tax regulations never have been static. Experience, changing needs, changing philosophies inevitably produce constant change in each. One making an election in the 1925 return took the risk that the method of treatment of depletion might be changed by the Congress, or, where power existed, by the Commissioner. Any other conclusion would make the application of changes pursuant to regulations, though prospective, dependent on fortuitous circumstances under which each taxpayer made such an election. Rigidity, as well as confusion, in administration of tax laws would be the result.\n But in this case there is another answer to respondent's claim that an inequity results by changing the regulations after it had made its election in the 1925 return. On June 18, 1927, the Commissioner, with the \n\n[308 \nU.S. 90, 98]\n\u00a0\n approval of the Secretary, issued a Treasury Decision8 stating that 'In view of the change in the basis for depletion provided by the Revenue Act of 1926, in the case of oil and gas wells, taxpayers may make a new election as to the treatment' of development expenditures 'for taxable periods ending on or after January 1, 1925, but not later than six months after the date of this decision.' Taxpayers desiring to make a new election were required to file amended returns for the taxable periods involved within six months from the date of that decision. Thus respondent, after Congress adopted the new percentage depletion provision, was afforded ample opportunity to make a new election. This it did not do. To be sure that Treasury Decision contained no notice of any projected change in the meaning of 'net income ... from property' as used in  114(b) (3). But in September 1927 there issued a General Counsel's Memorandum9 in which it was stated that thereafter 'if a taxpayer elects to treat development expenditures as ordinary and necessary business expenses ... in computing taxable net income, such expenditures must be deducted in determining the net income from the property, which amount is used as a limitation in the computation of the depletion allowance based on income'. To be sure this was merely an opinion of the General Counsel of the Bureau and did not have the force or effect of a Treasury Decision. Yet in view of such ruling, there is now no reasonable basis for concluding that when respondent made its second election in 1927 it had no basis for assuming that the policy as respects 'net income ... from the property' under the 1926 Act was or would be no different than it had been under the 1921 and 1924 Acts. Therefore, in terms of equitable considerations respond- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 90, 99]\n\u00a0\n ent has no just ground of complaint. On these facts substantial justice requires that respondent take such burdens as may flow from its election along with the benefits.\n Irrespective of these considerations, we think the regulations in question were valid. It is true, as stated by respondent, that the regulations under the 1921 Act provided that the 'net income ... from the property' should be computed for purpose of the depletion allowance without regard to development expenditures. And it may be assumed that that administrative construction received legislative approval by the reenactment of the statutory provision in the 1924 Act, without material change. Cf. United States v. Dakota-Montana Oil Co., \n288 \nU.S. 459, 466\n, 53 S.Ct. 435. But that does not mean that that meaning survived both the 1926 and the 1928 Acts. In the first place, there were no comparable regulations under the 1926 Act. \n10\n In fact, the Commissioner under- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 90, 100]\n\u00a0\n took under that Act to follow the practice later set forth in the regulations here in question. See Ambassador Petroleum Co. v. Commissioner, 9 Cir., 81 F.2d 474. Those facts are of some significance here for they refute the suggestion that the Congress in enacting the 1928 Act was giving approval to an administrative construction which had been given to comparable provisions of earlier Acts but which was abandoned before the passage of the 1928 Act. The more reasonable inference seems to be that reenactment of the provision in question by the 1928 Act at a time when Treasury policy as respects its construction had changed did nothing more than to restore to the phrase 'net income ... from the property' its original ambiguity. Accordingly that phrase became peculiarly susceptible to new administrative interpretation. Helvering v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., \n306 \nU.S. 110\n, 59 S.Ct. 423; Morrissey v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, \n296 \nU.S. 344\n, 56 S.Ct. 289.\n But in any event, the validity of the regulations in question seems clear. The oft-repeated statement that administrative construction receives legislative approval by reenactment of a statutory provision, without material change (United States v. Dakota-Montana Oil Co., supra) covers the situation where the validity of administrative action standing by itself may be dubious or where ambiguities in a statute or rules are resolved by reference to administrative practice prior to reenactment of a statute; and where it does not appear that the rule or practice has been changed by the administrative agency through exercise of its continuing rule-making power. It does not mean that a regulation interpreting a provision of one act becomes frozen into another act merely by reenactment of that provision, so that that administrative interpretation cannot be changed prospectively through exercise of appropriate rule-making powers. Cf. Morrissey v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, supra, 296 U.S. at page 355, 56 S.Ct. at page 294. The contrary conclusion \n\n[308 \nU.S. 90, 101]\n\u00a0\n would not only drastically curtail the scope and materially impair the flexibility of administrative action; it would produce a most awkward situation. Outstanding regulations which had survived one Act could be changed only after a pre-view by the Congress. In preparation for a new revenue Act the Commissioner would have to prepare in advance new regulations covering old provisions. Their effectiveness would have to await Congressional approval of the new Act. The effect of such procedure, so far as time is concerned, would be precisely the same as if these new regulations were submitted to the Congress for approval. Such dilution of administrative powers would deprive the administrative process of some of its most valuable qualities-ease of adjustment to change, flexibility in light of experience, swiftness in meeting new or emergency situations. It would make the administrative process under these circumstances cumbersome and slow. Known inequities in existing regulations would have to await the advent of a new revenue act. Paralysis in effort to keep abreast of changes in business practices and new conditions would redound at times to the detriment of the revenue; at times to the disadvantage of the taxpayer. Likewise the result would be to read into the grant of express administrative powers an implied condition that they were not to be exercised unless, in effect, the Congress had consented. We do not believe that such impairment of the administrative process is consistent with the statutory scheme which the Congress has designed.\n The only remaining question is whether Treasury Regulations 74, Art. 221 (i) were within the power of the Commissioner to promulgate. That they were seems clear beyond question. We are not dealing here, as was this Court in Helvering v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., supra, with regulations applied retroactively. These are \n\n[308 \nU.S. 90, 102]\n\u00a0\n applied prospectively only. The rule-making power here in question may be found in  23(l) of the Revenue Act of 1928, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 358. That section, after providing that companies like respondent were entitled, as a deduction in computing net income, to a 'reasonable allowance for depletion ... according to the peculiar conditions in each case' laid especial emphasis on the power of the Commissioner to make rules for the computation of the depletion allowance, by providing that 'such reasonable allowance in all cases (is) to be made under rules and regulations to be prescribed by the Commissioner, with the approval of the Secretary'.\n Respondent does not strongly urge that the regulatory power conferred by  23(l) does not extend to the percentage depletion allowance under  114(b)(3). Rather the contention seems to be that to allow the Commissioner by regulation to change the measure of 'net income ... from the property' from time to time, especially in the manner here attempted, would be to approve a result equally as contrary to the intention of Congress as if he had attempted by regulation to change the percentage factors themselves. But the scope or importance of the change effected by the regulations is immaterial if the power to promulgate such regulations exists. Here the Congress has not prescribed a precise formula free from all ambiguity. The ambiguous phrase 'net income ... from the property' was susceptible of various meanings and hence administrative interpretation of it was peculiarly appropriate, as we have said. And there were special reasons growing out of the complex nature of the depletion problem as it is treated for purposes of the income tax, for requiring the Commissioner to make precise the vague elements of that formula. In its general aspects under revenue acts depletion is a problem on which taxpayers, government and accountants \n\n[308 \nU.S. 90, 103]\n\u00a0\n have expressed a contrariety of opinions. 11 Obfuscation in attempted application of its principles under income tax laws has frequently been the result. The Congress itself, as revealed in the history of the revenue acts, has expressed varying philosophies. In practical administration of any one statute there are admittedly borderline cases between deductible business expenses and non-deductible capital outlays. On specific fact situations the clear line between depletion, depreciation, and obsolescence often becomes blurred. \n12\n What those lines are or should be is for the Congress and the Commissioner. Experience and new insight can be expected to produce rather constant change. In sum, the highly technical and involved factors entering into a practical solution of the problem of depletion in administration of the tax laws points to the necessity of interpreting  23(l) so as to strengthen rather than to weaken the administrative powers to deal with it equitably and reasonably. These considerations are persuasive here not only in reaffirming the conclusion that the rule-making power existed, but also in concluding that restrictions on that power should not be lightly imposed where the incidence of such rules as are promulgated is prospective only.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice BUTLER and Mr. Justice REED took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] These expenditures consisted of such items as labor, fuel and power, materials and supplies, tool rental, truck and auto hire, repairs to drilling equipment and depreciation upon equipment used in drilling. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] For the year 1929 the Commissioner's computations were as follows: Gross Income from the properties $1,001,375.17 Deductions: Production expense $171,399.03 Development expense 606,051.66 Total expenses 777,450.69\n Net income from property (computed without allowance for depletion) $223,924.48 50 per cent of that income $111,962.24\n Gross Income from the properties $1,001,375.17 Deductions:\n The Commissioner limited the depletion allowance to the last mentioned figure since 50 per cent of the net income from the property as thus computed was less than 27 1\/2 per cent of the gross income.\n Under the taxpayers computation, the net income for depletion purposes would be $1,001,375.17 less $171,399.03 or $829,976.14 and 50 per cent thereof would not be less than 27 1\/2 per cent of the gross income.\n For the year 1930 the Commissioner's computation showed a loss of $ 194,869.22. He therefore ruled that since the percentage depletion allowance was limited to 50 per cent of the net income from the properties and since the taxpayer had no such net income, no deduction on account of percentage depletion could be allowed. The taxpayer refused, however, to deduct development expenses in the application of the 50 per cent limitation and claimed a depletion deduction of $42,528.91, arrived at as follows:\n Gross income from the properties $370,448.72 Deductions: Production expense 285,390.90\n Net income $85,057.82 Depletion deduction (50 per cent of net income) $42,528.91\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Treasury Regulations 69, Art. 223, promulgated under the Revenue Act of 1926 provides that 'such incidental expenses as are paid for ... development of the property may at the option of the taxpayer be deducted as a development expense or charged to capital account returnable through depletion. ... An election once made under the provisions of this article will control the taxpayer's returns for all subsequent years.' \n[\nFootnote 4\n] Treasury Regulations 62, Art. 201(h). \n[\nFootnote 5\n] Treasury Regulations 65, Art. 201(h). \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Respondent points to the Report of Committee on Ways and Means on Revenue Bill of 1926 (H.Rep. No. 1, 69th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 6): 'The discovery depletion deduction limitation of an amount not in excess of 50 per cent of the net income of the taxpayer from the property upon which discovery was made, provided in existing law, is retained in the provision.' \n[\nFootnote 7\n] The date when Treasury Regulations 74, Art. 221(i), here in question, were promulgated. \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Treasury Decision 4025, Cum.Bul. VI-1, p. 75. \n[\nFootnote 9\n] G.C.M. 2315, Cum.Bul. VI-2, p. 21. \n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] As respects discovery depletion in the case of mines under the 1926 Act, provisions similar to those under the 1921 and 1924 Acts were retained. Treasury Regulations 69, Art. 201(h). But this was not true as respects oil and gas wells.  204(c)(2) of the Revenue Act of 1926 applied the percentage depletion allowance exclusively to 'oil and gas wells'. Treasury Regulations 69, Art. 221, provided:\n'Under section 204(c)(2), in the case of oil and gas wells, a taxpayer may deduct for depletion an amount equal to 27 1\/2 per cent of the gross income from the property during the taxable year, but such deduction shall not exceed 50 per cent of the net income of the taxpayer ( computed without allowance for depletion) from the property. In no case shall the deduction computed under this paragraph be less than it would be if computed upon the basis of the cost of the property or its value at the basic date, as the case may be. In general, 'the property,' as the term is used in section 204(c)(2) and this article, refers to the separate tracts or leases of the taxpayer.'\n\n Thus, it is apparent that the delimitation implied in the permission to deduct 'operating expenses' present under the earlier regulations disappeared from the 1926 regulations in case of oil and gas wells. \n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] 2 Paul & Mertens, The Law of Federal Income Taxation (1934), ch. 21; 47 Yale L.

CITY OF BATON ROUGE, LA.(1939)\nNo. 462\nArgued: March 3, 1939Decided: April 17, 1939\n\n\n\n Rehearing Denied May 15, 1939\n\n\n See 307 U.S. --, 59 S.Ct. 831, 83 L.Ed. --.\n Messrs. Paul G. Borron, of Baton Rouge, La., and Edward Rightor, of New Orleans, La., for appellant.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The City of Baton Rouge, in March, 1935, pursuant to Act No. 1 of the First Extraordinary Session of 1935 of the legislature of Louisiana, adopted an ordinance declar- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 535, 536]\n\u00a0\n ing that the City was without authority to retain appellant, Powers Higginbotham, as Superintendent of Public Parks and Streets, and that his employment in that capacity was terminated. Contending that he had been employed for a term continuing until November, 1936, and that the legislation abovementioned constituted an impairment of the obligation of his contract in violation of Section 10 of Article 1 of the Constitution of the United States, U.S.C.A., appellant brought this suit to recover the balance of his salary for the stated term. The Supreme Court of the State affirmed the judgment dismissing his complaint. 190 La. 821, 183 So. 168.\n The pertinent legislation with respect to the municipal position in question is comprehensively reviewed in the opinion of the state court. It appears that the City of Baton Rouge has a commission form of government adopted in 1914 under the provisions of Act No. 207 of 1912. The authority of the Commission Council is divided among three departments, viz. (1) the Department of Public Health and Safety, (2) the Department of Finance, and ( 3) the Department of Public Parks and Streets. It was provided that a Commissioner should be elected for each department, the Mayor being ex officio Commissioner of Public Health and Safety. In 1921 the terms of office of the members of the Commission Council were fixed at four years, the election to be had in April. Appellant was elected Commissioner of the Department of Public Parks and Streets in April, 1931, for a term which was to expire in May, 1935. But in 1934 the date for the election of officers was postponed to November, 1936, and appellant's term of office was extended accordingly. Later, by Act No. 13 of the Third Extraordinary Session of 1934, the legislature abolished the office of Commissioner of Public Parks and Streets and transferred its functions to the Mayor. There was also created a Department of State Coordination and Public Welfare \n\n[306 \nU.S. 535, 537]\n\u00a0\n and provision was made for the election of a Commissioner of that Department. This was followed by a proviso that the person then filling the office of Commissioner of the Department of Public Parks and Streets should be entitled to enter the employ of the City, at a salary equal to that theretofore allowed to the Commissioner, 'in the work under the said Mayor and said person shall have the right to continue in said service during good behavior until the next general election of officers in said municipality'. Appellant was the person thus described, and accordingly, in January, 1935, the Commission Council adopted an ordinance reciting the statutory provisions and providing for the employment of appellant as Superintendent of Public Parks and Streets, under the Mayor, 'at the same salary now provided for the Commissioner of Public Parks and Streets, his employment to continue during good behavior and until the next general election for municipal officers'. Appellant accepted the employment and entered upon the discharge of his duties, as to the faithful performance of which no question is raised.\n The state court held that the position in question was 'in the nature of a public office' with governmental functions and that the legislative action in abolishing it did not contravene the constitutional provision as to impairment of contracts. The court referred to the provision of the Act of 1912 abovementioned that 'all of the powers and authority' conferred upon the City by its charter, not inconsistent with the provisions of the Act, were declared to be 'reserved to the City unimpaired' to be exercised by the Mayor and Commission Council. Further, that by the charter of the City (Section 7 of Act No. 169 of 1898) it was provided 'that the 'employees' of the city are removable as therein specified' and that by a subsequent provision (Section 52, as amended by Act. No. 249 of 1914,  4) it was declared that 'all officers elected by the \n\n[306 \nU.S. 535, 538]\n\u00a0\n Council shall be removable by the Council at pleasure'. Again, that by the Act of 1912 it was declared that 'any official or assistant elected or appointed by the commission council may be removed from office at any time by a vote of the majority of the members of the council', except as therein otherwise provided, and that there was no exception elsewhere that might be applicable to the present case. The court said that the general rule that a municipal council 'may remove at any time any official appointed or elected by the council, or anyone employed by the council to perform governmental functions', had been recognized in its former decisions, which were cited. 183 So. at page 172.\n In this view the state court was of the opinion that the case was not controlled by Hall v. Wisconsin, \n103 \nU.S. 5\n, upon which appellant relies,-a case of a contract with a State for the performance of specific services of a scientific character under a statute providing for 'a Geological, Mineralogical and Agricultural Survey'-a contract which was held to be within the constitutional protection, and rather that the case was governed by the general doctrine reaffirmed in Newton v. Mahoning County Commissioners, \n100 \nU.S. 548\n, 557. While the particular question was not involved in that case, the court stated the familiar principle that 'the legislative power of a State, except so far as restrained by its own Constitution, is at all times absolute with respect to all offices within its reach. It may at pleasure create or abolish them, or modify their duties. It may also shorten or lengthen the term of service'. Id., 100 U.S. page 559. See, also, Butler v. Pennsylvania, 10 How. 402; Crenshaw v. United States, \n134 \nU.S. 99, 106\n, 10 S.Ct. 431, 433; Phelps v. Board of Education, \n300 \nU.S. 319, 322\n, 57 S.Ct. 483, 484; Dodge v. Board of Education, \n302 \nU.S. 74, 78\n, 79 S., 58 S.Ct. 98, 100.\n While this Court in applying the contract clause of the Constitution must reach an independent judgment as to the existence and nature of the alleged contract (Larson v. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 535, 539]\n\u00a0\n South Dakota, \n278 \nU.S. 429, 433\n, 49 S.Ct. 196, 197; United States Mortgage Co. v. Matthews, \n293 \nU.S. 232, 236\n, 55 S.Ct. 168, 170), we attach great weight to the views of the highest court of the State. Coombes v. Getz, \n285 \nU.S. 434, 441\n, 52 S.Ct. 435, 436; Phelps v. Board of Education, supra; Dodge v. Board of Education, supra. In this instance we find no reason for disagreeing with the conclusion reached by the Supreme Court of Louisiana. The Act providing for appellant's 'employment' did not change the nature of the duties which he had been performing as Commissioner. Instead of acting as Commissioner he rendered the same service as Superintendent of Public Parks and Streets under the control of the Mayor. His duties still distinctly pertained to the performance of the ordinary governmental functions of the City in the supervision of its streets and parks and his position as Superintendent both with respect to duties and tenure may properly be regarded as subject to the control of the legislature and of the Commission Council acting under its authority.\n The judgment is affirmed.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","62":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHONEYMAN v. JACOBS(1939)\nNo. 465\nArgued: Decided: April 17, 1939\n\n\n\n\n[306 \nU.S. 539, 540]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Robert B. Honeyman, of New York City, for appellant.\n Messrs. John J. Bennett, Jr., of New York City, Henry Epstein, of Albany, N.Y., and John F. X. McGohey and Benjamin Heffner, both of New York City, for appellees.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case, coming here on appeal from the state court, presents the question of the validity under the contract clause of the Federal Constitution, U.S.C.A.Const. art. 1,  10, of Section 1083-a of the Civil Practice Act of New York (Chapter 794 of the Laws of 1933, Ex.Sess.)1 under which the appellant, a mortgagee of real \n\n[306 \nU.S. 539, 541]\n\u00a0\n property, was denied a deficiency judgment in a foreclosure suit, where the state court found that the value of the property purchased by the mortgagee at the foreclosure sale was equal to the debt secured by the mortgage.\n The mortgage was executed in February, 1928, that is, prior to the legislation in question, to secure a bond for $15,000, with interest, payable in February, 1931. On default in payment, appellant, the holder of the bond and mortgage, brought suit for foreclosure and judgment for foreclosure and sale was entered in April, 1938. The property was then sold to appellant for the sum of $7,500 In the referee's report of sale the amount due on the bond and mortgage was stated to be $15,771.17, and the taxes, fees and expenses amounted to $1,319.03, leaving a deficiency of $9,590.20.\n Section 1083-a of the Civil Practice Act required that the right to a deficiency judgment should be determined in the foreclosure suit. Honeyman v. Hanan, 275 N.Y. 382, 9 N.E.2d 970; Id., \n302 \nU.S. 375, 378\n, 58 S.Ct. 273, 274. Accordingly, appellant made his motion in that suit to confirm the sale and for deficiency judgment. Proof was submitted to the court that the present value of the property was $25,318. It does not appear that the correctness of this valuation was contested. The court thereupon confirmed the sale and denied the motion for deficiency judgment upon the ground 'that the value of the property is equal to the debt of the plaintiff'. Appellant's contention that Section 1083-a as thus applied violated the contract clause of the Constitution was overruled and this ruling was sus- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 539, 542]\n\u00a0\n tained by the Court of Appeals. Honeyman v. Clark, 278 N.Y. 467, 17 N.E.2d 131 The court followed its earlier decisions, citing Honeyman v. Hanan, 275 N.Y. 382, 9 N.E.2d 970; Klinke v. Samuels, 264 N.Y. 144, 190 N.E. 324; City Bank Farmers' Trust Co. v. Ardlea Incorporation, 267 N.Y. 224, 196 N. E. 34.\n Appellant invokes the principle that the obligation of a contract is impaired by subsequent legislation which under the form of modifying the remedy impairs substantial rights. See Sturges v. Crowninshield, 4 Wheat. 122, 200; Von Hoffman v. City of Quincy, 4 Wall. 535, 553, 554; Antoni v. Greenhow, \n107 \nU.S. 769, 775\n, 2 S.Ct. 91, 96; Home Building & Loan Association v. Blaisdell, \n290 \nU.S. 398, 430\n, 434 S., and cases cited, note 13, 54 S.Ct. 231, 237, 238; W. B. Worthen Co. v. Thomas, \n292 \nU.S. 426, 433\n, 54 S.Ct. 816, 818, 93 A.L.R. 173; W. B. Worthen Co. v. Kavanaugh, \n295 \nU.S. 56, 60\n, 55 S. Ct. 555, 556, 97 A.L.R. 905. As we said in Richmond Mortgage Corporation v. Wachovia Bank, \n300 \nU.S. 124, 128\n, 57 S.Ct. 338, 339, 108 A.L.R. 886, 'The Legislature may modify, limit, or alter the remedy for enforcement of a contract without impairing its obligation, but in so doing, it may not deny all remedy or so circumscribe the existing remedy with conditions and restrictions as seriously to impair the value of the right'.\n We have heretofore decided that the requirement of Section 1083-a that the right to a deficiency judgment must be determined in the foreclosure suit raises no substantial question under the contract clause. Honeyman v. Hanan, \n302 \nU.S. 375\n, at page 378, 58 S.Ct. 273, 274. The question is whether in the instant case the denial of a deficiency judgment substantially impaired appellant's contract right. The bond provided for the payment to him of $15,000 with the stipulated interest. The mortgage was executed to secure payment of that indebtedness. The contract contemplated that the mortgagee should make himself whole, if necessary, out of the security but not that he should be enriched at the expense of the debtor or realize more than what would repay the debt with the costs and expenses \n\n[306 \nU.S. 539, 543]\n\u00a0\n of the suit. Having a total debt of $15,771.17, with expenses, etc., of $1, 319.03, appellant has obtained through his foreclosure suit the property of the debtor found without question to be worth over $25,000. He has that in hand. We know of no principle which entitles him to receive anything more. Assuming that the statute before its amendment permitted a recovery of an additional amount through a so-called deficiency judgment, we cannot say that there was any constitutional sanction for such a provision which precluded the legislature from changing it so as to confine the creditor to securing the satisfaction of his entire debt.\n Section 1083-a in substance assured to the court the exercise of its appropriate equitable powers. By the normal exercise of these powers, a court of equity in a foreclosure suit would have full authority to fix the terms and time of the foreclosure sale and to refuse to confirm sales upon equitable grounds where they were found to be unfair or the price bid was inadequate. Home Building & Loan Association v. Blaisdell, supra, 290 U.S. at pages 446, 447, and cases cited, note 18, 54 S.Ct. at page 243, Richmond Mortgage Corporation v. Wachovia Bank, supra, 300 U.S. at page 129, 57 S.Ct. at page 339, 108 A.L.R. 886. In this control over the foreclosure sale under its decree, the court could consider and determine the value of the property sold to the mortgagee and what the mortgagee would thus realize upon the mortgage debt if the sale were confirmed. See Monaghan v. May, 242 App.Div. 64, 67, 273 N.Y.S. 475; Guaranteed Title & Mortgage Co. v. Scheffres, 247 App.Div. 294, 285 N.Y.S. 464.\n The reasoning of this Court in Richmond Mortgage Corporation v. Wachovia Bank, supra, is applicable and governs our decision. There, a statute of North Carolina, enacted after the execution of notes secured by a deed of trust, provided that where a mortgagee caused the sale of mortgaged property by a trustee and, becoming the purchaser for a sum less than the amount of the debt, \n\n[306 \nU.S. 539, 544]\n\u00a0\n thereafter brought an action for a deficiency, the defendant was entitled to show, by way of defense and set-off, that the property sold was fairly worth the amount of the debt or that the sum bid was substantially less than the true value of the property, and thus defeat the claim in whole or in part. Under the former law of that State, when the mortgagee became the purchaser at the trustee's sale under a power in the deed of trust, he might thereafter in an action at law recover the difference between the price he had bid and the amount of the indebtedness. We found that the other remedy by bill in equity to foreclose the mortgage was still available. And that in such a proceeding the chancellor could set aside the sale if the price bid was inadequate, and, in addition, he might award a money decree for the amount by which the avails of the sale fell below the amount of the indebtedness but that 'his decree in that behalf would be governed by well-understood principles of equity'. The Court was of the opinion that the statute modifying one of the existing remedies for realizing the value of the security could not 'fairly be said to do more than restrict the mortgagee to that for which he contracted, namely, payment in full'. The act recognized the obligation of his contract and his right to its full enforcement but limited that right 'so as to prevent his obtaining more than his due. By the old and well-known remedy of foreclosure a mortgagee was so limited because of the chancellor's control of the proceeding'. That 'classical method' of realization upon a mortgage security through a foreclosure suit had always been understood 'to be fair to both parties to the contract and to afford an adequate remedy to the mortgagee'. In that view it appeared that the new law as to proceedings for a deficiency judgment after the exercise of a power of sale 'merely restricted the exercise of the contractual remedy to provide a procedure which, to some extent, renders the remedy by a trustee's sale consistent \n\n[306 \nU.S. 539, 545]\n\u00a0\n with that in equity'. And that did 'not impair the obligation of the contract'.\n We reach a similar result here upon the same ground-that under the finding of the state court the mortgagee has obtained satisfaction of his debt and that the denial by the statute of a further recovery does not violate the constitutional provision.\n The judgment is affirmed.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 1083-a, provides:\n'1083-a. Limitation Upon Deficiency Judgments During Emergency Period. No judgment shall be granted for any residue of the debt remaining unsatisfied as prescribed by the preceding section where the mortgaged property shall be sold during the emergency, except as herein provided. Simultaneously with the making of a motion for an order confirming the sale or in any event within ninety days after the date of the sale, the party to whom such residue shall be owing may make a motion in the action for leave to enter a deficiency judgment upon notice to the party against whom such judgment is sought or the attorney o shall have appeared for such party in such action. Such notice shall be served personally or in such other manner as the court may direct. Upon such motion the court, whether or not the respondent appears, shall determine, upon affidavit or otherwise as it shall direct, the fair and reasonable market value of the mortgaged premises as of the date of sale or such nearest earlier date as there shall have been any market value thereof and shall make an order directing the entry of a deficiency judgment. Such deficiency judgment shall be for an amount equal to the sum of the amount owing by the party liable as determined by the judgment with interest, plus the amount owing on all prior liens and encumbrances with interest, plus cost and disbursements of the action including the referee's fee and disbursements, less the market value as determined by the court or the sale price of the property whichever shall be the higher. If no motion for a deficiency judgment shall be made as herein prescribed the proceeds of the sale regardless of amount shall be deemed to be in full satisfaction of the mortgage debt and no right to recover any deficiency in any action or proceeding shall exist'. \n\n\n\n\n\n","63":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHONOLULU OIL CORPORATION, LTD. v. HALLIBURTON(1939)\nNo. 466\nArgued: Decided: April 17, 1939\n\n\n\n\n[306 \nU.S. 550, 551]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. A. W. Boyken, of San Francisco, Cal., and A. J. Hill, of Los Angeles, Cal., for Honolulu Oil Corporation.\n Messrs. Leonard S. Lyon and William H. Davis, both of Los Angeles, Cal., for Erle P. Halliburton et al.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit presents questions of validity and infringement of Patent No. 1,930,987 applied for February 10, 1926 by Simmons and, after assignment, issued October 17, 1933, to Halliburton. It is for a method and apparatus for testing productivity of formations encountered in oil and other deep wells drilled by the rotary method.\n The writs were granted, on petition of defendants Honolulu Oil Corporation, Ltd. et al. and cross-petition of plaintiffs Halliburton, et al., to review a decree1 of the circuit court of appeals for the ninth circuit holding that the method claims are valid and infringed and to that extent reversing a decree2 of the district court of southern California holding that the method and apparatus claims are invalid.\n There was an earlier suit for infringement of the same patent brought by these plaintiffs in the federal court for the eastern district of Texas against other defendants. That court sustained the patent and found it infringed. The circuit court of appeals for the fifth circuit reversed. \n3\n It held the method claims invalid for lack of invention and that, while the apparatus claims may define a simplifying improvement upon which a combination patent might rest, the apparatus was not of such character as to be infringed by the accused tool of defendants. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 550, 552]\n\u00a0\n In recent years rotary drilling has been widely used in sinking deep oil wells. Boring is done by rotation of a bit attached to a steel pipe which when so used is called a 'drill stem.' A smaller bore, called 'rat- hole', sometimes precedes, and is reamed out to obtain, the full size hole. To aid operation, drilling fluid (mud-laden water) is pumped into the upper end of the drill stem and escapes into the well at high velocity through holes in the bit. It rises through the space between the pipe and the earth walls of the well and carries to the surface cuttings made by the bit. It holds back and seals the penetrated formations. Hydrostatic pressure of the drilling fluid is very great and the fluid in a penetrated formation will not flow into the well unless it is under greater pressure. It is often desirable to secure a sample of the fluid within a stratum in the bottom of the well without removing the drilling fluid. The patent in suit is for a method and apparatus intended to accomplish that purpose.\n The method claims are 8 and 18. Claim 8 is as follows: 'A method of testing the productivity of a formation encountered in a well containing drilling fluid, which includes lowering an empty string of pipe into the well through the drilling fluid to adjacent the formation, the pipe carrying a packer4 and having a valved inlet at its lower end which is closed while the pipe is being lowered, setting the packer above the formation to seal off the drilling fluid from the formation, opening the valved inlet after the packer is set to permit cognate fluid5 from the formation to enter the pipe, closing the valved inlet against the entrance of fluid from the well by movement of the pipe, raising the pipe so closed to remove an en \n\n[306 \nU.S. 550, 553]\n\u00a0\n trapped sample and the packer from the well.' Claim 18 is printed in the margin. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n The apparatus claims in suit are 9 to 17 inclusive and 19. Claim 15 is typical: 'Apparatus for testing the productivity of a formation encountered in a well containing drilling fluid, comprising a singe empty string of pipe to be lowered into the well through the drilling fluid to adjacent the formation to be tested, a packer lowered into the well by said string of pipe for sealing off the drilling fluid from the formation to be tested, said packer adapted to be positively pressed against the walls of the formation to seal off the same, means at the lower end of said string of pipe to receive fluid from said formation including an inlet opening into said pipe below said packer and a valve structure for controlling the inlet, said value structure having a relatively stationary part connected to the packer and a relatively movable part connected to the pipe.'\n Sustaining the claims in suit, the district court for eastern Texas found: Plaintiffs have a large business under the patent in suit. Prior to the discovery there was no apparatus or method in use for testing productivity of formations in wells containing drilling fluid except by putting in a casing and removing the fluid. This patent \n\n[306 \nU.S. 550, 554]\n\u00a0\n first disclosed testing apparatus and method requiring only a single string of pipe.\n In this suit the trial court found: The Franklin Patent No. 263,330, dated August 29, 1882, anticipates both the method and apparatus covered by the patent in suit. The use of a packer is necessarily implied from the language of the Franklin patent. Without one, that device could not perform the functions attributed to it. Plainly, it may be used as a tester; for by its use the contents of the producing stratum, sealed off from the rest of the well and unimpeded in its entry into the rat-hole by pressure of the rotary mud, can be brought undiluted to the surface by a mechanism almost duplicating that shown by the patent in suit. A packer to separate one stratum of the oil well from another is old in the art.\n And it also found: The Cox Patent No. 1,347,534, dated July 27, 1920, and the Edwards Patent No. 1,514,585, dated November 4, 1924, substantially disclose the method and device claimed in the patent in suit. The object of these patents, like that of the one in suit, was to ascertain productivity of the stratum being drilled. There was no actual commercial use of the device disclosed and claimed in the patent in suit. It was impractical, due to difficulty in operating at increased length. The inventor himself was employed to devise improvements in the valve structure. If valid at all, the patent must be restricted to its precise form. The method claims are invalid for want of invention. In important respects, defendants' devices differ in operation from the device disclosed and claimed by the patent in suit; they are not infringements of it.\n And that court decreed that as to all claims in suit, the patent is invalid.\n The opinion of the circuit court of appeals for the fifth circuit considers the questions of invention here involved. In substance, it says: \n\n[306 \nU.S. 550, 555]\n\u00a0\n Method claim 18, taken as typical, assumes familiar apparatus and claims a monopoly on a new use of the old apparatus to achieve a result in a better way. That apparatus includes a single string of pipe lowered into the well, a packer on the string, and a valve at the lower end. These simple and well-known elements are to be used by lowering the pipe into the well with the valve closed against the drilling fluid until the packer is set, then by opening the valve to admit cognate fluid below the packer, then by closing the valve so as to prevent the drilling fluid from entering when the packer is released and the pipe drawn up with its contents. No novelty and certainly no invention can be claimed for the method.\n Packers and pipes with valves in them have long been in use to get what is below the packer free from what is above and without removing what is above. Whether a large quantity from a finished well or a simple sample from an unfinished well does not materially alter the method. Water has always been encountered in oil wells; the drilling fluid is only very muddy water voluntarily put and kept in the well for special reasons. Expansible and removable packers with pipes through them to reach the oil, gas, or other desired fluid beneath and rat-hole packers set by the weight of the pipe pressing them down and removable by simply lifting them are shown in earlier patents. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n The simplicity of the method in suit along with all its operations, was reasonably disclosed in the old patent to Franklin. There is the single pipe with a packer mentioned, but function esteemed to familiar as to need no emphasis, capable of being lowered into and withdrawn from a well, with the entrance into or escape from the pipe \n\n[306 \nU.S. 550, 556]\n\u00a0\n to be controlled by a valve operated from above while the pipe is lowered or withdrawn. The importance of Franklin to this method claim is that he describes the use of a packer on a single string of pipe with a valve in the pipe in the very operation of putting them in and taking them out of the well. Franklin discloses a packer. Evidently one must be used for without it oil would not flow through the pipe as desired and there would be no use of the valve to control the flow. The packer is necessary to prevent escape of gas and to build up pressure to make the oil flow.\n Franklin did not intend to get a sample by raising the pipe, but intended to keep from getting a sample by making the valve a leaky one that would let the contents escape as the pipe is raised. He expected to get what was below by natural flow just as Simmons, applicant for the patent in suit, says that is to be preferred. It would be no invention to substitute a valve that would not leak for one that was intended to and does leak on withdrawal. It would be no invention to use the Franklin device to sample a well instead of using it to flow the well. Especially after the disclosure of Cox and Edwards in the art of testing by sample taken through the drill stem with their somewhat complicated devices, recurrence for this new use to what is in substance the simple apparatus of Franklin ought not to be the foundation for the broad method claims here put forth. While perhaps not anticipated, they involve no such invention as entitles to monopoly.\n The apparatus claims have a different status. They propose a new machine to better accomplish the useful result. They were rewritten to state for the first time that only a single string of pipe is to be used. In view of the oil well art, the omission of the Edwards second pipe to maintain circulation involves no such invention as to give a monopoly of all single string testers as is here \n\n[306 \nU.S. 550, 557]\n\u00a0\n claimed. It may be a simplifying improvement on which to rest a combination patent but it is not a basic and pioneer invention. Positive pressure of the packer against the well walls, also written into the claims, appears to refer to the weight of the pipe on the rat-hole packer, but that is the way a rat-hole packer has always worked. The claims in suit can not be sustained in all their breadth but must be limited to the form of the apparatus disclosed.\n The circuit court of appeals for the ninth circuit, upon considerations in substance the same as those suggested in the opinion of the circuit court of appeals for the fifth circuit, held that the apparatus claims of the patent in suit were anticipated by the patent to Franklin. But, holding that invalidity of apparatus claims does not negative discovery of method or process, that court in substance said:\n The Franklin patent directs the pipe to be lowered into the well and the valve to be operated by movement of the pipe so as to control the flow of oil. It teaches that the tube can be kept empty by closing the valve while it is being lowered and that it should be closed prior to its removal. The device is to be used in a flowing well which, of course, contains no drilling fluid. At the time of that patent the rotary method of drilling was unknown. Its purposes were to provide a method of keeping the tubing closed while being lowered into or removed from the well and means of temporarily closing the tubing to allow the gas in the well to obtain sufficient head so that the well would flow. There is disclosed no use for taking entrapped samples from unfinished wells containing drilling fluid. There is no suggestion of this last step of the patented process; the device was evidently intended to be permanently attached to the tubing of the well.\n Simmons, applicant for the patent in suit, faced the problem of providing a method of testing an oil well with \n\n[306 \nU.S. 550, 558]\n\u00a0\n out removing hydrostatic pressure necessary for support of the formation in question. He met it by a method operating so quickly that the suspension of the circulation of drilling fluid was not substantially greater than that frequently necessary in drilling operations. Franklin neither considered nor solved this problem.\n The Simmons discovery constituted invention. It disclosed what had not been thought possible in the art, that is, that such a device could be set in a well containing drilling fluid not in circulation long enough to make the test; it substituted a much better process than had been in use. The discovery was that a well could be safely tested by lowering a single string of pipe equipped with a valve packer and strainer and that it was not necessary to set the casing permanently and bail out the drilling fluid; or, if a test were attempted without permanently setting the casing, it was not necessary to provide an extra string of pipe for circulation of the drilling fluid.\n\n 1. \nPlaintiffs, insisting that the apparatus claims are not invalid for lack of invention, emphasize the fact that the Franklin apparatus was intended to be used to govern flow of a finished well and not for testing productivity of formations encountered in drilling; they maintain that it is not adapted to the last mentioned use without significant changes and they suggest that even a very slight change is enough to give patentability to the changed apparatus if the change is foreign to the purposes of the Franklin apparatus and dictated by those of the apparatus in suit. They say that the essential features of the latter, not found in the Franklin patent, are a packer so related to the inlet that it may seal off the formation to be tested from the hydrostatic pressure of the mud- laden fluid standing in the well during the testing operation, a valve so positioned with respect to the packer inlet that when closed it will entrap the entire flow of the cognate fluid to result from natural pressure in the formation \n\n[306 \nU.S. 550, 559]\n\u00a0\n when relieved from pressure of the drilling fluid, and so constructed that it will hold and bring to the surface the entrapped sample uncontaminated and undiminished.\n The specification of Franklin's patent states that his invention consists in providing a device which can be connected with the tubing of the well above a 'packer.' On ample evidence, the trial and appellate courts found that packers to separate the producing strata from the others were old in the art, and that the use of a packer, substantially as the same exists today, is necessarily implied from the language of the Franklin patent. Detailed description by Franklin was unnecessary. Webster Loom Co. v. Higgins, \n105 \nU.S. 580\n, 586\n\n\n Franklin's specification states that the device containing the valve should be 'preferably ... above the packer' and that 'it may be placed deep in the well and thereby obtain considerable advantage.' This indicates a valve just above the packer as is true with respect to the patent in suit. But even assuming the contrary, in view of prior art as disclosed by the Cox and Edwards patents, the location of the valve as indicated by the patent in suit is mere mechanical contrivance and not invention. Hollister v. Benedict Manufacturing Co., \n113 \nU.S. 59, 73\n, 5 S. Ct. 717, 724.\n It is assumed, as claimed by plaintiffs, that the valve of the Franklin device was made so that it would let the contents of the pipe escape while it was being taken out of the well. But by mere substitution of a tight valve for a leaky one the device would be made to hold and bring up samples from the formation below the packer. The difference between the Franklin valve, leaking while being drawn from the well, and that of the patent in suit, purposely made to close tightly, is not an essential or patentable element.\n In wells where there exists natural pressure in the formation below the packer sufficient to force the fluid to \n\n[306 \nU.S. 550, 560]\n\u00a0\n the surface, either device, the Franklin or the one in suit, may be used to control flow of the well and so disclose the productivity of that stratum. It is equally plain that, in the absence of adequate pressure to carry to the surface, the Franklin device with a valve effectively closed would, if operated in accordance with the method claimed in the patent in suit, similarly receive, hold, and bring to the surface samples from the formation.\n The apparatus claims are invalid.\n\n 2. \nAs used in the statute,8 'useful art' includes method which in this case is used interchangeably with process; 'machine' includes apparatus. \n9\n Having held the apparatus not new, we come to the question whether claims 8 and 18 cover any new method or process. \n10\n These claims relate to 'a method of testing.' The claims relating to the device call it an 'apparatus for testing.' In the method claims11 and in some relating to apparatus,12 the phrases just quoted are followed by identical words: 'the productivity of a formation encountered in a well containing drilling fluid.' \n13\n The elements to be employed in taking the steps constituting the method are essentially the same as those constituting the apparatus. The process consists of 'lowering an empty string of pipe,' 'setting the packer,' 'opening the valved inlet,' 'closing the valved inlet,' 'raising the pipe so closed to remove an entrapped sample and the packer from the well.' The result to be achieved by the method claimed to be new is precisely the same as that for the attainment of which the apparatus found to be old was contrived. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 550, 561]\n\u00a0\n 13 To show identical subject matter in the two sets of claims, defendants present an analysis of method claim 18 and apparatus claim 19 in parallel arrangement as follows:\n 18. 19.

The method practiced by its use includes in the same order all the steps, except the last one, that constitute the process in question. That step is the raising of the pipe containing the entrapped sample. As the Franklin device was to control flow and not to test productivity of strata reached before completion of wells, the final movement to be taken in the process under consideration was not involved or described. But that movement is substantially disclosed by the Cox and Edwards patents. No discussion, in addition to the convincing exposition by the circuit court of appeals for the fifth circuit, is required to show that the method claimed in suit was clearly indicated in the prior art. It cannot reasonably be held that anything more than mechanical skill of men familiar with known methods of obtaining oil from formations below packers would be required to suggest the raising of the pipe containing fluid entrapped and held by effective closing of the valve.\n The method claims are invalid.\n The part of the decree of the circuit court of appeals brought up by defendants' petition is reversed. The part brought up by plaintiffs' petition is affirmed. The decree of the district court is affirmed. It is so ordered. \n No. 466\n reversed.\n No. 479 affirmed.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 198 F.2d 436. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 18 F.Supp. 58. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Johnston Formation Testing Corporation v.

LIQUOR CONTROL COMMISSION(1939)\nNo. 130\nArgued: December 7, 1938Decided: January 3, 1939\n\n\n\n Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Michigan. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 391, 392]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Thomas F. O'Mara, of Terre Haute, Ind., and Herbert J. Patrick, of Indianapolis, Ind., for appellant.\n Mr. Raymond W. Starr, of Grand Rapids, Mich., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Indianapolis Brewing Company, Inc., an Indiana corporation, manufactures beer in that State. Under appropriate licenses it has for some years sold and shipped to dealers in Michigan its product in interstate commerce. In July, 1937, the Michigan Liquor Control Act was amended so as to prohibit Michigan dealers in beer from selling any beer manufactured in a state which by its laws discriminates against Michigan beer. By Section 40 of the amended Act, the Michigan Commission is directed to declare what states discriminate as that term is defined by the Act. \n1\n It named ten states. \n2\n Among these is In \n\n[305 \nU.S. 391, 393]\n\u00a0\n diana, which by its Liquor Control Act of 1935, as amended in 1937, prohibits licensed Indiana wholesalers from importing any beer which is not their absolute property; and requires that in order to secure the privilege of importing beer from other states each must obtain a 'port of entry' permit, of which no fewer than ten and no more than one hundred are to be granted, pay a license fee of $1500 and give a bond of $10,000, in addition to the license fee and bond required of those who sell only Indiana beer. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n The Indianapolis Company, suing on behalf of itself and others similarly situated, brought, in the federal court for eastern Michigan, this suit to enjoin the enforcement of that provision of the Michigan law on the ground that it violates the Federal Constitution. The members of the Michigan Liquor Control Commission and other officers of the State were made defendants. As a temporary, as well as a permanent, injunction was sought, a three-judge court was conveened to hear the application for a temporary injunction. Defendants moved to dismiss the bill. It was conceded that if the law was unconstitutional the plaintiff was entitled to equitable relief. No question except that of the constitutionality of the law was presented. The court held the law valid; denied the temporary injunction; and dismissed the bill. 21 F.Supp. 969. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 391, 394]\n\u00a0\n The plaintiff contends that although the Twenty-First Amendment, U.S. C.A.Const. Amend. 21, declares: 'The transportation or importation into any State, Territory, or possession of the United States for delivery or use therein of intoxicating liquors, in violation of the laws thereof, is hereby prohibited', the Michigan law should be held void as violating the commerce clause and the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S.C.A.Const. art. 1,  8, cl. 3; Amend. 14. It characterizes the law as 'retaliatory'; argues, among other things, that the Amendment may not be interpreted as permitting retaliation; and insists that such interpretation would defeat its purpose, as thereby Michigan would be allowed to punish Indiana for doing what, under the rule applied in State Board of Equalization v. Young's Market Co., \n299 \nU.S. 59, 63\n, 57 S.Ct. 77, 78, is permitted. Whether the Michigan law should not more properly be described as a protective measure, we have no occasion to consider. For whatever its character, the law is valid. Since the Twentyfirst Amendment, U.S.C.A.Const. Amend. 21, as held in the Young Case, the right of a state to prohibit or regulate the importation of intoxicating liquor is not limited by the commerce clause; and, as held by that case and Mahoney v. Joseph Triner Corp., \n304 \nU.S. 401\n, 58 S.Ct. 952, discrimination between domestic and imported intoxicating liquors, or between imported intoxicating liquors, is not prohibited by the equal protection clause. The further claim that the law violates the due process clause is also unfounded. The substantive power of the State to prevent the sale of intoxicating liquor is undoubted. Mugler v. Kansas, \n123 \nU.S. 623\n, 8 S.Ct. 273.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Amended sec. 40 of Michigan Act No. 281. Public Acts of 1937, pp. 509, 521, provides: '...

U.S.(1939)\nNo. 227\nArgued: Decided: January 30, 1939\n\n\n\n\n[306 \nU.S. 153, 154]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John S. Burchmore and Nuel D. Belnap, both of Chicago, Ill., for appellants.\n Messrs. Edward M. Reidy, of Washington, D.C., and J. R. Barse, of Chicago, Ill., for appellees the United States and the Interstate Commerce Commission.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In No. 227, after full hearings the Interstate Commerce Commission, on July 11, 1935, found and reported1 that the Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad was engaged in the practice of paying an allowance for appellant's service in spotting cars in appellant's plant;2 that appellant was performing this plant service for its own convenience; that the Railroad was under no legal obligation to spot the cars and therefore the allowance was paid for service for which the Railroad was not compensated under line-haul rates; that the allowance was unlawful and afforded appellant a preferential service, not accorded to shippers generally, amounting to refund or remission of part of the rates charged or collected as compensation for transporting freight. On the same date, an order of the Commission incorporated its report and findings, including the finding that 'by the payment of said allowances the Indiana Belt Railroad Company violates the Interstate Commerce Act.' This order also directed the Railroad \n\n[306 \nU.S. 153, 155]\n\u00a0\n to 'cease and desist on or before September 3, 1935, and thereafter to abstain from such unlawful practice.'\n August 28, 1935, upon petition of appellant, the District Court, three judges sitting, granted an interlocutory injunction by which the Commission's report and order were 'suspended, stayed, and set aside'- 'pending the further order of the court'; the Commission was restrained and enjoined from enforcing them; and, the Railroad having previously given public notice that its published tariff providing for the allowance would be cancelled as of September 3, 1935, in accordance with the Commission's order, the injunction suspended the effective date of the cancellation. But the interlocutory injunction also provided 'that until the further order of the Court, any and all sums due and payable to plaintiff (appellant), under the ... tariff providing said allowance, shall be set up by defendant Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad Company on its books of account, which sums so set up shall be paid over to ... ( appellant), or canceled, only upon the further order of this Court, ( appellant) ... by its counsel having agreed in open court to such arrangement, without prejudice.'\n February 26, 1937, the Commission entered an order purporting to extend the effective date of its command to 'cease and desist' to June 15, 1937, but specifically provided that its order of July 11, 1935, should 'in all other respects remain in full force and effect.'\n April 27, 1938, the District Court dismissed appellant's petition for want of equity, dissolved the interlocutory injunction, and ordered the accrued allowances that had been set aside in a special account by the Railroad as required by the interlocutory injunction to 'be retained by ... (the Railroad) as a part of its general funds and said account canceled.'\n Appellant concedes the correctness of the District Court's decree holding the Commission's order valid, dismissing the petition and denying a permanent injunc- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 153, 156]\n\u00a0\n tion. \n3\n The appeal only seeks a review of the Court's action in ordering that the unlawful allowances accumulated after the date of the interlocutory injunction be retained by the Railroad and not paid to appellant.\n First. In granting the interlocutory injunction, the District Court proceeded under a jurisdictional Act which provides that '... the court, in its discretion, may restrain or suspend, in whole or in part, the operation of the commission's order pending the final hearing and determination of the suit.' 4 Appellant invoked the Court's equity powers. \n 5\n\u00a0\n\n A Court of equity 'in the exercise of its discretion, frequently resorts to the expedient of imposing terms and conditions upon the party at whose instance it proposes to act. The power to impose such conditions is founded upon, and arises from, the discretion which the court has in such cases, to grant, or not to grant, the injunction applied for. It is a power inherent in the court, as a court of equity, and has been exercised from time immemorial.' \n6\n\u00a0\n\n In the exercise of its discretion, the District Court imposed conditions in its decree granting appellant's petition for an interlocutory injunction. Appellant neither objected to the conditions nor sought review of the Court's action in imposing them, but under the interlocutory injunction enjoyed for three years the suspension-which it had sought-of the Commission's order, pending litigation. Now, the litigation ended, appellant insists that the District Court lacked jurisdiction to do more \n\n[306 \nU.S. 153, 157]\n\u00a0\n than vacate its interlocutory injunction and dismiss the petition, since no pleadings of the Railroad or the Commission sought the creation of the special allowance account. But this overlooks the governing principle that it is the duty of a court of equity granting injunctive relief to do so upon conditions that will protect all-including the public-whose interests the injunction may affect. \n7\n And the Commission, in defending its report and order, acted under its statutory duty as the representative of the interest which the public, as well as the railroads, have in the maintenance of fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory transportation practices. \n8\n Moreover, in intervening the Commission prayed that it have 'the benefit of such ... decrees or relief as may be just and proper.'\n The Interstate Commerce Commission has primary jurisdiction to determine whether the granting of allowances for services performed by shippers constitutes a discriminatory practice. \n9\n Here, in the exercise of its primary jurisdiction, the Commission considered the technical questions involved and made findings that the Railroad's practice was unlawfully preferential and discriminatory. In doing so, the Commission was acting in the interest of shippers generally and in behalf of the public and the national railroad system. The District Court, at the behest of this appellant, restrained the enforcement of the Commission's report and order embodying these findings. While thus acting in the interest of \n\n[306 \nU.S. 153, 158]\n\u00a0\n a single shipper, the Court properly took steps to protect the other interests-represented by the Commission-from injuries that the injunction might cause. It did so by ordering the payments, which the Commission had found unlawful, to be continued-on condition that they be segregated or paid into a separate account, pending the Court's review of the Commission's finding of illegality. This segregated account thus accrued as a result of judicial restraint of administrative proceedings in which the payments had been declared unlawful. When the Court finally determined that the administrative findings and order were correct, appellant could claim an interest in the fund only by asserting a right to payments forbidden by law, and it became the duty of the Court promptly to allocate the fund to its lawful owner.\n An Equity Court having lawful control of a fund, in which there may be interests represented only by a duly authorized governmental agency, has the power and is charged with the duty of protecting those interests in disposing of the fund. \n10\n Otherwise, rights (such as the right of this Railroad to restitution) might be impaired or cut off while an interlocutory injunction is in effect, as for instance by statutes of limitation. Here, the Court had the power and it was its duty so to fashion its equitable decree that appellant should not be the beneficiary of unlawful payments, and to prevent the dissipation of the Railroad's assets through unlawful preferences.\n Second. Appellant further insists that the Court had no power to impose the particular conditions here, because the Railroad was ordered to retain (in a special account) allowances provided for in its published tariff. This contention rests on the statutory requirement that published tariffs must be observed. \n11\n However, before the Court \n\n[306 \nU.S. 153, 159]\n\u00a0\n acted, the Commission had found and reported-and had incorporated its findings and report in an order-that these allowances provided in the published tariff were unlawful preferences violating the Interstate Commerce Act. The Commission had also ordered that payment of the unlawful allowances cease, and the Railroad had already-in obedience to the Commission's order-published a new tariff eliminating the allowance provision. But, six days before the new tariff would by its terms have become effective, appellant sought and obtained the preliminary injunction which did not destroy, but tentatively suspended the Commission's report and order and also tentatively suspended the Railroad's tariff canceling the unlawful allowance. The Railroad then republished the old tariff, thus- under court order-restoring the unlawful allowance. When the Court subsequently dismissed appellant's petition and vacated the interlocutory injunction 'in all respects', it thereby found the Commission's report and order valid and they were then in effect as though the injunction had never been granted. Thus, during the period the injunction was pending ( save for the first six days), the published tariff had contained the unlawful allowance solely because of the Court's injunction. To sustain the contention of appellant that the provision for allowances in the published tariff limited the authority of the court to prevent their payment would be to clothe a published tariff, in existence solely by reason of equitable intervention, with an immunity from equity itself. The Interstate Commerce Act grants no such immunity. \n12\n\u00a0\n\n Third. The appellant takes the position that the Commission's purported postponement of its command to cease and desist (eighteen months after the interlocutory \n\n[306 \nU.S. 153, 160]\n\u00a0\n injunction was granted) deprived the Court of authority to enforce the conditions of its interlocutory injunction. However, since the Court had exercised jurisdiction to review and suspend the Commission's report and order, the administrative body was without power to act inconsistently with the Court's jurisdiction, had it attempted to do so.13 But, since the Commission had already been enjoined from enforcing its report and order when it entered its postponement, there is no reason to construe the Commission's action as anything more than a recognition of the postponement actually effected by the Court's interlocutory injunction.\n In addition, there were two separate aspects to the action of the Commission. It found an illegal practice in existence that involved unlawful disbursement of the Railroad's funds, contrary to the public interest. The Commission also entered a cease and desist order to operate prospectively. Even if the Commission's postponement of the cease and desist portion of its order had been operative, the Commission specifically left in effect its ruling that the allowance was unlawful. \n14\n\u00a0\n\n The Commission had exercised its primary jurisdiction and had found the allowances unlawful; upon review, the District Court properly approved this finding; the \n\n[306 \nU.S. 153, 161]\n\u00a0\n amount in the special allowance account was exactly known and undisputed; this fund could have belonged only to the Railroad or to appellant; the Railroad was in possession of the fund and in equity and good conscience was entitled to retain it. Therefore, there was no necessity to take evidence, and the action of the District Court in disposing of the fund required no additional findings. The final decree of the District Court properly directed that the unlawful allowances should not be paid to appellant, and should be retained by the Railroad.\n The questions presented in No. 228 are governed by our conclusions here, and the judgments in both cases are\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 209 I.C.C. 747; 216 I.C.C. 8 (No. 228). \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 'Spotting' involves handling of cars between the point of interchange between the Railroad and appellant and the points at which such cars are unloaded or loaded in appellant's plant. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] See, United States v.

Upon a previous appeal this Court set aside the decree and remanded the cause to the District Court for further proceedings because of its failure to state findings of fact and conclusions of law as required by Equity Rule 70 1\/2, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723. \n304 \nU.S. 55\n, 58 S.Ct. 768. The case is \n\n[306 \nU.S. 208, 214]\n\u00a0\n now before us on findings of the District Court specifically stating that appellants did in fact agree with each other to enter into and carry out the contracts, which the court found to result in unreasonable and therefore unlawful restraints of interstate commerce.\n Appellants comprise the two groups of defendants in the District Court. The members of one group of eight corporations which are distributors of motion picture films, and the Texas agents of two of them, are appellants in No. 270. The other group, corporations and individuals engaged in exhibiting motion pictures in Texas, and some of them in New Mexico, appeals in No. 269. The distributor appellants are engaged in the business of distributing in interstate commerce motion picture films, copyrights on which they own or control, for exhibition in theatres throughout the United States. They distribute about 75 per cent. of all first-class feature films exhibited in the United States. They solicit from motion picture theatre owners and managers in Texas and other states applications for licenses to exhibit films, and forward the applications, when received from such exhibitors, to their respective New York offices, where they are accepted or rejected. If the applications are accepted, the distributors ship the films from points outside the states of exhibition to their exchanges within those states, from which, pursuant to the license agreements, the films are delivered to the local theatres for exhibition. After exhibition the films are reshipped to the distributors at points outside the state.\n The exhibitor group of appellants consists of Interstate Circuit, Inc ., and Texas Consolidated Theatres, Inc., and Hoblitzelle and O'Donnell, who are respectively president and general manager of both and in active charge of their business operations. The two corporations are affiliated with each other and with Paramount Pictures Distributing Co., Inc., one of the distributor appellants. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 208, 215]\n\u00a0\n Interstate operates forty-three first-run and second-run motion picture theatres, located in six Texas cities. \n1\n It has a complete monopoly of first-run theatres in these cities, except for one in Houston operated by one distributor's Texas agent. In most of these theatres the admission price for adults for the better seats at night is 40 cents or more. Interstate also operates several subsequent-run theatres in each of these cities, twenty-two in all, but in all but Galveston there are other subsequent-run theatres which compete with both its first- and subsequent- run theatres in those cities.\n Texas Consolidated operates sixty-six theatres, some first- and some subsequent-run houses, in various cities and towns in the Rio Grande Valley and elsewhere in Texas and in New Mexico. In some of these cities there are no competing theatres, and in six leading cities there are no competing first-run theatres. It has no theatres in the six Texas cities in which Interstate operates. That Interstate and Texas Consolidated dominate the motion picture business in the cities where their theatres are located is indicated by the fact that at the time of the contracts in question Interstate and Consolidated each contributed more than 74 per cent. of all the license fees paid by the motion picture theatres in their respective territories to the distributor appellants. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n On July 11, 1934, following a previous communication on the subject to the eight branch managers of the dis- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 208, 216]\n\u00a0\n tributor appellants, O'Donnell, the manager of Interstate and Consolidated, sent to each of them a letter3 on the letterhead of Interstate, each letter naming all of them as addressees, in which he asked compliance with two demands as a condition of Interstate's continued exhibition of the distributors' films in its 'A' or first-run the- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 208, 217]\n\u00a0\n atres at a night admission of 40 cents or more. \n4\n One demand was that the distributors 'agree that in selling their product to subsequent runs, that this 'A' product will never be exhibited at any time or in any theatre at a smaller admission price than 25\u00f5 for adults in the evening'. The other was that 'on 'A' pictures which are exhibited at a night admission of 40\u00f5 or more-they shall never be exhibited in conjunction with another feature picture under the so-called policy of double features'. The letter added that with respect to the 'Rio Grande Valley situation', with which Consolidated alone was concerned, 'We must insist that all pictures exhibited in our 'A' theatres at a maximum night admission price of 35\u00f5 must also be restricted to subsequent runs in the Valley at 25\u00f5'.\n The admission price customarily charged for preferred seats at night in independently operated subsequent-run theatres in Texas at the time of these letters was less than 25 cents. In seventeen of the eighteen independent theatres of this kind whose operations were described by witnesses the admission price was less than 25 cents. In one only was it 25 cents. In most of them the admission was 15 cents or less. It was also the general prac- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 208, 218]\n\u00a0\n tice in those theatres to provide double bills either on certain days of the week or with any feature picture which was weak in drawing power. The distributor appellants had generally provided in their license contracts for a minimum admission price of 10 or 15 cents, and three of them had included provisions restricting doublebilling. But none was at any time previously subject to contractual compulsion to continue the restrictions. The trial court found that the proposed restrictions constituted an important departure from prior practice.\n The local representatives of the distributors, having no authority to enter into the proposed agreements, communicated the proposal to their home offices. Conferences followed between Hoblitzelle and O'Donnell, acting for Interstate and Consolidated, and the representatives of the various distributors. In these conferences each distributor was represented by its local branch manager and by one or more superior officials from outside the state of Texas. In the course of them each distributor agreed with Interstate for the 1934-35 season to impose both the demanded restrictions upon their subsequent-run licensees in the six Texas cities served by Interstate, except Austin and Galveston. While only two of the distributors incorporated the agreement to impose the restrictions in their license contracts with Interstate, the evidence establishes, and it is not denied, that all joined in the agreement, four of them after some delay in negotiating terms other than the restrictions and not now material. These agreements for the restrictions-with the immaterial exceptions noted5-were carried into effect by each of the distribu- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 208, 219]\n\u00a0\n tors' imposing them on their subsequent-run licensees in the four Texas cities during the 1934-35 season. One agreement, that of Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer Distributing Corporation, was for three years. The others were renewed in the two following seasons and all were in force when the present suit was begun.\n None of the distributors yielded to the demand that subsequent runs in towns in the Rio Grande Valley served by Consolidated should be restricted. One distributor, Paramount, which was affiliated with Consolidated, agreed to impose the restrictions in certain other Texas and New Mexico cities.\n The trial court found that the distributor appellants agreed and conspired among themselves to take uniform action upon the proposals made by Interstate, and that they agreed and conspired with each other and with Interstate to impose the demanded restrictions upon all subsequent-run exhibitors in Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston and San Antonio; that they carried out the agreement by imposing the restrictions upon their subsequent-run licensees in those cities, causing some of them to increase their admission price to 25 cents, either generally or when restricted pictures were shown, and to abandon doublebilling of all such pictures, and causing the other subsequent-run exhibitors, who were either unable or unwilling to accept the restrictions, to be deprived of any opportunity to exhibit the restricted pictures, which were the best and most popular of all new feature pictures; that the effect of the restrictions upon 'low- income members of the community' patronizing the theatres of these exhibitors was to withhold from them altogether the 'best entertainment furnished by the motion picture industry;' and that the restrictions operated to increase the income of the distributors and of Interstate and to deflect attendance from later-run exhibitors who yielded to the restrictions to the first-run theatres of Interstate. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 208, 220]\n\u00a0\n The court concluded as matters of law that the agreement of the distributors with each other and those with Interstate to impose the restrictions upon subsequent-run exhibitors and the carrying of the agreements into effect, with the aid and participation of Hoblitzelle and O'Donnell, constituted a combination and conspiracy in restraint of interstate commerce in violation of the Sherman Act. It also concluded that each separate agreement between Interstate and a distributor that Interstate should subject itself to the restrictions in its subsequent-run theatres and that the distributors should impose the restrictions on all subsequent-run theatres in the Texas cities as a condition of supplying them with its feature pictures, was likewise a violation of the Act.\n It accordingly enjoined the conspiracy and restrained the distributors from enforcing the restrictions in their license agreements with subsequent-run exhibitors6 and from enforcing the contracts or any of them. This indluded both the contracts of Interstate with the distributors and the contract between Consolidated and Paramount, whereby the latter agreed to impose the restrictions upon subsequent-run theatres in Texas and New Mexico served by it.\n Appellants assail the decree of the District Court upon three principal grounds: (a) that the finding of agreement and conspiracy among the distributor appellants to impose the restrictions upon later-run exhibitors is not supported by the court's subsidiary findings or by the evidence; (b) that the several separate contracts entered into by Interstate with the distributors are within the protection of the Copyright Act and consequently \n\n[306 \nU.S. 208, 221]\n\u00a0\n are not violations of the Sherman Act; and (c) that the restrictions do not unreasonably restrain interstate commerce within the provisions of the Sherman Act.\nThe Agreement Among the Distributors.\n Although the films were copyrighted, appellants do not deny that the conspiracy charge is established if the distributors agreed among themselves to impose the restrictions upon subsequent-run exhibitors. Straus v. American Publishers' Association, \n231 \nU.S. 222\n, 34 S.Ct. 84, L.R.A.1915A, 1099, Ann.Cas.1915A, 369; Paramount Famous Lasky Corp. v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 30\n, 51 S.Ct. 42. As is usual in cases of alleged unlawful agreements to restrain commerce, the government is without the aid of direct testimony that the distributors entered into any agreement with each other to impose the restrictions upon subsequent-run exhibitors. In order to establish agreement it is compelled to rely on inferences drawn from the course of conduct of the alleged conspirators.\n The trial court drew the inference of agreement from the nature of the proposals made on behalf of Interstate and Consolidated; from the manner in which they were made; from the substantial unanimity of action taken upon them by the distributors; and from the fact that appellants did not call as witnesses any of the superior officials who negotiated the contracts with Interstate or any official who, in the normal course of business, would have had knowledge of the existence or non-existence of such an agreement among the distributors. This conclusion is challenged by appellants because not supported by subsidiary findings or by the evidence. We think this inference of the trial court was rightly drawn from the evidence. In the view we take of the legal effect of the cooperative action of the distributor appellants in carrying into effect the restrictions imposed upon subsequent-run theatres in the four Texas cities and of the legal effect of the separate agreements for the imposi- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 208, 222]\n\u00a0\n tion of those restrictions entered into between Interstate and each of the distributors, it is unnecessary to discuss in great detail the evidence concerning this aspect of the case.\n The O'Donnell letter named on its face as addressees the eight local representatives of the distributors, and so from the beginning each of the distributors knew that the proposals were under consideration by the others. Each was aware that all were in active competition and that without substantially unanimous action with respect to the restrictions for any given territory there was risk of a substantial loss of the business and good will of the subsequent-run and independent exhibitors, but that with it there was the prospect of increased profits. There was, therefore, strong motive for concerted action, full advantage of which was taken by Interstate and Consolidated in presenting their demands to all in a single document.\n There was risk, too, that without agreement diversity of action would follow. Compliance with the proposals involved a radical departure from the previous business practices of the industry and a drastic increase in admission prices of most of the subsequent-run theatres. Acceptance of the proposals was discouraged by at least three of the distributors' local managers. Independent exhibitors met and organized a futile protest which they presented to the representatives of Interstate and Consolidated. While as a result of independent negotiations either of the two restrictions without the other could have been put into effect by any one or more of the distributors and in any one or more of the Texas cities served by Interstate, the negotiations which ensued and which in fact did result in modifications of the proposals resulted in substantially unanimous action of the distributors, both as to the terms of the restrictions and in the selection of the four cities where they were to operate. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 208, 223]\n\u00a0\n One distributor, it is true, did not agree to impose the restrictions in Houston, but this was evidently because it did not grant licenses to any subsequent-run exhibitor in that city, where its own affiliate operated a first-run theatre. \n7\n The proposal was unanimously rejected as to Galveston and Austin, as was the request that the restrictions should be extended to the cities of the Rio Grande Valley served by Consolidated. We may infer that Galveston was omitted because in that city there were no subsequent-run theatres in competition with Interstate. But we are unable to find in the record any persuasive explanation, other than agreed concert of action, of the singular unanimity of action on the part of the distributors by which the proposals were carried into effect as written in four Texas cities but not in a fifth or in the Rio Grande Valley. Numerous variations in the form of the provisions in the distributors' license agreements and the fact that in later years two of them extended the restrictions into all six cities, do not weaken the significance or force of the nature of the response to the proposals made by all the distributor appellants. It taxes credulity to believe that the several distributors would, in the circumstances, have accepted and put into operation with substantial unanimity such far-reaching changes in their business methods without some understanding that all were to join, and we reject as beyond the range of probability that it was the result of mere chance.\n Appellants present an elaborate argument, based on the minutiae of the evidence, that other inferences are to be drawn which explain, at least in some respects, the unanimity of action both in accepting the restrictions for some territories and rejecting them for others. It is said that the rejection of Consolidated's proposal for the \n\n[306 \nU.S. 208, 224]\n\u00a0\n Rio Grande Valley may have been due to the fact that the demand with respect to that territory differed materially from that directed to the six Texas cities. It is urged that the proposal for the Valley was that all pictures once shown in a first-run theatre with a 35 cents admission should not thereafter be exhibited in any city in the Valley for less than 25 cents admission, while the demand in behalf of Interstate with respect to the six Texas cities was that 'A' pictures, after a first-run in theatres charging 40 cents admission or more, should not thereafter be exhibited in the same city for less than 25 admission. But reference to the O'Donnell letter shows that both demands related to pictures shown in a first-run or 'A' theatre and were not in terms limited to subsequent-run exhibitions in the same city in which the first run had occurred. The record discloses no reason for the distinction taken between first-run theatres in the six cities charging an admission of 40 cents or more and those in the Valley served by Consolidated charging 35 cents, other than the fact that the cities there were smaller.\n The trial court, interpreting the letter in the light of the whole evidence, which showed unmistakably that one purpose of both demands was to protect first-run houses from competition of subsequent-run houses, concluded that the substance of the proposals in one case as in the other was that the restrictions upon the subsequent-run theatres were to be imposed only in the same city in which the first run had occurred. We agree with its conclusion, but in any event since the demand made by Interstate was phrased as broadly as that made by Texas Consolidated, both as to the kind of pictures affected and the scope of the restriction, we can find no basis for saying that one was more limited in its essentials than the other, or that any explanation is thus afforded of the unanimous acceptance of the demands of Interstate in \n\n[306 \nU.S. 208, 225]\n\u00a0\n four of the six cities affected by the proposal, and the unanimous rejection of the demand of Consolidated. In the face of this action and similar unanimity with respect to other features of the proposals, and the strong motive for such unanimity of action, we decline to speculate whether there may have been other and more legitimate reasons for such action not disclosed by the record, but which, if they existed, were known to appellants.\n The failure of the distributors to make any substantial changes in their business practices in dealing with exhibitors in Austin for the season 1934-35; their failure to unite in imposing the restriction as to admission prices in subsequent-run theatres in that city; and their failure to enter into the proposed restrictive agreement with Interstate for Austin, are likewise unexplained by any inferences to be drawn from the record. The facts that three of the distributors continued their established practice there, as elsewhere, of placing restrictions against double-billing in their license contracts; that the 25 cents admission restriction appeared in the Austin license agreements of one distributor for that year; and that certain of the distributors included the restrictions in their Austin license agreements in later years, do not militate against this conclusion. Taken together, the circumstances of the case which we have mentioned, when uncontradicted and with no more explanation than the record affords, justify the inference that the distributors acted in concert and in common agreement in imposing the restrictions upon their licensees in the four Texas cities.\n This inference was supported and strengthened when the distributors, with like unanimity, failed to tender the testimony, at their command, of any officer or agent of a distributor who knew, or was in a position to know, whether in fact an agreement had been reached among them for concerted action. When the proof supported, as we think it did, the inference of such concert, the \n\n[306 \nU.S. 208, 226]\n\u00a0\n burden rested on appellants of going forward with the evidence to explain away or contradict it. They undertook to carry that burden by calling upon local managers of the distributors to testify that they had acted independently of the other distributors, and that they did not have conferences with or reach agreements with the other distributors or their representatives. The failure under the circumstances to call as witnesses those officers who did have authority to act for the distributors and who were in a position to know whether they had acted in pursuance of agreement is itself persuasive that their testimony, if given, would have been unfavorable to appellants. The production of weak evidence when strong is available can lead only to the conclusion that the strong would have been adverse. Clifton v. United States, 4 How. 242, 247. Silence then becomes evidence of the most convincing character. Runkle v. Burnham, \n153 \nU.S. 216, 225\n, 14 S.Ct. 837, 840; Kirby v. Tallmadge, 160\u00f5u.S. 379, 383, 16 S.Ct. 349, 350; United States ex rel. Bilokumsky v. Tod, \n263 \nU.S. 149, 153\n, 154 S., 44 S.Ct. 54, 55, 56; United States ex rel. Vajtauer v.

United States, \n291 \nU.S. 293, 298\n, 54 S.Ct. 396, 398.\n While the District Court's finding of an agreement of the distributors among themselves is supported by the evidence, we think that in the circumstances of this case such agreement for the imposition of the restrictions upon subsequent-run exhibitors was not a prerequisite to an unlawful conspiracy. It was enough that, knowing that concerted action was contemplated and invited, the distributors gave their adherence to the scheme and participated in it. Each distributor was advised that the others were asked to participate; each knew that cooperation was essential to successful operation of the plan. They knew that the plan, if carried out, would result in a restraint of commerce, which, we will presently point out, was unreasonable within the meaning of the Sher- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 208, 227]\n\u00a0\n man Act, and knowing it, all participated in the plan. The evidence is persuasive that each distributor early became aware that the others had joined. With that knowledge they renewed the arrangement and carried it into effect for the two successive years.\n It is elementary that an unlawful conspiracy may be and often is formed without simultaneous action or agreement on the part of the conspirators. United States v. Schenck, D.C., 253 F. 212, 213, affirmed \n249 \nU.S. 47\n, 39 S.Ct. 247; Levey v. United States, 9 Cir., 92 F.2d 688, 691. Acceptance by competitors, without previous agreement, of an invitation to participate in a plan, the necessary consequence of which, if carried out, is restraint of interstate commerce, is sufficient to establish an unlawful conspiracy under the Sherman Act. Eastern States Retail Lumber Dealers' Association v. United States, \n234 \nU.S. 600\n, 34 S.Ct. 951, L.R.A.1915A, 788; Lawlor v. Loewe, \n235 \nU.S. 522, 534\n, 35 S.Ct. 170, 171; American Column & Lumber Co. v. United States, \n257 \nU.S. 377\n, 42 S.Ct. 114, 21 A.L.R. 1093; United States v. American Linseed Oil Co., \n262 \nU.S. 371\n, 43 S.Ct. 607\n\n\n The Protection Afforded by the Copyright Act to the Contracts between Interstate and the Distributors.\n The decree below enjoined enforcement and renewal of the separate agreements between each distributor and Interstate and of the contract between Paramount and Consolidated imposing the restrictions upon later- run theatres in certain cities in Texas and New Mexico, although the court found no conspiracy among the distributors to effect this latter restriction. Appellants assail this part of the decree on the ground that such separate agreements, if entered into without agreement or concert among the distributors, are a legitimate exercise of the monopoly secured to the distributors by their copyrights.\n Under  1 of the Copyright Act, 35 Stat. 1075, 17 U.S.C.  1, 17 U.S. C.A.  1, the owners of the copyright of a motion picture film acquire the right to exhibit the picture and to grant an exclusive or restrictive license to others to exhibit it. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 208, 228]\n\u00a0\n See Manners v. Morosco, \n252 \nU.S. 317\n, 40 S.Ct. 335. Appellants argue that the distributors were free to license the films for exhibition subject to the restrictions, just as a patentee in a license to manufacture and sell the patented article may fix the price at which the licensee may sell it. E. Bement & Sons v. National Harrow Co., \n186 \nU.S. 70\n, 22 S.Ct. 747; United States v. General Electric Co., \n272 \nU.S. 476\n, 47 S.Ct. 192. That the parallel is not complete is obvious. Because a patentee has power to control the price at which his licensee may sell the patented article, it does not follow that the owner of a copyright can dictate that other pictures may not be shown with the licensed film or the admission price which shall be paid for an entertainment which includes features other than the particular picture licensed. Cf. Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Manufacturing Co., \n243 \nU.S. 502\n, 37 S.Ct. 416, L.R.A.1917E, 1187, Ann.Cas. 1918A, 959; Carbice Corporation v. American Patents Development Corporation, \n283 \nU.S. 27\n, 51 S.Ct. 334; Leitch Manufacturing Co. v. Barber Co., \n302 \nU.S. 458\n, 58 S.Ct. 288.\n We have no occasion now to pass upon these or related questions. Granted that each distributor, in the protection of his own copyright monopoly, was free to impose the present restrictions upon his licensees, we are nevertheless of the opinion that they were not free to use their copyrights as implements for restraining commerce in order to protect Interstate's motion picture theatre monopoly by suppressing competition with it. The restrictions imposed upon Interstate's competitors did not have their origin in the voluntary act of the distributors or any of them. They gave effect to the will and were subject to the control of Interstate, not by virtue of any copyright of Interstate, for it had none, but through its contract with each distributor. Interstate was able to acquire the control and impose its will by force of its monopoly of first-run theatres in the principal cities of Texas and the threat to use its monopoly position against copyright owners who did not yield to its demands. The purpose \n\n[306 \nU.S. 208, 229]\n\u00a0\n and ultimate effect of each of its contracts with the distributors was to restrain its competitors in the theatre business by forcing an increase in their admission price and compelling them through the double feature restriction to make their entertainment less attractive, and to preclude the distributors for the specified time from relaxing the pressure of the restrictions upon them.\n The case is not one of the mere restriction of competition between the first showing of a copyrighted film by Interstate and a subsequent showing of the same film by a licensee of the copyright owner. The contract, when applied to the situation existing in the four Texas cities, had a more extensive effect. Both Interstate's first-run and second-run theatres in each of the cities regularly compete with the independent second-run theatres in those cities. Since all are in practically continuous operation during the season, competition between them extends to the exhibition of films furnished by different distributors including those of copyright owners shown by independents, which compete with those of other copyright owners shown at the same time by Interstate. Moreover, the provision in Interstate's contracts for the restriction against double billing stipulated for restraint upon competition with Interstate in the exhibition of films in the double bill in which neither Interstate nor the licensor had any interest by way of copyright or otherwise. The patent effect of the contract was to impose an undue restraint both as to admission price and the character of the exhibition upon competing theatre businesses habitually exhibiting the competitive pictures of different copyright owners. Through acceptance of its terms by the principal distributors the contract became the ready instrument by which Interstate succeeded in dominating the business of its competitors in the Texas cities. The fact that the restrictions may have been of a kind which a distributor could voluntarily have imposed, but \n\n[306 \nU.S. 208, 230]\n\u00a0\n did not, does not alter the character of the contract as a calculated restraint upon the distribution and use of copyrighted films moving in interstate commerce. Even if it be assumed that the benefit to the distributor from the restrictions is one which it might have secured through its monopoly control of the copyright alone, that would not extend the protection of the copyright to the contract with Interstate and to the resulting restraint upon the competition of its business rivals.\n A contract between a copyright owner and one who has no copyright, restraining the competitive distribution of the copyrighted articles in the open market in order to protect the latter from the competition, can no more be valid than a like agreement between two copyright owners or patentees. Straus v. American Publishers' Association, supra; Paramount Famous Lasky Corp. v. United States, supra; see Standard Oil Co. v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 163, 174\n, 51 S.Ct. 421, 425. In either case if the contract is effective, as it was here, competition is suppressed and the possibility of its resumption precluded by force of the contract. An agreement illegal because it suppresses competition is not any less so because the competitive article is copyrighted. The fact that the restraint is made easier or more effective by making the copyright subservient to the contract does not relieve it of illegality. Standard Sanitary Mfg. Co. v. United States, \n226 \nU.S. 20\n, 33 S.Ct. 9.\nUnreasonableness of the Restraint.\n The restrictions imposed on the subsequent-run exhibitors were harsh and arbitrary. As we have seen, they were forced upon the distributors and upon their customers as a result of the agreements entered into by Interstate with the distributors. Compliance with the restrictions was a uniform condition of exhibition of the films by subsequent-run theatres. There were wide differences in the location and character of the subsequent- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 208, 231]\n\u00a0\n run houses in the four Texas cities, which afforded basis for the corresponding differences in admission prices charged before the restrictions were adopted. Due to the practice of the distributors of establishing clearance periods between the first and each successive run, later runs are progressively less attractive. The poorer class of theatres, exhibiting the later runs, sometimes offered a double bill as an offsetting inducement for patronage. Despite these differences which normally affect the admission price that could be charged by subsequent- run theatres, the 25 cents admission price was to be required of all alike, forcing increases in admission price ranging from 25 per cent. to 150 per cent.\n The trial court found that practically all of the later-run exhibitors who bowed to the restrictions would not have done so but for the compulsion of their need of showing the restricted pictures, and that the result was to increase the income of the distributors and Interstate and diminish that of the exhibitors who accepted the restrictions, by deflecting attendance from subsequent-run theatres to Interstate's first- run theatres. There was no testimony that such loss was offset by the higher admission price of the second-run theatres, and there was evidence that some of the poorer class of second-run theatres suffered loss of income by yielding to the restrictions. Some who did not yield were compelled to forego exhibition of the distributors' feature pictures. The effect was a drastic suppression of competition and an oppressive price maintenance, of benefit to Interstate and the distributors but injurious alike to Interstate's subsequent-run competitors and to the public.\n The benefit, at such a cost does not justify the restraint. Eastern States Retail Lumber Dealers' Association v. United States, supra, page 613, 34 S.Ct. page 954; Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering, \n254 \nU.S. 443, 468\n, 41 S.Ct. 172, 177, 16 A.L.R. 196; Anderson v. Shipowners' Association, \n272 \nU.S. 359, 363\n, 47 S.Ct. 125, 126; Bedford Cut Stone Co. v. Journeyman Stone Cutters' Association, \n274 \nU.S. 37, 47\n, 47 S.Ct. 522, 525, 54 A.L.R. 791. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 208, 232]\n\u00a0\n It does not appear that the competition at which they were aimed was unfair or abnormal. Cf. Appalachian Coals, Inc., v. United States, \n288 \nU.S. 344, 363\n, 372 S., 53 S.Ct. 471, 475, 478. The consequence of the price restriction, though more oppressive, is comparable with the effect of resale price maintenance agreements, which have been held to be unreasonable restraints in violation of the Sherman Act. Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. John D. Park & Sons Co., \n220 \nU.S. 373\n, 31 S.Ct. 376; United States v. A. Schrader's Son, Inc., \n252 \nU.S. 85\n, 40 S.Ct. 251. Cf. United States v. Trenton Potteries Co., \n273 \nU.S. 392\n, 397 et seq., 47 S.Ct. 377, 379 et seq., 50 A.L.R. 989.\n We think the conclusion is unavoidable that the conspiracy and each contract between Interstate and the distributors by which those consequences were effected are violations of the Sherman Act and that the District Court rightly enjoined enforcement and renewal of these agreements, as well as of the conspiracy among the distributors.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS, dissenting.\n I think the decree should be reversed. The bill charges that the two exhibitor defendants which were under the same management, knowing that subsequent run houses in Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, Fort Worth, Austin, and Galveston, the largest cities in Texas, and in Waco, Wichita Falls, Tyler, Amarillo, Texas, and Albuquerque, New Mexico, could not operate without the showing of feature films, in order to strengthen these two defendants' monopoly in first run exhibition of such feature films, and to monopolize the business of exhibiting feature films in second or subsequent run houses operated by them in those cities, conspired to notify the distributor defendants that, during the 1934-1935 season, and subsequent seasons, the latter must advise second and subsequent run \n\n[306 \nU.S. 208, 233]\n\u00a0\n exhibitors that such feature films could not be operated in second or subsequent run houses for less than 25 cents adult lower floor admission or as part of a double feature program and that, unless the distributor defendants would do so, the exhibitors would not maintain a night adult admission price of 40 cents or more for the first run exhibitions of feature films licensed by the distributor defendants to them. The bill charged that, upon receipt of advices to this effect from the exhibitor defendants, the distributor defendants joined in the unlawful combination and conspired with the exhibitor defendants to place such restrictions in licenses to second or subsequent run exhibitors.\n The parties entered into a stipulation of facts, in lieu of evidence, binding upon them for the purposes of suit, and further agreed that any party might introduce additional relevant and material evidence bearing upon the issues 'but not inconsistent with any fact contained in' the stipulation. Plaintiff and defendants introduced additional evidence. The testimony of second or subsequent exhibitors called as witnesses by plaintiff and defendants may be said to have been, in some respects, conflicting. The evidence offered by the plaintiff and the defendants with respect to the negotiations between the exhibitor defendants and the distributor defendants, and the conduct of the latter, was uncontradicted upon all points material to a resolution of the fact issues in the cause.\n The District Court made ten findings (numbered from 12 to 21, inclusive) of subsidiary or evidentiary facts and based upon these specific findings one conclusion of ultimate fact,-that the distributor defendants conspired amongst themselves to take uniform action upon the proposals of Interstate and conspired with each other and with Interstate to impose the restrictions requested by Interstate upon all subsequent run exhibitors in Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston, and San Antonio. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 208, 234]\n\u00a0\n The appellants contend, and I think their contention is sound, that the subsidiary findings are insufficient to support the fact conclusion and that these subsidiary findings are, in a number of vital instances, contrary to, or unsupported by, the agreed statement of facts and, in other instances, are in the teeth of uncontradicted and unimpeached testimony.\n Since this is a direct appeal from the District Court in an equity suit, and the findings are challenged, this court is bound to review them and to determine whether they have a proper basis in the evidence. I think such a review demonstrates the lack of support of the critical basic findings. No good purpose would be served by a detailed analysis of what I consider erroneous and unsupported findings. But I am of opinion that the findings ought not to stand and that the conclusion that there was a conspiracy, either between the distributor defendants or between them and the Interstate corporation, is unjustified. The opinion of this court accepts and closely follows these findings of fact but, while approving the conclusion of the District Court, finds it unnecessary to give detailed consideration to the appellants' challenge of the accuracy and sufficiency of the subsidiary findings, for the reason that it holds, as matter of law, on uncontradicted facts, that there were eight separate conspiracies unreasonably to restrain trade in interstate commerce in virtue of the agreement of each of the distributor defendants with Interstate to impose restrictions on subsequent run exhibitors in certain cities.\n Separately considered, I think these agreements are not conspiracies contemplated by the Sherman Act and the holding that they are goes far beyond anything this court has ever decided. The distributor defendants are owners of copyrights on moving picture films. The copyright law gives them the exclusive privilege of licensing performances of the photoplays recorded. On the other \n\n[306 \nU.S. 208, 235]\n\u00a0\n hand, there are competing concerns whose copyrighted feature films are licensed for the purpose of production. In addition, there are copyrighted films of lower classes well known to the trade. These lower class films are usually licensed to houses that charge lower prices for first run exhibition than those charged by theatres showing feature films, and both the feature films, second and subsequent run, and other films of less attraction and less expensively produced, are exhibited by so-called second run houses. The latter pay a much reduced rate to obtain the feature films for exhibition in the same city after their original showing as feature films in first run houses. Many of the subsequent run houses charge low admission prices, and sometimes put on double bills.\n Interstate is the largest licensee of first run feature films in Texas. It has many more first run houses than any other Texas exhibitor. Its first run houses are in the largest cities where the highest admission prices can be obtained. The distributors are, of course, interested in the conservation and protection of the necessarily high license fees which they must obtain for first runs of feature pictures. These are far higher than those received for the second showings of the same pictures in the same city. They naturally have to protect themselves and their licensees from the destruction of the good will and drawing power of these feature films in their first runs. In an effort to accomplish this, by requiring minimum admission charges and prohibiting double billing in subsequent runs of feature pictures, they may, of course, narrow the opportunity of second run houses to obtain feature pictures.\n I agree that while the Copyright Act gives a distributors a so-called monopoly, that monopoly cannot be made the cover for a conspiracy to restrain trade or commerce. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[306 \nU.S. 208, 236]\n\u00a0\n But I think it obscures the issue to use the phrase 'monopoly'. What the copyright gives is much the same as what is conferred by the patent law. \n2\n The exhibition of a photoplay, were it not for the copyright law, would amount to a public disclosure and the use of the material would thereafter be open to the public. All the Copyright Act does is to create a form of property in the literary or artistic production of the author or artist. The Act attaches to the product of his brain certain attributes of property. One of these is the right of exclusive use similar to that attaching to physical property; another is the right to sell the production with consequent exclusive enjoyment in the vendee; another is the right to license others to use the product as one might lease or bail real or personal property. The monopoly, so called, amounts to no more than the attachment to the work of an author or composer or producer of motion pictures of the same rights as inhere in other property under the common law. Therefore, the standing of the distributor defendants toward their customers, as respects the productions proposed to be licensed, differs in no way from that of the owner of any other property toward those to whom he leases or licenses its use or sale.\n The decision of the court necessarily means that the owner of a product may not agree with an important customer that the former will not sell the product at a cut rate to the latter's competitors in the same city in which he conducts his business. The decision leads to the necessary conclusion that a manufacturer whose skill results in the production of apparatus of superior quality may not, in consideration of a price to be paid him for the bailment of that apparatus to certain users in a city, contract, as an inducement to the users, that he will not bail the same apparatus at lower and destruc- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 208, 237]\n\u00a0\n tive prices to his bailees' competitors in the same city. I think it has never been suggested that an agreement of the sort mentioned, restricted in time and place, amounts to a conspiracy in unreasonable restraint of trade or commerce. The right to make such agreements is essential to the realization of the full value of the property. It is conceded that the distributor defendants might grant exclusive licenses to Interstate, and that an exclusive license to Interstate would not constitute a conspiracy under the Sherman Act, or confer any cause of action on others who desired licenses in the same city; and this remains true however much such action by the licensor might injure the business of others seeking licenses.\n I am of opinion that the restrictions in the licenses of second run exhibitors were not unreasonable restraints of commerce under the Sherman Act. There is no contention that the action of the distributor defendants discouraged competition between them either for the business of Interstate or for that of subsequent run licensees. The restrictions upon the latter were not intended to increase license fees paid by them or those paid by Interstate; they were imposed to prevent destruction of the good will which made possible the continued exhibition of first run feature pictures and to avoid decrease of the revenue from those pictures then and theretofore enjoyed under licenses to Interstate and other first run feature exhibitors. The reasonableness of the restrictions must be judged by the situation of the industry and the propriety of its protection from practices which would seriously injure it. \n3\n The question always is whether an agreement unduly restrains competition and, in applying \n\n[306 \nU.S. 208, 238]\n\u00a0\n this test, consideration must be given both to the intent and effect of the agreement in the light of realities.\n It is settled that the proprietor of a copyright may grant an exclusive license; that is, may covenant with his licensee that he will not license anyone else, as the owner of a patent may grant a similar exclusive license to make or sell the patented article. \n4\n It is settled that the distributor defendants could lawfully stipulate with their licensees, whether first run or subsequent run, as to the admission price to be paid by patrons and that, so to do, would not be a violation of the Sherman Act.5. But it is said that if, in order to protect its earnings from first run licenses by enabling its licensees to pay the demanded consideration, the distributor agrees to restrict in anywise the exhibition of the same feature by a subsequent run exhibitor he has violated the Anti-Trust Law. In the nature of things this cannot be true. The record discloses that the distributors have always provided a so- called 'clearance' between the first run and subsequent runs of feature pictures. By this is meant that the distributors refuse to license a subsequent run theatre to show such a feature until the expiration of a given number of days or months after the picture has been shown in a first run house. This is a perfectly natural procedure and one obviously required to protect the value of the first run license. Under the decision here, however, if a distributor should agree with a first run house that if it will contract for a given feature picture at a given price the distributor will impose a clearance on second run houses this would be a conspiracy in restraint of trade. Other restrictions tending to preserve the value of the \n\n[306 \nU.S. 208, 239]\n\u00a0\n first exhibition of a feature picture such as those challenged in this case are just as necessary and I suppose, in the absence of agreement would be held just as lawful as the restriction known as a clearance.\n The opinion of the court recognizes that a distributor may lawfully agree that its exhibitor licensee shall have the exclusive right to exhibit a copyrighted play but condemns the agreements here in controversy although a much less drastic restraint respecting licenses to subsequent run exhibitors results from the provision for licenses with a restriction as to price and as to double billing.\n Once the property rights conferred by the Copyright Law are recognized it must follow that the principles governing the right to use, sell, or turn to account other forms of property are equally applicable here. We have often held that a contract containing a covenant in restraint of trade is valid if the restraint is reasonably necessary for the protection of the right granted by the owner of the property. Examples of such lawful contracts are those by which the vendor of a business sold as a going concern agrees that for the protection of its value he will for a period of years refrain from engaging in the same business in a prescribed territory;6 and those by the vendor with the vendee of an article to be used in business or trade that it shall not be used so as to interfere with the vendor's business,7 which are held not to offend the Sherman Act if the prohibition has a reasonable relation to the value of the business of the vendor. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 208, 240]\n\u00a0\n The Government stresses the fact that each of the distributors must have acted with knowledge that some or all of the others would grant or had granted Interstate's demand. But such knowledge was merely notice to each of them that if it was successfully to compete for the first run business in important Texas cities it must meet the terms of competing distributors or lose the business of Interstate. It could compete successfully only by granting exclusive licenses to Interstate and injuring subsequent run houses by refusing them licenses,-a course clearly lawful,-or by doing the less drastic thing of agreeing to protect the good will of its pictures by putting necessary and not severely burdensome restrictions upon subsequent run exhibitors, which I think equally lawful.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice BUTLER join in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] A first-run theatre is one in which a picture is first exhibited in any given locality. A subsequent-run theatre is one in which there is a subsequent exhibition of the same picture in the same locality. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Payments of license fees by Interstate to distributor appellants in the 1934-35 season aggregated $1,077,819.58.

Olsmyth, Doak Roberts.\n'Gentlemen: On April 25th, the writer notified you that in purchasing product for the coming season 34-35, it would be necessary for all distributors to take into consideration in the sale of subsequent runs that Interstate Circuit, Inc., will not agree to purchase produce to be exhibited in its 'A' theatres at a price of 40\u00f5 or more for night admission, unless distributors agree that in selling their product to subsequent runs, that this 'A' product will never be exhibited at any time or in any theatre at a smaller admission price than 25\u00f5 for adults in the evening.\n\n In addition to this price restriction, we also request that on 'A' pictures which are exhibited at a night admission price of 40\u00f5 or more- they shall never be exhibited in conjunction with another feature picture under the so-called policy of double-features.\n At this time the writer desires to again remind you of these restrictions due to the fact that there may be some delay in consummating all our feature film deals for the coming season, and it is imperative that in your negotiations that you afford us this clearance.\n In the event that a distributor sees fit to sell his product to subsequent runs in violation of this request, it definitely means that we cannot negotiate for his product to be exhibited in our 'A' theatres at top admission prices.\n We naturally, in purchasing subsequent runs from the distributors in certain of our cities, must necessarily eliminate double featuring and maintain the maximum 25\u00f5 admission price, which we are willing to do.\n Right at this time the writer wishes to call your attention to the Rio Grande Valley situation. We must insist that all pictures exhibited in our 'A' theatres at a maximum night admission price of 35\u00f5 must also be restricted to subsequent runs in the Valley at 25\u00f5. Regardless of the number of days which may intervene, we feel that in exploiting and selling the distributors' product, that subsequent runs should be restricted to at least a 25\u00f5 admission scale.\n The writer will appreciate your acknowledging your complete understanding of this letter.\n Sincerely,\n (Signed) R. J. O'Donnell.' \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] A Class 'A' picture is a 'feature picture' having five reels or more of film each approximately 1,000 feet in length, shown in theatres of the specified Texas cities charging 40 cents or more for adult admission at night.

BACON & SONS v. MARTIN(1939)\nNo. 203\nArgued: December 15, 1938Decided: January 3, 1939\n\n\n\n Mr. Charles I. Dawson, of Louisville, Ky., for appellant.\n The Court declined to hear further argument.\n\n PER CURIAM.\n Plaintiff sought judgment declaring invalid a statute imposing a tax on 'the receipt of cosmetics in the State by any Kentucky retailer',1 as applied to articles purchased from manufacturers and dealers in other States and transported to plaintiff at its place of business in Kentucky. Plaintiff contended that the tax was on 'the act of receiving' and hence was a direct burden upon interstate commerce. The Court of Appeals of Kentucky thus construed the statute:\n'The word 'receipt' is not used in a limited sense, but in the sense that it has already been received by the retailer and is now in his use . ... The word 'receipt' pre \n\n[305 \nU.S. 380, 381]\n\u00a0\n supposes that the cosmetics were now in use and after the sale had been consummated.\n\n'... It, therefore, follows that the imposition of the tax against the retailer is not on the act of receiving the cosmetics, but on the sale and use thereof, after the retailer has received them, that constitutes the excise tax. When we apply the intended and correct meaning of the word 'receipt' as used in the act, it is conclusive to our minds that the tax of the retailer, referred to, is paid when the articles are in his possession and when the merchant has unlimited control and dominion over the cosmetics'. Martin v. J. Bacon & Sons, 268 Ky. 612, 105 S.W.2d 569, 572.\n\n Adhering to that construction, the state court affirmed the present judgment sustaining the tax. 273 Ky. 389, 116 S.W.2d 963. The plaintiff appeals.\n The construction of the statute by the state court is binding upon us. Supreme Lodge, Knights of Pythias v. Meyer, \n265 \nU.S. 30, 32\n, 33 S., 44 S.Ct. 432, 433; Hicklin v.

UNITED ARTISTS CORPORATION(1939)\nNo. 161\nArgued: Decided: January 3, 1939\n\n\n\n Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of West Virginia. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 410, 411]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. W. Holt Wooddell and Clarence W. Meadows, both of Charleston, W.Va., for appellant.\n Mr. Robert G. Kelly, of Charleston, W.Va., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This appeal requires consideration of but a single question: whether appellee is subject to the provisions of a statute of West Virginia which lays a tax, measured by gross receipts, 'Upon every person (including corporations) engaging ... within this state in the business of collecting incomes from the use of real or personal property ....' Laws W.Va.1935, c. 86,  2-(i).\n Appellee, a Delaware corporation, having an office and its principal place of business in New York City, brought the present suit in the District Court for southern West Virginia against appellant, a West Virginia tax official, to restrain collection of a tax imposed by Article 13 of Chapter 11 of the West Virginia Code, as amended March 9, 1935, by c. 86, West Virginia Laws of 1935, on the ground that the appellee was not, by the terms of the statute, subject to the tax, and that the tax was an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[305 \nU.S. 410, 412]\n\u00a0\n The district court, three judges sitting, adopted as its findings the facts as stipulated. It found that the amount of the tax exceeded $3,000 and that such judicial remedy as there was under West Virginia law for recovery of the tax, if paid, was not enforceable at law in the federal courts, and that by reason of penalties for nonpayment, some of which were cumulative, appellee was without adequate legal remedy. The court concluded that appellee was not doing business in West Virginia or engaged there in the business of collecting income from the use of personal property, within the meaning of the applicable taxing act, and that the attempted tax was an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce, and decreed that collection of the tax be permanently enjoined. 23 F.Supp. 353. The case comes here on appeal under  266 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  380, 28 U.S.C.A.  380.\n Section 2 of Article 13, c. 11, of the West Virginia Code, as amended, lays annual privilege taxes upon various businesses and activities carried on within the state. Section 2-(g) imposes a tax of one-half of one per cent. of the gross income derived from the business of operating a theatre or moving picture show. Section 2-(h) taxes the gross receipts of every person engaging within the state in any business not otherwise specifically taxed, and  2-(i) levies upon 'every person engaging ... within this state in the business of collecting incomes from the use of real or personal property' a tax of one per cent. 'of the gross income of any such activity'.\n Appellee is engaged in the business of distributing motion picture films for exhibition in theatres in various states, including West Virginia. It maintains branch offices in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and the District of Columbia, but has no office or place of business in West Virginia, and has no agents or employees in the state other than a traveling representative who visits the state to solicit from theatre managers or owners contracts for the exhibition \n\n[305 \nU.S. 410, 413]\n\u00a0\n there of films to be supplied by appellee. Appellee owns no property in West Virginia other than the films sent there temporarily for exhibition and afterward returned to it at points without the state.\n In the course of its business appellee from time to time makes public announcements of its offering of films. Theatre owners or managers in West Virginia sign written applications in the form of offers for license contracts permitting the exhibition in West Virginia of such films as they desire to show there. The signed applications are transmitted to appellee's New York office, where it accepts or rejects them. When they are accepted, appellee signs a written acceptance attached to the application and returns the executed contract to the exhibitor. The subsequent course of business between appellee and the West Virginia exhibitor conforms to the terms of the contract. It calls for the delivery of the films by shipment from any of appellee's exchanges to the exhibitor in West Virginia, and provides for exhibition of the films for a specified period, for which the exhibitor undertakes to pay a fixed sum or a percentage of the receipts from exhibition, and for the return of the films by the exhibitor after they are shown, by shipping them to another exhibitor or to one of the appellee's exchanges, as appellee may direct.\n When the license is upon a percentage basis, the exhibitor undertakes to segregate appellee's percentage of the box office receipts and to hold it 'in trust' and pay it over to the appellee daily. But the contract provides that 'Any and all payments to be made hereunder shall be payable to the Distributor at the city in which is located the Exchange from which the Exhibitor is served,' and all payments due appellee from West Virginia exhibitors are sent by them to appellee at points without the state.\n Upon the argument the state conceded that the exhibitors of appellee's films in West Virginia are subject to \n\n[305 \nU.S. 410, 414]\n\u00a0\n and pay the tax imposed on operators of moving picture houses by  2-(g) and that the tax is measured by the entire gross receipts from exhibiting the films, ascertained without deducting the percentage payable to appellee. The Attorney General of the state disclaimed any contention that appellee was taxable under  2-(h), see Pennywitt v. Blue, State Tax Commissioner, 73 W.Va. 718, 81 S.E. 399, or under any provisions of the statute other than those of  2-(i) laying a gross receipts tax on every person engaging within the state in the business of collecting incomes from property.\n The Supreme Court of West Virginia appears not to have construed this section, and we are without the benefit of any legislative history of the statute indicating that it has any purpose or meaning other than that suggested by its words. We are not here concerned with the question whether a state, by a statute appropriately framed, may lay a tax on income derived from sources within it, or whether the solicitation of the contracts may be taxed. No such taxation is attempted by  2-(i). The taxing provisions of  2 are restricted in their application to various enumerated classes of activities within the state, one of which, specified in  2-(i), is that of engaging there in the business of collecting incomes. The conduct of such a business or activity by appellee requires its presence there, or that of its agent, and the collection of income within the state by the one or the other. As it is stipulated and found that appellee carries on no business within the state, except such as is involved in solicitation of the contracts, and has no collection agent there, and as the exhibitors there are bound to and do pay all sums due under their contracts to appellee at points outside the state, we can find no basis for saying that it is engaged in collecting income within the state, either as a business or otherwise. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 410, 415]\n\u00a0\n The contract requirement that the exhibitor is to set apart the appellee's percentage of the gross receipts 'in trust' is a familiar device for securing payment to the appellee in the event of the exhibitor's financial embarrassment. But it does not make the exhibitor appellee's agent, nor does it dispense in law, more than it has in fact, with the performance of the former's obligation to make all payments to appellee without the state. The emphasis placed by  2 and its various subsections on the carrying on of business or other specified activities within the state as the condition of laying the tax, and the fact that the exhibitors' receipts are taxed in their hands under  2-(g), lead to the conclusion that there was no legislative purpose in cases like the present to tax gross receipts apart from the business or activity of collecting them, carried on within the state. We cannot say that the court below was wrong in that conclusion.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The suit was begun before the enactment on August 21, 1937, of the amendment to  24 of the Judicial Code, 50 Stat. 738, 28 U.S.C.A.  41(1), providing that 'no district court shall have jurisdiction of any suit to enjoin, suspend, or restrain the assessment, levy, or collection of any tax imposed by or pursuant to the laws of any State where a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy may be had at law or in equity in the courts of such State.' Section 2 of the Act, 28 U.S.C.A.  41(1a) excludes from its operation suits begun in the district courts before its enactment. \n\n\n\n\n","69":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJOHN HANCOCK MUT. LIFE INS. CO. v. BARTELS(1939)\nNo. 33\nArgued: November 9, 1939Decided: December 4, 1939\n\n\n\n\n[308 \nU.S. 180, 181]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. L. M. Bickett, of San Antonio, Tex., and John H. Bickett, Jr., of Dallas, Tex., for petitioner.\n Messrs. T. E. Mosheim, of Seguin, Tex., Elmer McClain, of Lima, Ohio, and Wm. Lemke, of Fargo, N.D., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In this proceeding brought by a farmer under Section 75 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A.  203, the District Court dismissed the debtor's petition. The Circuit Court of Appeals held that this action was contrary to the requirements of the statute and directed the proceeding to be reinstated. 5 Cir., 100 F.2d 813. Because of conflict in the rulings of the Court of Appeals of the Fifth Circuit, due to the differing views of the judges composing the court in the cases cited,1 and because of the importance of the question, we granted certiorari, \n307 \nU.S. 617\n, 59 S.Ct. 794, April 24, 1939\n\n\n Respondent Bartels presented his petition to the District Court on December 2, 1937, asking that he be afforded an opportunity to effect a composition or exten- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 180, 182]\n\u00a0\n sion of time to pay his debts under Section 75. The court referred the matter to a conciliation commissioner, directing the debtor to appear before the commissioner and to submit to such orders as might be made in proceedings under that section. A meeting of the creditors was held on December 21, 1937, at which the debtor was present and was examined. It appeared that his debts amounted to about $10,000 of which about $8,000 ( including interest and attorney's fees) was owing to the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company and was secured by a lien upon his home. As the debtor was unable to obtain an agreement with a majority of his creditors in number and amount, he notified the commissioner that he would apply to be adjudged a bankrupt under subsection  of Section 75, 11 U.S.C. A.  203, sub. s. That application was filed on January 10, 1938. The debtor asked that 'his property be appraised', that 'his exemption be set aside to him' and that he be permitted 'to retain possession of his property under the supervision of the court'. On the same day, the District Judge entered an order adjudging the debtor a bankrupt and requiring further proceedings before the commissioner acting as referee under subsection s.\n On March 23, 1938, the John Hancock Company moved to set aside the adjudication and to dismiss the debtor's petition on the ground that the debtor was not entitled to avail himself of the provisions of subsection ( s); that he had not presented any feasible plan for a composition and extension of his debts, and that his petition 'was not filed in good faith' or 'with and hope or expectation of working out his debts and paying up his delinquencies but apparently for the sole purpose of hindering and delaying his creditors'. The Company also alleged that at the fair market value of the real property held by it as security there was no equity for the debtor and that the Company would suffer irreparable loss unless the adjudication was set aside and the proceeding dismissed. \n\n[308 \nU.S. 180, 183]\n\u00a0\n The debtor denied these allegations and alleged that the land on which the Company had a lien was worth unimproved more than $7,000 and that the improvements were worth $6,000 and that he thus had a large equity which would be lost to him unless he obtained the benefits sought under the applicable law.\n At the hearing of the motion on April 5, 1938, the court received the evidence previously taken before the commissioner and additional testimony. Thereupon the motion was granted. The District Judge said in his opinion that the debtor had not made any proposal which could be construed as a 'good faith offer for an extension or composition' and hence the debtor was not entitled to be adjudged a bankrupt under subsection s. The District Judge observed that the evidence was conflicting as to the value of the land (100 acres); that, separating the land from its improvements, certain of the debtor's witnesses placed its value at $70 an acre and the improvements at $5,000 or $6,000, while witnesses for the creditor valued the land at about $40 an acre and the improvements at about $2,000. He thought that there was no reasonable probability of the property being sold for enough to give any substantial equity to the debtor and accordingly found that there was no reasonable probability of the debtor's financial rehabilitation. In that view the District Judge concluded 'that the order adjudicating the debtor a bankrupt under subsection (s) was improperly entered and should be set aside and the cause dismissed'.\n We think that the District Judge failed to follow the mandate of the statute and that the Circuit Court of Appeals was right in reversing the judgment and ordering the proceeding to be reinstated.\n Subsection  of Section 75 as amended by the Act of August 28, 1935,2 prescribes a definite course of procedure. That \n\n[308 \nU.S. 180, 184]\n\u00a0\n subsection applies explicitly to a case of a farmer who has failed to obtain the acceptance of a majority in number and amount of all creditors whose claims are affected by a proposal for a composition or an extension of time to pay his debts. That was Bartels' situation. Provisions for proceedings by a farmer to obtain a composition or extension, when he is insolvent or unable to pay his debts as they mature, are found in subsections a to r of Section 75, 11 U.S.C.A.  203, subs. a to r. For that relief Bartels had presented his petition under subsection (c) and the District Court had approved the petition as properly filed. According to the report of the conciliation commissioner, to whom the matter was referred according to the statute, Bartels had appeared at the meeting of the creditors and had submitted to a detailed examination concerning his financial condition. He proposed to sell certain property and to apply the proceeds to the payment in part of the amounts due to the John Hancock Company, the secured creditor. He succeeded in obtaining an agreement with certain unsecured creditors for an extension but the secured creditor refused consent, as Bartels could not meet all his arrears. Bartels was thus precisely in the condition prescribed in subsection s.\n The subsections of Section 75 which regulate the procedure in relation to the effort of a farmer-debtor to obtain a composition or extension contain no provision for a dismissal because of the absence of a reasonable probability of the financial rehabilitation of the debtor. \n3\n Nor is there anything in these subsections which warrants the imputation of lack of good faith to a farmer-debtor because of that plight. The plain purpose of Section 75 was to afford relief to such debtors who found themselves \n\n[308 \nU.S. 180, 185]\n\u00a0\n in economic distress however severe, by giving them the chance to seek an agreement with their creditors, subsections a to r, and, failing this, to ask for the other relief afforded by subsection s. The farmer-debtor may offer to pay what he can, as Bartels did, and he is not to be charged with bad faith in taking the course for which the statute expressly provides. The only reference in Section 75 to good faith is found in subsection i, which relates solely to the confirmation of proposals for composition or extension when the court must be satisfied that the offer and its acceptance are in good faith and have not been made or procured by forbidden means or except as provided in the statute. That provision manifestly hits at secret advantages to favored creditors or other improper or fraudulent conduct.\n As Bartels' case thus fell within subsection s, he amended his petition and asked to be adjudicated a bankrupt as that subsection permits. He was so adjudicated. Bartels then asked, also as provided in subsection s, that his property be appraised, that his exemptions be set aside to him as provided by state law, and that he be allowed to retain possession of his property under the supervision of the court, that is, subject to such orders as the court might make in accordance with the statute. The court failed to take that action. Instead of having the property appraised, the court received conflicting testimony as to value, discussed the chances of the debtor's rehabilitation and dismissed the petition and all proceedings thereunder.\n The procedure under subsection  is intended to protect all interests. It provides, in paragraph (1), that after the value of the debtor's property has been fixed by the prescribed appraisal, the referee shall set aside the debtor's unencumbered exemptions and direct his retention of possession of the rest of his property subject \n\n[308 \nU.S. 180, 186]\n\u00a0\n to all liens and to the court's supervision and control. Under paragraph ( 2), if there has been compliance with the statutory conditions, the court is directed to stay all proceedings against the debtor or his property for a period of three years, and during that time the debtor may retain possession of all or part of his property subject to the court's control, provided he pays a reasonable rental semi-annually. That rental is to be paid into court and is to be used first for the payment of taxes and the upkeep of the property and the remainder is to be distributed among the creditors as their interests may appear. If the court finds it necessary to protect the creditors 'from loss by the estate', or 'to conserve the security', the court may order any unexempt perishable property of the debtor, or any unexempt personal property not reasonably necessary for the farming operations of the debtor, to be sold at public or private sale, and the court, in addition to the prescribed rental, may require payments to be made by the debtor on the principal of his debts in the manner set forth. Then it is provided, in paragraph (3), that at the end of the three- year period, or at any time before that, the debtor may pay into court the appraised value of the property of which he retains possession, 'including the amount of encumbrances on his exemptions, up to the amount of the appraisal, less the amount paid on principal', for appropriate distribution to his creditors. There is the proviso that upon the request of any creditor, or of the debtor, the court shall cause the debtor's property to be reappraised, or in its discretion set a date for hearing, and thereafter fix the value of the property in accordance with the evidence, and the debtor shall then pay the value so arrived at into court, less payments made on the principal, for distribution to his creditors. In that way, by the order of the court, the debtor may regain full possession and title of such property, the ascertained \n\n[308 \nU.S. 180, 187]\n\u00a0\n value of which has thus been devoted to the payment of his debts. There is the further proviso, for the protection of secured creditors, that upon request in writing by any secured creditor the court shall order the property upon which the secured creditor has a lien to be sold at public auction. See Wright v. Vinton Branch, supra, 300 U.S. pages 458-461, 57 S. Ct. pages 559-561, 112 A.L.R. 1455. The debtor is to have ninety days to redeem the property so sold by paying the amount for which it was sold, with interest, into court, and he may apply for his discharge as provided in the Act. If, however, the debtor at any time fails to comply with the provisions of the section or with any orders of the court made thereunder, or is unable to refinance himself within three years, the court may order the appointment of a trustee and direct the property to be sold or otherwise disposed of as provided in the Act.\n The scheme of the statute is designed to provide an orderly procedure so as to give whatever relief may properly be afforded to the distressed farmer-debtor, while protecting the interests of his creditors by assuring the fair application of whatever property the debtor has to the payment of their claims, the priorities and liens of secured creditors being preserved. See Wright v. Vinton Branch, supra; Adair v. Bank of America Nat. Trust & Savins Association, \n303 \nU.S. 350\n, 354-357, 58 S.Ct. 694, 695; Wright v. Union Central Life Insurance Co., \n304 \nU.S. 502, 516\n, 517 S., 58 S.Ct. 1025, 1033.\n We are not here concerned with questions which may arise in the course of the administration under the statute, but merely with the duty to follow the procedure which the statute defines and the District Court failed to observe. We hold that on his amended petition invoking subsection  Bartels was entitled to be adjudged a bankrupt and to have his proceeding for relief entertained and his property dealt with in accordance with that subsection. \n\n[308 \nU.S. 180, 188]\n\u00a0\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals reversing that of the District Court and directing the proceeding to be reinstated is affirmed and the cause is remanded to the District Court with direction to proceed in conformity with this opinion. It is so ordered.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Baxter v. Savings Bank of Utica, 5 Cir., 92 F.2d 404; In re Henderson, 5 Cir., 100 F.2d 820; Wilson v.

FINCH & CO. v. MCKITTRICK(1939)\nNo. 252\nArgued: December 7, 1938Decided: January 3, 1939\n\n\n\n Appeals from the District Court of the United States for the Western District of Missouri.\n Messrs. Thomas Kiernan and Joseph M. Hartfield, both of New York City, for appellants.\n Mr. Edward H. Miller, of Jefferson City, Mo., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The State of Missouri approved April 8, 1937,1 an Act, sometimes called the Missouri Anti-Discrimination Act, \n\n[305 \nU.S. 395, 396]\n\u00a0\n sometimes the Missouri Retaliation Act. It provides in Section 4, Mo.St. Ann.  4525h-4, p. 4689: 'The transportation or importation into this state, or the purchase, sale, receipt, or possession herein, by any licensee, of any alcoholic liquor manufactured in a 'state in which discrimination exists' is hereby prohibited, and it shall be unlawful for any licensee to transport or import into this state, or to purchase, receive, possess, or sell in this state, any alcoholic liquor manufactured in any 'state in which discrimination exists' as herein defined.' The statute defines what exactions, prohibitions and restrictions imposed by laws of the several states shall be deemed 'discriminations' imposed upon the importation into the several states of alcoholic liquor manufactured in Missouri; requires the Attorney General to determine whether there exists therein an such discrimination; and, if he find any such discriminatory law, to specify the same in a certificate to be filed with the Supervisor of Liquor Control. The Supervisor is directed to publish notice of the certificates and to advise all licensees that it will be unlawful to import into Missouri or to purchase, receive, sell or possess in Missouri any liquor manufactured in a discriminating state. Pursuant to these provisions, the Attorney General filed, in October, 1937, certificates with the Supervisor declaring that the States of Indiana, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Massachusetts are 'states in which discriminations existed' as defined by the Missouri statute.\n To enjoin enforcement of this provision of the Missouri statute, these five suits were brought, in the federal court for the western district of the state, against the Attorney General and the Supervisor of Liquor Control. Each bill charges that the provision violates the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution and the equal protection \n\n[305 \nU.S. 395, 397]\n\u00a0\n clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S.C.A.Const. art. 1,  8, cl. 3; Amend. 14.2 In four of the cases the bill alleges that the plaintiff is a citizen of a state other than Missouri; that it manufactures liquor in one of the states certified as 'discriminating'; that it holds a non-resident Missouri permit under which it imports and sells in Missouri a part of its products; and that it would be irreparably injured if the provision of the Missouri statutes were enforced. The fifth case differs only in that the bill alleges that the plaintiff is a citizen of Missouri engaged there in the rectifying and bottling business for which it imports liquor manufactured in a state certified as 'discriminating.' As both a temporary and a permanent injunction was sought in each case, each was assigned for hearing before a three-judge court. In each the defendants moved to dismiss the bill. Later, the cases were consolidated for hearing and review; and it was agreed that when the court heard the application for the temporary injunction it should finally determine the causes. The District Court denied the applications for a temporary and a permanent injunction and dismissed the bill in each case. 23 F.Supp. 244. But the temporary restraining orders issued upon the filing of the bills were continued until the final determination of the appeals to this Court.\n The claim of unconstitutionality is rested, in this Court, substantially on the contention that the statute violates the commerce clause. \n3\n It is urged that the Missouri law does not relate to protection of the health, safety and morality, or the promotion of their social wel \n\n[305 \nU.S. 395, 398]\n\u00a0\n fare, but is merely an economic weapon of retaliation; and that, hence, the Twenty-First Amendment, U.S.C.A.Const. Amend. 21, should not be interpreted as granting power to enact it. Since that amendment, the right of a State to prohibit or regulate the importation of intoxicating liquor is not limited by the commerce clause. As was said in State Board of Equalization v. Young's Market Co., \n299 \nU.S. 59, 62\n, 57 S.Ct. 77, 78, 'The words used are apt to confer upon the state the power to forbid all importations which do not comply with the conditions which it prescribes.' To limit the power of the states as urged 'would involve not a construction of the amendment, but a rewriting of it.' See also Mahoney v.

Casper v. Regional Agricultural Credit Corporation, 202 Minn. 433, 278 N.W. 896. The question is whether a Regional Agricultural Credit Corporation, in the circumstances presently to be stated, is immune from suit.\n On July 21, 1932, Congress enlarged the powers of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (hereafter called 'Reconstruction') established early that year, Act of January 22, 1932, c. 8, 47 Stat. 5, 15 U.S.C.A.  601 et seq., by authorizing it, among other things, to create regional agricultural credit corporations 'in any of the twelve Federal land-bank districts.' Emergency Relief and Construction Act of 1932,  201(e), c. 520, 47 Stat. 709, 713, 12 U.S.C.A.  1148. Each corporation was to have a paid-up capital of not less than $3,000,000 to be subscribed for by Reconstruction, was to be managed by appointees of Reconstruction, and was empowered to make loans to farmers and stockmen for agricultural purposes or for raising and marketing livestock. Accordingly, on September 10, 1932, Reconstruction chartered the Regional Agricultural Credit Corporation of Sioux City, Iowa (hereafter called 'Regional'). Regional, in due exercise of its powers, entered into so-called cattle-feeding contracts, whereby it undertook to provide sufficient feed and water for livestock with appropriate security for rendering these services. Failure through negligence to provide proper care for cattle delivered under this arrangement, with resulting damage to the livestock, is the basis of this suit brought by petitioner, plaintiff below, against Reconstruction and Regional. Both de- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 381, 388]\n\u00a0\n fendants demurred on several grounds, of which challenge to the jurisdiction of the court is alone pertinent here. The District Court sustained the demurrers and dismissed the suit. 22 F.Supp. 918. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed, holding for Reconstruction because its control of Regional had been transferred by Executive Order (No. 6084, dated March 27, 1933, effective May 27, 1933, 12 U.S.C.A. c. 7 note) to the Farm Credit Administration prior to the alleged cause of action, and for Regional because it was found immune from suit. 8 Cir., 97 F.2d 812. Certiorari was granted, directed solely to the latter issue. \n305 \nU.S. 588\n, 59 S.Ct. 106, 83 L.Ed. --.\n The starting point of inquiry is the immunity from unconsented suit of the government itself. As to the states, legal irresponsibility was written into the Eleventh Amendment, Const.U.S.C.A.; as to the United States, it is derived by implication. Principality of Monaco v. Mississippi, \n292 \nU.S. 313, 321\n, 54 S.Ct. 745, 747. For present purposes it is academic to consider whether this exceptional freedom from legal responsibility rests on the theory that the United States is deemed the institutional descendant of the Crown, enjoying its immunity but not its historic prerogatives, cf. Langford v. United States, \n101 \nU.S. 341\n, 343, or on a metaphysical doctrine 'that there can be no legal right as against the authority that makes the law on which the right depends.' Kawananakoa v. Polyblank, \n205 \nU.S. 349, 353\n, 27 S.Ct. 526, 527. But because the doctrine gives the government a privileged position, it has been appropriately confined. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Therefore, the government does not become the conduit of its immunity in suits against its agents or instrumentalities merely because they do its work. United States v. Lee, \n106 \nU.S. 196, 213\n, 221 S., 1 S.Ct. 240, 254, 261; Sloan Shipyards Corp. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 381, 389]\n\u00a0\n v. U.S. Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corp., \n258 \nU.S. 549, 567\n, 42 S.Ct. 386, 388. For more than a hundred years corporations have been used as agencies for doing work of the government. Congress may create them 'as appropriate means of executing the powers of government, as, for instance, ... a railroad corporation for the purpose of promoting commerce among the states.' Luxton v. North River Bridge Co., \n153 \nU.S. 525, 529\n, 14 S.Ct. 891, 892. But this would not confer on such corporations legal immunity even if the conventional to-sue- and-be-sued clause were omitted. In the context of modern thought and practice regarding the use of corporate facilities, such a clause is not a ritualistic formula which alone can engender liability like unto indispensable words of early common law, such as 'warrantizo' or 'to A and his heirs', for which there were no substitutes and without which desired legal consequences could not be wrought. Littleton, Tenures (Wambaugh ed .)  1, 733.\n Congress may, of course, endow a governmental corporation with the government's immunity. But always the question is: has it done so? Federal Land Bank v. Priddy, \n295 \nU.S. 229, 231\n, 55 S.Ct. 705, 706. Cf. Helvering v. Gerhardt, \n304 \nU.S. 405, 411\n, 412 S., notes, 58 S.Ct. 969, 971, 972. This is our present problem. Has Congress endowed Regional with immunity in the circumstances which enveloped its creation? It is not a textual problem; for Congress has not expressed its will in words. Congress may not even have had any consciousness of intention. The Congressional will must be divined, and by a process of interpretation which, in effect, is the ascertainment of policy immanent not merely in the single statute from which flow the rights and responsibilities of Regional, but in a series of statutes utilizing corporations for governmental purposes and drawing significance from dominant contemporaneous opinion regarding the immunity of governmental agencies from suit. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 381, 390]\n\u00a0\n Because of the advantages enjoyed by the corporate device compared with conventional executive agencies, the exigencies of war and the enlarged scope of government in economic affairs have greatly extended the use of independent corporate facilities for governmental ends. \n2\n In spawning these corporations during the past two decades, Congress has uniformly included amenability to law. Congress has provided for not less than forty of such corporations discharging governmental functions, and without exception the authority to-sue-and-be-sued was included. \n3\n Such a firm practice is partly \n\n[306 \nU.S. 381, 391]\n\u00a0\n an indication of the present climate of opinion which has brought governmental immunity from suit into disfavor, partly it reveals a definite attitude on the part of Congress which should be given hospitable scope. \n4\n It is noteworthy that the oldest surviving government corporation- the Smithsonian Institution-has several times been in the law courts, even in the absence of explicit authority and although the general feeling regard- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 381, 392]\n\u00a0\n ing governmental immunity was very different in 1846 from what it has become in our own day. 9 Stat. 102, 20 U.S.C.A.  41 et seq. Smithsonian Institution v. Meech, \n169 \nU.S. 398\n, 18 S.Ct. 396; Smithsonian Institution v. St. John, \n214 \nU.S. 19\n, 29 S.Ct. 601.\n Only two instances have been brought to the Court's attention in which Congress has not explicitly rendered its recent corporate creations amenable to suit. These are the Regionals and the Federal Savings and Loan Associations. 48 Stat. 128, 132-134, 12 U.S.C.A.  1464. It is significant that neither of these classes of corporations was the direct emanation of Congress or the offspring of a general incorporation law under Congressional authority. Sloan Shipyards Corp. v. U.S. Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corp., supra. Each was to come into being through an organ that had theretofore been created by Congress. We put the Federal Savings and Loan Associations to one side, because they are not now before the Court. \n5\n But the circumstances attending the origination of Regional make it manifest that it was within the considerations that have uniformly led Congress to make its immediate corporate creatures subject to suit. The genesis, functions, and affiliations of Regional all negative the assumption that in its operations it was to be without the law.\n Reconstruction is the parent of Regional. When creating it, Congress gave Reconstruction various general corporate powers including authority 'to sue and be sued, to complain and to defend, in any court of competent jurisdiction, State or Federal.' 47 Stat. 5, 6, 15 U.S.C.A.  604. When later Congress authorized Reconstruction to create these Regional Agricultural Credit Corporations, it did so by \n\n[306 \nU.S. 381, 393]\n\u00a0\n outlining in a single section of a comprehensive statute the broad scope of this added power for Reconstruction. 47 Stat. 709, 713.6 Congress naturally assumed that the general corporate powers to which it had given particularity in the original statute establishing Reconstruction would flow automatically to the Regionals from the source of their being. Such, certainly, has been the practical construction of the Regional Agricultural Credit Corporations in the instinctive pursuit of their enterprise. See, e.g., Hallenbeck v. Regional Agricultural Credit Corporation, 47 Ariz. 477, 56 P.2d 1041; Regional Agricultural Credit Corporation v. Elston, Prince & McDade, La.App., 183 So. 91. Cf. Lewis v. Regional Agricultural Credit Corporation, 10 Cir., 92 F.2d 1008. To imply for Regionals a unique legal position compared with those corporations to whose purposes Regional is so closely allied,7 is to inter Congressional idiosyncrasy. There is a much more sensible explanation for the failure of Congress to bring Regional by express terms within its emphatic practice not to confer sovereign immunity upon these government corporations. Congress had a right to assume that the characteristic energies for corporate enterprise with which \n\n[306 \nU.S. 381, 394]\n\u00a0\n a few months previously it had endowed Reconstruction would now radiate through Reconstruction to Regional.\n To give Regional an immunity denied to more than two score corporations, each designed for a purpose of government not relevantly different from that which occasioned the creation of Regional, is to impute to Congress a desire for incoherence in a body of affiliated enactments and for drastic legal differentiation where policy justifies none. A fair judgment of the statute in its entire setting relieves us from making such an imputation of caprice.\n The legal position of Regional is, therefore, the same as though Congress had expressly empowered it 'to sue and be sued.' The scope of this liability remains to be explored.\n Regional claims immunity in any event because Congress has not subjected it to suit 'in tort'. It is assumed that the present action is not one upon a contract, express or implied, and, therefore, outside the purview of 'to sue and be sued.' The premise is not valid, nor does the conclusion follow.\n The transaction which gave rise to the controversy was a bailment of livestock for hire, and the cause of action lack of reasonable diligence by the bailee. Ever since the fifteenth century, according to Maitland, there were 'actions against bailees for negligence in the custody of goods intrusted to them, and here also it was necessary to allege an assumpsit'- the having undertaken to do something. Maitland, Equity, Lecture VI, pp. 362, 363; Maitland, The Forms of Action at Common Law, Lecture VI, pp. 68, 69. That Regional's failure properly to feed and water the livestock entrusted to it by the cattle-feeding contract was not a wrong disassociated from carrying out the very transaction which brought it into existence, is evident from the recognized liability of the United States itself as lessee and bailee even under the \n\n[306 \nU.S. 381, 395]\n\u00a0\n explicit restrictions of the Court of Claims Acts. \n8\n Both this Court and the Court of Claims have sustained actions not dissimilar from the present. They have recognized that the breach of implied duty of a lessee 'not to commit waste, or suffer it to be committed,' United States v. Bostwick, \n94 \nU.S. 53\n, 68, and of a bailee not to neglect 'to exercise ordinary care and skill,' Gulf Transit Co. v. United States, 43 Ct.Cl. 183, 199, are duties that have their source in contract even though the guilty agents may be merely tort-feasors. To be sure, the common law fiction of waiving the tort and suing in assumpsit cannot be used as an evasion of the limited liability created by the Court of Claims Acts. Bigby v. United States, \n188 \nU.S. 400\n, 23 S.Ct. 468; United States v. Minnesota Mut. Investment Co., \n271 \nU.S. 212, 217\n, 46 S.Ct. 501, 502. But where the wrong really derives from an undertaking, to stand on the undertaking and to disregard the tort is not to invoke a fictive agreement. It merely recognizes a choice of procedural vindications open to the injured party.\n To assume that Congress in subjecting these recently created governmental corporations to suit meant to enmesh them in these procedural entanglements, would do violence to Congressional purpose. When it chose to do so, Congress knew well enough how to restrict its consent to suits sounding only in contract, even with all the controversies in recondite procedural learning that this might entail. It did so with increasing particularity in the successive Court of Claims Acts. 10 Stat. 612, 24 Stat. 505, 28 U.S.C.  41(20), 250(1), 28 U.S.C.A.  41(20), 250(1). In the light of these statutes it ought not to be assumed that when \n\n[306 \nU.S. 381, 396]\n\u00a0\n Congress consented 'to suit' without qualification, the effect is the same as though it had written 'in suits on contract, express or implied, in cases not sounding in tort.' No such distinction was made by Congress, and no such interpolation into statutes has been made in cases affecting government corporations incorporated under state law or that of the District of Columbia. \n9\n There is equally no warrant for importing such a distinction here. To do so would make application of a steadily growing policy of governmental liability contingent upon irrelevant procedural factors. These, in our law, are still deeply rooted in historical accidents to which the expanding conceptions of public morality regarding governmental responsibility should not be subordinated.\n Congress has embarked upon a generous policy of consent for suits against the government sounding in tort even where there is no element of contract. It has sanctioned suits for patent infringement, 36 Stat. 851, 35 U.S.C.A.  68, provided for compensation for the disability or death of a government employee 'while in the performance of his duty,' 39 Stat. 742, 5 U.S.C.A.  751 et seq., authorized payment for damage to property by the Army Air Service. 41 Stat. 109. These and other public statutes and many private bills were founded on considerations thus generalized in a Report of the Senate Committee on Claims:\n'In other words, it may be said that Congress has recognized the general liability of the Government within maximum amounts for the negligence of officers and employees of the United States, but the machinery for determining that liability is defective and results in overburdening the Claims Committee of Congress and Congress itself with the consideration of tort liability claims and with injuries to the claimants. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 381, 397]\n\u00a0\n 'This proposed legislation is designed to relieve the situation by utilizing the machinery of the Accounting Office and judicial branches of the Government in the assistance of Congress.' Senate Report No. 1699, 70th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 4. See also Senate Report No. 658, 72d Cong., 1st Sess., p. 3.\n\n Acting on these views, Congress passed a general court of claims bill, which, however, at the close of the session failed of enactment by President Coolidge's pocketveto. H.R. 9285, 70th Cong., 2d Sess.; 70 Cong. Rec. 4836. 10 Congress has thus clearly manifested an attitude which serves as a guide to the scope of liability implicit in the general authority it has conferred on governmental corporations to sue and be sued. We should be denying the recent trend of Congressional policy to relieve Regional from liability. This compels us to reverse the judgment of the court below.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Professor Borchard's bibliography in (1934) 20 A.B.A.J. 747, 748, and the collection of authorities in Judge Mack's opinion in The Pesaro, D.C., 277 F. 473, reversed \n271 \nU.S. 562\n, 46 S.Ct. 611. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See Thurston, Government Proprietary Corporations; Van Dorn, Government Owned Corporations; McDiarmid, Government Corporations and Federal Funds; Field, Government Corporations: A Proposal (1935) 48 Harv.L.

'A statute,' he wrote in Johnson v. United States, 1 Cir., 163 F. 30, 32, 18 L.R.A.,N.S., 1194, 'may indicate or require as its justification a change in the policy of the law, although it expresses that change only in the specific cases most likely to occur to the mind. The Legislature has the power to decide what the policy of the law shall be, and if it has intimated its will, however indirectly, that will should be recognized and obeyed. The major premise of the conclusion expressed in a statute, the change of policy that induces the enactment, may not be set out in terms, but it is not an adequate discharge of duty for courts to say: We see what you are driving at, but you have not said it, and therefore we shall go on as before.'

He made certain admissions to a District Director of Naturalization as a result of which \n\n[307 \nU.S. 22, 24]\n\u00a0\n naturalization was withheld and his case was referred to the Department of Labor.\n November 25, 1933, the Second Assistant Secretary of Labor issued a warrant for the respondent's apprehension, in which it was recited that he was in the United States in violation of law in that (1) he believes in, advises, advocates or teaches the overthrow, by force or violence, of the Government of the United States; (2) he is a member of, or affiliated with, an organization, association, society, or group that believes in, advises, advocates or teaches the overthrow, by force or violence, of the Government of the United States; (3) he is a member of, or affiliated with, an organization, association, society, or group that writes, circulates, distributes, prints, publishes or displays, or causes to be written, circulated, distributed, printed, published or displayed, or that has in its possession for these purposes written or printed matter advising, advocating or teaching the overthrow, by force or violence, of the Government of the United States; and (4) after his entry into the United States he has been found to have become a member of one of the classes of aliens enumerated in Section 1 of the Act of October 16, 1918, as amended by the Act of June 5, 1920, to wit: an alien who is a member of, or affiliated with, an organization, association, society or group that believes in, advises or teaches the overthrow, by force and violence, of the Government of the United States.\n The respondent was apprehended and was given hearings before an Immigration Inspector, at which he was represented by counsel and testified in his own behalf. The Government offered in evidence transcripts of his examination by the Naturalization Bureau, of an interview with him by an Immigration Inspector, and his membership book in the Communist Party of the U.S.A., issued November 15, 1932, with stamps affixed showing payment of dues to the end of February, 1933. The rules \n\n[307 \nU.S. 22, 25]\n\u00a0\n of the party, set forth in the book, provided that a failure to pay dues for three months automatically results in the loss of membership, and it is admitted there is no evidence respondent continued to be a member after March 1, 1933\n\n\n The book contained printed matter stating the purposes and objects of the party. The Government also offered a copy of a magazine called 'The Communist', dated April 1934, and read into the record excerpts from articles appearing therein. The respondent admitted that he joined the Communist Party in November 1932, asserted that his membership terminated prior to March 1, 1933, and had never been renewed, and professed ignorance of the magazine called 'The Communist' and its contents. In some respects his testimony as to his beliefs and actions was contradictory of his statements on prior examinations, and testimony was elicited from him in an effort to show that his denial of present affiliation with the Communist Party might not be made in good faith; but there was no sufficient evidence to sustain that conclusion. After a review of the record by the Board of Review of the Department of Labor, a warrant of deportation was issued by the Assistant Secretary which recites an affirmative finding as to each of the counts in the warrant of arrest and orders the respondent's deportation. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The respondent petitioned a federal district court in Arkansas for a writ of habeas corpus to deliver him from the custody of the Immigration Inspector. The writ was denied. Thereafter he filed the petition in the instant case in the District Court for Louisiana. In this peti- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 22, 26]\n\u00a0\n tion he alleged that he had not been accorded a fair hearing; that the Department of Labor had not correctly construed the immigration laws applicable to his case; that the findings were without support in the evidence; that he had been denied due process of law, and that he is not a citizen of Poland, to which the warrant directed his remission. The District Court dismissed the writ. The respondent appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals assigning error to the District Court's action in denying each of his contentions. That court found that the hearings had been fair, but held that each of the findings recited in the warrant was without support in the evidence. The court was of opinion the evidence failed to show that the respondent is now a member of the Communist Party or that he or that party, in 1933, taught, advocated, or incited the overthrow of the Government by force and violence, and that the record was bare of evidence to countervail his denial that he had ever taught or believed in the unlawful destruction or overthrow of the Government by force. The court held that the Acts of 1918 and 1920 were passed to meet a situation caused by crises in Russia in 1918 and 1919;2 that the major changes in policy and conduct of the Soviet Socialist Republics which had taken place between 1918 and 1933 rebutted the implications arising from membership in the Communist Party at the time the Acts were adopted; that mere membership in that party in 1933 is not a statutory ground for deportation. The order of the District Court was reversed and the cause was remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with the opinion. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n The Government moved for a rehearing, pressing specially the contention that the overwhelming weight of \n\n[307 \nU.S. 22, 27]\n\u00a0\n authority is to the effect that membership in the Communist Party is sufficient to warrant deportation. The petition was entertained, the judgment was amended to provide: 'Reversed, with directions to try the issues de novo as suggested in Ex parte Fierstein (C.C.A.) 9 Cir., 41 F.2d 53, at page 54'; and a rehearing was denied. \n4\n Judge Sibley dissented on the ground that on the basis of the respondent's membership book which refers to the Third Communist Internationale, the court could take judicial notice of the objectives and programs of the Communist Party and the Third Internationale.\n The United States petitioned for certiorari, asserting that the single question presented is 'whether the court below erred in failing to sustain an order of deportation against respondent, an alien who in 1932 became a member of the Communist Party of the United States.' In its specification of errors to be urged the Government enumerated (1) the holding that an alien who became a member of the party in 1932 is not, by reason of that fact, subject to deportation; (2) the holding that the evidence before the Secretary of Labor concerning the principles of the party was insufficient to sustain the order; (3) the remand for a trial de novo in the District Court, and (4) the failure to affirm the judgment of the District Court. As reason for the granting of the writ the Government urged a conflict of decision on the question whether membership by an alien in the Communist Party of America subjects him to deportation. By reason of the allegation of conflict and the action of the Circuit Court of Appeals in ordering a trial de novo in the District Court, we granted the writ. \n305 \nU.S. 587\n, 59 S.Ct. 102, 83 L.Ed. --.\n The Government does not attempt to support the warrant of deportation on the second and third grounds therein specified, namely, that the respondent 'is a mem- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 22, 28]\n\u00a0\n ber of or affiliated with' an organization described in the Act. The only evidence of record is that his membership ceased months before the issue of the warrant for his arrest. The contention is that respondent is deportable because, after entry, he became a member of a class of aliens described in Section 1 of the Act, to wit, a member of the Communist Party, an organization membership in which is made a cause of deportation because the organization believes in, advocates, and teaches the overthrow of the Government of the United States by force and violence. This contention presents the question whether the Act renders former membership in such an organization, which has ceased, a ground of deportation. Respondent insists that the statute makes only present membership in an organization described in the Act such ground.\n Section 1 of the Act of October 16, 1918, as amended in 1920,5 has to do with the exclusion of alien immigrants and specifies five classes, members of which may not be admitted to the United States. One of these classes-subsection (c)-includes 'aliens who believe in, advise, advocate, or teach, or who are members of or affiliated with any organization, association, society, or group, that believes in, advises, advocates, or teaches ... the overthrow by force or violence of the Government of the United States ....'\n Section 2 of the Act of 1918,6 which was not altered by the Act of 1920, deals with deportation. It provides that 'any alien who, at any time after entering the United States, is found to have been at the time of entry, or to have become thereafter, a member of any one of the classes of aliens enumerated' in Section 1, shall, upon war- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 22, 29]\n\u00a0\n rant of the Secretary of Labor, be taken into custody and deported, in the manner provided by law.\n Relying on the phrases italicized in the quotation, the Government insists that the section embraces an alien who, after entry, has become a member of an organization, membership in which, at the time of his entry, would have warranted his exclusion, although he has ceased to be a member at the time of his arrest. We hold that the Act does not provide for the deportation of such an alien. This conclusion rests not alone upon the language, but, as well, upon the context and the history of the legislation.\n The phrase 'at any time' qualifies the verb 'found'. Thus, if at any time the Secretary finds that at entry the alien was a member, or has thereafter become and is a member, he may be deported. The natural meaning is that, as the alien was excludable for present membership, he is deportable for present membership subsequently acquired. The Government's construction, which collocates the phrase 'at any time' with the phrase 'or to have become thereafter' is unnatural and strained. If Congress meant that past membership, of no matter how short duration or how far in the past, was to be a cause of present deportation the purpose could have been clearly stated. The section does not bear this import.\n By the first section of the Act, as amended in 1920, aliens are to be excluded who are members of a described organization. The section does not require the exclusion of those who have been in the past, but are no longer, members. When the Congress came to provide for deportation, instead of again enumerating and defining the various classes of aliens who might be deported, it provided that if at any time it should be found that an alien had been admitted and, at the time of admission, was a member of any of the proscribed classes, or had thereafter become such, he should be deported. It is not to be \n\n[307 \nU.S. 22, 30]\n\u00a0\n supposed that past membership, which does not bar admission, was intended to be a cause of deportation. And the fact that naturalization is denied to an alien only on the ground that he 'is a member of or affiliated with any organization entertaining' disbelief in or opposition to organized government, and not for past membership or affiliation,7 lends added force to this view.\n In the absence of a clear and definite expression, we are not at liberty to conclude that Congress intended that any alien, no matter how long a resident of this country, or however well disposed toward our Government, must be deported, if at any time in the past, no matter when, or under what circumstances, or for what time, he was a member of the described organization. In the absence of such expression we conclude that it is the present membership, or present affiliation-a fact to be determined on evidence-which bars admission, bars naturalization, and requires deportation. Since the statute deals not only with membership in an organization of the described class, but with affiliation therewith and, as well, with belief and teaching, it enables the Secretary of Labor, as trier of the facts, fully to investigate and to find the true relation, belief and activity of the alien under investigation.\n The legislative history of the statute supports this conclusion. By Act of March 3, 1903,8 Congress directed the exclusion of 'anarchists, or persons who believe in or advocate the overthrow by force or violence of the Government of the United States,9 ...' and also of any 'person who disbelieves in or who is opposed to all organized government, or who is a member of or affiliated with any organization entertaining and teaching such disbe- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 22, 31]\n\u00a0\n lief in or opposition to all organized government ....'10 The only section authorizing deportation of such persons is directed to an alien found to have entered in violation of the Act, if proceeded against within three years after entry. 11 These provisions were reenacted without alteration in the Act of February 20, 1907.12\n The first legislation authorizing deportation of persons who had entered lawfully is H.R. 6060, enacted by the 63rd Congress but vetoed by President Wilson January 28, 1915.13 This bill required deportation of 'any alien who within five years after entry shall be found advocating or teaching' the defined doctrines. It also altered existing law in respect of deportation of those who had entered illegally to provide that 'at any time within five years after entry, any alien who at the time of entry was a member of one or more of the classes excluded by law' should be deported.\n A bill, in substance the same, was introduced in the 64th Congress and enacted February 5, 1917, over Presidential veto.14 While this measure was in course of passage, the Chairman of the House Committee in charge of it moved, on behalf of the Committee, to amend section 19 by inserting the phrase 'at any time' so that the section should provide for deportation of 'any alien who at any time after entry shall be found advocating or teaching' forcible overthrow of the government. The Act, as adopted, was in this form. The purpose of the amendment was to make plain that no time limit was fixed for deportation of aliens found advocating the doctrine. \n15\n\u00a0\n\n[307 \nU.S. 22, 32]\n\u00a0\n The Act of 1917 was amended by that of October 16, 1918, here under consideration, which, by its title, purported to apply to 'aliens who are members of the anarchistic and similar classes. ...'\n Section 1 enlarged one of the classes of excludable aliens by the addition of the words 'aliens who are members of or affiliated with any organization that entertains a belief in, teaches, or advocates the overthrow by force or violence of the Government of the United States .... ' Section 2 modified the earlier Act in respect of deportation, both in form and substance. The provision for deportation of those who, at the time of entry, were members of one of the proscribed classes was retained, but the five year period of limitation within which deportation might be had was eliminated. \n16\n The provision for deportation of aliens of anarchistic and similar classes was expanded by including as causes of deportation all the causes of exclusion enumerated in Section 1 which were themselves much broader than those included the 1917 Act. Thus, although there was no provision in the Act of 1917 for deportation of aliens who did not personally advocate the proscribed doctrine, but were members of an organization which did, the Act of 1918 embodied such a provision. This alteration, and the elimination of the five year time limitation, were the important changes, relevant to the question under examination, which the Act of 1918 effected in the earlier legislation. These modifications lend no support to the contention that Section 2 of the Act of 1918 was intended to make quondam membership a ground of deportation.\n Nor is there anything in the formal alteration worked by the Act of 1918 which leads to a different conclusion. Section 19 of the Act of 1917, 8 U.S.C.A.  155, dealt in distinct clauses with the various classes of aliens who might be deported, speci- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 22, 33]\n\u00a0\n fying in one clause an alien 'who at the time of entry was a member (of one or more) of the classes excluded by law' and, in another clause, an alien 'who at any time after entry shall be found advocating or teaching' the obnoxious doctrines. Section 2 of the Act of 1918 combined the clauses dealing with the two groups in a single sentence, with a somewhat different locution. We think this consolidation was not intended to alter the substantive law as it theretofore stood.\n The only decisions which support the Government's position are those in the Second Circuit. \n17\n We cannot approve their reasoning or result. It is claimed that the administrative construction has always accorded with the Government's contention in the present case. We cannot find that there has been such a uniform construction as requires an interpretation of the Act in accordance with that view. The administrative construction seems to have been in favor of the respondent's view until after the decision in the Yokinen case, 18 and the construction seems to have been changed in deference to the decision in that case. \n19\n\u00a0\n\n Our reading of the statute makes it unnecessary to pass upon the conflicting contentions of the parties concerning the adequacy of the evidence before the Secretary concerning the purposes and aims of the Communist Party or the propriety of the court's taking judicial notice thereof. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 22, 34]\n\u00a0\n The Solicitor General suggests that the evidence is sufficient to sustain the warrant of deportation on the first ground therein stated, namely, that the respondent believes in and teaches the overthrow, by force and violence, of the Government of the United States. It is said that the error of the Circuit Court of Appeals in reversing the District Court is, in this aspect, so plain that we should notice it, although the petition does not present the question. We have the power to do this in the case of plain error,20 but we exercise it only in clear cases and in exceptional circumstances.\n We do not know on what grounds the District Judge's action rested since he wrote no opinion. The Circuit Court of Appeals held the evidence insufficient to support the Secretary's finding. We think that the record does not justify a reversal of the holding of the court below upon this point.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals remanded the cause to the District Court for a trial de novo. In this we think there was error. The proceeding for deportation is administrative. \n21\n If the hearing was fair, if there was evidence to support the finding of the Secretary, and if no error of law was committed, the ruling of the Department must stand and cannot be corrected in judicial proceedings. \n22\n If, on the other hand, one of the elements mentioned is lacking, the proceeding is void and must be set aside. \n23\n A district court cannot upon habeas corpus, proceed de novo, for the function of investigation and finding has not been conferred upon it but upon the Secretary of Labor. Only in the event an alleged alien asserts his United States \n\n[307 \nU.S. 22, 35]\n\u00a0\n citizenship in the hearing before the Department, and supports his claim by substantial evidence, is he entitled to a trial de novo of that issue in the district court. \n24\n The status of the relator must be judicially determined, because jurisdiction in the executive to order deportation exists only if the person arrested is an alien; and no statutory proceeding is provided in which he can raise the question whether the executive action is in excess of the jurisdiction conferred upon the Secretary. \n25\n\u00a0\n\n It follows from what has been said that, as the Secretary erred in the construction of the statute, the writ must be granted and the respondent discharged from custody.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is accordingly modified and the cause is remanded to the District Court with instructions to proceed in conformity with this opinion. So ordered.\n Modified.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS (dissenting).\n Mr. Justice BUTLER and I cannot acquiesce in the disposition of this cause or in the supporting opinion just announced. It seems worthwhile briefly to indicate our views.\n More than five years have passed since the alien respondent was arrested and ordered to show why he should not be deported. The record of the following proceedings before the Labor Department and in the courts, printed on eighty-four pages, is before us. It is not very difficult to understand. Without question we have power finally to dispose of the cause upon the merits notwithstanding \n\n[307 \nU.S. 22, 36]\n\u00a0\n any omissions or defects found in the petition for certiorari. In the circumstances, we think that course should be taken. The District Court upon another view of the record can ascertain nothing not open to us.\n If this alien is guiltless of the charge against him he should be liberated without more ado; if guilty, the public should be relieved of his presence now. That he is an undesirable is made manifest.\n The construction of the statute adopted by the Court seems both unwarranted and unfortunate. If by the simple process of resigning or getting expelled from a proscribed organization an alien may thereby instantly purge himself after months or years of mischievous activities, hoped-for protection against such conduct will disappear. Escape from the consequences of deliberate violations of our hospitality should not become quite so facile. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Seven years ago, the Circuit Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, construed the statute under consideration in United States ex rel. Yokinen v. Commissioner of Immigration, 57 F.2d 707, 708. There the alien had been expelled from the Communist Party before his arrest, and for that reason he unsuccessfully claimed exemption. The following excerpts from the court's opinion, with force and directness, express our view concerning the true meaning of the enactment-\n'It is true that he was not a member of the Communist Party when arrested. He had recently been expelled because of his attitude toward negroes, but that did not remove him from the reach of the statute. We have nothing to do with shaping the policy of the law \n\n[307 \nU.S. 22, 37]\n\u00a0\n toward aliens who come here and join a proscribed society. Congress has provided that 'any alien who, at any time after entering the United States, is found to have been at the time of entry, or to have become thereafter, a member of any one of the classes of aliens enumerated in this section' shall be deported. 8 U.S.C.A.  137(g). This alien concededly did become after entry a member of 'one of the classes ... enumerated' and from that time became deportable. We are urged to ameliorate the supposed harshness of the statute by reading into it words that Congress saw fit to leave out and interpret it to apply not to aliens who became members, but only to those who become and continue to the time of their arrest to be members, of one of the enumerated classes. If the words used in the statute were equivocal or the intention of Congress for any reason uncertain, there might be room for such a construction as that for which the appellant now contends. Perhaps the sufficient answer is that had Congress intended membership at the time of arrest to be the criterion it would have said so. It has the power to determine what acts of an alien shall terminate his right to remain here. Skeffington v. Katzeff et al. (C. C.A.) 277 F. 129. What it did do was to make the act of becoming a member a deportable offense without regard to continuance of membership and it did that in language so plain that any attempt to read in any other meaning is no less than an attempt to circumvent the law itself.\n\n'Since the appellant admittedly had, after entry, become a member of a proscribed organization, the undisputed evidence required the order from which this appeal was taken. All proof upon which he was held to be affiliated with the Communist Party was unnecessary, and while we do not mean to intimate that any evidence on that phase of the case was unfairly received and considered, in any event it did him no harm.' \n\n[307 \nU.S. 22, 38]\n\u00a0\n A petition for certiorari asking this Court to review the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals was refused October 10, 1932, \n287 \nU.S. 607\n, 53 S.Ct. 11. It stressed the point that-'A fair and proper construction of the statute requires that it be confined in its operation to aliens who are members of or affiliated with a proscribed organization at the issuance of the warrant of arrest.'\n\n The unusual importance of the question was not difficult to appreciate.\n In the presence of clear and positive expression of Congressional intent to the contrary we do not feel at liberty to conclude that an alien who after entry has shown his contempt for our laws by deliberately associating himself with a proscribed organization must be allowed to remain if he resigned or was debarred a day, a month or a year before his arrest. An experienced court years ago declared that would be 'no less than an attempt to circumvent the law itself.' \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The delay in this case is due to the fact that respondent was born an Austrian subject but was refused reentry into that country on the ground that the place of his birth is now in Poland. Protracted negotiations on the part of the Department were required to obtain the consent of the government of Poland to his return to that country. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] That this view is erroneous is shown by the history of the legislation referred to infra, 305 U.S. page 30, 59 S.Ct. page 698, 83 L.

A writ of attachment was issued and levied upon certain whiskey which appellants claimed was subject to their lien under a chattel mortgage executed by the company.

The court stated that it was its opinion that Section 12 of the Alcohol Control Act of 1934, c. 149, 'furnishes petitioners an adequate remedy ... to contest the validity of said Act and to recover any taxes collected from them by the State of Kentucky' thereunder. The case comes here on appeal. Jud.Code,  266, 28 U.S.C.  380, 28 U.S.C.A.  380.\n Appellants contest the ruling of the District Court, asserting that under Section 12 of the Act of 1934-the text of which is set forth in the margin 1-the remedy is given \n\n[306 \nU.S. 531, 533]\n\u00a0\n only to the taxpayer and it not available to appellants, the taxpayer's mortgagees. The Commonwealth urges the contrary, but points to no decision of the state court which is decisive of that point.\n Apart from that question, the Commonwealth insists that appellants had a plain and adequate remedy by appearing in the attachment suit in the Franklin Circuit Court where all issues as to the validity of the tax and the propriety of the proceedings for enforcement could be litigated and determined, with the ultimate right of review in this court of any federal question raised and decided. The Commonwealth points to the provision of the Civil Code of Practice of Kentucky, Section 29,2 under which any person claiming an interest in property which has been attached may file his petition stating his claim \n\n[306 \nU.S. 531, 534]\n\u00a0\n and controverting that of the plaintiff in the attachment whereupon he may be made a defendant, his petition being treated as an answer. See, also, Carroll's Kentucky Statutes, Baldwin's 1936 Revision, Section 950-1.\n Appellants assert that the Franklin Circuit Court was without jurisdiction of the attachment suit, but that question, appropriately one for the decision of the state court, could manifestly be presented and determined in that action.\n Appellants also state that in the present suit they asked the federal court to exercise its equity powers in their aid in the foreclosure of their mortgage, but it is apparent that this relief is merely incidental and that the main object of the suit is to restrain the proceedings in the Franklin Circuit Court which had been brought to enforce the collection of the tax.\n This endeavor, aside from the application of the general principle governing the equity jurisdiction, encounters two positive statutory prohibitions; (1) that of Section 265 of the Judicial Code (28 U.S.C.  379, 28 U.S.C.A.  379) providing that an injunction shall not be granted to stay proceedings in a state court (Essanay Film Company v. Kane, \n258 \nU.S. 358, 361\n, 42 S.Ct. 318, 319; Monamotor Oil Company v. Johnson, \n292 \nU.S. 86, 97\n, 54 S.Ct. 575, 579; Hill v. Martin, \n296 \nU.S. 393, 403\n, 56 S.Ct. 278, 282); and (2) the provision of the Act of August 21, 1937 (50 Stat. 738), 28 U.S.C.A.  41(1), amending the first paragraph of Section 24 of the Judicial Code to the effect that 'no district court shall have jurisdiction of any suit to enjoin, suspend, or restrain the assessment, levy, or collection of any tax imposed by or pursuant to the laws of any State where a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy may be had at law or in equity in the courts of such State'.\n The judgment is affirmed.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 12 of the Act of 1934 (Carroll's Kentucky Statutes, Baldwin's 1936 Revision, Section 4214a-23) is as follows:\n'No suit shall be maintained in any court to restrain or delay the collection or payment of the tax levied by this Act. The aggrieved taxpayer shall pay with or without protest the tax as and when required and may at any time within two years from the date of such payment sue the Commonwealth through its agent, the Auditor of Public Accounts, in an action at law in any court, state or federal, otherwise having jurisdiction of the parties and subject matter, for the recovery of the tax paid with legal interest thereon from the date of payment. If it is finally determined that said tax or any part thereof was wrongfully collected, for any reason, it shall be the duty of the Auditor of Public Accounts to issue his warrant on the Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Kentucky for the amount of such tax so adjudged to have been wrongfully collected together with legal interest thereon. The Treasurer shall pay the same at once out of the general expenditure fund of the State in preference to other warrants or claims against the Commonwealth. A separate suit need not be filed for each individual payment made by any taxpayer, but a recovery may be had in one suit for as many payments as may have been made'. \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The text of Section 29 of the Civil Code of Practice is as follows:\n'In an action or proceeding for the recovery of real or personal property, or for the subjection thereof to a demand of the plaintiff under an attachment or her lien, any person claiming a right to, or interest in, the property or its proceeds, may, before payment of the proceeds to the plaintiff, file, in the action, his verified petition, stating his claim and controverting that of the plaintiff; whereupon the court may order him to be made a defendant; and upon that being done, his petition shall be treated as his answer. But if he be a non-resident he must give security for costs'. \n\n\n\n\n\n","74":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLANE v. WILSON(1939)\nNo. 460\nArgued: March 3, 1939Decided: May 22, 1939\n\n\n\n\n[307 \nU.S. 268, 269]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles A. Chandler, of Muskogee, Okl., and James M. Nabrit, Jr., of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Joseph C. Stone, of Muskogee, Okl., and Charles G. Watts, of Wagoner, Okl., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The case is here on certiorari to review the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirming that of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma, entered upon a directed verdict in favor of the defendants. The action was one for $5,000 damages brought under Section 1979 of the Revised Statutes, 8 U.S.C.  43, 8 U.S.C.A.  43, by a colored citizen claiming discriminatory treatment resulting from electoral legislation of Oklahoma, in violation of the Fifteenth Amendment, U S.C.A. Const. Certiorari was granted, \n305 \nU.S. 591\n, 59 S.Ct. 249, 83 L.Ed. --, because of the importance of the question and an asserted conflict with the decision in Guinn v. United States, \n238 \nU.S. 347\n, 35 S.Ct. 926, L.R.A.1916A, 1124\n\n\n The constitution under which Oklahoma was admitted into the Union regulated the suffrage by Article III, Okl.St.Ann., whereby its 'qualified electors' were to be 'citizens of the State ... who are over the age of twenty-one years' with disqualifications in the case of felons, paupers and lunatics. Section 1. Soon after its admission the suffrage provisions of the Oklahoma Constitution were radically amended by the addition of a literacy test from which white voters were in effect relieved through the operation of a 'grandfather clause.' Okl.St.Ann.Const. art. 3,  4a. The clause was stricken down by this Court as violative of the prohibition against discrimination 'on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude' of the Fifteenth Amendment. This outlawry occurred on June 21, 1915. In the meantime the Oklahoma general election of 1914 had been based on the \n\n[307 \nU.S. 268, 270]\n\u00a0\n offending 'grandfather clause.' After the invalidation of that clause a special session of the Oklahoma legislature enacted a new scheme for registration as a prerequisite to voting. Oklahoma Laws of 1916, Act of February 26, 1916, c. 24. Section 4 of this statute (now Section 5654, Oklahoma Statutes 1931, 26 Okl.St.Ann.  74) 1 was obviously \n\n[307 \nU.S. 268, 271]\n\u00a0\n directed towards the consequences of the decision in Guinn v. United States, supra. Those who had voted in the general election of 1914, automatically remained qualified voters. The new registration requirements affected only others. These had to apply for registration between April 30, 1916 and May 11, 1916, if qualified at that time, with an extension to June 30, 1916, given only to those 'absent from the county ... during such period of time, or ... prevented by sickness or unavoidable misfortune from registering ... within such time'. The crux of the present controversy is the validity of this registration scheme, with its dividing line between white citizens who had voted under the 'grandfather clause' immunity prior to Guinn v. United States, supra, and citizens who were outside it, and the not more than 12 days as the normal period of registration for the theretofore proscribed class.\n The petitioner, a colored citizen of Oklahoma, who was the plaintiff below and will hereafter be referred to as such, sued three county election officials for declining to register him on October 17, 1934. He was qualified for registration in 1916 but did not then get on the registration list. The evidence is in conflict whether he presented himself in that year for registration and, if so, under what circumstances registration was denied him. The fact is that plaintiff did not get on the register in 1916. Under the terms of the statute he thereby permanently lost the right to register and hence the right to vote. The central claim of plaintiff is that of the unconstitutionality of Section 5654. The defendants joined issue on this claim and further insisted that if there had been illegality \n\n[307 \nU.S. 268, 272]\n\u00a0\n in a denial of the plaintiff's right to registration, his proper recourse was to the courts of Oklahoma. The District Court took the case from the jury and its action was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. It found no proof of discrimination against negroes in the administration of Section 5654 and denied that the legislation was in conflict with the Fifteenth Amendment. 10 Cir., 98 F.2d 980.\n The defendants urge two bars to the plaintiff's recovery, apart from the constitutional validity of Section 5654. They say that on the plaintiff's own assumption of its invalidity, there is no Oklahoma statute under which he could register and therefore no right to registration has been denied. Secondly, they argue that the state procedure for determining claims of discrimination must be employed before invoking a federal judiciary. These contentions will be considered first, for the disposition of a constitutional question must be reserved to the last.\n The first objection derives from a misapplication of Giles v. Harris, \n189 \nU.S. 475\n, 23 S.Ct. 639, 640. In that case a bill in equity was brought by a colored man on behalf of himself 'and on behalf of more than five thousand negroes, citizens of the county of Montgomery, Alabama, similarly situated' which in effect asked the federal court 'to supervise the voting in that State by officers of the court.' What this Court called a 'new and extraordinary situation' was found 'strikingly' to reinforce 'the argument that equity cannot undertake now, any more than it has in the past, to enforce political rights'. See 189 U.S. at page 487, 23 S.Ct. at page 642.2 Apart from this traditional restriction upon the exercise of equitable jurisdiction there was another difficulty in Giles v. Harris, supra. The plaintiff there was in effect asking for specific performance of his right under \n\n[307 \nU.S. 268, 273]\n\u00a0\n Alabama electoral legislation. This presupposed the validity of the legislation under which he was claiming. But the whole theory of his bill was the invalidity of this legislation. Naturally enough, this Court took his claim at its face value and found no legislation on the basis of which specific performance could be decreed. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n This case is very different from Giles v. Harris, supra-the difference having been explicitly foreshadowed by Giles v. Harris, supra itself. In that case this Court declared 'we are not prepared to say that an action at law could not be maintained on the facts alleged in the bill.' 189 U.S. at page 485, 23 S.Ct. at page 641. That is precisely the basis of the present action, brought under the following 'appropriate legislation' of Congress to enforce the Fifteenth Amendment: 'Every person who, under color of any statute, ... of any State ... subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States ... within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law ....'4 \n\n[307 \nU.S. 268, 274]\n\u00a0\n The Fifteenth Amendment secures freedom from discrimination on account of race in matters affecting the franchise. Whosoever 'under color of any statute' subjects another to such discrimination thereby deprives him of what the Fifteenth Amendment secures and, under Section 1979 becomes 'liable to the party injured in an action at law.' The theory of the plaintiff's action is that the defendants, acting under color of Section 5654, did discriminate against him because that Section inherently operates discriminatorily. If this claim is sustained his right to sue under R.S. Section 1979 follows. The basis of this action is inequality of treatment though under color of law, not denial of the right to vote. Compare Nixon v. Herndon, \n273 \nU.S. 536\n, 47 S.Ct. 446.\n The other preliminary objection to the maintenance of this action is likewise untenable. To vindicate his present grievance the plaintiff did not have to pursue whatever remedy may have been open to him in the state courts. Normally, the state legislative process, sometimes exercised through administrative powers conferred on state courts, must be completed before resort to the federal courts can be had. Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line Co., \n211 \nU.S. 210\n, 29 S.Ct. 67. But the state procedure open for one in the plaintiff's situation (Section 5654) has all the indicia of a conventional judicial proceeding and does not confer upon the Oklahoma courts any of the discretionary or initiatory functions that are characteristic of administrative agencies. See Section 1 of Article IV of the Oklahoma Constitution, Okl.St.Ann.; Oklahoma Cotton Ginners' Ass'n v. State, 174 Okl. 243, 51 P.2d 327. Barring only exceptional circumstances, see e.g. Gilchrist v. Interborough Rapid Transit Co., \n279 \nU.S. 159\n, 49 S. Ct. 282, or explicit statutory requirements, e.g. 48 Stat. 775, 50 Stat. 738, 28 U.S.C.  41(1), 28 U.S.C.A.  41(1), resort to a federal court may be had without first exhausting the judicial remedies of state courts. Bacon v. Rut- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 268, 275]\n\u00a0\n land R.R., \n232 \nU.S. 134\n, 34 S.Ct. 283; Pacific Tel. & Tel. Co. v. Kuykendall, \n265 \nU.S. 196\n, 44 S.Ct. 553.\n We therefore cannot avoid passing on the merits of plaintiff's constitutional claims. The reach of the Fifteenth Amendment against contrivances by a state to thwart equality in the enjoyment of the right to vote by citizens of the United States regardless of race or color, has been amply expounded by prior decisions. Guinn v. United States, \n238 \nU.S. 347\n, 35 S.Ct. 926, L.R.A.1916A, 1124; Myers v. Anderson, \n238 \nU.S. 368\n, 35 S.Ct. 932. The Amendment nullifies sophisticated as well as simple-minded modes of discrimination. It hits onerous procedural requirements which effectively handicap exercise of the franchise by the colored race although the abstract right to vote may remain unrestricted as to race. When in Guinn v. United States, supra, the Oklahoma 'grandfather clause' was found violative of the Fifteenth Amendment, Oklahoma was confronted with the serious task of devising a new registration system consonant with her own political ideas but also consistent with the Federal Constitution. We are compelled to conclude, however reluctantly, that the legislation of 1916 partakes too much of the infirmity of the 'grandfather clause' to be able to survive.\n Section 5652 of the Oklahoma statutes makes registration a prerequisite to voting. \n5\n By Sections 5654 and 56596 all \n\n[307 \nU.S. 268, 276]\n\u00a0\n citizens who were qualified to vote in 1916 but had not voted in 1914 were required to register, save in the exceptional circumstances, between April 30 and May 11, 1916, and in default of such registration were perpetually disenfranchised. Exemption from this onerous provision was enjoyed by all who had registered in 1914. But this registration was held under the statute which was condemned in the Guinn case. Unfair discrimination was thus retained by automatically granting voting privileges for life to the white citizens whom the constitutional 'grandfather clause' had sheltered while subjecting colored citizens to a new burden. The practical effect of the 1916 legislation was to accord to the members of the negro race who had been discriminated against in the outlawed registration system of 1914, not more than 12 days within which to reassert constitutional rights which this Court found in the Guinn case to have been improperly taken from them. We believe that the opportunity thus given negro voters to free themselves from the effects of discrimination to which they should never have been subjected was too cabined and confined. The restrictions imposed must be judged with reference to those for whom they were designed. It must be remembered that we are dealing with a body of citizens lacking the habits and traditions of political independence and otherwise living in circumstances which do not encourage initiative and enterprise. To be sure, in exceptional cases a supple- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 268, 277]\n\u00a0\n mental period was available. But the narrow basis of the supplemental registration, the very brief normal period of relief for the persons and purposes in question, the practical difficulties, of which the record in this case gives glimpses, inevitable in the administration of such strict registration provisions, leave no escape from the conclusion that the means chosen as substitutes for the invalidated 'grandfather clause' were themselves invalid under the Fifteenth Amendment. They operated unfairly against the very class on whose behalf the protection of the Constitution was here successfully invoked.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals must, therefore, be reversed and the cause remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\n Reversed and remanded.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice BUTLER think that the court below reached the right conclusion and that its judgment should be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS took no part in the consideration or disposition of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'It shall be the duty of the precinct registrar to register each qualified elector of his election precinct who makes application between the thirtieth day of April, 1916, and the eleventh day of May, 1916, and such person applying shall at the time he applies to register be a qualified elector in such precinct and he shall comply with the provisions of this act, and it shall be the duty of every qualified elector to register within such time; provided, if any elector should be absent from the county of his residence during such period of time, or is prevented by sickness or unavoidable misfortune from registering with the precinct registrar within such time, he may register with such precinct registrar at any time after the tenth day of May, 1916, up to and including the thirtieth day of June, 1916, but the precinct registrar shall register no person under this provision unless he be satisfied that such person was absent from the county or was prevented from registering by sickness or unavoidable misfortune, as hereinbefore provided. And provided that it shall be the mandatory duty of every precinct registrar to issue registration certificates to every qualified elector who voted at the general election held in this state on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November, 1914, without the application of said elector for registration, and, to deliver such certificate to such elector if he is still a qualified elector in such precinct and the failure to so register such elector who voted in such election held in November, 1914, shall not preclude or prevent such elector from voting in any election in this state; and provided further, that wherever any elector is refused registration by any registration officer such action may be reviewed by the district court of the county by the aggrieved elector by his filing within ten days a petition with the Clerk of said court, whereupon summons shall be issued to said registrar requiring him to answer within ten days, and the district court shall be a expeditious hearing and from his judgment an appeal will lie at the instance of either party to the Supreme Court of the State as in civil cases; and provided further, that the provisions of this act shall not apply to any school district elections. Provided further, that each county election board in this state shall furnish to each precinct election board in the respective counties a list of the voters who voted at the election in November, 1914, and such list shall be conclusive evidence of the right of such person to vote.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See also, In re Sawyer, \n124 \nU.S. 200\n, 8 S.Ct. 482; Walton v.

We express no opinion as to the alleged fact of their unconstitutionality beyond saying that we are not willing to assume that they are valid, in the face of the allegations and main object of the bill, for the purpose of granting the relief which it was necessary to pray in order that that object should be secured.' 189 U.S. at page 487, 23 S.Ct. at page 642. Recognition of the difference between an action for damages and the equitable relief prayed for in Giles v. Harris, supra, was repeated at the close of the opinion. See 189 U.S. at page 488, 23 S.Ct. at page 642. Justices Harlan, Brewer, and Brown were of the opinion that it was competent for a federal court to grant even the equitable relief asked for in Giles v. Harris, supra. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] The Act of April 20, 1871, c. 22, 17 Stat. 13, which became Section 1979 of the Revised Statutes, and is now 8 U.S.C.  43, 8 U.S.C.A.  43. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] 'It shall be the duty of every qualified elector in this state to register as an elector under the provisions of this Act, and no elector shall be permitted to vote at any election unless he shall register as herein provided, and no elector shall be permitted to vote in any primary election of any political party except of the political party of which his registration certificate shows him to be a member.'

STATE OF NEW JERSEY(1939)\nNo. 308\nArgued: January 9, 1939Decided: March 27, 1939\n\n\n\n Messrs. Samuel Kagle and Harry A. Mackey, both of Philadelphia, Pa., for appellants.\n Messrs. Robert Peacock, of Mount Holly, N.J., and French B. Loveland, of Ocean City, N.J., for appellee. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 451, 452]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By this appeal we are called on to decide whether, by reason of vagueness and uncertainty, a recent enactment of New Jersey,  4, R.S.N.J. 1937, 2:136-4, c. 155, Laws 1934, is repugnant to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S.C.A.Const. It is as follows: 'Any person not engaged in any lawful occupation, known to be a member of any gang consisting of two or more persons, who has been convicted at least three times of being a disorderly person, or who has been convicted of any crime, in this or in any other State, is declared to be a gangster ...'.1 Every violation is punishable by fine not exceeding $10,000 or imprisonment not exceeding 20 years, or both.  5, R.S.N.J.1937, 2:136-5.\n In the court of quarter sessions of Cape May County, appellants were accused of violating the quoted clause. The indictment charges that on four days, June 12, 16, 19, and 24, 1936 'they, and each of them, not being engaged in any lawful occupation; they, and all of them, known to be members of a gang, consisting of two or more persons, and they, and each of them, having been convicted of a crime in the State of Pennsylvania, are hereby declared to be gangsters.' There was a trial, verdict of guilty, and judgment of conviction on which each was sentenced to be imprisoned in the state prison for not more than ten years and not less than five years, at hard labor. On the authority of its recent decision in State v. Bell, 188 A. 737, 15 N.J.Misc. 109, the Supreme Court entered judgment affirming the conviction. State v. Pius, 118 N.J.L. 212, 192 A. 89. The Court of Errors and Appeals affirmed, 120 N.J.L. 189, 198 A. 837, on the authority of its deci- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 451, 453]\n\u00a0\n sion, State v. Gaynor, 119 N.J.L. 582, 197 A. 360, affirming State v. Bell.\n If on its face the challenged provision is repugnant to the due process clause, specification of details of the offense intended to be charged would not serve to validate it. Cf. United States v. Reese, \n92 \nU.S. 214\n, 221; Czarra v. Board of Medical Supervisors, 25 App.D.C. 443, 453. It is the statute, not the accusation under it, that prescribes the rule to govern conduct and warns against transgression. See Stromberg v. California, \n283 \nU.S. 359, 368\n, 51 S.Ct. 532, 535, 73 A.L. R. 1484; Lovell v. Griffin, \n303 \nU.S. 444\n, 58 S.Ct. 666. No one may be required at peril of life, liberty or property to speculate as to the meaning of penal statutes. All are entitled to be informed as to what the State commands or forbids. \n2\n The applicable rule is stated in Connally v. General Const. Co., \n269 \nU.S. 385, 391\n, 46 S.Ct. 126, 127: 'That the terms of a penal statute creating a new offense must be sufficiently explicit to inform those who are subject to it what conduct on their part will render them liable to its penalties is a well- recognized requirement, consonant alike with ordinary notions of fair play and the settled rules of law; and a statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application violates the first essential of due process of law.'\n The phrase 'consisting of two or more persons' is all that purports to define 'gang'. The meanings of that \n\n[306 \nU.S. 451, 454]\n\u00a0\n word indicated in dictionaries and in historical and sociological writings are numerous and varied. \n3\n Nor is the \n\n[306 \nU.S. 451, 455]\n\u00a0\n meaning derivable from the common law,4 for neither in that field nor anywhere in the language of the law is there definition of the word. Our attention has not been called to, and we are unable to find, any other statute attempting to make it criminal to be a member of a 'gang.' \n5\n\u00a0\n\n In State v. Gaynor, supra, the Court of Errors and Appeals dealt with the word. It said: 'Public policy ordains that a combination designed to wage war upon society shall be dispersed and its members rendered incapable of harm. This is the objective of section 4 ... and it is therefore a valid exercise of the legislative power. ... The evident aim of this provision was to render penal the association of criminals for the pursuit of criminal enterprises; that is the gist of the legislative expression. It cannot be gainsaid that such was within the competency of the Legislature; the mere statement of the purpose carries justification of the act. ... If society cannot impose such taint of illegality upon the confederation of convicted criminals, who have no lawful occupation, under circumstances denoting ... the pursuit of criminal objectives, it is helpless against one of the most menacing forms of evil activity. ... The primary function of government ... is to render security to its subjects. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 451, 456]\n\u00a0\n And any mischief menacing that security demands a remedy commensurate with the evil.' (119 N.J.L. 582, 197 A. 361.)\n Then undertaking to find the meaning of 'gang' as used in the challenged enactment, the opinion states: 'In the construction of the provision, the word is to be given a meaning consistent with the general object of the statute. In its original sense it signifies action-'to go'; in its modern usage, without qualification, it denotes-in common intent and understanding-criminal action. It is defined as 'a company of persons acting together for some purpose, usually criminal,' while the term 'gangster' is defined as 'a member of a gang of roughs, hireling criminals, thieves, or the like.' Webster's New International Dictionary, 2d Ed. And the Oxford English Dictionary likewise defines the word 'gang' as 'any company of persons who go about together or act in concert (in modern use mainly for criminal purposes).' Such is plainly the legislative sense of the term.'\n If worded in accordance with the court's explication, the challenged provision would read as follows: 'Any person not engaged in any lawful occupation, known to be a member of any gang consisting of two or more persons (meaning a company of persons acting together for some purpose, usually criminal, or a company of persons who go about together or who act in concert, mainly for criminal purposes), who has been convicted at least three times of being a disorderly person or who has been convicted of any crime in this or in any other State, is declared to be a gangster (meaning a member of a gang of roughs, hireling criminals, thieves, or the like).'\n Appellants were convicted before the opinion in State v. Gaynor. It would be hard to hold that, in advance of judicial utterance upon the subject, they were bound to understand the challenged provision according to the language later used by the court. Indeed the state Supreme \n\n[306 \nU.S. 451, 457]\n\u00a0\n Court (State v. Bell, supra) went on supposed analogy between 'gang' and offenses denounced by the Disorderly Persons Act, Comp.Stat.Supp.1930,  59-1 R.S.N.J.1937, 2:202-1, upheld by the Court of Errors and Appeals in Levine v. State, 110 N.J.L. 467, 470, 166 A. 300. But the court in that case found the meaning of 'common burglar' there involved to be derivable from the common law.\n The descriptions and illustrations used by the court to indicate the meaning of 'gang' are not sufficient to constitute definition, inclusive or exclusive. The court's opinion was framed to apply the statute to the offenders and accusation in the case then under consideration; it does not purport to give any interpretation generally applicable. The state court did not find, and we cannot, that 'gang' has ever been limited in meaning to a group having purpose to commit any particular offense or class of crimes, or that it has not quite frequently been used in reference to groups of two or more persons not to be suspected of criminality or of anything that is unlawful. The dictionary definitions adopted by the state court extend to persons acting together for some purpose, 'usually criminal', or 'mainly for criminal purposes'. So defined, the purposes of those constituting some gangs may be commendable, as, for example, groups of workers engaged under leadership in any lawful undertaking. The statute does not declare every member to be a 'gangster' or punishable as such. Under it, no member is a gangster or offender unless convicted of being a disorderly person or of crime as specified. It cannot be said that the court intended to give 'gangster' a meaning broad enough to include anyone who had not been so convicted or to limit its meaning to the field covered by the words that it found in a dictionary, 'roughs, hireling criminals, thieves, or the like'. The latter interpretation would include some obviously not within the statute and would exclude some plainly covered by it. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 451, 458]\n\u00a0\n The lack of certainty of the challenged provision is not limited to the word 'gang' or to its dependent 'gangster'. Without resolving the serious doubts arising from the generality of the language, we assume that the clause 'any person not engaged in any lawful occupation' is sufficient to identify a class to which must belong all capable of becoming gangsters within the terms of the provision. The enactment employs the expression, 'known to be a member'. It is ambiguous. There immediately arises the doubt whether actual or putative association is meant. If actual membership is required, that status must be established as a fact, and the word 'known' would be without significance. If reputed membership is enough, there is uncertainty whether that reputation must be general or extend only to some persons. And the statute fails to indicate what constitutes membership or how one may join a 'gang'.\n The challenged provision condemns no act or omission; the terms it employs to indicate what it purports to denounce are so vague, indefinite and uncertain that it must be condemned as repugnant to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The section continues: 'provided, however, that nothing in this section contained shall in any wise be construed to include any participant or sympathizer in any labor dispute.'

Hale Houts, Dean Wood, Charles M. Miller, and Cyrus Crane, all of Kansas City, Mo., for petitioners.\n Mr. Melville W. Borders, Jr., of Kansas City, Mo., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case is here on certiorari to review the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirming a judgment of the district court for the respondent. Certiorari was granted for consideration of a federal question of substance, to wit, whether a carrier's charges for services, actually utilized by a shipper and authorized by a tariff requiring prior arrangements for the services, are uncollectable when the services are rendered on orders, preceded or accompanied by denials of legal liability. \n305 \nU.S. 587\n, 59 S.Ct. 103, 83 L.Ed. --. Substantial conflict was alleged. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The facts were stipulated. The petitioners, as trustees of the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway Company, brought suit, under Section 24(8) of the Judicial Code,2 in the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri, for the value of services rendered in the installation of grain doors on box cars used by the respondent to ship grain in bulk in interstate commerce. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 516, 518]\n\u00a0\n Grain doors are required to prevent leakage of grain from the car while in transit. They are wooden barriers which must be placed inside the box car doors before loading and removed upon unloading. Before July 1, 1935, they were furnished and installed by carriers without separate charge. Effective that day, a tariff filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission continued the carriers' practice of furnishing the materials for grain doors but shifted the cost of installation to the shippers. It provided as follows: 'The railroad will act as shipper's agent and install grain doors ... at a charge of one dollar ($1.00) per car; prior arrangements for the service to be made with the carriers and to cover a specified period of time ....'\n On July 2, 1935, the day after the tariff went into effect, the respondent, together with other shippers, addressed a letter to the local freight agents of several carriers, including the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific, in which they announced that despite the tariff they expected the railroads, from and after July 1, 1935, to furnish cars with equipment to carry bulk grain safely, and would decline to pay for the service of installing grain doors in the cars. They wrote in part: 'Said undersigned parties further notify you that if ordinary box cars are furnished and supplied upon such orders (for cars for the shipment of bulk grain) they will expect them to be fully coopered or prepared with necessary sideddor barricades completely installed and ready for loading.'\n The carriers protested that neither they nor the shippers could be parties to practices not in conformity with the tariff. They declared that unless the shippers made unqualified arrangements pursuant to the terms of the tariff, cars would be furnished without the grain doors installed. This letter, dated July 15, 1935, evoked no reply. Between July 1, 1935, and February 29, 1936, the petitioners upon the orders of respondent supplied the \n\n[306 \nU.S. 516, 519]\n\u00a0\n Grain Company with 624 box cars for the shipment of grain in bulk. Before the cars were loaded, the petitioners installed the necessary grain doors. Bills, rendered monthly, charged the respondent $1.00 for each car. On November 22, 1935, the latter returned the bills, declining to pay on the ground that it had made no arrangement for the petitioners to install grain doors as its agents, as contemplated by the tariff. It concluded with a request that petitioners reveal the justification for the charges in the absence of any arrangement. The petitioners' agent replied on January 9, 1936, that the letter of July 2, 1935, had been construed to effect an arrangement and 'accepting such prior arrangement, the cars were coopered for your account and as your agent, and were accepted and used by you as such.' By letter of January 15, 1936, the respondent disagreed with petitioners' construction of the letter of July 2, 1935, and reiterated its intention not to pay.\n On April 4, 1936, the petitioners began this suit, asking judgment for $624. Before trial in the district court, the Interstate Commerce Commission passed upon the validity and reasonableness of the charge for this particular service. On April 12, 1937, the Commission ruled that it was proper to require the shipper to bear the expense of installing grain doors furnished by the carrier; that the clause relative to prior arrangements was not ambiguous; that it was for the carrier's benefit and could be waived; that the charge of $1.00 per car was unreasonable and should be limited to $.60 per car. It ruled further that shippers who had paid that $1.00 charge were entitled to reparation and that carriers might waive collection above the sixty-cent charge from shippers who had not yet paid. Chicago Board of Trade v. Abilene & So. R. Co., 220 I.C.C. 753.3 The petitioners reduced their demand \n\n[306 \nU.S. 516, 520]\n\u00a0\n in the district court to $.60 per car and asked judgment for $374.40.\n The district court gave judgment for the respondent. Simonds-Shields- Lonsdale Grain Co. v. Lowden, D.C., 19 F.Supp. 438. The circuit court of appeals affirmed, one judge dissenting. 8 Cir., 97 F.2d 816.\n The ruling of the Interstate Commerce Commission determines that the installation is a duty of the shipper and that the carrier can only receive sixty cents when it acts for the shipper in performing that duty. These are the essential provisions of the tariff. To facilitate the rendition of the service prior arrangements are required. The dominant elements are the responsibility for and the amount of the charge. These are fixed by the tariff. The letter of July 2, 1935, from the shippers required the installation of the grain doors and the respective orders for the separate cars, given thereafter, were given in the light of this demand for cars so equipped. We think this was an arrangement under the tariff. On July 2, 1935, the respondent clearly signified its desire for cars fully coopered and ready for loading. Its letter of that date was an unconditional request for the petitioners' services for a sufficiently specified period of time-'from and after July 1, 1935.' The announcement that respondent would decline to pay for them in no way qualified the request for tariff services, and cannot now stave off liability. The petitioners could disregard this advance disclaimer of liability and rely upon the courts to enforce observance of the tariff. Until changed, tariffs bind both carriers and shippers with the force of law. \n4\n Under Section 6 of the Interstate Commerce Act the carrier cannot deviate from the rate specified in the tariff for any service in connection with the transportation of property. \n5\n That section for \n\n[306 \nU.S. 516, 521]\n\u00a0\n bids the carrier from giving a voluntary rebate in any shape or form. This Court has had occasion recently to sustain action of the Commission aimed at carriers' practices resulting in collection of less than the tariff rate. \n6\n It is equally important to aid the efforts of a carrier in collecting published charges in full. \n7\n Involuntary rebates from tariff rates should be viewed with the same disapproval as voluntary rebates.\n The respondent suggests that the suit must fail because based upon a tariff held by the Interstate Commerce Commission 'unreasonable and unlawful.' The Commission did not hold that tariff unlawful or wholly unreasonable. It clearly recognized the validity of a tariff charge for installation services rendered by carriers at the request of shippers, but found $1.00 per car unreasonable to the extent that it exceeded $.60. It awarded reparation to those who has paid $1.00 per car and authorized the carriers to waive collection of the amount over $.60 per car from shippers who had not paid. \n8\n The only relief afforded respondent by the Commission's decision is a right to reparation for all payments over $.60 per car. \n9\n The voluntary reduction of their claim by the petitioners is a sensible adjustment of their right to recover the tariff charge and of their obligation to make reparation to the extent that it is unreasonable.\n It is unnecessary to consider various other contentions made by both the petitioners and the respondent.\n Judgment reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Cf.

MUTUAL BENEFIT HEALTH & ACCIDENT ASS'N(1939)\nNo. 189\nArgued: Decided: January 3, 1939\n\n\n\n\n[305 \nU.S. 484, 485]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John W. Nance, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Thomas B. Pryor and Thomas B. Pryor, Jr., both of Fort Smith, Ark., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner (plaintiff below) brought suit as beneficiary in the District Court against respondent (defendant below) on a health and accident policy issued by respondent in 1926 to petitioner's husband. Plaintiff alleged that the insured was accidentally killed July 26, 1934, while the policy was in full force and effect insuring against death resulting from accidental causes. At \n\n[305 \nU.S. 484, 486]\n\u00a0\n the conclusion of plaintiff's evidence, defendant declined to offer any evidence and did no more than move for a peremptory instruction. Defendant's motion was based upon the contentions that (1) the policy was not in effect when insured was killed because defendant had exercised an option granted it by the policy to reject the quarterly premium due July 1, 1934; (2) that the 'premium receipts themselves show that the policy terminated on the first day of July, 1934, prior to the time this loss occurred.' Defendant's motion for peremptory instruction was denied, defendant excepted, and the court directed the jury to return a verdict for plaintiff. Defendant's exception was noted, the jury rendered verdict for plaintiff, and the court entered judgment upon the verdict.\n The Court of Appeals reversed,1 holding that the policy was term insurance and reserved to defendant the right to reject any quarterly premium on the due date, that defendant had properly exercised its option in rejecting the quarterly premium due July 1, 1934, and that the policy was, therefore, terminated prior to insured's death. The court further held that no competent evidence had sustained plaintiff's allegations that the required premiums had been paid. We granted certiorari. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n In the view we take of the case, it is unnecessary to consider plaintiff's contention that the Court of Appeals erred in holding that defendant had the option to cancel the policy upon the due date of any quarterly premium. We find that there was competent and substantial evidence to sustain plaintiff's allegation that insured had paid premiums sufficient to keep the policy in effect up to and including the date of insured's death.\n The evidence showed that:\n The policy sued on was issued December 31, 1926; after advance payment of $74 for the first year's pre- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 484, 487]\n\u00a0\n mium, the policy was delivered to insured; thereafter, all quarterly premiums were paid to the defendant's local treasurer located at Rogers, Arkansas (where the policy was sold and delivered), up to and including the quarterly premium due January 1, 1934; these premiums were usually paid in advance, but not always; before April 1, 1934, plaintiff as agent for the insured went to the office of the local treasurer at whose office she had paid all the other premiums; he could not be found at the office; a young girl in the office suggested that the payment be sent to Little Rock; plaintiff mailed that payment to Little Rock and received a receipt dated March 30, 1934; plaintiff had not then received, and never did receive any notice from the company that it had moved its office or changed its method of collecting premiums; July 1, 1934, when the next premium was due she went to the local treasurer's office and found it closed; diligent search for him disclosed that not only had his office been closed, but he had moved from the house in which he had formerly resided; continuing to search for the treasurer, she finally found him several days later early in the morning entering a car in front of his office; he declined to accept the premium, told her to send it to Little Rock, and informed her that she should have received a notice from the company to that effect; that day, July 6, she bought a money order, 'addressed the envelope just to the company at Little Rock' and mailed it; July 13, the Little Rock office of the company wrote her that it could not accept the payment because the Omaha home office had not sent an official receipt for this policy payment; in that letter and in a subsequent communication of July 26, the Little Rock office offered to reinstate the policy but with restricted benefits; on July 26, however, the insured was killed by accidental means within the terms of the policy. The defendant offered no evidence whatsoever. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 484, 488]\n\u00a0\n First. The policy provides as to premium payments that 'this policy is issued in consideration of ... the payment in advance of $74.00 the first year, and the payment in advance of ... $16.00 dollars quarterly thereafter, beginning with April 1, 1927, is required to keep this policy in continuous effect.' This language is clear and nothing elsewhere in the policy alters its meaning. True, the printed application signed by deceased, December 27, 1926, and upon which the policy was issued four days later, contains the printed question, 'What is the premium?' and a typewritten answer, '$16.00 quarterly.' However, this is not inconsistent with the provision of the policy for the payment of $74 in advance and $16 quarterly premiums. The provision for payment in advance of $74 the first year required payment before the date the policy took effect, which according to the policy was the date of issue. Under the language of this provision actual payment of a year's premium in advance purchased insurance for a year. The dates for further payments to extend the policy beyond a year could be and were fixed by the policy contract. Payment for the first year carried the policy to December 31, 1927, and the first quarterly payment, due by the policy's terms April 1, 1927 and paid in advance of that date, extended the policy another quarter beyond December 31, 1927. Each succeeding quarterly payment carried the policy a corresponding three months. The questions before the trial court were whether the $74 first payment was actually made, and whether thereafter quarterly payments were made in an amount sufficient to carry the policy from the end of the first year up to and including the quarterly period in which death of insured occurred.\n Since the policy recites that 'this policy is issued in consideration of ... the payment in advance of $74.00 the first year ...,' delivery of the policy prima facie \n\n[305 \nU.S. 484, 489]\n\u00a0\n established the fact of the advance payment of that amount. 3 This evidence was reinforced by plaintiff's testimony that the $74 was so paid. Defendant made no objection to this testimony. On cross-examination by defendant, plaintiff amplified her testimony as to why she paid the quarterly premium in April, 1927, after having already paid the premium for a whole year before the policy was delivered. She explained that this was because defendant's representative told her and the insured that 'there were no days of grace included in the policy, but if we paid a year's premium in advance that would take the place of these days of grace.'\n Although defendant did not object to plaintiff's testimony of payment, and evoked explanation of it on cross-examination, the Court of Appeals, without any reference to governing State law,4 concluded that the evidence was incompetent. That court believed this evidence represented an effort to alter the terms of the written policy contract by an oral agreement violating the provisions that 'This policy ... contains the entire contract of insurance,' and 'No agent has authority to change this policy or to waive any of its provisions.' But this evidence of payment of premiums as required by the policy did not affect the terms of the written contract. It was offered to prove the discharge of the insured's obligation under the contract. The evidence was material to establish the fact of payment. No statutes of Arkansas or decisions of the highest court of that State5 have been \n\n[305 \nU.S. 484, 490]\n\u00a0\n pointed out which would make such relevant evidence incompetent. \n6\n The $74 payment for the first year, together with quarterly payments undisputedly made through April 1, 1934, carried the policy to January 1, 1935. We, therefore, find it unnecessary to consider whether the six days' delay in paying the July 1, 1934 premium was excused by reason of attendant circumstances.\n Second. The Conformity Act requires that 'The practice, pleadings, and forms and modes of proceeding in civil causes ... in the district courts, shall conform, as near as may be, to the practice, pleadings, and forms and modes of proceeding existing at the time in like causes in the courts of record of the State within which such district courts are held, any rule of court to the contrary notwithstanding.' \n7\n\u00a0\n\n Our attention has not been directed to any more authoritative Arkansas ruling governing the procedural effect of a request for a peremptory instruction without more, than the decision of the Supreme Court of Arkansas in A. B. Smith Lumber Co. v. Portis Bros., 140 Ark. 356, 215 S.W. 590. There the Court said (at pages 358, 359, 360, 215 S.W. at page 591): 'The cause ... proceeded to a hearing upon the pleadings and evidence. When the evidence was concluded, appellant requested a peremptory instruction, and no other. The court refused the instruction over the objection of appellant, and, on its own motion instructed the jury to return a verdict in favor of appellees ... over the objection and exception of appellant. ... And the court, on its own motion, gave a peremptory instruction for appellee. The request for a peremptory \n\n[305 \nU.S. 484, 491]\n\u00a0\n instruction by appellant and the giving of the peremptory instruction by the court for the adverse party was tantamount to submitting the case to the court sitting as a jury, and the court's finding became a verdict as much so as if it had been rendered by a jury upon the issues and evidence . ... So the question presented by this record is not whether there was sufficient evidence in the record to warrant the court in sending the case to the jury upon the issue of whether or not the undertaking was collateral, but the\n Here, there was ample evidence upon to support the finding of the court that the undertaking was original?'\n This rule of procedure closely approaches that frequently approved by this Court on the same subject, to the effect that \"Where both parties request a peremptory instruction and do nothing more they thereby assume the facts to be undisputed and, in effect, submit to the trial judge the determination of the inferences proper to be drawn therefrom.' And upon review a finding of fact by the trial court under such circumstances must stand if the record discloses substantial evidence to support it.' \n8\n\u00a0\n\n Here, there was amle evidence upon which to justify the verdict. Defendant obviously proceeded-after the evidence was closed-upon the belief that the facts and all the inferences to be drawn therefrom raised only a question of law for the court-not one of fact for the jury; and plaintiff acquiesced. Neither defendant nor plaintiff did anything to indicate a desire or belief that the jury should pass upon any facts. Thus, the District Court sitting in Arkansas, having jurisdiction only by reason of diversity of citizenship and trying a suit involving an Arkansas contract, followed the procedural rule announced by the highest court of that State. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 484, 492]\n\u00a0\n While litigants in Federal courts cannot-by rules of procedure-be deprived of fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution and laws of the United States, the local Arkansas rule followed by the District Court does not result in such deprivation. In effect, that local rule is practically identical with the Federal rule which treats a request by both parties for peremptory instructions without more as a submission of issues of fact to the court. It is essential that the right to trial by jury be scrupulously safeguarded, and a State rule of procedure entrenching upon this right would not require observance by Federal courts. \n9\n However, this Arkansas procedural rule-so closely approximating the Federal rule-does not amount to a prohibited invasion of Federal rights. Since the District Court followed the Arkansas procedural rule, and the verdict and judgment were supported by competent and substantial evidence, it follows that the Court of Appeals erroneously reversed the District Court's judgment. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is, therefore, reversed and that of the District Court is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER, dissenting.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and I are unable to accept the opinion or to agree with the judgment of the court just announced.\n We are of opinion that the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be reversed, and that, for the reasons given in the separate opinion of Circuit Judge Stone, 8 Cir., 95 F.2d 528, 534, the case should be remanded to the district court for proceedings in accordance with that opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 8 Cir., 95 F.2d 528. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] \n305 \nU.S. 583\n, 59 S.Ct. 81, 83 L.Ed. --, cf.

RADIO CORPORATION(1939)\nNo. 127\nArgued: Decided: January 30, 1939\n\n\n\n As Modified on Denial of Rehearing March 6, 1939. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 86, 87]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Samuel E. Darby, Jr., of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. Jo. Baily Brown, of Pittsburgh, Pa., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[306 \nU.S. 86, 88]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The questions presented for decision by the petition for certiorari are whether the Carter patent, No. 1,974,387, of September 18, 1934, for a directive antenna system for use in radio communication, is valid and is infringed by antennae structures used by petitioner in such communication.\n Respondent brought the present suit in the District Court for eastern New York to enjoin infringements of four patents relating to radio antennae or their operation. Two were those of Carter and two those of Lindenblad. Of these only the second Lindenblad patent, No. 1,927,522, of September 19, 1933, for an antenna for radio communication, is of present importance. When the suit was begun the application for the third Carter patent, with which we are presently concerned, was pending. After petitioner had answered and respondent, as a result of the litigation, had acquired knowledge of the particulars of the structure and operation of petitioner's antennae, Carter, respondent's assignor, amended the statement of his invention in his application so as in terms to embrace a differentiating feature of petitioner's structures. After this patent was issued respondent was permitted to file a supplemental bill charging infringement of it. The suits were consolidated, and the parties proceeded to trial on the issues of the validity and infringement of all five patents.\n After taking the voluminous testimony of numerous witnesses, the trial court found that none of the patents in suit was infringed and decreed that the suits be dismissed. D.C., 16 F.Supp. 610. It held that none of them was a pioneer patent; that none had been employed by any one; that respondent's commercial structures did \n\n[306 \nU.S. 86, 89]\n\u00a0\n not follow the teachings of any of them; and that consequently they were not entitled to a broad construction. With respect to the Carter patent in suit it said (page 621): 'The disclosure and the claims were broadened, not only contrary to their original terminology, but to their spirit as well.' And '... by those amendments the plaintiff attempted to mold the third Carter patent both as to disclosure and claims, to cover defendant's antenna systems. This could not lawfully be done.'\n On appeal from so much of the decree as related to the second Lindenblad patent and the third Carter patent, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed as to the Lindenblad patent, but reversed as to the Carter patent, holding Claims 15 and 16 valid and infringed. 96 F. 2d 587. We granted certiorari, \n305 \nU.S. 582\n, 59 S.Ct. 73, 83 L.Ed. --, because of the nature and importance of the case, on a petition which urged as grounds for its allowance that validity and infringement of the Carter patent were in doubt and that, as petitioner is the only competitor of respondent in the business of world wide public radio communication, further litigation, resulting in conflict of decision among circuits, was improbable.\n In ordinary broadcasting, radio waves are projected in all directions from the sending station. In radio communication it is advantageous and has long been the practice to use a directive antenna by which the waves of radio activity emanating from it are projected as a beam in the direction of the receiving station. In practice the beam is directed at an angle from the earth's surface toward the ionized layer of the stratosphere, or Heaviside layer, from which the beam is deflected toward the earth's surface in the compass direction of the receiving station. In more recent years it has been the practice to use relatively short wave lengths for radio communication. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 86, 90]\n\u00a0\n The radio waves are generated at the sending station by feeding an oscillating electric current of appropriate character into the wire or wires of the antenna. The electric waves in the wires energize radio activity, which the antenna projects as radio waves toward the receiving station. By modulating or interrupting the current, corresponding modulation or interruption of the radio waves is effected, which may be used as a means of transmitting any desired signal. The waves, as modulated, impinge on the antenna of the receiving station devised to receive and utilize them as a means of controlling, with corresponding modulation, an electric current which in turn actuates a mechanism contrived to give audible or visual expression to the transmitted signal.\n The effective part of the antenna is a copper wire from which the radio waves are radiated, supported on towers or poles at a height above the ground depending on the wave length used. The wire may be parallel with the earth, or vertical, or arranged at an angle, depending upon the function to be performed. Before Carter, antennae of two or more wires in varying arrangement had been used. The second Lindenblad patent showed an antenna of two wires arranged at an angle in the form of a V or an X, and it pointed out that in such an arrangement radiation will take place in the direction of the axis or bisector of the angle of the diverging wires, and that 'the spacing at the open end (of the wires), while variable over a great range, should be in the neighborhood of a fifth of the length, and the length of each antenna section should be of the order of magnitude of five to ten waves long.'\n While such an arrangement projects the radio waves principally in two directions along the bisector of the angle of the antenna wires, the prior art had made use of an arrangement of wires, parallel to the wires of the angu- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 86, 91]\n\u00a0\n lar antenna, as a 'reflector' by which the radiation was projected as a beam in one direction away from the reflector and along the bisector of the angle of the wires.\n The present Carter patent is for an 'antenna system utilizing standing wave phenomena.' Like the second Lindenblad patent, it is concerned with a V antenna by which the principal radiation is directed in the plane of the wires along the bisector of their angle. The disclosure of the patent, in which the court below found invention, was that the best directional radio propagation by the V type antenna is obtained with a structure in which the angle of the wires, their length, and the length of wave propagated are in a definite mathematical relationship expressed by a formula disclosed in the specifications.\n In explaining his invention, Carter pointed out that 'It is known that when a wire having a length greater than the operating wave length is excited in such manner that standing waves are produced thereon, radiation will occur principally in the direction of symmetrical cones having their apices at the center of the wire. Such is the case with a wire having a length equal to a plurality of one-half wave lengths at the operating frequency. The radiation pattern produced in such instance appears, in cross section, in the form of symmetrical cones about the wire. The present invention which makes use of these phenomena, in its most simple aspect employs a pair of open-ended wires energized in phase opposition to have standing waves throughout the length of the wires, the wires having such angular relation with respect to each other as to obtain a highly directional, efficient and simple antenna system. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[306 \nU.S. 86, 92]\n\u00a0\n The patent states the mathematical formula by which the desired relationship is secured, which shows that the appropriate angle between each of the antenna wires and their bisector depends upon the wave length to be propagated and the use of antenna wires of a length which is a multiple of half wave lengths. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[306 \nU.S. 86, 93]\n\u00a0\n The significance of the formula lies in the fact that the angle between the wire and the direction of greatest radio activity is a trigonometrical function of two variables, the wave length used and the 'number of half wave lengths contained in the wire', and that, as the application stated, the use of the formula in practice presupposes the use of a wire whose length is a multiple of half wave lengths. The patent then explains that the angle of the formula is the angle between each wire of the V antenna and its bisector-in other words, that the angle of the wires of the antenna is twice and hence, like the angle of the formula, is a function of the wave length and the length of the wires, which are each a multiple of half wave lengths long.\n Carter did not invent the formula. It had been developed by Abraham and published in a scientific journal thirty years before. Annalen der Physik, 1898, Physikalische Zeitschrift, March 2, 1901. Abraham's formula expressed the scientific truth that when radio activity is projected from a charged wire of finite length, i.e., one having standing waves, and having a length of a multiple of half wave lengths, the angle between the direction of the principal radio activity and the wire is dependent on \n\n[306 \nU.S. 86, 94]\n\u00a0\n wave length and wire length, which is a multiple of half wave lengths. Lindenblad had described his antenna as using either standing or traveling waves and, as we have seen, had taught that with an arrangement of antenna wires at an angle, radiation will occur substantially in the direction of the bisector of the angle and that the preferred angle was dependent upon an indicated relationship between wire length and wave length.\n It is plain, therefore, that the Carter invention, if it was invention, consisted in taking the angle of the Abraham formula as the angle between each wire of the V antenna and its bisector. By so doing he brought the cones of principal radio activity, each having one of the wires of the antenna as its axis, into conjunction at their periphery and along the bisector of the angle between the wires, and thus established there the greatest directional radio activity.\n While a scientific truth, or the mathematical expression of it, is not patentable invention, a novel and useful structure created with the aid of knowledge of scientific truth may be. But we do not stop to solve the problem whether it was more than the skill of the art to combine the teaching of Abraham with that of Lindenblad and others who had pointed out that the arrangement of the wires at an angle enhanced directional radio activity along their bisector. We assume, without deciding the point, that this advance was invention even though it was achieved by the logical application of a known scientific law to a familiar type of antenna. But it is apparent that if this assumption is correct the invention was a narrow one, consisting of a structure conforming to the teachings of the Abraham formula as to angle and wire length relative to wave length, and is to be strictly construed with regard both to prior art and to alleged infringing devices. Kokomo Fence Machine Co. v. Kit \n\n[306 \nU.S. 86, 95]\n\u00a0\n selman, \n189 \nU.S. 8\n, 23 S.Ct. 521; Cimiotti Unhairing Co. v. American Fur Refining Co., \n198 \nU.S. 399\n, 25 S.Ct. 697. Carter's structure was a V antenna having an angle double the Abraham angle and wires containing a multiple of half wave lengths.\n Carter, using the Abraham formula, calculated the value of the angle in that formula for wires up to fourteen wave lengths long. He plotted the result, which he expressed graphically in figure 12 of the patent by drawing a smooth curve connecting the discrete points on the graph which indicated the results of his computation by use of the Abraham formula. From this calculation he derived a formula in empirical form3 for determining the desired angle when wave length and length of wire are known, in which the angle between the wires is described as twice a, which is the equivalent of the angle of the Abraham formula.\n Petitioner uses antennae with wires in V arrangement, but their wires are not an integral number of half wave lengths long, with the exception of one antenna, No. 8, which is four wave lengths long and uses an angle 10% smaller than that prescribed by the Abraham formula for that length of wire. The others are of lengths which are approximately multiples of quarter wave lengths, and their angles differ from the angles of the formula. The crucial question in the case is whether a V antenna structure, having a wire length to which the Abraham formula does not apply and using an angle not to be derived from that formula, which is the basis of the patent, infringes Carter's patent. Respondent insists that it does, because, as it argues, the invention disclosed by Carter's \n\n[306 \nU.S. 86, 96]\n\u00a0\n application, elaborated by amendment and broad claims, embraces all V antennae arranged at an angle double the angle of the empirical formula, even though the length of the wires is not an exact multiple of half wave lengths, as prescribed by the Abraham formula. This is the invention of Claim 15,4 and it is urged that the claim is amply supported by the statement in the specifications appearing in the original application that the empirical formula represented by the plotted curve of figure 12 of the patent 'will be found accurate for all practical purposes where the length of wire dealt with does not correspond to a whole number of half wave lengths.'\n The trial court, analyzing Carter's application and taking into account the essentials of the Abraham formula and the statement in the application that the 'object of the present invention is to disclose the proper angle for conductors or radiators' measured in multiples of half wave lengths, evidently thought, as petitioner argues, that the references in the application to 'wires of finite' 5 \n\n[306 \nU.S. 86, 97]\n\u00a0\n length and to wires 'of any length whatsoever'6 were intended only to refer to wires of electrically finite as distinguished from electrically infinite length, capable of producing standing waves utilized by the antenna of the patent, and of any length conforming to the requirements of the basic formula. \n7\n It concluded that the correct construction of the application was that the invention described did not go beyond the scope of the Abraham formula and so extended only to the angles calculable by that formula for standing wave wires measured by multiples of half wave lengths. Support is given to this conclusion by the statement in the application that 'The law, giving the correct angle for lengths between odd and even number of half wave lengths, is not given due to its complexity ...'\n The Court of Appeals placed emphasis on the reference to 'wires of any finite length' and on the statement that \n\n[306 \nU.S. 86, 98]\n\u00a0\n 'the empirical formula and the curve of figure 12 will be found accurate for all practical purposes, where the length of wire dealt with does not correspond to a whole number of half wave lengths.' It held that the invention disclosed was the application of the empirical formula to all lengths of antenna wires and embraced all angles resulting from such calculation, and that the invention was consequently infringed by petitioner's structures.\n Whether or not it was the purpose of the patentee, by these references to wire lengths in his application to extend his patent to structures not conforming to the Abraham formula, we are not able to construe the application, before amendment at least, as embracing such an extension. And we think that the attempt to extend the claims based on the application of the empirical formula, to wire lengths not multiples of half wave lengths, must fail, because such structures are not within the invention described in the application.\n The formula in Claims 15 and 16 is the empirical formula derived from the Abraham formula, which is, by its terms, applicable only to antenna wires which are multiples of half wave lengths long. Carter's empirical formula, wholly derived from Abraham's formula, and taken together with it, therefore discloses no invention or discovery more than the application of the Abraham formula to the V antenna. It reveals no scientific law applicable to wire lengths which are intermediate of multiples of half wave lengths, and the application explicitly states that 'the law, giving the correct angle for lengths between odd and even number of half wave lengths, is not given'. The preparation, by methods familiar to engineers, of the graph in figure 12, which was but a pictorial representation of the Abraham formula applied to certain wire lengths specified in the formula, did not involve invention. Neither the empirical formula nor its graph gives any clue to the directional radio activity re- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 86, 99]\n\u00a0\n sulting from the use of wire lengths intermediate of multiples of half wave lengths, which were excluded by the Abraham formula, and neither afforded any basis for a claim of invention not supported by the use of the Abraham formula itself.\n The claimed use of the empirical formula for the calculation of the angle for wires which are not multiples of half wave lengths long thus involved a departure from what Carter's application had described as his invention, and a contradiction of it. What Carter did was to describe his structure in terms of its dimensions, arrived at by the use of the Abraham formula, which was stated to embody the applicable scientific law. He then derived the empirical formula from Abraham. From the very method of derivation the empirical formula meant nothing different from that of Abraham. He then declared the empirical formula to embody a method of arriving at the measurements of a structure different from the structure first described as the invention and not capable of construction by the method of the Abraham formula. If, as a result of this legerdemain, a V antenna having wire lengths a multiple of any fractional wave length is to be taken as the invention of Carter's application, then everything that it said of the Abraham formula and of wires 'either an even number of half wave lengths long or an odd number of half wave lengths long' could be discarded without changing its meaning. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n This attempt to broaden the only invention described in the application through a purely mechanical alteration of the meaning of the empirical formula, which had been devised as a shorthand expression of the scientific law on which the invention was declared to rest, cannot, we think, be taken to enlarge the description of the invention as measured by the Abraham formula, so as to include a structure to which that formula does not apply. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 86, 100]\n\u00a0\n This use of the empirical formula for a purpose for which it was not devised does not justify our construing the application as though all reference to the Abraham formula had been eliminated and a new and different one expressing a new and different scientific law had been substituted for it. The result of reading the application as respondent contends it should be construed is precisely the same as though full effect were given to a claim which goes beyond the invention described, and it is open to the same objection.\n After the present suit was brought the application was altered by amendment so as in effect to wipe out all reference to the scientific law by which Carter's invention was defined. This was accomplished by changes which implicitly assert that the letter n of the formula of the invention, the Abraham formula, meant something different from 'the number of half wave lengths contained in the wire' of a length of multiples of half wave lengths as stated both in the application and in the patent.\n The reference in the application to the purpose of the invention to disclose the 'proper angle' for radiators of multiples of half wave lengths long was altered by eliminating from it all mention of half wave lengths. \n9\n A sentence added after formal allowance of the patent states: 'By the term 'plurality of wave lengths' or 'plurality of half wave lengths' or 'several half wave lengths' it is not intended that the wires so described shall necessarily be an exact or approximate integral number of such lengths, unless so specified, but rather that each of the wires so described shall be sufficiently long to enclude the lengths specified.' These amendments operated to modify the Abraham formula so as to cancel from the application the statement of the scientific law defining the invention. They left as its definition the modified \n\n[306 \nU.S. 86, 101]\n\u00a0\n Abraham formula and its counterpart, the empirical formula, stating a different law which their genesis did not authorize.\n We think that these alterations were not permissible. Schriber- Schroth Co. v. Cleveland Trust Co., \n305 \nU.S. 47\n, 59 S.Ct. 8, and that without them the invention must be taken to be limited to a structure having an angle double that disclosed by the Abraham formula, which was made the basis of the alleged invention. As already shown, neither the Abraham formula nor the empirical formula describes, or purports to describe, the directional radio activity or defines the angle which affords 'the best directional propagation' of the patent for antennae of wire lengths intermediate of multiples of half wave lengths. The expert testimony shows that in fact neither formula serves that purpose. The finding of the trial court that they do not make 'a correct showing of what happens when the wires are other than exact multiples of half wave lengths' is supported by the evidence. The testimony warrants the conclusion that differences in wave effect already noted,10 when wires of other than exact multiples of half wave lengths are used, produce, through consequent changes in 'radiation resistance', differences in directional radio activity not calculable by the formulae of the patent. It follows that Claims 15 and 16, so far as they claim antennae of wire lengths intermediate of multiples of half wave lengths, are invalid. So far as the patent discloses and claims invention of a structure made in conformity to the Abraham formula, petitioner's structures do not infringe, for none of them conforms to the Abraham formula.\n For reasons already indicated it is not material that the variations are small between the angles used by petitioner for wire lengths of multiples of quarter wave lengths \n\n[306 \nU.S. 86, 102]\n\u00a0\n and those obtained by application of the empirical formula. Further, Carter's advance over prior art was in specifying an exact angle for wires of the prescribed length. Lindenblad had indicated a preferred angle, and Bruce, before Carter, had plotted a rule of thumb graph, which the trial court found to be prior art, showing the directional radio activity of a V antenna and exhibiting relatively small variations from that of Carter. Carter, avoiding prior art by defining his angle for antennae with wires of particular wave lengths with mathematical precision, cannot discard that precision to establish infringement. Kokomo Fence Machine Co. v. Kitselman, supra; Cimiotti Unhairing Co. v. American Fur Refining Co., supra, cf. General Electric Co. v. Wabash Appliance Corp., \n304 \nU.S. 364\n, 58 S.Ct. 899\n\n\n It is unnecessary to discuss the further question whether petitioner's structures avoid infringement because the direction of their principal radio activity is not in the plane of the wires, an operative difference from the antennae described by the patent which the court below found to be due wholly to ground effect, which it thought must be assumed to be envisaged by, though not stated in, the Carter patent.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Understanding of the disclosure and other features of the patent requires a brief explanation of its terms. The term 'long', as applied to an antenna, means a wire which is long in relation to the wave length used. The term 'standing waves', as distinguished from 'traveling waves', describes the phenomenon manifested when an oscillating electric current of radio frequency is communicated to one end of a wire which is open at the other (that is, not in a closed circuit) and sufficiently short so that the waves have not completely radiated their energy before reaching the end of the wire. The waves will then be reflected back along the wire, and the energy of the reflected waves tends to unite with that of the oncoming waves of the same periodicity, so as to produce standing waves along the wire. As the velocity of the radio wave in space is approximately that of the current waves in the wire, the number of complete standing waves on the wire is always exactly the same as the length of the wire divided by the wave length. When the length of the wire is a multiple of half wave lengths, the oncoming and reflected waves, traveling at the same velocity, occur simultaneously, differing in this respect from the waves in a wire of a length intermediate a multiple of half wave lengths, and with different effects upon the resulting radio energy, presently to be noted. \n When osciallating current is so related to the length of wire that the energy of the former is exhausted by radiation before or when the waves reach the end of the wire, there is no reflection of the waves, and they travel in one direction only toward the open end of the wire. They are denominated 'traveling waves'. In professional parlance, wires producing reflected, and hence 'standing' waves, are electrically of finite length. Those of sufficient length to avoid reflection and thus carry waves flowing in only one direction are said to be electrically of infinite length. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] The specifications state:\n'By considering a long wire the equivalent of a very large number of very short, (Hertz) oscillators and by adding up the field components at any point P having a direction angle relative to the axis of the wire, where the point P is a great distance from the wire as compared to the length of the wire such that all lines from point P to any point on the wire are essentially parallel, it can be shown that the field strength H is given by the following proportionality for a conductor an odd number of half wave lengths long:\n\n'The letter 'n' indicates the number of half wave lengths contained in the wire.\n\n'For a wire an even number of half wave lengths long, in similar fashion, the field strength 'H' is given by the following proportionality:\n\n'Where n as above indicates the number of half wave lengths on the wire.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] 'For practical purposes the empirical formula\n is sufficiently accurate where l equals the length of the wire and the wave length, both in the same units of measurement.' \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] '15. An antenna comprising a pair of relatively long conductors disposed with respect to each other at an angle substantially equal to twice\n degrees, l being the length of the wire and the operating wave length in like units, and means in circuit with said antenna for exciting the conductors in phase opposition whereby standing waves of opposite instantaneous polarity are formed on the conductors throughout their length.'\n Claim 16 claims an antenna arranged in conformity to the empirical formula, as in Claim 15, with 'a similar parallel pair of conductors spaced an odd number of quarter wave lengths away from said first mentioned pair ....' These parallel wires constitute the 'reflector', which, as already noted, was old in the art. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] 'Still a further object of the present invention is to disclose the proper angle for conductors or radiators either an even number of half wave lengths long or an odd number of half wave lengths long, and, in general to disclose the angle for best directional propagation for wires of any finite length.'\n After the present suit was brought this paragraph was amended to read:\n'Another object of the invention is to disclose the angle for the best directional propagation for open-ended wires of any finite length, preferably longer than the operating wave length, having standing waves thereon and arranged in the manner proposed.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] 'Moreover, it should be clearly understood that the wires of each unit can be of any length whatsoever provided they are placed at the correct angle for their length. For best tuning, the total overall length of both of the wires and the 'U' loop terminating them should be effectively an integral number of half wave lengths, but, the portion forming the radiation element can be of any length. The law, giving the correct angle for lengths between odd and even number of half wave lengths, is not given due to its complexity but, the empirical formula and the curve of figure 12 will be found accurate for all practical purposes, where the length of wire dealt with does not correspond to a whole number of half wave lengths.' \n[\nFootnote 7\n] See note 1, supra. \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] See note 5, supra. \n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] See note 5, supra. \n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] See note 1, supra. \n\n\n\n\n","79":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMAYTAG CO. v. HURLEY MACH. CO.(1939)\nNo. 661\nArgued: Decided: May 22, 1939\n\n\n\n\n[307 \nU.S. 243, 244]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Wallace R. Lane and Benton Baker, both of Chicago, Ill., for Maytag Co.\n Messrs. William H. Davis and Dean S. Edmonds, both of New York City, for General Electric Supply Corporation.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These are patent infringement suits in which certiorari was granted, \n305 \nU.S. 599\n, 59 S.Ct. 66, 83 L.Ed. --; \n306 \nU.S. 626\n, 59 S.Ct. 591, 83 L. Ed. --, because of a conflict of decision. \n1\n Apparatus claims 23, 26, and 29 of the Snyder patent, No. 1,866,779, which are here involved, have been held invalid in the Second Circuit by reason of anticipation; and have been adjudged valid in the Eighth Circuit. We need not resolve the conflict, since we are of opinion the patent is void for failure to disclaim claim 39.\n The patent, issued July 12, 1932, to the Maytag Company as assignee, contains thirty-nine claims, thirty-six of which are for a washing machine and three (Nos. 1, 38 and 39) for a method of washing fabrics. In 1935 the company obtained a decree in a suit against the Brooklyn Edison Company for infringement of apparatus claims 23 and 26 and method claim 38.2 The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed as to all three claims, holding they did not disclose novelty. \n3\n This court refused certiorari, \n300 \nU.S. 662\n, 57 S.Ct. 493, and the company promptly disclaimed two of the method claims, 1 and 38, but did not disclaim 39. In the instant cases infringement of apparatus claims 23, 26, and 29, is charged, but claim 39, \n\n[307 \nU.S. 243, 245]\n\u00a0\n is not in suit, nor has it been made the basis of any other suit.\n There has been unreasonable neglect or delay in entering a disclaimer of claim 39 within the meaning of R.S.  4917, and R.S.  4922,4 unless that claim is 'definitely distinguishable from the parts claimed without right',-that is, the disclaimed method claims 1 and 38. This must be so, for the company, by disclaiming those claims, has confessed that the patentee therein claimed 'more than that of which he was the original or first inventor or discoverer' and that the company, as assignee of the patent, therefore, 'did not choose to claim or to hold' the method therein disclosed 'by virtue of the patent or assignment.'\n Thus the company elected the course it would pursue with knowledge of the options open to it. Claim 38, which had been adjudged invalid, need not have been disclaimed, but, alone or with other claims, might have been made the basis of another suit against a different party,-the petitioner in No. 661, for example. \n5\n If the claims were held invalid in such later suit the court might find the patent wholly void, for failure seasonably to disclaim. \n6\n To avoid the risk of such a possible outcome, the company chose the other alternative of disclaiming 38, and relying on other claims. 7 In the Brooklyn Edison case the district court said concerning claim 1, 'The quoted verbiage is different from that of Claim 38, but the same method or process is thought to be equally embodied in both.' \n8\n This expression presumably caused the company also to disclaim claim 1 as not 'definitely distinguishable' from claim 38. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 243, 246]\n\u00a0\n If claim 39 describes the same method as claim 38, it follows that failure either to sue on 39 or to disclaim it along with 38 invalidates the patent.\n The two are copied in the margin. \n9\n We think they describe but a single method. The company insists that the crucial difference lies in the fact that in 38 the moving fluid in the tub is said substantially to suspend the fabrics, whereas in 39 the same agency is said to cause the fabrics to be freely moved out. But the difference \n\n[307 \nU.S. 243, 247]\n\u00a0\n in verbiage describes no difference in operation or result. We conclude that, when read in their entirety, they describe the same method.\n The decrees in Nos. 76 and 77 are affirmed; that in No. 661 is reversed.\n Affirmed in part and reversed in part. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Maytag Co. v.

U. S.(1939)\nNo. 660\nArgued: March 30, 1939Decided: April 17, 1939\n\n\n\n Mr. H. Lowndes Maury, of Butte, Mont., for petitioner.\n Mr. Paul A. Freund, of Washington, D.C., for respondent. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 61, 62]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Court of Appeals dismissed petitioner's appeal from a judgment of contempt for failure to obey a District Court's order to testify before an Internal Revenue official. \n1\n This dismissal was proper if the contempt proceeding was civil and not criminal. A notice of appeal was filed and a bill of exceptions signed. But petitioner's appeal was not, as appeals from civil judgments were required to be, applied for or allowed by the trial judge or a judge of the Court of Appeals. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The facts disclose:\n On April 21, 1938, an Internal Revenue agent, acting under 26 U.S.C .,  1514, 26 U.S.C.A.  1514 (copied in the margin),3 served petitioner with summons to appear before him and testify in connection with the tax liability of another. Petitioner responded to the summons, but declined to give any statement or information as to the matter under inquiry. Thereupon, both the agent and the Assistant United \n\n[307 \nU.S. 61, 63]\n\u00a0\n States Attorney for the District appeared before the District Court, and the agent filed an affidavit of facts and prayed that petitioner be ordered to submit to such questions 'as may be propounded to him ... that are material and pertinent to the subject matter' of the investigation. After hearing, in which petitioner appeared, the District Court ordered him to appear before the agent and testify upon 'all matters and facts within ... (his) knowledge and concerning the subject matter of the inquiry and investigation, ...' Petitioner did so appear but again declined to answer the agent's questions. After a second hearing by the District Court, petitioner was found in contempt for failure to obey the Court's previous order to testify before the agent and was ordered 'held in ... jail ... until ... (he) purges himself of ... contempt by obeying the order' to testify.\n Petitioner insists that no civil action was involved here and that proceedings to which the United States and its agents are parties can not be civil. \n4\n However, Article 3, Section 2, of the Constitution, U.S.C.A., expressly contemplates the United States as a party to civil proceedings by extending the jurisdiction of the Federal judiciary 'to Controversies to which the United States shall be a Party.' An action by the Interstate Commerce Commission to compel a witness to testify is 'a direct civil proceeding, expressly authorized by an act of congress, in the name of the commission, and under the direction of the attorney general \n\n[307 \nU.S. 61, 64]\n\u00a0\n of the United States, against the witness ... refusing to testify, ...' 5 So here, the mere presence of the United States as a party, acting through its agents, does not impress upon the controversy the elements of a criminal proceeding. \n6\n In accordance with its constitutional authority to do so, Congress has expressly authorized such a proceeding by an agent of the United States in the Federal courts 'to compel ... attendance, testimony, or production of books, papers, or other data.' 26 U.S.C.  1523, 26 U.S.C.A.  1523.7\n While particular acts do not always readily lend themselves to classification as civil or criminal contempts, a contempt is considered civil when the punishment is wholly remedial, serves only the purposes of the complainant, and is not intended as a deterrent to offenses against the public. \n8\n Here, the summons served on petitioner required only that he testify in a tax inquiry properly conducted by an agent of the Bureau of Internal Revenue. And the agent's petition to the District Court, to which we may look in determining the nature of the proceeding,9 invoked judicial assistance solely in obtaining petitioner's testimony. Authority of the Court was sought to buttress the procedure for collection of taxes \n\n[307 \nU.S. 61, 65]\n\u00a0\n and not in 'vindication of the public justice',10 as in criminal cases.\n The judgment of contempt was civil and appeal from it was governed by the statutory rules of civil appeals.\n There remains the suggestion that the appeal in question can be considered a civil appeal properly taken under Rule 73 of the new Federal Rules of Civil Procedure which became effective September 16, 1938, 28 U.S. C.A. following section 723c. \n11\n However, petitioner's notice of appeal was filed May 2, 1938. The controlling statute required application for allowance of a civil appeal within three months after judgment from which appeal was sought. The three months expired July 28, 1938, and the contempt judgment had become unappealable well before the effective date of the new Rules. Therefore, petitioner is not aided by the provision of Rule 86 that the new Rules shall 'govern all ... actions then pending, ( September 16, 1938) ...' This action-from which there was then no right of appeal-was not pending within the meaning of the Rule.\n The Court of Appeals was not in error in dismissing petitioner's appeal for failure to comply with the statutory requirements governing civil appeals. Its judgment is affirmed.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 9 Cir., 100 F.2d 322. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 28 U.S.C.  230, 28 U.S.C.A.  230; Alaska Packers Association v.

Caldwell, of Harrisburg, Pa., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[306 \nU.S. 346, 349]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n We are called upon to determine whether a local police regulation unconstitutionally regulates or burdens interstate commerce.\n Pennsylvania, by an Act of April 30, 19351 has declared the milk industry in that Commonwealth to be a business affected with a public interest. The statute defines a milk dealer as any person 'who purchases or handles milk within the Commonwealth for sale, shipment, storage, processing or manufacture within or without the Commonwealth.' It creates a Milk Control Board with authority to investigate, supervise, and regulate the industry and imposes penalties for violations of the law or of the Board's orders issued pursuant to the law, and requires a dealer to obtain a license by application to the Board. Licenses may be refused, suspended, or revoked for specified causes. A requisite of obtaining a license is that the dealer shall file with the Board a bond conditioned for the prompt payment of all amounts due to producers for milk purchased by the licensee. The act empowers the Board to require the dealer to keep certain records and directs the Board, with the approval of the Governor, to 'fix, by official order, the minimum prices to be paid by milk dealers to producers and others for milk.' The Board may very the price according to the production, use, form, grade or class of milk. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The petitioner, the Milk Control Board, filed its bill in a Common Pleas Court to restrain the appellee from continuing to do business without complying with the statute. The respondent by its answer sought to justify \n\n[306 \nU.S. 346, 350]\n\u00a0\n failure to comply on the ground that it was engaged in interstate commerce. After trial the court dismissed the bill. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania affirmed the decree. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n The respondent, a Pennsylvania corporation, leases and operates a milk receiving plant in Elizabethville, Pennsylvania, at which it buys milk from approximately one hundred and seventy-five farmers in the neighborhood, who bring their milk to the plant in their own cans. There the milk is weighed and tested by the respondent and emptied into large receiving tanks in which it is cooled preparatory to shipment. This requires retention of the milk for less than twenty-four hours; it is not processed, and no change occurs in its constituent elements. The milk is then drawn from the cooling tanks into tank trucks operated by a contract carrier and transported into New York City for sale there by the respondent. The journey is continuous from Elizabethville to New York City. All milk purchased by the respondent at Elizabethville is shipped to and sold in New York. During the year 1934 approximately 4,500,000,000 pounds of milk were produced in Pennsylvania of which approximately 470,000,000 pounds were shipped out of the state.\n The respondent contends that the act, if construed to require it to obtain a license, to file a bond for the protection of producers, and to pay the farmers the prices prescribed by the Board, unconstitutionally regulates and burdens interstate commerce. The State Supreme Court has held that the statute is a valid police regulation. \n4\n The petitioner concedes that the purchase, shipment into \n\n[306 \nU.S. 346, 351]\n\u00a0\n another state, and sale there of the milk in which the respondent deals is interstate commerce. The question for decision is whether, in the absence of federal regulation, the enforcement of the statute is prohibited by Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution, U.S.C.A. We hold that it is not.\n When the people declared 'The Congress shall have Power ... To regulate Commerce ... among the several States,' their purpose was clear. The United States could not exist as a nation if each of them were to have the power to forbid imports from another state, to sanction the rights of citizens to transport their goods interstate, or to discriminate as between neighboring states in admitting articles produced therein. The grant of the power of regulation to the Congress necessarily implies the subordination of the states to that power. This court has repeatedly declared that the grant established the immunity of interstate commerce from the control of the states respecting all those subjects embraced within the grant which are of such a nature as to demand that, if regulated at all, their regulation must be prescribed by a single authority. \n5\n But in matters requiring diversity of treatment according to the special requirements of local conditions, the states remain free to act within their respective jurisdictions until Congress sees fit to act in the exercise of its overriding authority. \n6\n One of the commonest forms of state action is the exercise of the police power directed to the control of local conditions and exerted in the interest of the welfare of the state's citizens. Every state police statute necessarily will affect interstate commerce in some degree, but such a statute does not run counter to the grant of Congressional power merely because it incidentally or indirectly involves or burdens interstate commerce. This is so even though, \n\n[306 \nU.S. 346, 352]\n\u00a0\n should Congress determine to exercise its paramount power, the state law might thereby be restricted in operation or rendered unenforceable. \n7\n These principles have guided judicial decision for more than a century. Clearly they not only are inevitable corollaries of the constitutional provision, but their unimpaired enforcement is of the highest importance to the continued existence of our dual form of government. The difficulty arises not in their statement or in a ready assent to their propriety, but in their application in connection with the myriad variations in the methods and incidents of commercial intercourse.\n The purpose of the statute under review obviously is to reach a domestic situation in the interest of the welfare of the producers and consumers of milk in Pennsylvania. Its provisions with respect to license, bond, and regulation of prices to be paid to producers are appropriate means to the ends in view. The question is whether the prescription of prices to be paid producers in the effort to accomplish these ends constitutes a prohibited burden on interstate commerce, or an incidental burden which is permissible until superseded by Congressional enactment. That question can be answered only by weighing the nature of the respondent's activities, and the propriety of local regulation of them, as disclosed by the record.\n The respondent maintains a receiving station in Pennsylvania where it conducts the local business of buying milk. At that station the neighboring farmers deliver their milk. The activity affected by the regulation is essentially local in Pennsylvania. Upon the completion of that transaction the respondent engages in conserving and transporting its own property. The Commonwealth does not essay to regulate or to restrain the shipment of the respondent's milk into New York or to regulate its sale or the price at which respondent may sell it in New York. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 346, 353]\n\u00a0\n If dealers conducting receiving stations in various localities in Pennsylvania were free to ignore the requirements of the statute on the ground that all or a part of the milk they purchase is destined to another state the uniform operation of the statute locally would be crippled and might be impracticable. Only a small fraction of the milk produced by a farmers in Pennsylvania is shipped out of the Commonwealth. There is, therefore, a comparatively large field remotely affecting and wholly unrelated to interstate commerce within which the statute operates. These considerations we think justify the conclusion that the effect of the law on interstate commerce is incidental and not forbidden by the Constitution, in the absence of regulation by Congress.\n None of the decisions on which the court below and the respondent rely rules the instant case. DiSanto v. Pennsylvania, \n273 \nU.S. 34\n, 47 S.Ct. 267, involved a state law directed solely at foreign commerce; Lemke v. Farmers' Grain Co., \n258 \nU.S. 50\n, 42 S.Ct. 244, condemned a state statute affecting commerce, over ninety per cent. of which was interstate and essaying to regulate the price of commodities sold within the state payable and receivable in the state of destination; Shafer v. Farmers' Grain Co., \n268 \nU.S. 189\n, 45 S.Ct. 481, also dealt with a state law intended to regulate commerce almost wholly interstate in character. In Baldwin v. Seelig, \n294 \nU.S. 511\n, 55 S.Ct. 497, 101 A.L.R. 55, this court condemned an enactment aimed solely at interstate commerce attempting to affect and regulate the price to be paid for milk in a sister state, and we indicated that the attempt amounted in effect to a tariff barrier set up against milk imported into the enacting state.\n The decree must be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. So ordered.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 346, 354]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice BUTLER are of opinion that the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania properly concluded that under former opinions of this Court the questioned regulations constituted a burden upon interstate commerce prohibited by the Federal Constitution. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] P.L. 96, 31 P.S.Pa.  684. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] The act was repealed by an Act of April 28, 1937, P.L. 417, 31 P.S.

SMITH(1939)\nNo. 505\nArgued: March 8, 1939Decided: April 17, 1939\n\n\n\n\n\n[307 \nU.S. 38, 41]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. A. J. Little, of Valdosta, Ga., and L. E. Heath, of Douglas, Ga., for appellants.\n Messrs. Robert H. Jackson, Sol. Gen., and Robert K. McConnaughey, of Dayton, Ohio, for the United States.\n Mr. Omer W. Franklin, of Valdosta, Ga., for appellees Smith et al.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appellants, producers of flue-cured tobacco, assert that the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938,1 is unconstitutional as it affects their 1938 crop.\n The portions of the statute involved are those included in Title III, providing marketing quotas for flue-cured tobacco.2 The Act directs that when the supply is found to exceed the level defined in the Act as the 'reserve supply level' a national marketing quota shall become effective which will permit enough flue-cured tobacco to be marketed during the ensuing marketing year to maintain the supply at the reserve supply level. The quota is to be apportioned to the farms on which tobacco is grown. Penalties are to be paid by tobacco auction warehousemen for marketing tobacco from a farm in excess of its quota. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 38, 42]\n\u00a0\n Section 311 is a finding by the Congress that the marketing of tobacco is a basic industry which directly affects interstate and foreign commerce; that stable conditions in such marketing are necessary to the general welfare; that tobacco is sold on a national market and it and its products move almost wholly in interstate and foreign commerce; that without federal assistance the farmers are unable to bring about orderly marketing, with the consequence that abnormally excessive supplies are produced and dumped indiscriminately on the national market; that this disorderly marketing of excess supply burdens and obstructs interstate and foreign commerce, causes reduction in prices and consequent injury to commerce, creates disparity between the prices of tobacco in interstate and foreign commerce and the prices of industrial products in such commerce, and diminishes the volume of interstate commerce in industrial products; and that the establishment of quotas as provided by the Act is necessary and appropriate to promote, foster and obtain an orderly flow of tobacco in interstate and foreign commerce.\n There is no provision for continuous regulation of tobacco marketing, but, by Section 312(a), regulation becomes effective in any year only if, on November 15th, the Secretary finds that the total supply of tobacco as of July 1st exceeded the reserve supply level which is defined in the Act. 3 If he so finds, he shall, by December 1st, proclaim the total supply and a national marketing quota shall be in effect throughout the marketing year which commences the following July 1st. The quota is to be the amount which the Secretary finds will make available during the ensuing marketing year a supply of tobacco equal to the \n\n[307 \nU.S. 38, 43]\n\u00a0\n reserve supply level. As it was not passed until after November 15, 1937, the Act provided, with respect to the marketing year beginning July 1, 1938, for which the quotas involved in this case were in effect, that the determination and proclamation of the national marketing quota should be made within fifteen days after the statute's approval. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n Within thirty days after proclamation, the Secretary is to conduct a referendum of the producers of the crop of the preceding year to ascertain whether they favor or oppose the imposition of a quota. If more than one- third oppose, the Secretary is to proclaim the result before January 1st and the quota is not to be effective. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n By Section 313(a) it is directed that the quota is to be first apportioned among the states based on the total quantity of tobacco produced in each state during the five years immediately preceding the year in question, plus the normal production of any acreage diverted under any agricultural adjustment and conservation program in any of the years. The basic determination is to be adjusted to correct state allotments, giving due consideration to seed bed or other plant diseases, production trends, or abnormal producing conditions which affected production in the several states during the five-year period, and to make required provision for allotments to small farms. A limit is set below which the quota of any state may not be reduced.\n The Act provides for the apportionment of the state allotment amongst the farms which produced tobacco in the current year or have produced previously in one or more of the four preceding years. Apportionment to \n\n[307 \nU.S. 38, 44]\n\u00a0\n these farms is to be made on the basis of past marketing, after due allowance for drought, flood, hail, and other abnormal weather conditions, plant bed and other diseases, land, labor, and equipment available for the production of tobacco, crop-rotation practices, and soil and other physical factors affecting production. A limit is fixed below which the adjustment may not reduce the production of a given farm. Allotment to new tobacco farms is to be made on a slightly different basis. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n Apportionment of the quota amongst individual farms is to be by local committees of farmers according to standards prescribed in the Act, amplified by regulations and instructions issued by the Secretary. Each farmer is to be notified of his marketing quota and the quotas of individual farms are to be kept available for public inspection in the county or district where the farm is located. If the farmer is dissatisfied with his allotment he may have his quota reviewed by a local review committee, and, if dissatisfied with the determination of that committee, he may obtain judicial review.\n Section 314 provides that if tobacco in excess of the quota for the farm on which the tobacco is produced is marketed through a warehouseman, the latter must pay to the Secretary a penalty equal to fifty per cent. of the market price of the excess, and may deduct an amount equivalent to the penalty from the price paid the producer. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n[307 \nU.S. 38, 45]\n\u00a0\n Section 376 gives the United States a civil action for the recovery of unpaid penalties. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n A few days before the 1938 auction sales were to take place, the appellants, who produce flue-cured tobacco in southern Georgia and northern Florida, filed a bill in equity in a Georgia state court against local warehousemen to restrain them from deducting penalties under the Act from the sales price of tobacco to be sold at their auction warehouses on behalf of appellants. The bill alleged that the Act is unconstitutional; that it illegally commands the defendants to deduct penalties, pay them over to the Secretary, who must cover them into the treasury of the United States; that, if the defendants should make the required payments, the amounts paid by them would aggregate so large a sum that they would be unable to satisfy judgments in actions brought to recover the illegal payments. The court granted a preliminary injunction and ordered the defendant warehousemen to pay the amounts of the penalties into the registry of the court. The cause was removed to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia. The District Court continued the injunction, modified the order to require the payments to be made into its registry, the auction sales were held, and payments into the court were made. The United States was permitted to intervene as a defendant. \n9\n The warehousemen and the United States filed answers. The cause was set down before a court \n\n[307 \nU.S. 38, 46]\n\u00a0\n consisting of three judges,10 which heard it on a stipulation of facts and entered a decree dismissing the bill. \n11\n\u00a0\n\n Before coming to the merits we inquire whether the court below had jurisdiction as a federal court or as a court of equity. Though no diversity of citizenship is alleged, nor is any amount in controversy asserted so as to confer jurisdiction under subsection (1)12 of Section 24 of the Judicial Code, the case falls within subsection (8)13 which confers jurisdiction upon District Courts 'of all suits and proceedings arising under any law regulating commerce.' Maintenance of the bill for injunction is not forbidden by R.S.  3224,14 which applies only to a suit to restrain assessment or collection of a tax. Under the averments of the bill the defendant warehousemen would be wrongdoers if they deducted and paid over the prescribed penalties, but no action at law would be adequate to redress the damage thus inflicted. It appears that the total of the penalties involved in this suit is some $374,000. The allegation that the warehousemen would be unable to respond in actions for sums aggregating this amount has, therefore, reasonable basis. Before any such action could be initiated the penal sum would have been paid to the Secretary of Agriculture and by him to the Treasurer of the United States and covered into the general funds of the Treasury. No action could be maintained against the warehousemen or either of these officials for disposing of the penal sums in accordance with the terms of the Act unless prior notice not to do so had been served upon each of them. In the light of the fact that the appellants received notice of their quotas only a few days before the \n\n[307 \nU.S. 38, 47]\n\u00a0\n actual marketing season opened, the maintenance of actions based upon collection of the penalties would have been a practical impossibility. We are of opinion, therefore, that a case is stated for the interposition of a court of equity.\n The appellants plant themselves upon three propositions: (1) that the Act is a statutory plan to control agricultural production and, therefore, beyond the powers delegated to Congress; (2) that the standard for calculating farm quotas is uncertain, vague, and indefinite, resulting in an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to the Secretary; (3) that, as applied to appellants' 1938 crop, the Act takes their property without due process of law.\n First. The statute does not purport to control production. It sets no limit upon the acreage which may be planted or produced and imposes no penalty for the planting and producing of tobacco in excess of the marketing quota. It purports to be solely a regulation of interstate commerce, which it reaches and affects at the throat where tobacco enters the stream of commerce,-the marketing warehouse. \n15\n The record discloses that at least two-thirds of all flue-cured tobacco sold at auction warehouses is sold for immediate shipment to an interstate or foreign destination. In Georgia nearly one hundred per cent. of the tobacco so sold is purchased by extrastate purchasers. In markets where tobacco is sold to both interstate and intrastate purchasers it is not known, when the grower places his tobacco on the warehouse floor for sale, whether it is destined for interstate or intrastate commerce. Regulation to be effective, must, and therefore may constitutionally, apply to all sales. \n16\n This \n\n[307 \nU.S. 38, 48]\n\u00a0\n court has recently declared that sales of tobacco by growers through warehousemen to purchasers for removal outside the state constitute interstate commerce. \n17\n Any rule, such as that embodied in the Act, which is intended to foster, protect and conserve that commerce, or to prevent the flow of commerce from working harm to the people of the nation, is within the competence of Congress. Within these limits the exercise of the power, the grant being unlimited in its terms, may lawfully extend to the absolute prohibition of such commerce,18 and a fortiori to limitation of the amount of a given commodity which may be transported in such commerce. The motive of Congress in exerting the power is irrelevant to the validity of the legislation. \n19\n\u00a0\n\n The provisions of the Act under review constitute a regulation of interstate and foreign commerce within the competency of Congress under the power delegated to it by the Constitution.\n Second. The appellants urge that the standard for allotting farm quotas is so uncertain, vague, and indefinite that it amounts to a delegation of legislative power to an executive officer and thus violates the Constitutional requirement that laws shall be enacted by the Congress.\n What has been said in summarizing the provisions of the Act sufficiently discloses that definite standards are laid down for the government of the Secretary, first, in fixing the quota and, second, in its allotment amongst states and farms. He is directed to adjust the allot \n\n[307 \nU.S. 38, 49]\n\u00a0\n ments so as to allow for specified factors which have abnormally affected the production of the state or the farm in question in the test years. Certainly fairness requires that some such adjustment shall be made. The Congress has indicated in detail the considerations which are to be held in view in making these adjustments, and, in order to protect against arbitrary action, has afforded both administrative and judicial review to correct errors. This is not to confer unrestrained arbitrary power on an executive officer. In this aspect the Act is valid within the decisions of this court respecting delegation to administrative officers. \n20\n\u00a0\n\n Third. In support of their contention that the Act, as applied to the crop year 1938, deprives them of their property without due process of law in violation of the Fifth Amendment, U.S.C.A.Const., the appellants rely on the following undisputed facts.\n Tobacco growers in southern Georgia and northern Florida began to arrange for the planting of their 1938 crop in December, 1937, when it was necessary for them to prepare beds for the planting of the seeds. Thereafter it was necessary to cultivate the seed beds, sow and water the seed, cover the beds with cloth, and otherwise care for the plants until they were large enough to be transplanted. At the date of approval of the Act each of the plaintiffs had planted his seed beds and, about the middle of March, began transplanting into the fields, which were prepared and fertilized at large expense. The plants were thereafter cultivated and sprayed, and harvesting began during June and continued during July, followed by the curing and grading of the tobacco. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 38, 50]\n\u00a0\n All of these activities involved labor and expense. The production of flue-cured tobacco requires, at prevailing price levels, a cash outlay of between thirty and forty dollars per acre for fertilizer, plant bed covering, twine, poison, etc. The use of animals and permanent and semi- permanent equipment demands an average expenditure, over a period of years, ranging from twenty to thirty dollars an acre. The labor expended per acre is between three hundred and four hundred man-hours. The total cost per pound varies from ten cents to twenty cents.\n The marketing season for flue-cured tobacco in Georgia and Florida commences about August 1st of each year. Each of the appellants was notified of the quota of his farm shortly before the opening of the auction markets. Prior to the receipt of notice each of them had largely, if not wholly, completed planting, cultivating, harvesting, curing and grading his tobacco. Until receipt of notice none knew, or could have known, the exact amount of his quota, although, at the time of filing the bill, each had concluded from available information that he would probably market tobacco in excess of any quota for his farm.\n The Act was approved February 16, 1938. The Secretary proclaimed a quota for flue-cured tobacco on February 18th and, on the same date, issued instructions for holding a referendum on March 12th. March 25th the Secretary proclaimed the result of the referendum which was favorable to the imposition of a national marketing quota. In June he issued regulations governing the fixing of farm quotas within the states. July 22nd he determined the apportionment as between states and issued regulations relative to the records to be kept by warehousemen and others. Shortly before the markets opened each appellant received notice of the allotment to his farm. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 38, 51]\n\u00a0\n On the basis of these facts it is argued that the statute operated retroactively and therefore amounted to a taking of appellants' property without due process. The argument overlooks the circumstance that the statute operates not on farm production, as the appellants insist, but upon the marketing of their tobacco in interstate commerce. The law, enacted in February, affected the marketing which was to take place about August 1st following, and so was prospective in its operation upon the activity it regulated. The Act did not prevent any producer from holding over the excess tobacco produced, or processing and storing it for sale in a later year; and the circumstance that the producers in Georgia and Florida had not provided facilities for these purposes is not of legal significance.\n The decree is affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER, dissenting.\n Plaintiffs are farmers in Georgia and on their farms raise tobacco. They sell it in the market year when produced because, in their circumstances, they are unable to process and make it fit to be held for sale in a later year. The sales are at auction markets, through defendants who are Georgia warehousemen, to purchasers intending to take the tobacco outside the State. The Secretary of Agriculture, assuming to be empowered by the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, 7 U.S.C.A.  1281 et seq., undertook to prescribe the amount of flue-cured tobacco to be raised in 1938 in the United States, in each State, and on each farm. He failed to let plaintiffs know the quotas respectively assigned to them until after their crops had matured and were ready for marketing. Each raised more than the assigned quota.\n The Act declares that, if more than the amount fixed for a farm is marketed, the warehouseman shall pay to \n\n[307 \nU.S. 38, 52]\n\u00a0\n the Secretary a penalty equal to one-half the price of the excess, but it authorizes him to retain that amount from the farmer raising and bringing it to market for sale. If, without resort to a warehouseman, the farmer sells directly to one in this country, the purchaser is required to pay the penalty but is authorized to take the amount from the purchase price. If the farmer sells directly to one outside the United States he is required to pay the penalty to the Secretary. Thus, in any event, the penalty is effectively laid upon the farmer. Enforcement of the Act will compulsorily take from plaintiffs an amount of money equal to one-half of the market value of all tobacco raised and sold by them in excess of the prescribed quotas.\n In United States v. Butler, \n297 \nU.S. 1\n, 56 S.Ct. 312, 323, 102 A.L.R. 914, we held the federal government without power to control farm production. We condemned the statutory plan there sought to be enforced as repugnant to the Tenth Amendment, U.S.C.A.Const. That scheme was devised and put in effect under the guise of exertion of power to tax. We held it to be in excess of the powers delegated to the federal government; found the tax, the appropriation of the money raised, and the directions for its disbursement, to be but the means to an unconstitutional end; showed that the Constitution confers no power to regulate production and that therefore legislation for that purpose is forbidden; emphasized the principle established by earlier decisions that a prohibited end may not be attained under pretext of exertion of powers which are granted; and finally we declared that, if Congress may use its power to tax and to spend compulsorily to regulate subjects within the reserved power of the States, that power 'would become the instrument for total subversion of the governmental powers reserved to the individual states.' \n\n[307 \nU.S. 38, 53]\n\u00a0\n After failure of that measure, Congress, assuming power under the commerce clause, enacted the provisions authorizing the quotas and penalties the validity of which is questioned in this case. Plaintiffs contend that the Act is a plan to control agricultural production and therefore beyond the powers delegated to Congress. The Court impliedly concedes that such a plan would be beyond congressional power, but says that the provisions do not purport to control production, set no limit upon the acreage which may be planted or produced and impose no penalty upon planting and production in excess of marketing quota. Mere inspection of the statute and Secretary's regulations unmistakably disclose purpose to raise price by lessening production. Whatever may be its declared policy or appearance, the enactment operates to control quantity raised by each farmer. It is wholly fallacious to say that the penalty is not imposed upon production. The farmer raises tobacco only for sale. Punishment for selling is the exact equivalent of punishment for raising the tobacco. The Act is therefore invalid. United States v. Butler, \n297 \nU.S. 1\n, 56 S.Ct. 312, 102 A.L.R. 914; Hammer v. Dagenhart, \n247 \nU.S. 251\n, 38 S.Ct. 529, 3 A.L.R. 649, Ann.Cas.1918E, 724. See Brooks v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 432, 438\n, 45 S.Ct. 345, 346, 37 A.L.R. 1407; Kentucky Whip & Collar Co. v. I.C.R. Co., \n299 \nU.S. 334, 350\n, 57 S.Ct. 277, 282 Cf. Railroad Retirement Board v. Alton R. Co., \n295 \nU.S. 330\n, 362, et seq., 55 S.Ct. 758, 767\n\n\n Assuming that, under Currin v. Wallace, \n306 \nU.S. 1\n, 59 S.Ct. 379, 83 L.Ed. --, plaintiffs' sales in interstate commerce at defendants' auction markets are to be deemed subject to federal power under the commerce clause, U.S.C.A.Const. art. 1,  8, cl. 3, the Court now rules that, within suggested limits so vague as to be unascertainable, the exercise of power under that clause, 'the grant being unlimited in its terms, may lawfully extend to the absolute prohibition of such commerce and a fortiori to limitation of the amount of a given commodity which may be transported in such commerce.' \n\n[307 \nU.S. 38, 54]\n\u00a0\n That ruling is contrary alike to reason and precedent. To support it, the Court merely cites the following cases:\n The Lottery Case, Champion v. Ames, \n188 \nU.S. 321\n, 23 S.Ct. 321, held that an Act of Congress prohibiting transportation of lottery tickets in interstate commerce is not inconsistent with any limitation or restriction imposed upon exercise of the powers granted to Congress. After demonstrating the illicit character of lottery tickets, the Court said (188 U.S. page 357, 23 S.Ct. page 327): 'We should hesitate long before adjudging that an evil of such appalling character, carried on through interstate commerce, cannot be met and crushed by the only power competent to that end. ... (188 U.S. page 358, 23 S.Ct. page 327) It is a kind of traffic which no one can be entitled to pursue as of right.'\n Hipolite Egg Co. v. United States, \n220 \nU.S. 45\n, 31 S.Ct. 364, 367, held within federal power the provisions of the Food and Drug Act, 21 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq., forbidding transportation in interstate commerce of food 'debased by adulteration' and authorizing articles so transported to be seized as contraband.\n Hoke v. United States, \n227 \nU.S. 308\n, 33 S.Ct. 281, 43 L. R.A, N.S., 906, Ann.Cas.1913E, 905, sustained congressional prohibition of interstate transportation of women for immoral purposes.\n Brooks v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 432\n, 45 S.Ct. 345, 37 A.L.R. 1407, upheld a statute of the United States (18 U.S.C.A.  408) making it a crime to transport a stolen automobile in interstate commerce.\n Gooch v. United States, \n297 \nU.S. 124\n, 56 S.Ct. 395, construed an Act of Congress making it a crime to transport a kidnapped person in interstate commerce.\n Plainly these cases give no support to the view that Congress has power generally to prohibit or limit, as it may choose, transportation in interstate commerce of corn, cotton, rice, tobacco, or wheat. Our decisions establish the contrary:\n Wilson v. New, \n243 \nU.S. 332\n, 37 S.Ct. 298, L.R.A.1917E, 938, Ann.Cas.1918A, 1024, upheld an Act regulating hours of service of employees of interstate carriers \n\n[307 \nU.S. 38, 55]\n\u00a0\n by rail. The Court following the teaching of earlier decisions, said (243 U.S. page 346, 37 S.Ct. page 301, L.R.A.1917E, 938, Ann.Cas. 1918A, 1024): 'The extent of regulation depends on the nature and character of the subject and what is appropriate to its regulation. The powers possessed by government to deal with a subject are neither inordinately enlarged or greatly dwarfed because the power to regulate interstate commerce applies. This is illustrated by the difference between the much greater power of regulation which may be exerted as to liquor and that which may be exercised as to flour, dry-goods and other commodities. It is shown by the settled doctrine sustaining the right by regulation absolutely to prohibit lottery tickets, and by the obvious consideration that such right to prohibit could not be applied to pig iron, steel rails, or most of the vast body of commodities.'\n Hammer v. Dagenhart, \n247 \nU.S. 251\n, 38 S.Ct. 529, 3 A.L. R. 649, Ann.Cas.1918E, 724, held repugnant to the commerce clause and to the Tenth Amendment, U.S.C.A.Const., an Act prohibiting transportation in interstate commerce of articles made at factories in which child labor was employed. The Court said (247 U.S. page 271, 38 S.Ct. page 530, 3 A.L.R. 649, Ann.Cas.1918E, 724): 'In other words, the power ( granted by the commerce clause) is one to control the means by which commerce is carried on, which is directly the contrary of the assumed right to forbid commerce from moving and thus destroying it as to particular commodities. But it is insisted that the adjudged cases in this court establish the doctrine that the power to regulate given to Congress incidentally includes the authority to prohibit the movement of ordinary commodities and therefore that the subject is not open for discussion. The cases demonstrate the contrary. They rest upon the character of the particular subjects dealt with and the fact that the scope of governmental authority, state or national, possessed over them is such that the authority to prohibit is as to them but the exertion of the power to regulate. ... (247 U.S. page 276, 38 S.Ct. page 533, 3 A. L.R. 649, Ann.Cas.1918E, 724) In our view the necessary effect of this act is, by means of a prohibition \n\n[307 \nU.S. 38, 56]\n\u00a0\n against the movement in interstate commerce of ordinary commercial commodities to regulate the hours of labor of children in factories and mines within the states, a purely state authority. Thus the act in a two- fold sense is repugnant to the Constitution. It not only transcends the authority delegated to Congress over commerce but also exerts a power as to a purely local matter to which the federal authority does not extend. The far reaching result of upholding the act cannot be more plainly indicated than by pointing out that if Congress can thus regulate matters entrusted to local authority by prohibition of the movement of commodities in interstate commerce, all freedom of commerce will be at an end, and the power of the states over local matters may be eliminated, and thus our system of government be practically destroyed'.\n Heretofore, in cases involving the power of Congress to forbid or condition transportation in interstate commerce, this Court has been careful to determine whether, in view of the nature and character of the subject, the measure could be sustained as an appropriate regulation of commerce.* If Congress had the absolute power now attributed to it by the decision just announced, the opinions in these cases were unnecessary and utterly beside the mark.\n For reasons above suggested, I am of opinion:\n The penalty is laid on the farmer to prevent production in excess of his quota.

UNITED STATES(1939)\nNo. 240\nArgued: November 14, 1939Decided: December 11, 1939\n\n\n\n Mr. David V. Cahill, of New York City, for petitioner nardonne.\n Mr. Jesse Climenko, of New York City, for petitioner Hoffman.\n Mr. Louis Halle, of New York City, for petitioner Gottfried.\n O. John Rogge, Asst. Atty. Gen., for respondent. \n\n[308 \nU.S. 338, 339]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n We are called upon for the second time to review affirmance by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit of petitioners' convictions under an indictment for frauds on the revenue. In Nardone v. United States, \n302 \nU.S. 379\n, 58 S.Ct. 275, this Court reversed the convictions on the first trial because they were procured by evidence secured in violation of  605 of the Communications Act of 1934, c. 652, 48 Stat. 1064, 1103; 47 U.S.C.,  605, 47 U.S.C.A.  605. For details of the facts reference is made to that case. Suffice it here to say that this evidence consisted of intercepted telephone messages, constituting 'a vital part of the prosecution's proof'.\n Conviction followed a new trial, and 'the main question' on the appeal below is the only question open here-namely, 'whether the (trial) judge improperly refused to allow the accused to examine the prosecution as to the uses to which it had put the information' which Nardone v. United States, supra, found to have vitiated the original conviction. Though candidly doubtful of the result it reached, the Circuit Court of Appeals limited the scope of  605 to the precise circumstances before this Court in the first Nardone case, and ruled that 'Congress had not also made incompetent testimony which had become accessible by the use of unlawful 'taps', for to divulge that information was not to divulge an intercepted telephone talk.' 2 Cir., 106 F.2d 41, 44.\n The issue thus tendered by the Circuit Court of Appeals is the broad one, whether or no  605 merely interdicts the introduction into evidence in a federal trial of intercepted telephone conversations, leaving the prosecution free to make every other use of the proscribed evidence. Plainly, this presents a far-reaching problem in \n\n[308 \nU.S. 338, 340]\n\u00a0\n the administration of federal criminal justice, and we therefore brought the case here for disposition. \n308 \nU.S. 539\n, 60 S.Ct. 103, 84 L.Ed. --.\n Any claim for the exclusion of evidence logically relevant in criminal prosecutions is heavily handicapped. It must be justified by an over-riding public policy expressed in the Constitution or the law of the land. In a problem such as that before us now, two opposing concerns must be harmonized: on the one hand, the stern enforcement of the criminal law; on the other, protection of that realm of privacy left free by Constitution and laws but capable of infringement either through zeal or design. In accommodating both these concerns, meaning must be given to what Congress has written, even if not in explicit language, so as to effectuate the policy which Congress has formulated.\n We are here dealing with specific prohibition of particular methods in obtaining evidence. The result of the holding below is to reduce the scope of  605 to exclusion of the exact words heard through forbidden interceptions, allowing these interceptions every derivative use that they may serve. Such a reading of  605 would largely stultify the policy which compelled our decision in Nardone v. United States, supra. That decision was not the product of a merely meticulous reading of technical language. It was the translation into practicality of broad considerations of morality and public well-being. This Court found that the logically relevant proof which Congress had outlawed, it outlawed because 'inconsistent with ethical standards and destructive of personal liberty.' \n302 \nU.S. 379, 384\n, 58 S.Ct. 275, 277. To forbid the direct use of methods thus characterized but to put no curb on their full indirect use would only invite the very methods deemed 'inconsistent with ethical standards and destructive of personal liberty.' What was said in a different context in Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, \n251 \nU.S. 385, 392\n, 40 S.Ct. 182, 183, 24 A.L.R. 1426, is pertinent here: 'The essence of a pro- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 338, 341]\n\u00a0\n vision forbidding the acquisition of evidence in a certain way is that not merely evidence so acquired shall not be used before the Court but that it shall not be used at all.' See Gouled v. United States, \n255 \nU.S. 298, 307\n, 41 S.Ct. 261, 264. A decent respect for the policy of Congress must save us from imputing to it a self-defeating, if not disingenuous purpose.\n Here, as in the Silverthorne case, the facts improperly obtained do not 'become sacred and inaccessible. If knowledge of them is gained from an independent source they may be proved like any others, but the knowledge gained by the Government's own wrong cannot be used by it' simply because it is used derivatively. \n251 \nU.S. 385, 392\n, 40 S.Ct. 182, 183, 24 A.L.R. 1426\n\n\n In practice this generalized statement may conceal concrete complexities. Sophisticated argument may prove a causal connection between information obtained through illicit wire-tapping and the Government's proof. As a matter of good sense, however, such connection may have become so attenuated as to dissipate the taint. A sensible way of dealing with such a situation-fair to the intendment of  605, but fair also to the purposes of the criminal law-ought to be within the reach of experienced trial judges. The burden is, of course, on the accused in the first instance to prove to the trial court's satisfaction that wire-tapping was unlawfully employed. Once that is established-as was plainly done here-the trial judge must give opportunity, however closely confined, to the accused to prove that a substantial portion of the case against him was a fruit of the poisonous tree. This leaves ample opportunity to the Government to convince the trial court that its proof had an independent origin.\n Dispatch in the trial of criminal causes is essential in bringing crime to book. Therefore, timely steps must be taken to secure judicial determination of claims of illegality on the part of agents of the Government in obtain- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 338, 342]\n\u00a0\n ing testimony. To interrupt the course of the trial for such auxiliary inquiries impedes the momentum of the main proceeding and breaks the continuity of the jury's attention. Like mischief would result were tenuous claims sufficient to justify the trial court's indulgence of inquiry into the legitimacy of evidence in the Government's possession. So to read a Congressional prohibition against the availability of certain evidence would be to subordinate the need for rigorous administration of justice to undue solicitude for potential and, it is to be hoped, abnormal disobedience of the law by the law's officers. Therefore claims that taint attaches to any portion of the Government's case must satisfy the trial court with their solidity and not be merely a means of eliciting what is in the Government's possession before its submission to the jury. And if such a claim is made after the trial is under way, the judge must likewise be satisfied that the accused could not at an earlier stage have had adequate knowledge to make his claim. The civilized conduct of criminal trials cannot be confined within mechanical rules. It necessarily demands the authority of limited direction entrusted to the judge presiding in federal trials, including a well-established range of judicial discretion, subject to appropriate review on appeal, in ruling upon preliminary questions of fact. Such a system as ours must, within the limits here indicated, rely on the learning, good sense, fairness and courage of federal trial judges.\n We have dealt with this case on the basic issue tendered by the Circuit Court of Appeals and have not indulged in a finicking appraisal of the record, either as to the issue of the time limit of the proposed inquiry into the use to which the Government had put its illicit practices, or as to the existence of independent sources for the Government's proof. Since the Circuit Court of Appeals did \n\n[308 \nU.S. 338, 343]\n\u00a0\n not question its timeliness, we shall not. And the hostility of the trial court to the whole scope of the inquiry reflected his own accord with the rule of law by which the Circuit Court of Appeals sustained him, and which we find erroneous.\n The judgment must be reversed and remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS is of opinion that the Circuit Court of Appeals reached the proper conclusion upon reasons there adequately stated and its judgment should be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice REED took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","84":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNATIONAL LABOR R. BD. v. NEWPORT NEWS, SHIPBUILDING & DRY DOCK(1939)\nNo. 20\nArgued: Decided: December 4, 1939\n\n\n\n\n[308 \nU.S. 241, 242]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Frank Murphy, Atty. Gen., and Charles Fahy, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n Mr. H. H. Rumble, of Norfolk, Va., for respondent.\n Mr. Frank A. Kearney, of Phoebus, Va., for Employees' Representative Committee, Intervener.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In a case duly instituted and heard, the National Labor Relations Board issued an order,1 pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 10(c)2 of the National Labor Relations Act, requiring the respondent, Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company: (1) to cease and desist from (a) dominating or otherwise interfering with the administration of the Employees' Representative Committee, a labor organization,3 or the formation or administration of any other labor organization of its employes; (b) from \n\n[308 \nU.S. 241, 243]\n\u00a0\n interfering with, restraining, or coercing its employes in the exercise of the right guaranteed them by Sec. 74 of the Act. The order further required the company (2) to take affirmative action, namely: (a) to withdraw all recognition from the Committee as the representative of any of its employes for the purpose of dealing with the company concerning labor conditions and wages, and completely to disestablish the Committee as such representative; (b) to post copies of the order throughout the plant; (c) to maintain said notices for thirty days; and (d) to notify the Board's Regional Director of the steps taken to comply with the order.\n The order was based upon findings that the respondent had dominated and interfered with the formation and administration of the Committee, had contributed to it financial and other support, and was still dominating and interfering with the Committee, contrary to Sec. 8(1) and (2)5 of the Act. \n 6\n\u00a0\n\n The Company petitioned the Circuit Court of Appeals for review. The Board answered praying that the court dismiss the company's petition and decree enforcement. The court held that the Board had jurisdiction of the cause, but that its holding that the company had dominated and interfered with the formation and administration of the Committee was without support in the evidence. The court decreed that Section 1(a) and (b) and Section 2( b)(c) and (d) of the Board's order should be enforced but that Section 2(a ), which required the withdrawal of recognition of the Committee and its disestablishment as a representative of the employes, should be stricken from \n\n[308 \nU.S. 241, 244]\n\u00a0\n the order. We granted certiorari, \n307 \nU.S. 617\n, 59 S.Ct. 793, because of asserted conflict with decisions of this court. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n The respondent does not press the claim advanced in the court below that the Board lacked jurisdiction. The sole issue here joined is as to the propriety of that portion of the Board's order which constrained the respondent to withdraw recognition of the Committee and to disestablish it as the bargaining representative of the employes. Resolution of the issue requires that we determine whether the Board's ultimate finding of domination and interference by the employer has substantial support in the evidence.\n The Board's subsidiary findings of fact are not the subject of serious controversy. The respondent attacks the ultimate conclusion of fact as unjustified by the subsidiary findings and further contends that the conclusion could not have been reached had not the Board ignored and refused to find other relevant facts which were either stipulated or proved without contradiction.\n The Board's findings were to the following effect: In 1927, in cooperation with its employes, the respondent put into effect a plan of employe representation known as 'Representation of Employes'. The preamble of the plan stated that its purpose was to give employes a voice in respect of the conditions of their labor and to provide a procedure for the prevention and adjustment of future differences. Under the plan the employes were to elect representatives each of whom was paid $100 per year for services as such. No one holding a supervisory position was eligible to serve as a representative or to vote for a representative. Administration of the plan was vested in certain joint committees each of which con- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 241, 245]\n\u00a0\n sisted of five elected representatives and not more than five representatives chosen from amongst the employes by the management. There was provision for a Management's Representative whose function was 'to keep the management in touch with the representatives and represent the management in negotiations with their officers and committees.' A provision calling for the arbitration of differences was to become operative only upon concurrence of the respondent's president.\n Amendment of the plan could be made only by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the full membership of the Joint Committee on Rules or of a majority of all the employes' representatives and all the representatives of the management, at an annual conference. The plan set forth that independence of action of elected representatives was guaranteed by permitting them to take questions of discrimination to any of the superior officers, to the Joint Committee, and to the president of the company. There was no provision for the payment of dues.\n The original plan was revised in 1929, 1931, 1934, 1936, and 1937\n\n\n By the 1931 revision, which was not materially altered until 1937, a General Joint Committee was set up in lieu of several joint committees theretofore constituted, and two representatives were to be elected by the employes in each department while the respondent was to appoint an equal number of management representatives, a majority of each class of representatives constituting a quorum. The annual remuneration to be paid elected representatives by the company was reduced to $60.00. The secretary of the General Joint Committee was paid $5.00 monthly by the company. An Executive Committee was also established constituted of five elected employe representatives and five representatives of management. \n\n[308 \nU.S. 241, 246]\n\u00a0\n Elections were arranged for by the management representatives but, in so far as possible, were conducted by the employes themselves.\n A procedure was established for the adjustment of individual employe grievances, whereby, in event of failure of settlement, notice was to be given to the president of the company. Under the revised plan the General Joint Committee met monthly to take action upon matters presented by the Management Representative or by employe representatives or subcommittees; but finality of the action of the General Joint Committee was dependent upon approval by the respondent's president. Amendment of the plan, which could be accomplished by a two-thirds vote of the entire General Joint Committee, became effective when approved by the president of the company.\n The last revision made in May 1937, after the validity of the National Labor Relations Act had been sustained by this court, originated in the General Joint Committee, one-half of whose members represented the interests of the respondent. The amended plan was referred to the Executive Committee, similarly constituted, and to the elected employe representatives, respectively. After announcement by the Management Representative that the revision was acceptable to the respondent it was adopted by the General Joint Committee. The personnel manager, and the general manager of the respondent, took part in the revision of the plan. The secretary of the Committee testified that this revision was undertaken in order to bring the plan within the letter, as well as within the spirit, of the Act.\n The two principal changes made were the elimination of payment of compensation by the respondent to elected representatives of the employes and the substitution of an Employes' Representative Committee, composed solely of employe representatives elected by employes, for the \n\n[308 \nU.S. 241, 247]\n\u00a0\n former General Joint Committee and the Joint Executive Committee. The revised plan provides that action of the Employes' Representative Committee 'shall be final and become effective upon agreement by the company'; and, further, that any article of the plan may be amended by a vote of two-thirds of the entire membership of the committee; and 'amendments shall be in effect at the time specified by the Employes' Representative Committee, unless disapproved by the company within fifteen days after their passage.'\n The grievance procedure permits the presentation of a grievance to the respondent's personnel manager, or its general manager, in the event no settlement has theretofore been effected.\n Upon the basis of these findings the Board concluded that, from the inception of the plan in 1927 until its final revision in 1937, the respondent dominated, assisted, and interfered with the administration of th labor organization; and that the method followed for amendment of the plan in 1937, and the provisions of the final revision, left the company still in the position of dominating and interfering in the formulation and administration of the plan, contrary to the provisions of Sec. 7 of the Act. The Board held that the Committee is, in the circumstances, incapable of serving the employes as their genuine representative for the purpose of collective bargaining.\n The respondent criticises several of the findings as without support or contrary to uncontradicted evidence. We do not stop to consider these contentions, since, without such findings, there would still be a basis in the record for the Board's conclusions.\n The principal contention of the respondent is that the Board ignored uncontradicted facts and refused to make findings respecting them. The Board replies that it did not ignore these facts, but omitted to find them because they were immaterial to the pivotal issues in the case. It \n\n[308 \nU.S. 241, 248]\n\u00a0\n is uncontradicted that labor disputes have repeatedly been settled under the plan; that since 1927 no labor dispute has caused cessation of activities at the respondent's plant; that overwhelming majorities of the employes have participated in the election of representatives; that the company has never objected to its employes joining labor unions; that no discrimination has been practiced against them because of their membership in outside unions; and that neither officials nor superior employes not eligible to vote in the election of employes' representatives, have interfered, or attempted to interfere, or use any influence, in connection with the election of representatives.\n Before the Board's decision and order had been promulgated a referendum was held at which a sweeping majority of the company's employes signified, by secret ballot, their satisfaction with the plan as revised in 1937 and their desire for its continuance. Counsel for the Committee requested the Board to certify these facts to the Circuit Court of Appeals as part of the record before the court. The Board, though not bound so to do, embodied these facts in a supplementary certificate. It now takes the position that the only proper way to bring these additional facts to the attention of the reviewing court would have been by application to the court to remand the cause for further findings, and as this was not done, the certificate was irregular and should not have been considered. We are unable to agree with this contention. We think the Circuit Court of Appeals cannot be convicted of error in accepting the Board's supplemental certificate.\n The Board urges that, notwithstanding the facts on which the respondent relies, the structure of the Committee, under the 1937 plan, renders the organization incompetent to meet the requirements of the National Labor Relations Act; and further that, if its fundamental \n\n[308 \nU.S. 241, 249]\n\u00a0\n law were free from defect, the history of its organization and administration would require that it be disestablished as the bargaining agency of the employes.\n Prior to the adoption of the Wagner Act the plan did not run counter to any federal law, either in conception or administration. The respondent, however, concedes that sundry features of the plan, as then formulated, conflict with the provisions of the statute. Both employer and employees so recognized when they undertook the revision of 1937 for the purpose of bringing the plan within the spirit and the letter of the Act.\n The Board has concluded that the provisions embodied in the final revision, whereby action of the Committee requires, for its effectiveness, the agreement of the company, and whereby amendment of the plan can become effective only if the company fails to signify its disapproval within fifteen days of adoption, still give the respondent such power of control that the plan is in the teeth of the expressed policy and the specific prohibitions of the Act. The respondent argues that these provisions affect only the company and not the employes; that, in collective bargaining, there is always reserved to the employer the right to qualify or to reject the propositions advanced by the employes. Whatever may be said of the first mentioned provision, this explanation will not hold for the second. The plan may not be amended if the company disapproves the amendment. Such control of the form and structure of an employe organization deprives the employes of the complete freedom of action guaranteed to them by the Act, and justifies an order such as was here entered. The court below, in its opinion, states it was advised in a brief after the hearing in that court, that the plan had been amended by striking out the provisions in question. It concludes, therefore, that their previous existence is immaterial. The statute expressly deprives the reviewing court of power to con- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 241, 250]\n\u00a0\n sider facts thus brought to its attention. The case must be heard on the record as certified by the Board. The appropriate procedure to add facts to the record as certified is prescribed in Section 10(e) of the Act.\n But we think that if the record disclosed such an alteration of the plan, the order of the Board could not be held erroneous. The Board held that, where an organization has existed for ten years and has functioned in the way that the Committee has functioned, with a joint control vested in management and men, the effects of the long practice cannot be eliminated and the employes rendered entirely free to act upon their own initiative without the complete disestablishment of the plan. On the record as made we cannot say this was error.\n While the men are free to adopt any form of organization and representation whether purely local or connected with a national body, their purpose so to do may be obstructed by the existence and recognition by the management of an old plan or organization the original structure or operation of which was not in accordance with the provisions of the law. Sec. 10(c) was not intended to give the Board power of punishment or retribution for past wrongs or errors. Action under that section must be limited to the effectuation of the policies of the Act. One of these is that the employes shall be free to choose such form of organization as they wish.\n As pointed out in National Labor Relations Board v. Pennsylvania Greyhound Lines, \n303 \nU.S. 261\n, 58 S.Ct. 571, 115 A.L.R. 307, disestablishment of a bargaining unit previously dominated by the employer may be the only effective way of wiping the slate clean and affording the employes an opportunity to start afresh in organizing for the adjustment of their relations with the employer. Compare National Labor Relations Board v. Fansteel Metallurgical Corp., \n306 \nU.S. 240, 262\n, 59 S.Ct. 490, 498, 123 A.L.R. 599. \n\n[308 \nU.S. 241, 251]\n\u00a0\n The court below agreed with the respondent that, as the Committee had operated to the apparent satisfaction of the employes; as serious labor disputes had not occurred during its existence; and as the men at an election held under the auspices of the Committee had signified their desire for its continuance, it would be a proper medium and one which the employer might continue to recognize for the adjustment of labor disputes. The difficulty with the position is that the provisions of the statute preclude such a disposition of the case. The law provides that an employe organization shall be free from interference or dominance by the employer. We cannot say that, upon the uncontradicted facts, the Board erred in its conclusion that the purpose of the law could not be attained without complete disestablishment of the existing organization which had been dominated and controlled to a greater or less extent by the respondent. In applying the statutory test of independence it is immaterial that the plan had in fact not engendered, or indeed had obviated, serious labor disputes in the past, or that any company interference in the administration of the plan had been incidental rather than fundamental and with good motives. It was for Congress to determine whether, as a matter of policy, such a plan should be permitted to continue in force. We think the statute plainly evinces a contrary purpose, and that the Board's conclusions are in accord with that purpose.\n The decree must be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings in conformity to this opinion. So ordered.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 8 N.L.R.B. 866. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 49 Stat. 449, 454, 29 U.S.C.Supp. IV, Sec. 160(c), 29 U.S.C.A.  160(c). \n[\nFootnote 3\n] The Committee was granted leave to intervene, produced evidence, and participated in the argument before the Board, and was heard in the court below and in this Court. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] 49 Stat. 449, 452, 29 U.S.C.Supp. IV, Sec. 157, 29 U.S.C.A.  157. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] 49 Stat. 449, 452, 29 U.S.C.Supp. IV, Sec. 158, 29 U.S.C.A.  158. \n[\nFootnote 6\n] The complaint also charged that the respondent had discharged certain employes for union activity and had thus violated Sec. 8(3) of the Act but the Board dismissed this charge. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] National Labor Relations Board v.

COLUMBIAN E. & STAMPING CO., INC.(1939)\nNo. 229\nArgued: Decided: February 27, 1939\n\n\n\n\n[306 \nU.S. 292, 293]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General, and Mr. Robert B. Watts, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Earl F. Reed, of Pittsburgh, Pa., for respondent Columbian Enameling & Stamping Co., Inc.\n Mr. Paul R. Shafer, of Terre Haute, Ind., for respondents Harry Hiatt and others.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This petition tests the validity of an order of the National Labor Relations Board of February 14, 1936, directing respondent to discharge from its service employees who were not employed by it on July 22, 1935; to reinstate, to the vacancies so created, those who were employed on that date and have not since received substantially equivalent employment elsewhere; and to desist from refusing to bargain collectively with Enameling and Stamping Mill Employees Union No. 19694 as the exclusive representative of respondent's production employees with respect to rates of pay, wages, hours, and other conditions of employment. Unless the finding of the Board that respondent had refused to bargain collectively with the Union on July 23, 1935, is sustained by the evidence, the order is invalid.\n Pursuant to a charge lodged with it by the Union, the Board issued its complaint charging respondent with un- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 292, 294]\n\u00a0\n fair labor practices affecting interstate commerce within the meaning of  8(1) and (5) of the National Labor Relations Act, 49 Stat. 449, 452, 29 U. S.C.A.  158(1, 5). After hearing, the Board made findings which, so far as now relevant, may be summarized as follows: Respondent corporation is engaged at Terre Haute, Indiana, in the manufacture and sale in interstate commerce of metal utensils and other products. On July 14, 1934, respondent and the Union entered into a written contract for one year, terminable on thirty days' notice, prescribing various conditions of employment. It provided that no employee should be discriminated against by reason of membership or non-membership in, or affiliation or non- affiliation with any union or labor organization. It also provided for arbitration, before an arbitration committee, of disputes arising under the contract, and that 'There shall be no stoppage of work by either party to this contract, pending decision by the Committee of Arbitration'.\n Between the date of the signing of the agreement, July 14, 1934, and March 23, 1935, respondent's officers held numerous meetings with representatives of the Union, usually the Union Scale Committee, for the consideration and adjustment of various demands of the Union. At a meeting on January 4, 1935, the committee presented a number of requests, among them the demand that respondent should discharge any employees who might be suspended by the Union. This and the other demands were rejected by respondent, and a later request that the demands of January 4th be arbitrated was likewise refused on the ground that they were not arbitrable under the agreement. The committee afterward presented new demands at other meetings and then at a meeting on March 11th renewed the demands of January 4th, which respondent again rejected. On March 17th the Union passed resolutions reciting grievances and demanding a closed shop, and on March 23d ordered a \n\n[306 \nU.S. 292, 295]\n\u00a0\n strike, when four hundred and fifty of respondent's five hundred employees left work. On March 30th respondent announced that its factory was closed indefinitely.\n The strike was in effect July 5, 1935, when the National Labor Relations Act was approved, and continued until about July 23d, when respondent resumed operations at its plant. By August 19th it had received three thousand applications for employment and had reemployed one hundred and ninety of its production employees. By the end of the second week in September respondent had employed a full force. On July 23d two labor conciliators from the Department of Labor appeared in Terre Haute and were requested by the Union 'to try and open up negotiations with the respondent'. On that day the conciliators met and conferred with respondent's president, who agreed to meet them with the Scale Committee. Several days later he informed them that he would not meet with them or with the Scale Committee. Later respondent received, but did not answer, letters of the Union of September 20th and October 11th, asking for a meeting to settle the controversy between them.\n The Board concluded that on July 23d the 'union represented a majority of the respondent's employees, that it sought to bargain with the respondent, that the respondent refused to so bargain, and that this constituted an unfair labor practice' within the meaning of  8, subdivision (5) of the Act. It ordered respondent to discharge all of its production employees who were not employed by it on July 22, 1935, to reinstate its employees as of that date, and thereupon to desist from refusing to bargain with the Union as the exclusive representative of respondent's production employees.\n Application by the Board for a decree enforcing its order was denied by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, 96 F.2d 948, on the ground that as \n\n[306 \nU.S. 292, 296]\n\u00a0\n the employees had struck before the enactment of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  151 et seq., in violation of their contract not to strike and to submit differences to arbitration, they did not retain and were not entitled to protection of their status as employees under  2(3) of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  152(3). We granted certiorari October 10, 1938, \n305 \nU.S. 583\n, 59 S.Ct. 86, 83 L.Ed. --, the questions presented with respect to the administration of the National Labor Relations Act being of public importance.\n The Board's order is without support unless the date of the refusal to bargain collectively be fixed as on July 23, 1935. The evidence and findings leave no doubt that later, in September, respondent ignored the Union's request for collective bargaining, but as at that time respondent's factory had been reopened and was operating with a full complement of production employees, the refusal to bargain could afford no basis for an order by the Board directing, as of that date, the discharge of new employees and their replacement by strikers. Restoration of the strikers to their employment, by order of the Board, under  10(c) of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  160(c), could as a practical matter be effected only if respondent had failed in its statutory duty to bargain collectively at some time after the approval of the National Labor Relations Act on July 5th, and before respondent had resumed normal operation of its factory. The date fixed by the Board was July 23d, when respondent reopened its factory, and the occasion was the personal interview on that day and a later telephone conversation of respondent's president with the conciliators from the Labor Department, who were not members or official representatives of the Union and who, so far as the testimony discloses, did not then appear to the president to be authorized to speak for the Union.\n In appraising these transactions between the conciliators and respondent's president, it is important to bear \n\n[306 \nU.S. 292, 297]\n\u00a0\n in mind the nature and extent of the legal duty imposed upon the employer by the National Labor Relations Act. Section 8(5) declares that it is an 'unfair labor practice' for an employer 'To refuse to bargain collectively with the representatives of his employees', and  2 and 10(c) give to the Board an extensive authority to order the employer to cease an unfair labor practice and to compel reinstatement of employees with back pay when employment has ceased in consequence of a labor dispute or unfair labor practice. See National Labor Relations Board v. Mackay Radio & Telegraph Co., \n304 \nU.S. 333\n, 58 S.Ct. 904. While the Act thus makes it the employer's duty to bargain with his employees, and failure to perform that duty entails serious consequences to him, it imposes no like duty on his employees. Since there must be at least two parties to a bargain and to any negotiations for a bargain, it follows that there can be no breach of the statutory duty by the employer-when he has not refused to receive communications from his employees-without some indication given to him by them or their representatives of their desire or willingness to bargain. In the normal course of transactions between them, willingness of the employees is evidenced by their request, invitation, or expressed desire to bargain, communicated to their employer.\n However desirable may be the exhibition by the employer of a tolerant and conciliatory spirit in the settlement of labor disputes, we think it plain that the statute does not compel him to seek out his employees or request their participation in negotiations for purposes of collective bargaining, and that he may ignore or reject proposals for such bargaining which come from third persons not purporting to act with authority of his employees, without violation of law and without suffering the drastic consequences which violation may entail. To put the employer in default here the employees must at \n\n[306 \nU.S. 292, 298]\n\u00a0\n least have signified to respondent their desire to negotiate. Measured by this test the Board's conclusion that respondent refused to bargain with the Union is without support, for the reason that there is no evidence that the Union gave to the employer, through the conciliators or otherwise, any indication of its willingness to bargain or that respondent knew that they represented the Union. The employer cannot, under the statute, be charged with refusal of that which is not proffered.\n During the eight months preceding the strike respondent had, upon request, entered into negotiations with the Union on some eleven different occasions. Such meetings, always with some known representatives of the Union, were customarily with the Union Scale Committee and on its written request. All negotiations were broken off by the Union by the strike which followed almost immediately its resolutions of March 17th. On July 23d the strike had continued for about four months, accompanied by picketing, violence and destruction of property, and had culminated, on July 22d, in a proclamation of martial law. A meeting on June 11th had resulted in no change of attitude on either side. From then until July 23d no attempt appears to have been made on either side to resume negotiations.\n While there was before the Board testimony of the secretary of the Union that on July 23d he had asked the conciliators to 'try and open up negotiations', there was no testimony that respondent or its officers had ever been informed of that fact or that they were advised in any way of the willingness of the Union to enter into negotiations. This was pointedly brought to the attention of the Board and the trial examiner by a motion to strike the testimony of the secretary and that of respondent's president, giving his account of his interview with the conciliators. But the conciliators were not called as witnesses and no attempt was made to supply the omission. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 292, 299]\n\u00a0\n Respondent's president testified that on July 23d the conciliators asked him if he would meet with them and the Scale Committee; that he replied that he would; that no meeting was arranged and that several days later he called one of the conciliators on the telephone and informed him that he, the witness, 'would not have any meeting with him or with the Scale Committee'. All else that took place between the conciliators and respondent is left a matter of conjecture.\n This testimony, on which the Board relies to support its finding, shows on its face that there was no indication until sometime later than July 23d of any unwillingness on the part of respondent's president to meet the Union. Furthermore, it contains no hint that the Union at any time after July 5th and before September communicated to respondent its willingness to bargain, or that the conciliators, in asking a meeting and discussing the matter with respondent's president, purported to speak for the Union. The testimony is consistent throughout with the inference, and indeed supports it, that the conciliator, so far as known to respondent, appeared in their official role as mediators to compose the long-standing dispute between respondent and its employees; that the employer first consented in advance to attend a meeting, and later withdrew its consent when they had failed for some days to arrange a meeting. Whether in the meantime the Scale Committee or any other representative of the Union was in fact willing to attend a meeting does not appear.\n Section 10(e) of the Act provides: '... The findings of the Board as to the facts, if supported by evidence, shall be conclusive'. But as has often been pointed out, this, as in the case of other findings by administrative bodies, means evidence which is substantial, that is, affording a substantial basis of fact from which the fact in issue can be reasonably inferred. Washington, Virginia & Maryland Coach Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, \n301 \nU.S. 142\n, 57 S.Ct. 648; Consolidated Edison Co. of New York v. National Labor Rela- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 292, 300]\n\u00a0\n tions Board, \n305 \nU.S. 197\n, 59 S.Ct. 206; Appalachian Electric Power Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, 4 Cir., 93 F.2d 985, 989; National Labor Relations Board v. Thompson Products Inc., 6 Cir., 97 F.2d 13; Ballston-Stillwater Knitting Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, 2 Cir., 98 F.2d 758, 764. Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, and must do more than create a suspicion of the existence of the fact to be established. 'It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion,' Consolidated Edison Co. of New York v. National Labor Relations Board, supra, 59 S.Ct. 217, and it must be enough to justify, if the trial were to a jury, a refusal to direct a verdict when the conclusion sought to be drawn from it is one of fact for the jury. See Baltimore & O.R.R. Co. v. Groeger, \n266 \nU.S. 521, 524\n, 45 S.Ct. 169, 170; Gunning v. Cooley, \n281 \nU.S. 90, 94\n, 50 S.Ct. 231, 233; Appalachian Electric Power Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, supra, page 989 of 93 F.2d.\n Judged by these tests or any of them we cannot say that there was substantial evidence that respondent at any time between July 5, 1935, and September, 1935, was aware that the Union desired or sought to bargain collectively with respondent, or that there is support in the evidence for the Board's conclusion that on or about July 23, 1935 respondent refused to bargain collectively with the Union.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK, dissenting.\n The Labor Board was given jurisdiction by Congress to hear and weigh evidence and to determine the inferences from it; to make findings of fact; and to issue orders necessary to effectuate the purposes of the National Labor Relations Act. In apt language, Congress \n\n[306 \nU.S. 292, 301]\n\u00a0\n limited the power of courts to review the Board's findings by providing in the Act that 'The findings of the Board as to the facts, if supported by evidence, shall be conclusive.'\n I believe that 'The inferences to be drawn were for the Board and not the courts,'1 and that the inferences drawn by the Board were supported by the evidence. Courts should not-as here-substitute their appraisal of the evidence for that of the Board.\n The Labor Board, the Federal Trade Commission, the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission and many other administrative agencies were all created to deal with problems of regulation of ever increasing complexity in the economic fields of trade, finance and industrial conflicts. Congress thus sought to utilize procedures more expeditious and administered by more specialized and experienced experts than courts had been able to afford. The decision here tends to nullify this Congressional effort.\n The Labor Board concluded that 'On or about July 23, 1935, the company refused to bargain collectively with the Union as the representatives of its employees, or at all, ....' This conclusion is here set aside only because the Court believes the evidence before the Board did not support its particular underlying finding that 'It seems clear that ... (the) president of the respondent, knew that the Union was seeking through the (Federal) conciliators to bargain with the respondent with respect to the settlement of the strike.'\n Undisputed evidence disclosed that on July 23, 1935, the conciliators- at the express instance of the Union-conferred for three or four hours with the president of respondent; that the only purpose of the conciliators \n\n[306 \nU.S. 292, 302]\n\u00a0\n was to arrange a meeting between the company and the Union in order to bring about collective bargaining; that the president agreed with the conciliators to meet the Union and the conciliators at a date to be set; but that several days thereafter (when the company had obtained other employees and was operating under the protection of the militia) the president--again acting for the company-called the conciliators and flatly refused to meet further with them or the Union. The Court finds only a single link missing in the chain of evidence showing that the company refused to bargain with the Union, i.e., that there was no evidence to justify the Board's finding that the president of the company was aware the conciliators had approached the company at the request of the Union. But the 'courts cannot pick and choose bits of evidence to make findings of fact contrary to the findings of' an administrative body. \n2\n And the story in this record discloses a broad basis for the inference that the company did know it was actually refusing the Union's request.\n For thirty-three years prior to July, 1934, the company ran a non- Union plant. About that date, a majority of the employees were organized by an affiliate of the American Federation of Labor. The company first refused to sign an agreement with the Union but did so, July 14, 1934, upon the intervention of the Regional Labor Board functioning under the National Industrial Recovery Act, 48 Stat. 195. This agreement was to continue a year, was subject to modification by mutual consent, and provided for arbitration of disputes arising under it. Thereafter, pursuant to the agreement, meetings were held between the Union and respondent and the Union submitted repeated re- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 292, 303]\n\u00a0\n quests and grievances, relating to the 'check-off' system, wage increases, the possibility of a closed shop, etc. These were refused and counter grievances of the company were submitted and discussed. In meetings and by mail, the Union continued to submit grievances-that back-pay accrued during shut-downs was owing, that the company was dealing with individual employees and in March, 1935, that the company by refusing to arbitrate had broken its agreement. March 22, the Union called a strike, the testimony showing that it was called 'on account of the company's refusal to honor and abide by the agreement signed before the Labor Board July 14, 1934 ... (as to) minimum days, wages, and any employee being called out and not used' and because the company had 'refused arbitration on this agreement.' Thereafter, the company closed its plant, consistently urged individual members of the Union to return to work and desert the Union's efforts-by strike-to obtain collective bargaining, and publicly announced that it would not meet with the members of the Union and that it was willing to take its individual employees back, but 'without Union recognition or agreement.' June 11, the company did meet with the Union's representatives but insured the impossibility of any successful collective bargaining by reiterating at the outset that the company would not recognize the Union. July 23, the Union asked the conciliators to see the president of the company.\n To conclude that the company-through its president-was unaware the conciliators were acting at the instance of the Union, and, therefore, is not to be held responsible for its flat refusal to meet with its employees, is both to ignore the record and to shut our eyes to the realities of the conditions of modern industry and industrial strife. The atmosphere of a strike between an employer and employees with whom the employer is familiar does not \n\n[306 \nU.S. 292, 304]\n\u00a0\n evoke, and should not require, punctilious observance of legalistic formalities and social exactness in discussions relative to the settlement of the strike. It is difficult to imagine that-during several hours of conversation between the conciliators and the company's president concerning a future meeting of Union and company-the conciliators refrained from reference to the Union's request that the conciliators arrange such a future meeting. In a realistic view, the company's statement of July 23 to the conciliators, that it would meet with them and the Union, clearly indicated the company's acceptance of the fact that the conciliators were appearing for the Union. The company's declaration to the conciliators, several days later, that it would not meet with the Union or the conciliators, equally represents the company's recognition and acceptance of the fact that the conciliators were a means of dealing with the Union.\n Not only did the Labor Board find the evidence sufficient to show that the company refused to bargain with the Union on or about July 23, but the court below reached the same conclusion. The rule is well settled that findings of fact concurred in by two lower courts will not 'be disturbed unless plainly without support.' \n3\n This rule equally applies when an administrative body and a lower court-as here-concur on findings of fact,4 and the rule is even more persuasive where, as in the Act creating the Labor Board, it is provided that 'The findings of the Board as to the facts, if supported by evidence, shall be conclusive.' The majority opinion5 of the Court of Appeals in this case said: \n\n[306 \nU.S. 292, 305]\n\u00a0\n 'This conclusion (refusal to enforce the Board's action) does not mean that we approve or uphold the refusal of the respondent to meet the request of the conciliators and enter into negotiations looking towards the settlement of disputes after the employees had quit their employment. Respondent's employees were largely unionized. Under the Act, respondent, when requested to negotiate, had a moral duty to do so. National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., \n301 \nU.S. 1\n, 57 S.Ct. 615, 108 A.L.R. 1352. Instead it lent a friendly ear to unwise counsel wholly out of sympathy with the legislation designed to avoid and settle capital-labor disputes. It erred in its refusal to respect that law and ... (ignored) the request of those charged with the burdensome task of working out a peaceful solution of what had become a bitter controversy. There is little or no explanation which we can find for their refusal, save an open defiant, flouting of the law of the land.' (96 F.2d 954.)\n Respondent's striking employees remained employees-while on strike- within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act (Sec. 2(3) because their work had ceased 'as the consequence of ... (and) in connection with ... (a) current labor dispute ....' The statutory rights of these striking employees could not be destroyed, and respondent could not commit unfair labor practices and then escape liability by reopening the plant with a full complement of non-Union men.\n Second. The court below was of opinion that the strike of March 22, 1953, violated the particular provision of the July 14, 1934, contract6 with the company that \n\n[306 \nU.S. 292, 306]\n\u00a0\n 'There shall be no stoppage of work by either party to this contract, pending decision by the Committee of Arbitration.' Solely because it believed the Union had violated its contract, the court below declined to enforce the Board's order, and held that the company could not be made responsible for its own violation of the Act.\n In this, I believe the court below was in error. A disagreement over the terms of a contract governing employer-employee relations is a labor dispute within the terms of the Act. Such a disagreement can-as it did here-produce industrial strife which the Act was expressly designed to prevent. Had Congress provided that violation of a private contract would deprive employees and the public of the benefits of the law, a different question would be presented. But Congress did not so provide and, in addition, the Union did not violate its contract. It contracted not to strike 'pending decision by the Committee of Arbitration' but there was no decision 'pending.' There was no arbitration pending because the company would not arbitrate. If the contract was broken, it was the company-not the Union-that broke it.\n I believe the judgment of the court below should be reversed and that the Board's order should be enforced.\n Mr. Justice REED joins in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] National Labor Relations Board v.

FAINBLATT(1939)\nNo. 514\nArgued: March 8, 1939Decided: April 17, 1939\n\n\n\n\n[306 \nU.S. 601, 602]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles Fahy, of Washington, D.C., and Frank Murphy, Atty. Gen., for petitioner.\n Mr. T. Girard Wharton, of Somerville, N.J., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This petition raises the question whether the National Labor Relations Act is applicable to employers, not themselves engaged in interstate commerce, who are engaged in a relatively small business of processing materials which are transmitted to them by the owners through the channels of interstate commerce and which after processing are distributed through those channels.\n Pursuant to  10(b) of the National Labor Relations Act, 49 Stat. 449, 29 U.S.C.  151 et seq., 29 U.S.C.A.  151 et seq., the National Labor Relations Board issued its complaint charging respondents with unfair labor practices in violation of  8(1), (3), (5) and  2(6), (7) of the Act. After a hearing, which resulted in a decision and order of the Board, a supplemental hearing was held pursuant to order of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which resulted in a supplemental decision and an order reaffirming the Board's original findings and conclusions of law and modifying the original order in one respect not now material.\n The facts, as found by the Board, are that respondents, under the name of Somerset Manufacturing Company, are engaged at Somerville, New Jersey, in the business of processing materials into various types of women's sports garments. They operate what is known as a 'contract shop'. The materials are supplied by and are the property of the Lee Sportswear Company, a partnership \n\n[306 \nU.S. 601, 603]\n\u00a0\n located in New York City. The cloth from which the garments are made is usually cut by the Lee Sportswear Company in New York City and then shipped by truck to respondents' factory in New Jersey. Sometimes the raw materials are shipped, on the order of the Lee Sportswear Company, directly from the mills manufacturing them, many of which are outside of New Jersey. All the materials are manufactured at respondents' New Jersey factory under contract. The finished garments are there delivered to a representative of the Lee Sportswear Company, who ships them to the company in New York City or directly to its customers throughout the United States.\n Throughout the year there is normally a continuous day-by-day flow of shipments of raw materials to respondents' factory from points without the state, and of finished garments from respondents' plant to New York City and other points outside of New Jersey. During the years 1934 and 1935 respondents appear to have finished more than a thousand dozen garments each month. In the course of the supplemental hearing in 1937 it appeared that respondents had increased their working force from sixty to approximately two hundred employees, from which the Board inferred a corresponding increase of output. Immediately preceding a strike of thirty- four of the workers in respondents' tailoring department, which occurred in September, 1935, and which the Board found to be induced by the unfair labor practices of respondents, shipments were about 80 per cent. of those for the corresponding period in 1934. Following the strike, output decreased by more than one-half, or to 38 per cent. of the shipments for the corresponding period in 1934\n\n\n The Board concluded that respondents' unfair labor practices had led and tended 'to lead to labor disputes burdening and obstructing commerce and the free flow of commerce'. Its order as modified directed respondents to desist from interfering with their employees' right to \n\n[306 \nU.S. 601, 604]\n\u00a0\n join a local union and from discouraging membership in the union by discharging them or discriminating against them in the terms of their employment, and it directed respondents to reinstate certain employees who had struck because of the unfair labor practices, some with back pay.\n The Board's petition for enforcement of its order was denied by the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, 98 F.2d 615, on the ground that respondents were not themselves engaged in interstate commerce and had no title or interest in the raw materials or finished products which moved to and from respondents' factory in New Jersey from and to points outside the state. We granted certiorari January 9, 1939, the question being one of public importance in the administration of the National Labor Relations Act, \n305 \nU.S. 594\n, 59 S.Ct. 362, 83 L.Ed. --.\n Only the question of the Board's jurisdiction is raised by the petition and in briefs and argument. It has been settled by repeated decisions of this Court that an employer may be subject to the National Labor Relations Act although not himself engaged in commerce. The end sought in the enactment of the statute was the prevention of the disturbance to interstate commerce consequent upon strikes and labor disputes induced or likely to be induced because of unfair labor practices named in the Act. That those consequences may ensue from strikes of the employees of manufacturers who are not engaged in interstate commerce where the cessation of manufacture necessarily results in the cessation of the movement of the manufactured product in interstate commerce, has been repeatedly pointed out by this Court.

National Labor Relations Board, \n305 \nU.S. 197\n, 59 S.Ct. 206. Long before the enactment of the National Labor Relations Act it had been many times held by this Court that the power of Congress extends to the protection of interstate commerce from interference or injury due to activities which are wholly intrastate. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Here interstate commerce was involved in the transportation of the materials to be processed across state lines to the factory of respondents and in the transportation of the finished product to points outside the state for distribution to purchasers and ultimate consumers. Whether shipments were made directly to respondents, as the Board found, or to a representative of Lee Sportswear Company at the factory, as respondents contend, is immaterial. It was not any the less interstate commerce because the transportation did not begin or end with the transfer of title of the merchandise transported. See Santa Cruz Packing Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, supra, 303 U.S. page 463, 58 S.Ct. page 658; cf. Gloucester Ferry Co. v. Pennsyl- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 601, 606]\n\u00a0\n vania, \n4 \nU.S. 196, 203\n, 5 S.Ct. 826, 827; Wabash, St. Louis & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Illinois, \n118 \nU.S. 557\n, 7 S.Ct. 4; Hanley v.

Transportation alone across state lines is commerce within the constitutional control of the national government and subject to the regulatory power of Congress. Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat 1; Champion v. Ames, \n188 \nU.S. 321\n, 23 S.Ct. 321.\n Nor do we think it important, as respondents seem to argue, that the volume of the commerce here involved, though substantial, was relatively small as compared with that in the cases arising under the National Labor Relations Act which have hitherto engaged our attention. The power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce is plenary and extends to all such commerce be it great or small. Hanley v. Kansas City Southern Ry. Co., supra. The exercise of Congressional power under the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. A.  1-7, 15 note, the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 730, the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C.A.  41 et seq., or the National Motor Vehicle Theft Act, 18 U.S.C.A.  408, has never been thought to be constitutionally restricted because in any particular case the volume of the commerce affected may be small. The amount of the commerce regulated is of special significance only to the extent that Congress may be taken to have excluded commerce of small volume from the operation of its regulatory measure by express provision or fair implication.\n The language of the National Labor Relations Act seems to make it plain that Congress has set no restrictions upon the jurisdiction of the Board to be determined or fixed exclusively by reference to the volume of interstate commerce involved. Section 2(6) defines commerce as 'trade, traffic, commerce, transportation, or communication among the several States', without reference to its volume, and declares in subsection (7) that 'The term 'affecting commerce' means in commerce, or burdening or obstructing commerce or the free flow of commerce, or \n\n[306 \nU.S. 601, 607]\n\u00a0\n having led or tending to lead to a labor dispute burdening or obstructing commerce or the free flow of commerce'. Section 10(a) confers on the Board authority 'to prevent any person from engaging in any unfair labor practice (listed in section 158) affecting commerce'.\n The Act on its face thus evidences the intention of Congress to exercise whatever power is constitutionally given to it to regulate commerce by the adoption of measures for the prevention or control of certain specified acts-unfair labor practices-which provoke or tend to provoke strikes or labor disturbances affecting interstate commerce. Given the other needful conditions, commerce may be affected in the same manner and to the same extent in proportion to its volume, whether it be great or small. Examining the Act in the light of its purpose and of the circumstances in which it must be applied we can perceive no basis for inferring any intention of Congress to make the operation of the Act depend on any particular volume of commerce effected more than that to which courts would apply the maxim de minimis.\n There are not a few industries in the United States which, though conducted by relatively small units, contribute in the aggregate a vast volume of interstate commerce. \n2\n Some, like the clothing industry, are extensively unionized and have had a long and tragic history of industrial strife. It is not to be supposed that Congress, in its attempted nationwide regulation of interstate commerce through the removal of the causes of industrial \n\n[306 \nU.S. 601, 608]\n\u00a0\n strife affecting it, intended to exclude such industries from the sweep of the Act. In this, as in every other case, the test of the Board's jurisdiction is not the volume of the interstate commerce which may be affected, but the existence of a relationship of the employer and his employees to the commerce such that, to paraphrase  10(a) in the light of constitutional limitations, unfair labor practices have led or tended to lead 'to a labor dispute burdening or obstructing commerce'.\n It is no longer open to question that the manufacturer who regularly ships his product in interstate commerce is subject to the authority conferred on the Board with respect to unfair labor practices whenever such practices on his part have led or tend to lead to labor disputes which threaten to obstruct his shipments. National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., supra; National Labor Relations Board v. Fruehauf Trailer Co., supra; National Labor Relations Board v. Friedman- Harry Marks Clothing Co., supra; Santa Cruz Packing Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, supra; Consolidated Edison Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, supra. We cannot say, other things being equal, that the tendency differs in kind, quantity or effect merely because the merchandise which the manufacturer ships, instead of being his own, is that of the consignee or his customers in other states. In either case commerce is in danger of being obstructed in the same way and to the same extent.\n Here, although respondents' manufacturing business is small, employing from sixty to two hundred employees, its product is regularly shipped in interstate commerce. The Board's finding that respondents' unfair labor practices have led and tend to lead to labor disputes burdening interstate commerce and interfering with its free flow is supported by the evidence. Moreover, the Board has found specifically that respondents' unfair labor practices in attempting to prevent the unionization of their factory \n\n[306 \nU.S. 601, 609]\n\u00a0\n did in fact lead to a strike in respondents' tailoring establishment, with a consequent reduction of about 50 per cent. in respondents' output. These findings are not challenged.\n The threatened consequences to interstate commerce are as immediate and as certain to flow from respondents' unfair labor practices as were those which were held to result from unfair labor practices in National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., supra; National Labor Relations Board v. Fruehauf Trailer Co., supra; National Labor Relations Board v. Friedman-Harry Marks Clothing Co., supra; Santa Cruz Packing Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, supra; Consolidated Edison Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, supra. That the volume of commerce affected is smaller than in other cases in which the jurisdiction of the Board has been upheld, for reasons already stated, is in itself without significance.\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS (dissenting).\n Mr. Justice BUTLER and I conclude that the challenged judgment should be affirmed.\n Respondent, Benjamin Fainblatt, as sole owner, conducts a small plant for manufacturing wearing apparel located at Somerville, New Jersey, where he employs some sixty women. There he receives material belonging to Lee Sportswear Company of New York and under contract converts this into garments. These are delivered to the company's representative and payment is made for the work done. The owner sends the finished products to New York.\n The Labor Board claims jurisdiction in respect of employment at this establishment upon the theory that the material and garments move in interstate commerce; \n\n[306 \nU.S. 601, 610]\n\u00a0\n that disapproved labor practices there may lead to disputes; that these may cause a strike; that this may reduce the factory output; that because of such reduction less goods may move across the state lines; and thus there may come about interference with the free flow of commerce between the states which Congress has power to regulate. So, it is said, to prevent this possible result Congress may control the relationship between the employer and those employed. Also, that the size of the establishment's normal out-put is of minor or no importance. If the plant presently employed only one woman who stitched one skirt during each week which the owner regularly accepted and sent to another state, Congressional power would extent to the enterprise, according to the logic of the Court's opinion.\n Manifestly if such attenuated reasoning-possibility massed upon possibility-suffices, Congress may regulate wages, hours, out-put, prices, etc., whenever any product of employed labor is intended to pass beyond state lines-possibly if consumed next door. Producers of potatoes in Maine, peanuts in Virginia, cotton in Georgia, minerals in Colorado, wheat in Dakota, oranges in California, and thousands of small local enterprises become subject to national direction through a Board.\n Of course, no such result was intended by those who framed the Constitution. If the possibility of this had been declared the Constitution could not have been adopted. So construed, the power to regulate interstate commerce brings within the ambit of federal control most if not all activities of the Nation; subjects states to the will of Congress; and permits disruption of our federated system.\n Kidd v. Pearson, 1888, \n128 \nU.S. 1, 20\n, 21 S., 9 S.Ct. 6, 9, 10, 11, lucidly pointed out the necessary result of this subversive doctrine, showed how it had long been authoritatively rejected, and demonstrated its utter absurdity. A few \n\n[306 \nU.S. 601, 611]\n\u00a0\n paragraphs from that opinion may quicken estimation of what now impends.\n'We think the construction contended for by plaintiff in error would extend the words of the grant to congress, in the constitution, beyond their obvious import, and is inconsistent with its objects and scope. The language of the grant is, 'Congress shall have power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states,' etc. These words are used without any veiled or obscure signification. 'As men whose intentions require no concealment generally employ the words which most directly and aptly express the ideas they tend to convey, the enlightened patriots who framed our constitution, and the people who adopted it, must be understood to have employed words in their natural sense, and to have intended what they have said.' Gibbons v. Ogden, supra, (9 Wheat. 1, 188).\n\n'No distinction is more popular to the common mind, or more clearly expressed in economic and political literature, than that between manufacturers and commerce. Manufacture is transformation-the fashioning of raw materials into a change of form for use. The functions of commerce are different. The buying and selling and the transportation incidental thereto constitute commerce; and the regulation of commerce in the constitutional sense embraces the regulation at least of such transportation. The legal definition of the term, as given by this court in County of Mobile v. Kimball, \n102 \nU.S. 691\n, 702 (26 L.Ed. 238), is as follows: Commerce with foreign countries, and among the states, strictly considered, consists in intercourse and traffic, including in these terms navigation and the transportation and transit of persons and property, as well as the purchase, sale, and exchange of commodities.' If it be held that the term includes the regulation of all such manufactures as are intended to be the subject of commercial transactions in the future, it is impossible to deny \n\n[306 \nU.S. 601, 612]\n\u00a0\n that it would also include all productive industries that contemplate the same thing. The result would be that congress would be invested, to the exclusion of the states, with the power to regulate, not only manufacture, but also agriculture, horticulture, stock-raising, domestic fisheries, mining,-in short, every branch of human industry. For is there one of them that does not contemplate, more or less clearly, an interstate or foreign market? Does not the wheat-grower of the northwest, and the cotton planter of the south, plant, cultivate, and harvest his crop with an eye on the prices at Liverpool, New York, and Chicago? The power being vested in congress and denied to the states, it would follow as an inevitable result that the duty would devolve on congress to regulate all of these delicate, multiform, and vital interests,-interests which in their nature are, and must be, local in all the details of their successful management.'\n\n The doctrine approved in Kidd v. Pearson has been often applied. It was the recognized view of this Court for more than a hundred years.\n United States v. E. C. Knight Co., 1895, \n156 \nU.S. 1, 16\n, 15 S.Ct. 249, 255, declared-'Slight reflection will show that, if the national power extends to all ... productive industries, whose ultimate result may affect external commerce, comparatively little of business operations and affairs would be left for state control.'\n Oliver Iron Mining Co. v. Lord, 1923, \n262 \nU.S. 172, 178\n, 43 S.Ct. 526, 529-'Mining is not interstate commerce, but like manufacturing, is a local business, subject to local regulation and taxation. ... Its character in this regard is intrinsic, is not affected by the intended use or disposal of the product, is not controlled by contractual engagements, and persists even though the business be conducted in close connection with interstate commerce.'\n Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 1935, \n295 \nU.S. 495, 546\n, 548 S., 549, 550, 55 S.Ct. 837, 850, 851, 97 A.L.R. 947- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 601, 613]\n\u00a0\n 'If the commerce clause were construed to reach all enterprises and transactions which could be said to have an indirect effect upon interstate commerce, the federal authority would embrace practically all the activities of the people, and the authority of the state over its domestic concerns would exist only by sufferance of the federal government . ... The distinction between direct and indirect effects of intrastate transactions upon interstate commerce must be recognized as a fundamental one, essential to the maintenance of our constitutional system. ... If the federal government may determine the wages and hours of employees in the internal commerce of a state ... it would seem that a similar control might be exerted over other elements of cost, also affecting prices, such as the number of employees, rents, advertising, methods of doing business, etc. All the processes of production and distribution that enter into cost could likewise be controlled. ... But the authority of the federal government may not be pushed to such an extreme as to destroy the distinction, which the commerce clause itself establishes, between commerce 'among the several States' and the internal concerns of a state . ... The recuperative efforts of the federal government must be made in a manner consistent with the authority granted by the Constitution.'\n Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 1936, \n298 \nU.S. 238, 303\n, 309 S., 56 S.Ct. 855, 869, 872-'Plainly, the incidents leading up to and culminating in the mining of coal do not constitute such intercourse. The employment of men, the fixing of their wages, hours of labor, and working conditions, the bargaining in respect of these things-whether carried on separately or collectively-each and all constitute intercourse for the purposes of production, not of trade. ... The government's contentions in defense of the labor provisions are really disposed of adversely by our decision in the \n\n[306 \nU.S. 601, 614]\n\u00a0\n Schechter case. ... There is no basis in law or reason for applying different rules to the two situations.'\n The present decision and the reasoning offered to support it will inevitably intensify bewilderment. The resulting curtailment of the independence reserved to the states and the tremendous enlargement of federal power denote the serious impairment of the very foundation of our federated system. Perhaps the change of direction, no longer capable of concealment, will give potency to the efforts of those who apparently hope to end a system of government found inhospitable to their ultimate designs. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] It may prohibit wholly intrastate activities which, if permitted, would result in restraint of interstate commerce.

FANSTEEL METALLURGICAL CORP.(1939)\nNo. 436\nArgued: Decided: February 27, 1939\n\n\n\n\n[306 \nU.S. 240, 241]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General, and Mr. Charles Fahy, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[306 \nU.S. 240, 244]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Max Swiren, of Chicago, Ill., for respondent.\n\n\n[306 \nU.S. 240, 247]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals set aside an order of the National Labor Relations Board requiring respondent to desist from labor practices found to be in violation of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  151 et seq., and to offer reinstatement to certain discharged employees with back pay. While the other portions of the Board's order are under review, the principal question presented relates to the authority of the Board to require respondent to reinstate employees who were discharged because of their unlawful conduct in seizing respondent's property in what is called a 'sit-down strike'.\n Respondent, Fansteel Metallurgical Corporation, is engaged at North Chicago, Illinois, in the manufacture and sale of products made from rare metals. No question is raised as to the intimate relation of its operations to interstate commerce or the effect upon that commerce of the unfair labor practices with which the corporation is charged. The findings of the Board show that in the summer of 1936 a group of employees organized Lodge 66 under the auspices of a committee of the Amalgamated Association of Iron, Steel and Tin Workers of North America; that respondent employed a 'labor spy' to engage in espionage within the Union and his employment was continued until about December 1, 1936; that on September 10, 1936, respondent's superintendent was requested to meet with a committee of the union and the superintendent required that the committee should con- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 240, 248]\n\u00a0\n sist only of employees of five years' standing; that a committee, so constituted, presented a contract relating to working conditions; that the superintendent objected to 'closed-shop and check-off provisions' and announced that it was respondent's policy to refuse recognition to 'outside' unions; that on September 21, 1936, the superintendent refused to confer with the committee in which an 'outside' organizer had been included; that meanwhile, and later, respondent's representatives sought to have a 'company union' set up but the attempt proved abortive; that from November, 1936, to January, 1937, the superintendent required the president of the Union to work in a room adjoining the superintendent's office with the purpose of keeping him away from the other workers; that while in September, 1936, the Union did not have a majority of the production and maintenance employees, an appropriate unit for collective bargaining, by February 17, 1937, 155 of respondent's 229 employees in that unit had joined the Union and had designated it as their collective bargaining representative; that on that date, a committee of the Union met twice with the superintendent who refused to bargain with the Union as to rates of pay, hours and conditions of employment, the refusal being upon the ground that respondent would not deal with an 'outside' union.\n Shortly after the second meeting in the afternoon of February 17th the Union committee decided upon a 'sit-down strike' by taking over and holding two of respondent's 'key' buildings. These were thereupon occupied by about 95 employees. Work stopped and the remainder of the plant also ceased operations. Employees who did not desire to participate were permitted to leave, and a number of Union members who were on the night shift and did not arrive for work until after the seizure did not join their fellow members inside the buildings. At about six o'clock in the evening the superintendent, \n\n[306 \nU.S. 240, 249]\n\u00a0\n accompanied by police officials and respondent's counsel, went to each of the buildings and demanded that the men leave. They refused and respondent's counsel 'thereupon announced in loud tones that all the men in the plant were discharged for the seizure and retention of the buildings'. The men continued to occupy the buildings until February 26, 1937. Their fellow members brought them food, blankets, stoves, cigarettes and other supplies.\n On February 18th, respondent obtained from the state court an injunction order requiring the men to surrender the premises. The men refused to obey the order and a writ of attachment for contempt was served on February 19th. Upon the men's refusal to submit, a pitched battle ensued and the men successfully resisted the attempt by the sheriff to evict and arrest them. Efforts at mediation on the part of the United States Department of Labor and the Governor of Illinois proved unavailing. On February 26th the sheriff with an increased force of deputies made a further attempt and this time, after another battle, the men were ousted and placed under arrest. Most of them were eventually fined and given jail sentences for violating the injunction.\n Respondent on regaining possession undertook to resume operations and production gradually began. By March 12th the restaffing was approximately complete. A large number of the strikers, including many who had participated in the occupation of the buildings, were individually solicited to return to work with back pay but without recognition of the Union. Some accepted the offer and were reinstated; others refused to return unless there were union recognition and mass reinstatement and were still out at the time of the hearing before the Board. New men were hired to fill the positions of those remaining on strike.\n Meanwhile the Union was not inactive. On March 3d and 5th there were requests, which respondent refused, \n\n[306 \nU.S. 240, 250]\n\u00a0\n for meetings to consider the recognition of the Union for collective bargaining. There was no collective request for reinstatement of all the strikers. The position of practically all the strikers who did not go back, and who were named in the complaint filed with the Board, was 'that they were determined to stay out until the Union reached a settlement with the respondent'.\n Early in April a labor organization known as Rare Metal Workers of America, Local No. 1, was organized among respondent's employees. There was a meeting in one of respondent's buildings on April 15th, which was attended by about 200 employees and the balloting resulted in a vote of 185 to 15 in favor of the formation of an 'independent' organization. Another meeting was held soon after for the election of officers. Respondent accorded these efforts various forms of support. The Board concluded that the Rare Metal Workers of America, Local No. 1, was the result of the respondent's 'anti-union campaign' and that respondent had dominated and interfered with its formation and administration.\n Upon the basis of these findings and its conclusions of law, the Board made its order directing respondent to desist from interfering with its employees in the exercise of their right to self-organization and to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing as guaranteed in Section 7 of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  157; from dominating or interfering with the formation or administration of the Rare Metal Workers of America, Local No. 1, or any other labor organization of its employees or contributing support thereto; and from refusing to bargain collectively with the Amalgamated Association of Iron, Steel and Tin Workers of North America, Lodge 66, as the exclusive representative of the employees described. The Board also ordered the following affirmative action which it was found would 'effectuate the policies' of the Act;-that is, upon request, to bargain collectively with the Amal- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 240, 251]\n\u00a0\n gamated Association as stated above; to offer, upon application, to the employees who went on strike on February 17, 1937, and thereafter, 'immediate and full reinstatement to their former positions', with back pay, dismissing, if necessary, all persons hired since that date; to withdraw all recognition from Rare Metal Workers of America, Local No. 1, as a representative of the employees for the purpose of dealing with respondent as to labor questions and to 'completely disestablish' that organization as such representative; and to post notices of compliance. 5 N.L.R.B. 930.\n The Board found that respondent had not engaged in unfair labor practices by 'discrimination in regard to hire or tenure of employment' in order to 'encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization', and accordingly the complaint under Section 8(3) of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  158(3), was dismissed. Id.\n On respondent's petition, the Circuit Court of Appeals set aside the Board's order (7 Cir., 98 F.2d 375) and this Court granted certiorari, \n305 \nU.S. 590\n, 59 S.Ct. 230, 83 L.Ed. --, November 21, 1938\n\n\n First.-The unfair labor practices. The Board concluded that byy 'the anti-union statements and actions' of the superintendent on September 10, 1936, and September 21, 1936, by 'the campaign to introduce into the plant a company union', by 'the isolation of the union president from contact with his fellow employees', and by the employment and use of a 'labor spy', respondent had interfered with its employees, and restrained and coerced them, in the exercise of their right to self-organization guaranteed in Section 7 of the Act and thus had engaged in an unfair labor practice under Section 8(1) of the Act.\n Owing to the fact that in September, 1936, the Union did not have a majority of the employees in the appropriate unit, the Board held that it was precluded from finding unfair labor practices in refusing to bargain collectively at that time, but the Board found that there \n\n[306 \nU.S. 240, 252]\n\u00a0\n was such a refusal on February 17, 1937, when the Union did have a majority of the employees in the appropriate unit, and that this constituted a violation of Section 8(5).\n These conclusions are supported by the findings of the Board and the latter in this relation have substantial support in the evidence.\n Second.-The discharge of the employees for illegal conduct in seizing and holding respondent's buildings. The Board does not now contend that there was not a real discharge on February 17th when the men refused to surrender possession. The discharge was clearly proved.\n Nor is there any basis for dispute as to the cause of the discharge. Representatives of respondent demanded that the men leave and on their refusal announced that they were discharged 'for the seizure and retention of the buildings'. The fact that it was a general announcement applicable to all the men in the plant who thus refused to leave does not detract from the effect of the discharge either in fact or in law.\n Nor is it questioned that the seizure and retention of respondent's property were unlawful. It was a high-handed proceeding without shadow of legal right. It became the subject of denunciation by the state court under the state law, resulting in fines and jail sentences for defiance of the court's order to vacate and in a final decree for respondent as the complainant in the injunction suit.\n This conduct on the part of the employees manifestly gave good cause for their discharge unless the National Labor Relations Act abrogates the right of the employer to refuse to retain in his employ those who illegally take and hold possession of his property.\n Third.-The authority of the Board to require the reinstatement of the employees thus discharged. The contentions of the Board in substance are these: (1) That \n\n[306 \nU.S. 240, 253]\n\u00a0\n the unfair labor practices of respondent led to the strike and thus furnished ground for requiring the reinstatement of the strikers; (2) That under the terms of the Act employees who go on strike because of an unfair labor practice retain their status as employees and are to be considered as such despite discharge for illegal conduct; (3) That the Board was entitled to order reinstatement or reemployment in order to 'effectuate the policies' of the Act.\n\n\n (1)\n For the unfair labor practices of respondent the Act provided a remedy. Interference in the summer and fall of 1936 with the right of self- organization could at once have been the subject of complaint to the Board. The same remedy was available to the employees when collective bargaining was refused on February 17, 1937. But reprehensible as was that conduct of the respondent, there is no ground for saying that it made respondent an outlaw or deprived it of its legal rights to the possession and protection of its property. The employees had the right to strike but they had no license to commit acts of violence or to seize their employer's plant. We may put on one side the contested questions as to the circumstances and extent of injury to the plant and its contents in the efforts of the men to resist eviction. The seizure and holding of the buildings was itself a wrong apart from any acts of sabotage. But in its legal aspect the ousting of the owner from lawful possession is not essentially different from an assault upon the officers of an employing company, or the seizure and conversion of its goods, or the despoiling of its property or other unlawful acts in order to force compliance with demands. To justify such conduct because of the existence of a labor dispute or of an unfair labor practice would be to put a premium on resort to force instead of legal remedies and to subvert the principles of law and order which lie at the foundations of society. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 240, 254]\n\u00a0\n As respondent's unfair labor practices afforded no excuse for the seizure and holding of its buildings, respondent had its normal rights of redress. Those rights, in their most obvious scope, included the right to discharge the wrongdoers from its employ. To say that respondent could resort to the state court to recover damages or to procure punishment, but was powerless to discharge those responsible for the unlawful seizure, would be to create an anomalous distinction for which there is no warrant unless it can be found in the terms of the National Labor Relations Act. We turn to the provisions which the Board invokes.\n\n\n (2)\n In construing the Act in National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation, \n301 \nU.S. 1, 45\n, 46 S., 57 S.Ct. 615, 628, 108 A.L.R. 1352, we said that it 'does not interfere with the normal exercise of the right of the employer to select its employees or to discharge them'; that the employer 'may not, under cover of that right, intimidate or coerce its employees with respect to their self-organization and representation, and, on the other hand, the Board is not entitled to make its authority a pretext for interference with the right of discharge when that right is exercised for other reasons than such intimidation and coercion'. See, also, Associated Press v. National Labor Relations Board, \n301 \nU.S. 103, 132\n, 57 S.Ct. 650, 655. Compare Texas & New Orleans R.R. Co. v. Brotherhood of Ry. & S. S. Clerks, \n281 \nU.S. 548, 571\n, 50 S.Ct. 427, 434; Virginian Railway Co. v. System Federation No. 40, \n300 \nU.S. 515, 559\n, 57 S.Ct. 592, 605.\n It is apparent under that construction of the Act that had there been no strike, and employees had been guilty of unlawful conduct in seizing or committing depredations upon the property of their employer, that conduct would have been good reason for discharge, as discharge on that ground would not be for the purpose of intimidating or coercing employees with respect to their right of self-organization or representation, or because of any lawful \n\n[306 \nU.S. 240, 255]\n\u00a0\n union activity, but would rest upon an independent and adequate basis.\n But the Board, in exercising its authority under Section10(c), 29 U.S. C.A.  160(c), to reinstate 'employees', insists that here the status of the employees was continued, despite discharge for unlawful conduct, by virtue of the definition of the term 'employee' in Section 2(3), 29 U.S.C. A.  152(3). By that definition the term includes 'any individual whose work has ceased as a consequence of, or in connection with, any current labor dispute or because of any unfair labor practice, and who has not obtained any other regular and substantially equivalent employment, ...'.\n We think that the argument misconstrues the statute. We are unable to conclude that Congress intended to compel employers to retain persons in their employ regardless of their unlawful conduct,-to invest those who go on strike with an immunity from discharge for acts of trespass or violence against the employer's property, which they would not have enjoyed had they remained at work. Apart from the question of the constitutional validity of an enactment of that sort, it is enough to say that such a legislative intention should be found in some definite and unmistakable expression. We find no such expression in the cited provision.\n We think that the true purpose of Congress is reasonably clear. Congress was intent upon the protection of the right of employees to self- organization and to the selection of representatives of their own choosing for collective bargaining without restraint or coercion. National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation, supra, page 33, 57 S.Ct. page 622. To assure that protection, the employer is not permitted to discharge his employees because of union activity or agitation for collective bargaining. Associated Press v. National Labor Relations Board, supra. The conduct thus protected is lawful conduct. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 240, 256]\n\u00a0\n Congress also recognized the right to strike,-that the employees could lawfully cease work at their own volition because of the failure of the employer to meet their demands. Section 13 provides that nothing in the Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  163, 'shall be construed so as to interfere with or impede or diminish in any way the right to strike'. But this recognition of 'the right to strike' plainly contemplates a lawful strike,-the exercise of the unquestioned right to quit work. As we said in National Labor Relations Board v. Mackay Radio & Telegraph Company, \n304 \nU.S. 333, 347\n, 58 S.Ct. 904, 911, 'if men strike in connection with a current labor dispute their action is not to be construed as a renunciation of the employment relation and they remain employees for the remedial purposes specified in the act'. There is thus abundant opportunity for the operation of Section 2(3) without construing it as countenancing lawlessness or as intended to support employees in acts of violence against the employer's property by making it impossible for the employer to terminate the relation upon that independent ground.\n Here the strike was illegal in its inception and prosecution. As the Board found, it was initiated by the decision of the Union committee 'to take over and hold two of the respondent's 'key' buildings'. It was pursuant to that decision that the men occupied the buildings and the work stopped. This was not the exercise of 'the right to strike' to which the Act referred. It was not a mere quitting of work and statement of grievances in the exercise of pressure recognized as lawful. It was an illegal seizure of the buildings in order to prevent their use by the employer in a lawful manner and thus by acts of force and violence to compel the employer to submit. When the employees resorted to that sort of compulsion they took a position outside the protection of the statute and accepted the risk of the termination of their employment \n\n[306 \nU.S. 240, 257]\n\u00a0\n upon grounds aside from the exercise of the legal rights which the statute was designed to conserve.\n\n\n (3)\n The Board contends that its order is valid under the terms of the Act 'regardless of whether the men remained employees'. The Board bases its contention on the general authority, conferred by Section 10(c), to require the employer to take such affirmative action as will 'effectuate the policies' of the Act. Such action, it is argued, may embrace not only reinstatement of those whose status as employees has been continued by virtue of Section 2(3), but also a requirement of the 'reemployment' of those who have ceased to be employed.\n The authority to require affirmative action to 'effectuate the policies' of the Act is broad but it is not unlimited. It has the essential limitations which inhere in the very policies of the Act which the Board invokes. Thus in Consolidated Edison Company v. National Labor Relations Board, \n305 \nU.S. 197\n, 59 S.Ct. 206, decided December 5, 1938, we held that the authority to order affirmative action did not go so far as to confer a punitive jurisdiction enabling the Board to inflict upon the employer any penalty it may choose because he is engaged in unfair labor practices, even though the Board is of the opinion that the policies of the Act may be effectuated by such an order. We held that the power to command affirmative action is remedial, not punitive, and is to be exercised in aid of the Board's authority to restrain violations and as a means of removing or avoiding the consequences of violation where those consequences are of a kind to thwart the purposes of the Act.\n We repeat that the fundamental policy of the Act is to safeguard the rights of self-organization and collective bargaining, and thus by the promotion of industrial peace to remove obstructions to the free flow of commerce as defined in the Act. There is not a line in the statute to warrant the conclusion that it is any part of the policies \n\n[306 \nU.S. 240, 258]\n\u00a0\n of the Act to encourage employees to resort to force and violence in defiance of the law of the land. On the contrary, the purpose of the Act is to promote peaceful settlements of disputes by providing legal remedies for the invasion of the employees' rights. Elections may be ordered to decide what representatives are desired by the majority of employees in appropriate units as determined by the Board. To secure the prevention of unfair labor practices by employers, complaints may be filed and heard and orders made. The affirmative action that is authorized is to make these remedies effective in the redress of the employees' rights, to assure them self-organization and freedom in representation, not to license them to commit tortious acts or to protect them from the appropriate consequences of unlawful conduct. We are of the opinion that to provide for the reinstatement or reemployment of employees guilty of the acts which the Board finds to have been committed in this instance would not only not effectuate any policy of the Act but would directly tend to make abortive its plan for peaceable procedure.\n What we have said also meets the point that the question whether reinstatement or reemployment would effectuate the policies of the Act is committed to the decision of the Board in the exercise of its discretion subject only to the limitation that its action may not be 'arbitrary, unreasonable or capricious'. The Board recognizes that in 'many situations' reinstatement or reemployment after discharge for illegal acts would not be proper, but the Board insists that it was proper in this instance. For the reasons we have given we disagree with that view. We think that a clearer case could hardly be presented and that, whatever discretion may be deemed to be committed to the Board, its limits were transcended by the order under review. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 240, 259]\n\u00a0\n The Board stresses the fact that, when respondent was able to obtain possession of its buildings and to resume operations, it offered reemployment to many of the men who had participated in the strike. The contention confuses what an employer may voluntarily and legally do in the exercise of his right of selection and what the Board is entitled to compel. In announcing the reopening respondent stated its belief that a large number of men who had taken part in the seizure of the plant were compelled to do so through coercion and intimidation and that applications for reemployment from such men would receive favorable consideration. The Board challenges the statement that respondent limited its rehiring to such applicants. The Board points to evidence showing that everyone who applied for reemployment during the period of restaffing was taken back without condition except two employees who were advanced in years and were not reinstated solely for that reason, and to the testimony of the superintendent that at least thirty-seven were rehired 'who had been in the sit-down'.\n We find it unnecessary to consider in detail the respective contentions as to respondent's offer of reemployment, for we think that its action did not alter the unlawful character of the strike or respondent's rights in that aspect. The important point is that respondent stood absolved by the conduct of those engaged in the 'sit-down' from any duty to reemploy them, but respondent was nevertheless free to consider the exigencies of its business and to offer reemployment if it chose. In so doing it was simply exercising its normal right to select its employees.\n Fourth.-The requirement of reinstatement of employees who aided and abetted those who seized and held the buildings. There is a group of fourteen persons in this class who were not within the buildings and hence do not appear to have been within the announcement of dis- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 240, 260]\n\u00a0\n charge, but who went on strike and fall within the order for reinstatement. The Board made no separate findings with respect to these particular persons and refers us to the evidence to show their relation to the transactions under review. This, however, sufficiently appears in the stipulation of facts, to which the Board was a party, naming in paragraph 12 these fourteen persons and describing their conduct as follows:\n'All of the following men were employees of the company on February 17, 1937, but did not participate in the seizure and retention of the building, but aided and abetted the men within the said buildings 3 and 5 in the retention of the said buildings by soliciting, procuring and delivering of food, bedding, cigarettes, stoves, or other supplies, or in some other manner, and thereby assisted the said men in buildings 3 and 5 to remain therein contrary to the injunctional order and writ of injunction heretofore mentioned; that all of the said men named in this paragraph had actual knowledge of the issuance of the said injunctional order and writ of injunction ordering and directing the men in buildings 3 and 5 to vacate the same, and that their activities in aiding and abetting the men in buildings 3 and 5 were done with a view to and for the purpose of assisting the said men to remain in the said buildings after the issuance of the said injunctional order and writ of injunction and with knowledge thereof. None of the men named in this paragraph were discharged by the company on February 17, 1937, or thereafter, and none of these men were recalled to work by the company upon the resumption of plant operations shortly after February 26th, 1937:' (the names follow)\n\n It cannot be said that independently of the Act respondent was bound to reinstate those who had thus aided and abetted the 'sit-down' strikers in defying the court's order. If it be assumed that by virtue of Section 2( 3) \n\n[306 \nU.S. 240, 261]\n\u00a0\n they still had the status of 'employees', that provision did not automatically provide reinstatement. Whether the Board could order it must turn on the application of the provision empowering the Board to require 'such affirmative action, including reinstatement of employees' as will 'effectuate the policies' of the Act. We are thus returned to the question already discussed and we think that in that respect these aiders and abettors, likewise guilty of unlawful conduct, are in no better case than the 'sit-down' strikers themselves. We find no ground for concluding that there is any policy of the Act which justifies the Board in ordering reinstatement in such circumstances.\n Fifth.-There are nine other persons apparently embraced within the order of reinstatement as to which respondent interposes special objections. As to seven, respondent objects to the reinstatement upon the ground that they were inefficient and that no showing of union activity by any of them was made. As to two others, respondent contends that they refused its request to return to work without any conditions and that their places were accordingly filled.\n With respect to these nine persons, and to a miscellaneous group of five others including three as to whom the trial examiner recommended dismissal of the complaint, the Board has not supplied specific findings upon the points in controversy to sustain its order.\n We are of the opinion that the Circuit Court of Appeals did not err in setting aside the requirement of reinstatement.\n Sixth.-The reqirement that respondent shall bargain collectively with Lodge 66 of the Amalgamated Association as the exclusive representative of the employees in the described unit.\n Respondent resumed work about March 12, 1937. The Board's order was made on March 14, 1938. In view of \n\n[306 \nU.S. 240, 262]\n\u00a0\n the change in the situation by reason of the valid discharge of the 'sit- down' strikers and the filling of positions with new men, we see no basis for a conclusion that after the resumption of work Lodge 66 was the choice of a majority of respondent's employees for the purpose of collective bargaining. The Board's order properly requires respondent to desist from interfering in any manner with its employees in the exercise of their right to self-organization and to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing. But it is a different matter to require respondent to treat Lodge 66 in the altered circumstances as such a representative. If it is contended that Lodge 66 is the choice of the employees, the Board has abundant authority to settle the question by requiring an election.\n Seventh.-The requirement that respondent shall withdraw all recognition from Rare Metal Workers of America, Local No. 1.\n While respondent presents a strong protest, insisting that Local No. 1 of the Rare Metal Workers was the free choice of the employees after work was resumed, we cannot say that there is not substantial evidence that the formation of this organization was brought about through promotion efforts of respondent contrary to the provision of Section 8(2), and we think that the order of the Board in this respect should be sustained. Whether Rare Metal Workers of America, Local No. 1, or any other organization, is the choice of the majority of the employees in the proper unit can be determined by proceedings open to the Board.\n The provisions of the Board's order contained in Paragraph 1, subdivisions (a) and (b), in Paragraph 2, subdivision (d), and in Paragraph 2, subdivisions (e) and (f) so far as these refer to the first- mentioned provisions, and the final Paragraph of the order dismissing the charge \n\n[306 \nU.S. 240, 263]\n\u00a0\n under Section 8(3) of the Act, are sustained. The other provisions of the order are set aside.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is modified accordingly and as modified is affirmed. It is so ordered.\n Modified and as modified, affirmed.\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER took no part in the consideration and decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE, concurring in part.\n I concur in so much of the Court's decision as holds that the Board was without statutory authority to order reinstatement of those employees who were discharged on February 17, 1937. But I rest this conclusion solely on the construction of  2(3) and  10(c) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  152(3), 160(c). By  10(c) the Board is given authority to reinstate in their employment only those who are 'employees'. Before the Board made its order, respondent's employees, by reason of their lawful discharge for cause, had lost their status as such, which would otherwise have been preserved to them under  2(3).\n The National Labor Relations Act, as its purpose and scope are disclosed by its preamble and operative provisions and explained by the reports of the Congressional committees recommending its enactment, Report No. 573, Senate Committee on Education and Labor, 74th Cong., 1st Sess.; Report No. 1147, House Committee on Labor, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., is aimed at securing the peaceable settlement of labor disputes by the prevention of unfair labor practices of the employer and by requiring him to bargain collectively with his employees. Since one means adopted by the Act to secure this end is the reinstatement, by the discretionary action of the National Labor Relations Board, of employees when unfair labor \n\n[306 \nU.S. 240, 264]\n\u00a0\n practices have caused them to cease work, it was necessary to provide that they should not lose their status as employees by reason of that fact. This was accomplished by  2(3), which provides:\n'The term 'employee' shall include ... any individual whose work has ceased as a consequence of, or in connection with, any current labor dispute or because of any unfair labor practice ....'\n\n Having in mind the purposes of the Act and the end sought by the enactment of this section, I think its fair meaning is that attributed to it by the Senate Committee Report, supra, pp. 6-7, which declared:\n'The bill thus observes the principle that men do not lose their right to be considered as employees for the purposes of this bill merely by collectively refraining from work during the course of a labor controversy. ... And to hold that a worker who because of an unfair labor practice has been discharged or locked out or gone on strike is no longer an employee, would be to give legal sanction to an illegal act and to deny redress to the individual injured thereby.'\n\n But it does not follow because the section preserves this right to employees where they have ceased work by reason of a labor dispute or unfair labor practice, that its language is to be read as depriving the employer of his right, which the statute does not purport to withdraw, to terminate the employer-employee relationship for reasons dissociated with the stoppage of work because of unfair labor practices. The language which saves the employee status for those who have ceased work because of unfair labor practices does not embrace also those who have lost their status for a wholly different reason-their discharge for unlawful practices which the Act does not countenance. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 240, 265]\n\u00a0\n There is nothing in the Act, read as a whole, to indicate such a purpose, and there is no language in  2(3) directed to such an end. I cannot attribute to Congress in the adoption of  2(3), explained as it was in the Senate Committee Report, a purpose to cut off the right of an employer to discharge employees who have destroyed his factory and to refuse to reemploy them, if that is the real reason for his action. If a plainer indication of such a purpose had been given by the language of  2( 3), I should have thought it of sufficiently dubious constitutionality to require us to construe its language otherwise, if that could reasonably be done, leaving it to Congress to say so, in unmistakable language, if it really meant to impose that duty on the employer.\n As to the fourteen employees who aided and abetted the sit-down strike, but who were not discharged, I think they retained their status under  2(3), and that the Board had power to reinstate them. Whether that power should be exercised was a matter committed to the Board's discretion, not ours.\n In other respects I concur with the decision of the Court.\n\n Mr. Justice REED, dissenting in part.\n This Court agrees with the conclusion of the Labor Board that the respondent was guilty of unfair labor practices, prior to the strike, in campaigning for a company union, isolating the union president, making, through its superintendent, anti-union statements and employing a labor spy. It also accepts the Board's conclusion that there was further pre- strike violation by respondent of the Labor Relations Act by refusal to bargain collectively. None questions the power of the Board to reinstate striking employees as a means of redress for unfair labor practices. The issue while important \n\n[306 \nU.S. 240, 266]\n\u00a0\n is narrow. Can an employee, on strike or let out by an unfair labor practice, be discharged, finally, by an employer so as to be ineligible for reinstatement under the act?\n The issue so stated glows feebly apart from the fire of controversy. But it may permit a more objective appraisal than to examine it when illustrated by conduct on the part of the employees which is thought to put 'a premium on resort to force' and to subvert 'the principles of law and order which lie at the foundations of society.' None on either side of the disputed issue need be suspected of 'countenancing law-lessness,' or of encouraging employees to resort to 'violence in defiance of the law of the land.' Disapproval of a sit-down does not logically compel the acceptance of the theory that an employer has the power to bar his striking employee from the protection of the Labor Act.\n The Labor Act was enacted in an effort to protect interstate commerce from the interruptions of labor disputes. This object was sought through prohibition of certain practices deemed unfair to labor, and the sanctions adopted to enforce the prohibitions included reinstatement of employees. To assure that the status of strikers was not changed from employees to individuals beyond the protection of the act, the term employee was defined to include 'any individual whose work has ceased as a consequence of, or in connection with, any current labor dispute or because of any unfair labor practice ....'  2(3), Act of July 5, 1935. Without this assurance of the continued protection of the act, the striking employee would be quickly put beyond the pale of its protection by discharge. As now construed by the Court, the employer may discharge any striker, with or without cause, so long as the discharge is not used to interfere with self-organization or collective bargaining. Friction easily engendered by labor strife may readily give rise to con- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 240, 267]\n\u00a0\n duct, from nose-thumbing to sabotage, which will give fair occasion for discharge on grounds other than those prohibited by the Labor Act.\n The Congress sought by clear language to eliminate this prolific source of ill feeling by the provision just quoted which should be interpreted in accordance with its language as continuing the eligibility of a striker for reinstatement, regardless of conduct by the striker or action by the employer. The constitutional problem involved in such a conclusion is not different from the one involved in compelling an employer to reinstate an employee, discharged for union activity. There is here no protection for unlawful activity. Every punishment which compelled obedience to law still remains in the hands of the peace officers. It is only that the act of ceasing work in a current labor dispute involving unfair labor practices suspends for a period, not now necessary to determine, the right of an employer to terminate the relation. The interference with the normal exercise of the right to discharge extends only to the necessity of protecting the relationship in industrial strife.\n The point is made that an employer should not be compelled to reemploy an employee guilty, perhaps, of sabotage. This depends upon circumstances. It is the function of the Board to weigh the charges and countercharges and determine the adjustment most conducive to industrial peace. Courts certainly should not interfere with the normal action of administrative bodies in such circumstances. Here both labor and management had erred grievously in their respective conduct. It cannot be said to be unreasonable to restore both to their former status.

Horsky, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Harry E. Smoyer, of Cleveland, Ohio, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals denied the petition of the National Labor Relations Board for enforcement of an order against the respondent and granted the respondent's petition to set aside the order. \n1\n We issued the writ of certiorari, \n305 \nU.S. 586\n, 59 S.Ct. 91, 83 L.Ed. --, because of alleged conflict. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n After complaint, answer and hearing, the Board found that the respondent, an Ohio corporation which manufactures water heaters in Cleveland, had engaged, and continued to engage, in unfair labor practices as defined by Sec. 8, subsections (1), (3), and (5) of the National Labor Relations Act,3 and ordered the company to cease and desist from violating those provisions and to offer reinstatement to former employes with compensation for loss of wages from September 3, 1935.4\n The respondent contends and the court below held that upon the findings of fact, and the uncontradicted evidence, the Board's conclusions are without support in the record. The petitioner insists that there is evidence to support them. From the findings, and the uncontradicted evidence, these facts appear: In the spring of 1934\n\n\n\n\n[306 \nU.S. 332, 335]\n\u00a0\n most of respondent's employes joined the Mechanics Educational Society of America (hereinafter called 'MESA'), an independent labor organization. The respondent manifested no opposition to their so doing, expressed its willingness that its men join any organization they chose, and readily met with a shop committee of the union to discuss grievances and working conditions. An agreement effecting an increase of wages, and affecting working conditions, was entered into between the respondent and the union. Although limited in term to sixty days it was continued, by mutual agreement, and under it all matters of controversy between employer and employes were settled by conference between the shop committee of the union and officials of the company.\n In May 1935 the committee demanded, and the company refused, an increase of wages. A strike was called, but negotiations went on between the company and the union. All differences were adjusted save that the company was unwilling to reinstate certain men alleged to be incompetent. The union insisted that these men be taken back and thereafter be afforded a hearing by the management and the shop committee. When work was resumed the company did not permit the men in question to return. Thereupon a second strike was called. Negotiations again ensued as a result of which the shop committee agreed to draft and submit a contract to the respondent. This was done. The management demanded certain changes in the draft, to which the committee agreed; a contract extending to March 1, 1936, was executed on June 15, 1935, and the men returned to work. The agreement provided that the company would recognize the shop committee as representing the employes for collective bargaining; that no employe should be discharged without a hearing before the shop committee and the management; that certain employes should be discharged and not rehired; that stipulated \n\n[306 \nU.S. 332, 336]\n\u00a0\n notice should be given of layoffs due to shortage of work; that new employes might join any labor organization they chose. It also covered wages and hours of work. It further provided: 'In case of a misunderstanding between the management and the employes, the committee shall allow the management forty-eight hours to settle the dispute and, if then unsuccessful, the committee shall act as they see fit.' Provisions as to seniority will be presently stated.\n In 1934 the company had an opportunity to procure a government order. Its officers conferred with the men and stated that they would take the government order if assured that no labor trouble would interfere with its execution. On receiving this assurance the order was taken and the working force more than doubled by the employment of new men. It was agreed with the union that these men might join the MESA and in fact many of them did so. It was also agreed that when the government order was finished these new men should be discharged so that the old men could remain at work.\n The company's plant was divided into a number of departments, one of which was the machine shop. The wage scales differed in different departments and the foreman and old men whom the company employed in each department received higher wages than new men in the same department. The company had had a practice of keeping the old men at work, in case business was slack, by transferring them from their own departments to others at their regular pay. When negotiations were under way for the agreement of June 15, 1935, the company insisted on discontinuing this practice of transferring old men from one department to another, stating that it would recognize, as theretofore, the seniority rights of old men but only in the departments in which particular men belonged. The management insisted that the practice of transferring men from one department to an- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 332, 337]\n\u00a0\n other resulted in inefficiency. The Board has found that the company in fact disapproved of the practice because it resulted in paying higher wages than would have been the case had the new men been retained or recalled to the busy department instead of transferring old men from other departments thereto. As a result of the insistence of the respondent, certain paragraphs of the proposed draft submitted by the employes were altered. These paragraphs follow, with the alterations demanded by the management in italics:\n'(5) That when employees are laid off, seniority rights shall rule, and by departments.\n\n\n (6)\n That when one department is shut down, men from this department will not be transferred or work in other departments until all old men only within that department, who were laid off, have been called back.\n\n\n (7)\n That all new employees be laid off before and old employees, in order to guarantee if possible at least one week's full time before the working week is reduced to three days.'\n On June 17, 1935, the company hired approximately 30\u00f5additional men, some of whom had worked for the respondent while the government order was being filled. By the middle of July work was becoming slack and respondent proceeded to reduce its working force. About July 15, 1935, after conferences between the management and the employees, all the men in the tank heater department except the foreman were laid off.\n In the agreement of June 15, 1935, the 31 men who were employes of the respondent prior to the government order of 1934 were designated as 'old men' and those employed while the government order was being filled were 'new men'. About July 30, 1935, a notice was posted on the time clock in the plant that the new men would be laid off on July 30 and the old men would be laid off on August 2, 1935. After the layoff of the new \n\n[306 \nU.S. 332, 338]\n\u00a0\n men another notice was posted to the effect that the plant would be operated with the old men on a schedule of three days a week.\n Thus, by the end of July or the beginning of August, some departments were being operated on a part time basis and others had been practically shut down. At or about this time, the respondent wished to increase the working force in the machine shop, the key department, while at the same time shutting down the other departments. Repeated conferences were held between the management and the shop committee in reference to this matter. The positions of the respondent and the employes were diametrically opposed. The management contended that new men, experienced in machine shop work, be employed in preference to the old men. The shop committee contended that, under the agreement of June 15, 1935, the respondent could not hire any new men for the machine shop as long as old men were still laid off. The management claimed that the shop committee was insisting upon a violation of Article 5 of the agreement. On August 19th an officer conferred with the shop committee and announced that the company would either keep the machine shop running according to the company's plan or temporarily close the plant. The committee was requested to confer with the employes and communicate their decision. After conference with the employes the committee stated that the company would not be allowed to run the machine shop unless it transferred old men in lieu of new men to that shop, and that if it did not comply with this condition it could close the plant. Accordingly, on August 21st, notice was posted that the plant would be closed until further notice.\n August 26th and 27th officers of respondent negotiated with the International Association of Machinists, an affiliate of the American Federation of Labor, and, on August 31st, made a contract with that union effective \n\n[306 \nU.S. 332, 339]\n\u00a0\n September 3rd. It also recruited labor from the county relief organization. Practically all of the employes so obtained were members of the International. It offered reemployment to several of the old MESA members, as foremen, on the basis of annual employment at a lower hourly wage instead of the higher hourly wage theretofore paid them, subject to layoffs. The offer was refused. September 3rd the plant reopened. On September 4th, a representative of MESA called an officer of respondent and demanded a conference. The demand was refused on the ground that the men had been discharged. The MESA picketed the plant for about a month thereafter.\n The Board held that the company had refused to bargain collectively with the representatives of its employes as required by Section 8(5) of the Act; had discriminated in regard to hire or tenure of employment and discouraged membership in a labor organization contrary to the provisions of Section 8(3); and, in violation of Section 8(1), had interfered with, restrained, and coerced its employes in the exercise of the right of self- organization, affiliation with labor organizations and collective bargaining as guaranteed by Section 7, 29 U.S.C.A.  157. The Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed with these conclusions. We hold that its decision was right.\n First. The petitioner urges the correctness of the ultimate conclusion that the respondent's conduct permits no reasonable inference save that the employes were locked out, discharged, and refused employment because they were members of the MESA and had engaged in concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining. We think the conclusion has no support in the evidence and is contrary to the entire and uncontradicted evidence of record.\n The respondent did not attempt to prevent organization of its employes or discourage their affiliation with MESA or interfere with their relations with that body. There is no evidence of espionage or coercion by the com- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 332, 340]\n\u00a0\n pany. Immediately upon the unionization of the men in the spring of 1934, the respondent recognized and conferred with the shop committee whenever requested so to do. May 2, 1934, it entered into an agreement with the union. It consulted the union respecting hiring of additional employes for the filling of the government order in the autumn of 1934 and complied with its promise to discharge additional men hired for this purpose when the order had been completed. All but three of the men hired became members of MESA without objection on the part of the company. From May 1934 to May 1935 the company negotiated with the union and the latter never had any trouble in getting meetings with the management. When, in 1935, a strike was called as a result of the refusal of the shop committee's demand for a wage increase, the company continued negotiations during the strike and made an oral agreement under which the strikers returned to work. When three days later they struck again because of a refusal to reinstate some of their number, although a representative of MESA said several of these men might be incompetent, the company took the men back and continued to negotiate with the union with the result that a draft of a contract was submitted by the shop committee. After the company had insisted on certain changes with respect to departmental seniority, the draft ripened into a contract June 15, 1935.\n Thereafter the respondent had hearings with the shop committee as to the discharge of an employe for incompetence and there is no suggestion that, between June 15th and August 21st, it failed to live up to its contract in any respect. Repeated meetings were held with the shop committee to discuss the terms of the contract respecting departmental seniority. The evidence of the members of the shop committee demonstrates that this matter was fully discussed before the contract was executed and that the members of the committee under \n\n[306 \nU.S. 332, 341]\n\u00a0\n stood the company's position and the reason for the alterations in the committee's draft. Throughout the summer of 1935 the company, while adhering to its position, attempted to accommodate its practices to the demands of the shop committee, evidently in order to avoid a strike. When the final conference of August 19th took place the company's manager made it clear to the committee that he desired to operate the machine shop with the new men belonging in that department and when the committee advised him this would not be permitted he asked them to go to the men and find out whether the proposed operation would be permitted or whether the plant would have to be shut down. On August 21st the committee brought back a reply to the effect that the company could shut down the plant but could not operate the machine shop on the principle of departmental seniority. The company then closed the plant and did not open until it had employed new men under a contract with another union which gave it the option to enforce departmental seniority. Save for one item of evidence, this is all the record discloses to indicate that the discharge and replacement of the men arose from a discrimination against them for union activities and the exercise of the right of collective bargaining. Manifestly it is not only insufficient to sustain any such conclusion but definitely refutes it. , the Board supports the conclusion by reference to the testimony of two men. One, Norman, who was, with the union's consent, discharged after the agreement of June 15, 1935, for incompetency, testified he thought he was discharged as a result of a grudge. He said that in June, one McKiernan, a shipping clerk who was his superior, told him when he complained about his discharge: 'I will tell you; there is a lot more of this than you and I know of.' 'I will get you back when we break this union up.' There is the further testimony of \n\n[306 \nU.S. 332, 342]\n\u00a0\n a witness Rudd who says that the superintendent said to him in June, in effect, that it would be better to have the A.F. of L. union as they were more conservative and not so likely to strike. This was just after MESA had called two strikes in the plant. Neither of the men who are quoted held such a position that his statements are evidence of the company's policy even in June, two months before the discharge, and the inference of hostility to MESA drawn from their testimony does not, in any event, amount to a scintilla when considered in the light of respondent's long course of conduct in respect of union activities and in dealing freely and candidly with MESA.\n Second. The Board held that respondent violated the obligation imposed upon it by the statute to bargain collectively with representatives of its employes. The legislative history of the Act goes far to indicate that the purpose of the statute was to compel employers to bargain collectively with their employes to the end that employment contracts binding on both parties should be made. \n5\n But we assume that the Act imposes upon the employer the further obligation to meet and bargain with his employes' representatives respecting proposed changes of an existing contract and also to discuss with them its true interpretation, if there is any doubt as to its meaning. Upon this basis the respondent was not deficient in the performance of its duty.\n The contract provided for departmental seniority, in sections 5 and 6, and section 7 did not create any ambiguity on the subject. Moreover, the record makes it clear that the committee which negotiated the contract on behalf of the union fully understood its terms in the same sense as did the respondent. In this situation how often and \n\n[306 \nU.S. 332, 343]\n\u00a0\n how long was the company bound to continue discussion of the committee's demand that the provisions of the contract should be ignored? It is to be borne in mind that section 20 of the contract provided that if the company did not meet the committee's views within forty-eight hours the employes reserved full liberty of action and this meant that if the company did not accede to demands a strike might follow.\n We come then to consider the situation of the respondent in August 1935. The Board has found that it desired to operate its machine shop in accordance with its honest understanding of the contract. Its motive, whether efficiency or economy, was proper. It had stated its views to the committee. The committee was adamant; its stand was that the company could close its entire plant if it chose, but it could not operate the machine shop in accordance with the provisions of the contract. If it attempted the latter alternative a strike was inevitable. The Board found that it was inconceivable that the employes would have accepted the company's construction of the contract even if they had been threatened with discharge at the time. It is evident that the respondent realized that it had no alternative but to operate the plant in the way the men dictated, in the teeth of the agreement, or keep it closed entirely, or have a strike. When the representatives of the two parties separated on August 21, no further negotiations were pending, each had rejected the other's proposals, and there were no arrangements for a further meeting. On the following days the factory was closed.\n The Board finds that, in this situation, the respondent was under an obligation to send for the shop committee and again to reason with its members or to wait until the situation became such that it could operate its whole plant without antagonizing the employes' views with respect to departmental seniority. We think it was under \n\n[306 \nU.S. 332, 344]\n\u00a0\n no obligation to do any of these things. There is no suggestion that there was a refusal to bargain on August 21st. There could be, therefore, no duty on either side to enter into further negotiations for collective bargaining in the absence of a request therefor by the employes. \n6\n No such request was made prior to September 4th. Respondent rightly understood that the men were irrevocably committed not to work in accordance with their contract. It was at liberty to treat them as having severed their relations with the company because of their breach and to consummate their separation from the company's employ by hiring others to take their places. The Act does not prohibit an effective discharge for repudiation by the employe of his agreement, any more than it prohibits such discharge for a tort committed against the employer. \n7\n As the respondent had lawfully secured others to fill the places of the former employes and recognized a new union, which, so far as appears, represented a majority of its employes, the old union and its shop committee were no longer in a position on September 4th to demand collective bargaining on behalf of the company's employes.\n It is urged that the company's offer to re-employ four men as foremen on the basis of guaranteed annual compensation, at a lower hourly rate than had theretofore been paid them, is evidence to support the Board's finding of a refusal to bargain collectively with the union. The argument is that if the company had made a similar offer to all of the men this might have formed a basis of compromise, since one of the employes to whom an officer talked indicated that the men might be willing to take a cut in wages; but there is no evidence that the \n\n[306 \nU.S. 332, 345]\n\u00a0\n company had any thought of offering a similar contract to others than the foremen of departments, and the breach of contract of which the men were guilty left the company under no obligation to initiate negotiations for a new and different contract of employment with them.\n Third. Certain occurrences subsequent to August 21, 1935, are urged by the Board in support of its finding that respondent's discharge of its forty-eight employes constituted discrimination against the union and failure to bargain collectively. The first of these is its application to the International Association for men and its making an agreement with that union on August 26th and 27th. If, as we have held, the respondent was confronted with a concerted refusal on the part of MESA to permit its members to perform their contract there was nothing unlawful in the company's attempting to procure others to fill their places. \n8\n If the respondent was at liberty to hire new employes it was equally at liberty to make a contract with a union for their services. \n 9\n\u00a0\n\n The offering of re-employment to four of the old employes, upon a new and different basis, is said to constitute discrimination against MESA, but the answer is that if the whole body of employes had been lawfully discharged the law does not prohibit the making of individual contracts with men whose prior relations had thereby been severed. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n Fourth. The Board found as a fact that in offering re-employment to two of its old men the respondent stipulated as a condition that they join the International \n\n[306 \nU.S. 332, 346]\n\u00a0\n union. The finding is sharply challenged but, as there is evidence in support of it, we accept it. Based upon this finding the Board contends this stipulation in connection with the offer to hire the men was a violation of Section 8(3) of the Act independent of any of the violations flowing out of the discharge and refusal to re-employ the men as a body. The contention is irrelevant to any issue in the cause. The complaint alleges that the discharge of the men constituted an unfair labor practice in violation of Section 8(1) and (3) and that the execution of the agreement with the international association constituted an unfair labor practice under Section 8(5). It nowhere refers to any discrimination in hiring any man or men or charges any violation in connection therewith.\n The decree is\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice BLACK and Mr. Justice REED dissent.\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 96 F.2d 721. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] See Jeffery-De Witt Insulator Co. v.

The suit was based on diversity of citizenship and was not brought 'in the district of the residence of either the plaintiff or the defendant.' Section 51 of the Judicial Code, Act of March 3, 1887, 24 Stat. 552, as corrected by Act of August 13, 1888, 25 Stat. 433, 28 U.S.C.  112, 28 U.S.C.A.  112.1 We took the case, \n307 \nU.S. 619\n, 59 S.Ct. 1037, because of the uncertainties in application of  51, emphasized by conflict between the views below and those of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. Oklahoma Packing Co. v. Oklahoma Gas & Elec. Co., 10 Cir., 100 F. 2d 770. The sole question in the case is whether  51 is satisfied by the designation by a foreign corporation of an agent for service of process, in conformity with the law of a state in which suit is brought against it in one of the federal courts for that state.\n The jurisdiction of the federal courts-their power to adjudicate-is a grant of authority to them by Congress and thus beyond the scope of litigants to confer. But \n\n[308 \nU.S. 165, 168]\n\u00a0\n the locality of a law suit-the place where judicial authority may be exercised-though defined by legislation relates to the convenience of litigants and as such is subject to their disposition. This basic difference between the court's power and the litigant's convenience is historic in the federal courts. After a period of confusing deviation it was firmly reestablished in General Inv. Co. v. Lake Shore Ry., \n260 \nU.S. 261\n, 43 S.Ct. 106; and Lee v. Chesapeake & Ohio Ry., \n260 \nU.S. 653\n, 43 S.Ct. 230, over-ruling Ex parte Wisner, \n203 \nU.S. 449\n, 27 S.Ct. 150, and qualifying In re Moore, \n209 \nU.S. 490\n, 28 S. Ct. 585, 706, 14 Ann.Cas. 1164. All the parties may be non- residents of the district where suit is brought. Lee v. Chesapeake & Ohio Ry., supra. Section 51 'merely accords to the defendant a personal privilege respecting the venue, or place of suit, which he may assert, or may waive, at his election.' Commercial Ins. Co. v. Stone Co., \n278 \nU.S. 177, 179\n, 49 S.Ct. 98, 99.\n Being a privilege, it may be lost. It may be lost by failure to assert it seasonably, by formal submission in a cause, or by submission through conduct. Commercial Ins. Co. v. Stone Co., supra. Whether such surrender of a personal immunity be conceived negatively as a waiver or positively as a consent to be sued, is merely an expression of literary preference. The essence of the matter is that courts affix to conduct consequences as to place of suit consistent with the policy behind  51, which is 'to save defendants from inconveniences to which they might be subjected if they could be compelled to answer in any district, or wherever found.' General Inv. Co. v. Lake Shore Ry., supra, 260 U.S. at page 275, 43 S.Ct. at page 113.\n When the litigants are natural persons the conceptions underlying venue present relatively few problems in application. But in the case of corporate litigants these procedural problems are enmeshed in the wider intricacies touching the status of a corporation in our law. The \n\n[308 \nU.S. 165, 169]\n\u00a0\n corporate device is one form of associated enterprise, and what the law in effect has done is to enforce rights and duties appropriate for collective activity. Cf. United Mine Workers of America v. Coronado Coal Co., \n259 \nU.S. 344\n, 42 S.Ct. 570, 27 A.L.R. 762; Puerto Rico v. Russell, \n288 \nU.S. 476\n, 53 S.Ct. 447. It has done so largely by assimilating corporations to natural persons. The long, tortuous evolution of the methods whereby foreign corporations gained access to courts or could be brought there, is the history of judicial groping for a reconciliation between the practical position achieved by the corporation in society and a natural desire to confine the powers of these artificial creations. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n It took half a century of litigation in this Court finally to confer on a corporation, through the use of a fiction,3 citizenship in the chartering state for jurisdictional purposes. Compare Lafayette Ins. Co. v. French, 18 How. 404, with Hope Ins. Co. v. Boardman, 5 Cranch 57. Throughout, the mode of thought was metaphorical. The classic doctrine was that a corporation 'must dwell in the place of its creation, and cannot migrate to another sovereignty.' Bank of Augusta v. Earle, 13 Pet. 519, 588. Logically applied, this theory of non-migration prevented suit in a non-chartering state, for the corporation could not be there. \n4\n And such was the practice of the circuit courts5 until the opinion of Chief Justice Waite in Ex parte Schollenberger, \n96 \nU.S. 369\n, displaced metaphor with common sense. The essential difference \n\n[308 \nU.S. 165, 170]\n\u00a0\n between the practice which Mr. Justice Nelson6 initiated at circuit and the decision in Schollenberger's case was not a matter of technical legal construction, but a way of looking at corporations. Men's minds had become habituated to corporate activities which crossed state lines. The fact that corporations did do business outside their originating bounds made intolerable their immunity from suit in the states of their activities. And so they were required by legislatures to designate agents for service of process in return for the privilege of doing local business. That service upon such an agent, in conformity with a valid state statute, constituted consent to be sued in the federal court and thereby supplanted the immunity as to venue, was the rationale of Schollenberger's case.\n To be sure, that case arose under the Judiciary Act of 1875, 18 Stat. 470, the language of which differed from the Act of 1887, now  51 of the Judicial Code. The earlier provision was as follows: 'And no civil suit shall be brought before either of said courts against any person by any original process or proceeding in any other district than that whereof he is an inhabitant, or in which he shall be found ....' The Act of 1887 omitted the words 'in which he shall be found.' But, of course, the Phoenix and the Clinton Insurance Company in Ex parte Schollenberger, supra, were not geographically 'found' in Pennsylvania, and Chief Justice Waite so recognized. They were 'found' in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania only in a metaphorical sense, because they had consented to be sued there by complying with the Pennsylvania law for designating an agent to accept service. Not less than three times does the opinion point \n\n[308 \nU.S. 165, 171]\n\u00a0\n out that the corporation gave 'consent' to be sued; and because of this consent the Chief Justice added that the corporation was 'found' there. But the crux of the decision is its reliance upon two earlier cases, Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company v. Harris, 12 Wall. 65, and Lafayette Ins. Co. v. French, 18 How. 404, recognizing that 'consent' may give 'venue'. The Phoenix and the Clinton Insurance Company consented not to be 'found' but to be sued. Since the corporation had consented to be sued in the courts of the state, this Court held that the consent extended to the federal courts sitting in that state. As to diversity cases, Congress has given the federal courts 'cognizance, concurrent with the courts of the several States'. Jud.Code  24, 28 U.S.C. A.  41. The consent, therefore, extends to any court sitting in the state which applies the laws of the state. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n The notion that the 1887 amendment, by eliminating the right to sue a defendant in the district 'in which he shall be found', was meant to affect the implications of a consent to be sued-implications which were the basis of the Schollenberger decision-derives from a misapplication of the purpose of Congress to contract diversity jurisdiction, based upon a misunderstanding of the legislative history of the 1887 amendment. \n8\n The deletion of 'in which he shall be found' was not directed toward any change in the status of a corporate litigant. The restriction was designed to shut the door against service of process upon a natural person in any place where he might be caught. It confined suability, except with the \n\n[308 \nU.S. 165, 172]\n\u00a0\n defendant's consent, to the district of his physical habitation. Insofar as the 1887 legislation sheds any light upon the status of a corporate litigant in diversity suits, its significance lies outside the omission of the 'he shall be found' clause. The form in which that Act passed the House of Representatives contained a provision, wholly distinct from the general venue section, restricting the growing volume of litigation drawn to the federal courts by the fiction of corporate citizenship. \n9\n It prohibited resort to the federal courts by foreign corporations authorized to do a local business. The Senate rejected, as it had done upon three previous occasions, this House proposal. \n10\n But the bill, as it left the House, also contained the venue provision, with its omission of the 'found' clause. It would be strange indeed if the House in  1 had dealt with the 'venue' of suits against corporate litigants who, like those involved in the Schollenberger case, by  3 of the same bill were completely barred from the federal courts. It would be stranger still if, after passing a drastic measure curtailing resort by foreign corporations to the federal courts, the House had only succeeded in giving discriminatory freedom to foreign corporations-discriminatory in that, by nullifying the significance of consent through obedience to state law to be sued in the federal courts, it would allow a \n\n[308 \nU.S. 165, 173]\n\u00a0\n foreign corporate defendant freedom either to remain in the state courts or to remove to a federal court.\n And so, after the Act of 1887 and despite its elimination of 'in which he shall be found' from the Act of 1875, lower federal courts continued to apply the doctrine of Schollenberger's case by considering the designation of an agent for service of process an effective consent to be sued in the federal courts. \n11\n This practice in the lower federal courts continued until 1892, when Southern Pacific Co. v. Denton, \n146 \nU.S. 202\n, 13 S.Ct. 44, was decided. But that case involved an entirely different situation. The Court was there concerned with a Texas statute which not merely regulated procedure for suit but sought to deny foreign corporations access to the federal courts. This Court held the act unconstitutional as the Texas court had in fact already done. \n12\n Inasmuch as the Texas act was found to be void, it 'could give no validity or effect to any agreement or action of the corporation in obedience to its provisions.' \n13\n To be sure, the Court went on to interpret the agreement 'if valid'14 and to suggest that had it been valid the agreement might have subjected the corporation to jurisdiction 'so long as the Judiciary Acts of the United States allowed it to be sued in the district in which it was 'found'.'15 Such, as we \n\n[308 \nU.S. 165, 174]\n\u00a0\n have seen, was not the true basis of the decision in Schollenberger's case. As decisions, the two cases are wholly consistent. But, disregarding the situation before the Court in the Denton case-the absence of any valid consent to be sued because of the invalidity of the statute by which the alleged 'consent' was obtained-several of the lower courts have taken language from the Denton opinion and have made it govern situations where valid consent did exist because given in conformity with the provisions of a valid statute. \n16\n Other courts have adhered to the practice established by Schollenberger's case. \n17\n We deem this practice sound, and it controls the present case.\n In conformity with what is now  210 of the General Corporation Law of New York (Consol.Laws, c. 23),18 Bethlehem designated \n\n[308 \nU.S. 165, 175]\n\u00a0\n 'William J. Brown as the person upon whom a summons may be served within the State of New York.' The scope and meaning of such a designation as part of the bargain by which Bethlehem enjoys the business freedom of the State of New York, have been authoritatively determined by the Court of Appeals, speaking through Judge Cardozo: 'The stipulation is therefore a true contract. The person designated is a true agent. The consent that he shall represent the corporation is a real consent. He is made the person 'upon whom process against the corporation may be served.' ... The contract deals with jurisdiction of the person. It does not enlarge or diminish jurisdiction of the subject-matter. It means that, whenever jurisdiction of the subject-matter is present, service on the agent shall give jurisdiction of the person.' Bagdon v. Phil. and Reading C. & I. Co., 217 N.Y. 432, 436, 437, 111 N.E. 1075, 1076, L.R.A.1916F, 407, Ann.Cas. 1918A, 387. A statute calling for such a designation is constitutional, and the designation of the agent 'a voluntary act.' Pennsylvania Fire Ins. Co. v. Gold Issue Mining Co., \n243 \nU.S. 93\n, 37 S.Ct. 344.\n In finding an actual consent by Bethlehem to be sued in the courts of New York, federal as well as state, we are not subjecting federal procedure to the requirements of New York law. We are recognizing that 'state legislation and consent of parties may bring about a state of facts which will authorize the courts of the United States to take cognizance of a case.' Ex parte Schollenberger, supra, 96 U.S. at page 377. The judgment below is\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals, in a careful and discriminating opinion, 1 has held that to deny the respondent's motion to dismiss it from the suit would be to dis- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 165, 176]\n\u00a0\n regard the long settled construction of Sec. 51 of the Judicial Code, 28 U. S.C.A.  112, and the equally well settled application of that section. I think its judgment should be affirmed.\n Whatever may be said in support of the original adoption of a different rule, it has been the law for a century that, as respects the jurisdiction of the federal courts over a corporation in diversity of citizenship cases, the corporation is a citizen and resident of the state of incorporation and of no other state. I do not understand the court's opinion to repudiate the rule.\n The statute which is now  51 of the Judicial Code took its present form in 1888. In 1892 the court held, in Shaw v. Quincy Mining Co., \n145 \nU.S. 444, 453\n, 12 S.Ct. 935, 938, that, under the statute, 'a corporation, incorporated in one state only, cannot be compelled to answer, in a circuit court of the United States held in another state in which it has a usual place of business, to a civil suit, at law or in equity, brought by a citizen of a different state.' This construction has been followed in this court without deviation and with practical unanimity by the lower federal courts. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n At the next term, in Southern Pacific Co. v. Denton, \n146 \nU.S. 202, 205\n, 207 S., 13 S.Ct. 44, 45, 46, the ruling was reaffirmed in a case where the defendant had registered as a foreign corporation under a state law and, as a condition of registration, had agreed that service of process might be made upon a designated agent. \n\n[308 \nU.S. 165, 177]\n\u00a0\n The earlier Act of 1875 provided that no civil suit could be brought against a defendant in a United States court 'in any other district than that whereof he is an inhabitant, or in which he shall be found at the time of serving such process ....'\n Ex parte Schollenberger, \n96 \nU.S. 369\n, applied that earlier statute. The court held that a foreign corporation which had registered and consented to the service of process upon a designated agent had thereby agreed 'to be found' within the state and might therefore be impleaded in a federal court sitting in the state although it was not a citizen or a resident of the state. The case was cited in the opinions in both the Shaw and the Southern Pacific cases. In the latter the court said, referring to the foreign corporation's agreement as to service, 146 U.S. at pages 207, 208, 13 S.Ct. at page 46: 'It might likewise have subjected the corporation to the jurisdiction of a Circuit Court of the United States held within the state, so long as the judiciary acts of the United States allowed it to be sued in the district in which it was found. ... But such an agreement could not, since congress (as held in Shaw v. Quincy Mining Co., above cited) has made citizenship of the state, with residence in the district, the sole test of jurisdiction in this class of cases, estop the corporation to set up noncompliance with that test, when sued in a circuit court of the United States.'\n In re Keasbey & Mattison Co., \n160 \nU.S. 221\n, 16 S.Ct. 273, the court held, 160 U.S. at page 228, 16 S.Ct. at page 275: 'Under the provision of that act (the earlier act of 1875), which allowed a defendant to be sued in the district of which he was an inhabitant, or in that in which he was found, a corporation could doubtless have been sued either in the district in which it was incorporated, or in any district in which it carried on business and had a general agent.' For this statement the court cited Ex parte Schollenberger, Shaw v. Quincy \n\n[308 \nU.S. 165, 178]\n\u00a0\n Mining Company, and Southern Pacific Company v. Denton, supra. The opinions in the last two, and that in the Keasbey case, were written for the court by Mr. Justice Gray, who summed up their effect by saying: 'And it is established, by the decisions of this court, that, within the meaning of this act, a corporation cannot be considered a citizen, an inhabitant, or a resident of a state in which it has not been incorporated; and, consequently, that a corporation incorporated in a state of the Union cannot be compelled to answer to a civil suit, at law or in equity, in a circuit court of the United States held in another state, even if the corporation has a usual place of business in that state.'\n This interpretation of Sec. 51 has since remained unchanged. Congress must have known of and acquiesced in the courts' construction of the section, particularly as there have been efforts to amend it, and no alteration has been adopted.\n Upon principle, and under the authorities, the mere fact that service of process valid under state law can be had on an officer or agent of a foreign corporation doing business within the state is irrelevant; for although the corporation may be served in conformity to local law, it cannot be compelled to try its case in a federal court sitting in the state. I do not understand the opinion of the court to hold to the contrary.\n But it is said that registration and designation of an agent upon whom service may be made under compulsion of state law amounts to a waiver of the requirements of Sec. 51 as to venue, or to a consent to be sued in a federal court sitting within the state.\n As has been shown by quotation from the opinion, this contention was made in Southern Pacific Co. v. Denton, supra, and was overruled. The holding was one of the alternative grounds of decision. The Southern Pacific \n\n[308 \nU.S. 165, 179]\n\u00a0\n case settled the application of Sec. 51, in the circumstances here disclosed, and the decision has never been qualified or overruled. The lower federal courts have understood and applied that decision with practical uniformity to enable the foreign corporation to contest the venue of suits against it. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n I see no reason at this late day to attribute a new effect to the statute when Congress has not seen fit to express a view contrary to that embodied in this court's construction of the law; though this might at any time be done. The principle of stare decisis seems to me to make against such a change.\n The court below has analyzed the applicable New York statute and has satisfactorily demonstrated that it deals with service of process on foreign corporations in the courts of New York. The state could not, by its laws, affect the jurisdiction of federal courts or the venue of suits therein,-a matter solely within the control of Congress.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS join in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 112(a) reads as follows: 'Except as provided in sections 113 to 117 of this title, no person shall be arrested in one district for trial in another in any civil action before a district court; and, except as provided in sections 113 to 118 of this title, no civil suit shall be brought in any district court against any person by any original process or proceeding in any other district than that whereof he is an inhabitant; but where the jurisdiction is founded only on the fact that the action is between citizens of different States, suit shall be brought only in the district of the residence of either the plaintiff or the defendant.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See Henderson, 'The Position of Foreign Corporations in American Constitutional Law', passim, and especially the illuminating analysis pp. 163-194. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] See Gray, 'The Nature and Sources of the Law', 184, and Henderson, op. cit. supra, note 2, pp. 50-76. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] See St. Clair v.

The decisive difference between the present case and In re Keasbey & Mattison Co., supra, is that in the latter case the designation under state law which is the basis of consent had in fact not been made. But the requirement of 'residence' in the Act of 1887 is as much satisfied by a consent to be sued as was the requirement 'to be found' in the 1875 Act satisfied by such a consent. \n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] Platt v.

CO. v. STATE BOARD OF TAX APPEALS(1939)\nNo. 449\nArgued: Decided: May 29, 1939\n\n\n\n As Corrected June 5, 1939. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 313, 314]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Arthur T. Vanderbilt, of Newark, N.J., for appellant Newark Fire ins. co.\n Messrs. John G. Jackson, of New York City, and Jehiel G. Shipman, of Newark, N.J., for appellants Universal Ins. Co. and another.\n Mr. Donald R. Richberg, of Washington, D.C., for appellees.\n\n\n\n[307 \nU.S. 313, 315]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice REED announced an opinion in which the CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice BUTLER and Mr. Justice ROBERTS, concurred.\n The controversy in No. 449 relates to the jurisdiction of New Jersey to tax the appellant upon the full amount of its capital stock paid in and accumulated surplus. The case is here by appeal under Section 237(a) of the Judicial Code. \n 1\n\u00a0\n\n Chapter 236 of the Laws of 19182 is a general act for the assessment and collection of taxes. Section 202, N.J.S.A. 54: 4-1, subjects all real and personal property within the jurisdiction of New Jersey to taxation annually at its true value. By Section 301, N.J.S.A. 54:4-9, the tax on other than tangible personal property is assessed on each inhabitant in the taxing district of his residence on the first day of October in each year. Section 305, N.J.S.A. 54:4-18, deals with domestic corporations as residents of the district in which their chief office is located and renders their personal property taxable in the same manner as that of individuals, except as otherwise provided. Section 307, N.J.S.A. 54:4-22, the most vital in the case, provides:\n'Every fire insurance company and every stock insurance company other than life insurance, shall be assessed in the taxing district where its office is situate, upon the full amount of its capital stock paid in and accumulated surplus. ... No franchise tax shall be imposed upon any such fire insurance company or other stock insurance company included in this section.' \n\n[307 \nU.S. 313, 316]\n\u00a0\n The appellant is a stock fire insurance corporation organized under the laws of New Jersey which at the time of this assessment required it to locate its principal office and to conduct its general business in the state. \n3\n It is stipulated that a registered office is maintained in Newark, New Jersey, together with such books as the law requires to be kept within the state. The only business carried on in this Newark office is a local or regional claim and underwriting department for Essex and three other counties. No executive officer is there and reports are sent to the New York office. The stipulation further shows that the company's 'executive officers and its executive office are located at 150 William Street, New York City. The general accounts of the company are kept in the office in New York City. The general accounting, underwriting and executive offices of the company are all located at the main office at 150 William Street, New York City. All cash and securities of the company are located there or in banks in that City or in other banks outside of the State of New Jersey, with the exception of the sum of $6,425.32 on deposit in New Jersey banks. All of the general affairs$of the company are conducted at the main office in New York City and have been so conducted there since appellant moved its main office from Newark six years ago.' No personal property tax is paid in New York. The company does pay there a franchise tax based upon premiums.\n\n The Board of Assessment of the City of Newark made an assessment, as of October 1, 1934, upon the capital stock paid in and accumulated surplus of the appellant, with deductions for debts and exemptions allowed by law. The assessment was sustained, in succession, by the \n\n[307 \nU.S. 313, 317]\n\u00a0\n Essex County Board of Taxation, by the New Jersey State Board of Tax Appeals, now an appellee, by the Supreme Court,4 and by the Court of Errors and Appeals, the highest court in the state. \n5\n Throughout the proceedings below the appellant resisted the jurisdiction of New Jersey to tax on the ground that its intangibles had acquired a business situs and the corporation a tax domicile in New York. Throughout, the state tribunals treated the assessment as upon personal property with a business situs in the sister state. The Supreme Court characterized the exaction as a personal property tax and discussed its validity 'in the light of the proofs ... upon the inescapable premise that ... the securities, the personalty involved, have become an integral part of (appellant's) business situs in New York. ...'6 It held that the state of domicile may impose a personal property tax upon intangibles which have acquired a business situs in another state and added that, in the absence of a New York personal property tax, multiple taxation was impossible. The Court of Errors and Appeals of New Jersey, per curiam, affirmed the judgment for the reasons expressed in the opinion of the Supreme Court. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n Appellant urges error in sustaining the assessment in the face of the conclusion that the tax is a property tax upon intangibles with a business situs in New York, the commercial domicile of the corporation. Such approval, it is claimed, violates the due process clause of the 14th Amendment, U.S.C.A.Const.\n The present tax, as administered, is levied upon an assessment of the full amount of capital stock and surplus. It is a tax on the net value of the corporation less allowable deductions, reached by taking liabilities from gross value of assets and subtracting exempt items from \n\n[307 \nU.S. 313, 318]\n\u00a0\n the remainder. This is apparently because capital stock and surplus are treated as invested in the exempt assets. \n8\n The value thus assessed is not determined by specific items but is the result of a calculation in which all assets are involved except those definitely exempted. Our conclusion makes it unnecessary to resolve doubts as to whether this is a property tax.\n When a state exercises its sovereign power to create a private corporation, that corporation becomes a citizen, and domiciled in the jurisdiction, of its creator. \n9\n There it must dwell. \n10\n The dominion of the state over its creature is complete. \n11\n In accordance with the ordinary recognition of the rule of mobilia sequuntur personam to determine the taxable situs of intangible personalty,12 the presumption is that such property is taxable by the state of the corporation's origin. \n13\n This power of New Jersey to tax is made effective by section 307 of the Act of 1918, heretofore quoted. It is the only tax sought by the state from corporations of this type, as the franchise tax, at one time levied,14 was repealed by the Act of April 8, 1903.15 \n\n[307 \nU.S. 313, 319]\n\u00a0\n There are occasions, however, when the use of intangible personalty in other states becomes so inextricably a part of the business there conducted that it becomes subject to taxation by that state. \n16\n The carrying on of the business of the corporation in New York, it is urged, has withdrawn its intangibles completely from the tax jurisdiction of New Jersey. With the assumption of a business situs and commercial domicile in New York, that state, under the authorities cited, would have the right to tax intangibles with this relation to its sovereignty. Appellant contends that if New York may levy a property tax on these intangibles, it will violate the due process clause of the 14th Amendment, U.S.C.A.Const., to permit New Jersey to do the same thing; that property cannot be in two places; that if it is in New York for tax purposes, it cannot be in New Jersey. We are asked to decide that both states have not the power to tax the same property for the same incidents. This question has been heretofore reserved. \n17\n We do not find it necessary to answer it in this case.\n Where consideration has been given to the existence of a business situs of intangibles for taxation by a state other than the state of domicile, there has been definite evidence that the intangibles were integral parts of the business conducted. In so far as the conclusion as to the existence of a business situs for the purpose of taxation, distinct from the domiciliary situs, is the basis for a claim of a Federal right, the duty of inquiring into the \n\n[307 \nU.S. 313, 320]\n\u00a0\n evidence which establishes such business situs rests upon this Court. \n18\n\u00a0\n\n In the Stempel, Bristol, Comptoir National, Metropolitan and Liverpool cases, cited in note 16, supra, the integration of the foreign- owned intangibles with local activities was evident from the continued course of business. The presence or absence of the evidences of the credits from the jurisdiction was immaterial. \n19\n The non-resident individuals and corporations carried on continuously a course of lending money or granting credits within the taxing states. The taxed intangibles grew out of these transactions. They were, in fact, a part of them. In the Wheeling Steel case, the same type of amalgamation occurred. West Virginia sought to tax a Delaware corporation on counts receivable and bank deposits. The opinion points out, 298 U.S. at pages 212 and 213, 56 S.Ct. at page 778, that these choses in action were the indebtedness for or the proceeds of sales confirmed in West Virginia, attributable 'to the place where they arise in the course of the business of making contracts of sale.' In First Bank Stock Corporation v. Minnesota, supra, another Delaware corporation was found to have established a commercial domicile for itself and given a business situs to certain of its intangibles. The intangibles in question were stocks of Montana and North Dakota state banks, purchased and held as part of the corporation's assets in its Minnesota business of holding the shares and managing, through stock ownership, the business of numerous banks, trust companies and other financial institutions of the Ninth Federal Reserve District. As this business was localized in Minnesota, the stocks of these banks were an essential factor of that business and therefore had a taxable situs in Minnesota. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 313, 321]\n\u00a0\n The conception of a business situs for intangibles enables the tax gathering entity to distribute the burden of its support equitably among those receiving its protection. It makes the notion of a tax situs for particular intangibles more definite. It is not the substitution of a new fiction as to the mass of choses in action for the established fiction of a tax situs at the place of incorporation. To overcome the presumption of domiciliary location, the proof of business situs must definitely connect the intangibles as an integral part of the local activity. The facts presented by this record fall far short of this requirement.\n The tax is upon 'the full amount of capital stock and surplus' less certain allowed deductions of real estate and exempt securities. The evidence gives no explanation of the amount or source of the assets making up the amount $3,370,080.66 which balances with the capital stock and surplus less these deductions. The stipulation shows 'agreed' figures,.$8, 107,901.83 presumably of capital and surplus, as shown below. \n20\n Agreed deductions are \n\n[307 \nU.S. 313, 322]\n\u00a0\n $4,737,821.17. But the assessment is $1,069,000. From the stipulation, we learn the 'general accounts' are kept in New York City and all cash except $ 6,425.32 and all securities are located at the New York office or in banks outside of New Jersey. If we assume that the 'general accounts' mentioned are the company's claims against agents, other insurance companies, and similar bills receivable, no progress is made towards their identification with New York business. Nothing is shown as to the volume of New York business in comparison with New Jersey or the other states. We are not told where business is accepted, moneys collected or insurance contracts made. The securities may represent local loans or investments in New Jersey or elsewhere made from funds derived from similar insurance contracts with a business situs at those points. 21 They may be the result of insurance activities of many kinds, taking place far from New York. If we were to assume that the intangibles of a corporation may have only one taxable situs, the mere fact that general affairs of a foreign corporation are conducted by general officers in New York without further evidence of the source and character of the intangibles does not destroy the taxability of a part of these intangibles by the state of the corporation's legal domicile. The presumption of a taxable situs solely in New Jersey is not overturned.\n Universal Insurance Company and Universal Indemnity Insurance Company have appeals involving the same questions. By stipulation these cases were consolidated for review below and appeal here. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 313, 323]\n\u00a0\n These appellants are New Jersey insurance corporations, assessed by the City of Newark in the same way, under the same statute and with the same result in the state courts as the appellant in No. 449.\n There are no significant distinctions between the cases. A management corporation handles these companies at a New York office, where accounts are payable. Seven per cent of the business of Universal Insurance Company originates in New Jersey. The corresponding percentage for the other company is not shown. As in No. 449, the record is silent as to the character, source and use of the securities and credits.\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER announced the following opinion, concurred in by Mr. Justice STONE, Mr. Justice BLACK, and Mr. Justice DOUGLAS.\n Wise tax policy is one thing; constitutional prohibition quite another. The task of devising means for distributing the burdens of taxation equitably has always challenged the wisdom of the wisest financial statesmen. Never has this been more true than today when wealth has so largely become the capitalization of expectancies derived from a complicated network of human relations. The adjustment of such relationships, with due regard to the promotion of enterprise and to the fiscal needs of different governments with which these relations are entwined, is peculiarly a phase of empirical legislation. It belongs to that range of the experimental activities of government1 which should not be constrained by rigid \n\n[307 \nU.S. 313, 324]\n\u00a0\n and artificial legal concepts. Especially important is it to abstain from intervention within the autonomous area of the legislative taxing power where there is no claim of encroachment by the states upon powers granted to the national government. It is not for us to sit in judgment on attempts by the states to evolve fair tax policies. When a tax appropriately challenged before us is not found to be in plain violation of the Constitution our task is ended.\n Chapter 236 of the New Jersey Laws of 1918, N.J.S.A. 54:4-1 et seq., as plied to the circumstances of these two cases, clearly does not offend the Constitution. In substance, such legislation has heretofore been found free from constitutional infirmity. Cream of Wheat Co. v. Grand Forks, \n253 \nU.S. 325\n, 40 S.Ct. 558, affirming 41 N.D. 330, 170 N.W. 863. During all the vicissitudes which the so-called 'jurisdiction-to-tax' doctrine has encountered since that case was decided, the extent of a state's taxing power over a corporation of its own creation, recognized in the Cream of Wheat case, has neither been restricted nor impaired. That case has not been cited otherwise than with approval. \n2\n Questions affecting the fictional 'situs' of intangibles, which received full consideration in Curry v. McCanless, \n307 \nU.S. 357\n, 59 S.Ct. 900, 83 L.Ed. --, decided this day, do not concern the present controversies. Cream of Wheat Co. v. Grand Forks, supra, and the cases that have followed it, afford a wholly adequate basis for affirming the judgments below. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 28 U.S.C.  344(a), 28 U.S.C.A.  344(a). \n[\nFootnote 2\n] N.J.Laws 1918, p. 847; also in N.J.Rev.Stats. 1937, 54:4-1 et seq., J.S.A. 54:4-1 et seq. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] N.J.Laws 1902, c. 134, section 3, second, 408; N.J.Laws 1929, c. 6, section 3, second, p. 18, and c. 47, section 1, p. 82, N.J.S.A.  17:26-1 to 17:26-3.

WOODROUGH(1939)\nNo. 810\nArgued: April 28, 1939Decided: April 28, 1939\n\n\n May 22, 1939 \n\n[307 \nU.S. 277, 278]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Frank Murphy, Atty. Gen., and Robert H. Jackson, Sol. Gen., for appellant.\n Messrs. J. A. C. Kennedy and George L. DeLacy, both of Omaha, Neb., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The case is here under Section 2 of the Act of August 24, 1937, 50 Stat. 751, 752, 28 U.S.C.A.  349a, as a direct appeal from a judgment of a district court whose 'decision was against the constitutionality' of an Act of Congress. The suit below, an action at law to recover a tax on income claimed to have been illegally exacted, was disposed of upon the pleadings and turned on the single question now before us, to wit: Is the provision of Section 22 of the Revenue Act of 1932, \n\n[307 \nU.S. 277, 279]\n\u00a0\n 47 Stat. 169, 178, reenacted by Section 22(a) of the Revenue Act of 1936, 49 Stat. 1648, 1657, 26 U.S.C.A.  22(a), constitutional insofar as it included in the 'gross income', on the basis of which taxes were to be paid, the compensation of 'judges of courts of the United States taking office after June 6, 1932'.\n That this is the sole issue will emerge from a simple statement of the facts and of the governing legislation. Joseph W. Woodrough was appointed a United States circuit judge on April 12, 1933, and qualified as such on May 1, 1933. For the calendar year of 1936 a joint income tax return of Judge Woodrough and his wife disclosed his judicial salary of $ 12,500, but claimed it to be constitutionally immune from taxation. Since it was not included in 'gross income' no tax was payable. Subsequently a deficiency of $631.60 was assessed on the basis of that item, which, with interest, was paid under protest. Claim for refund having been rejected, the present suit was brought, and judgment went against the Collector. The assessment of the present tax was technically under the Act of 1936, but that Act merely carried forward the provisions of the Act of 1932, for the inclusion of compensation of 'judges of courts of the United States taking office after June 6, 1932' which had been similarly incorporated in the Revenue Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 680, 686, 687, 26 U.S.C.A.  22(a). Therefore, the power of Congress to include Judge Woodrough's salary as a circuit judge in his 'gross income' must be judged on the basis of the validity of Section 22 of the Revenue Act of 1932, and not as though that power had been originally asserted by the Revenue Act of 1936. For it was the Act of June 6, 1932 that gave notice to all judges thereafter to be appointed, of the new Congressional policy to include the judicial salaries of such judges in the assessment of income taxes. The fact that Judge Woodrough before he became a circuit judge and prior to June 6, 1932, had been a district judge \n\n[307 \nU.S. 277, 280]\n\u00a0\n is wholly irrelevant to the matter in issue. The two offices have different statutory origins, are filled by separate nominations and confirmations, and enjoy different emoluments. A new appointee to a circuit court of appeals occupies a new office no less when he is taken from the district bench than when he is drawn from the bar.\n By means of Section 22 of the Revenue Act of 1932, Congress sought to avoid, at least in part, the consequences of Evans v. Gore, \n253 \nU.S. 245\n, 40 S.Ct. 550, 11 A.L.R. 519. That case, decided on June 1, 1920, ruled for the first time that a provision requiring the compensation received by the judges of the United States to be included in the 'gross income' from which the net income is to be computed, although merely part of a taxing measure of general, non-discriminatory application to all earners of incomes, is contrary to Article III,  1 of the Constitution, U. S.C.A., which provides that the 'Compensation' of the 'Judges' 'shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office.' See also the separate opinion of Mr. Justice Field in Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., \n157 \nU.S. 429, 586\n, 604 S. et seq., 15 S.Ct. 673, 691, 698. To be sure, in a letter to Secretary Chase, Chief Justice Taney expressed similar views. \n1\n In doing so, he merely gave his extra-judicial opinion asserting at the same time that the question could not be adjudicated. \n2\n Chief Justice Taney's vigorous views were shared by Attorney General Hoar. 3 Thereafter, both the Treasury Department4 and Con- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 277, 281]\n\u00a0\n gress5 acted upon this construction of the Constitution. However, the meaning which Evans v. Gore, supra, imputed to the history which explains Article III,  1 was contrary to the way in which it was read by other English-speaking courts. \n6\n The decision met wide and steadily growing disfavor from legal scholarship and professional opinion. \n7\n Evans v. Gore, supra, itself was rejected by most of the courts before whom the matter came after that decision. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n Having regard to these circumstances, the question immediately before us is whether Congress exceeded its constitutional power in providing that United States judges \n\n[307 \nU.S. 277, 282]\n\u00a0\n appointed after the Revenue Act of 1932 shall not enjoy immunity from the incidences of taxation to which everyone else within the defined classes of income is subjected. Thereby, of course, Congress has committed itself to the position that a non-discriminatory tax laid generally on net income is not, when applied to the income of a federal judge, a diminution of his salary within the prohibition of Article III,  1 of the Constitution. To suggest that it makes inroads upon the independence of judges who took office after Congress had thus charged them with the common duties of citizenship, by making them bear their aliquot share of the cost of maintaining the Government, is to trivialize the great historic experience on which the framers based the safeguards of Article III,  1.9 To subject them to a general tax is merely to recognize that judges are also citizens, and that their particular function in government does not generate an immunity from sharing with their fellow citizens the material burden of the government whose Constitution and laws they are charged with administering.\n After this case came here, Congress, by Section 3 of the Public Salary Tax Act of 1939, amended Section 22(a) so as to make it applicable to 'judges of courts of the United States who took office on or before June 6, 1932 '10 That Section, however, is not now before us. But to the extent \n\n[307 \nU.S. 277, 283]\n\u00a0\n that what the Court now says is inconsistent with what was said in Miles v. Graham, \n268 \nU.S. 501\n, 45 S.Ct. 601, the latter cannot survive.\n Judgment reversed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS did not hear the argument in this cause and took no part in its consideration or decision.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER, dissenting.\n Concretely, the question is whether, by exacting from United States circuit judge Joseph W. Woodrough and his wife $631.60 in the form of income tax on his salary of $12,500 for 1936, the government diminished the compensation for his services theretofore fixed by Congress. That item excluded, they had no taxable income. The judge's monthly pay was $1,041. 66. The tax took at the monthly rate of $52.63.\n The material details may be given briefly.\n April 12, 1933, Judge Woodrough was appointed judge of the United States circuit court of appeals for the eighth circuit. He qualified May 1, 1933. Congress had by the Act of December 13, 1926,1 enacted that 'To each of the circuit judges the sum of $12,500 per year' shall be paid as compensation. Since May 1, 1933, appellee has received the specified pay. The Revenue Act of June 6, 1932, applicable only to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1931, contained a provision declaring that in the case of judges taking office after that date 'the compensation received as such shall be included in gross income; and all Acts fixing the compensation of such ... judges are hereby amended accordingly.' \n2\n The Revenue Act of 1934,3 applicable only to taxable \n\n[307 \nU.S. 277, 284]\n\u00a0\n years beginning after December 31, 1933, and that of 1936,4 applicable only to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1935, contain the same language as that just quoted from the Act of 1932.\n Judge Woodrough and his wife made a joint income tax return for 1936; it disclosed his salary but claimed it was not subject to the tax. The commissioner held the item taxable and made a deficiency assessment of $ 631.60 Plaintiffs paid under protest and filed claim for refund; it was denied. Claiming the tax that they were so compelled to pay diminished the judge's compensation and that therefore  22(a) of the Act of 1936 violates  1, Art. III, of the Constitution, U.S.C.A., plaintiffs sued to recover the amount of the tax. The collector moved to dismiss. The court held the Act unconstitutional, overruled the motion and, defendant having elected not to plead further, gave plaintiffs judgment as prayed. Defendant appealed. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n Article III,  1, declares: 'The Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good behaviour, and shall, at stated Times, receive for their Services, a Compensation, which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office.'\n It safeguards the independence of the judiciary. The abuse against which it was intended to be a barrier is included in the list of reasons for our Declaration of Independence. 'The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States ... He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.-He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the \n\n[307 \nU.S. 277, 285]\n\u00a0\n tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.'\n Alexander Hamilton, explaining the reasons for and the purpose of  1 of Art. III, said:\n'The Executive not only dispenses the honors, but holds the sword of the community. The legislature not only commands the purse, but prescribes the rules by which the duties and rights of every citizen are to be regulated. The judiciary, on the contrary, has no influence over either the sword or the purse; no direction either of the strength or of the wealth of the society; and can take no active resolution whatever. It may truly be said to have neither force nor will, but merely judgment ...\n\n'This simple view of the matter ... proves incontestably, that the judiciary is beyond comparison the weakest of the three departments of power; that it can never attack with success either of the other two; and that all possible care is requisite to enable it to defend itself against their attacks ....\n\n'The complete independence of the courts of justice is peculiarly essential in a limited Constitution. By a limited Constitution, I understand one which contains certain specified exceptions to the legislative authority; such, for instance, as that it shall pass no bills of attainder, no expost-facto laws, and the like. Limitations of this kind can be preserved in practice no other way than through the medium of courts of justice, whose duty it must be to declare all acts contrary to the manifest tenor of the Constitution void. Without this, all the reservations of particular rights or privileges would amount to nothing ....' (The Federalist, No. 78.)\n\n'Next to permanency in office, nothing can contribute more to the independence of the judges than a fixed provision for their support ... In the general course of human nature, a power over a man's subsistence amounts \n\n[307 \nU.S. 277, 286]\n\u00a0\n to a power over his will ... The enlightened friends to good government in every State, have seen cause to lament the want of precise and explicit precautions in the State constitutions on this head. Some of these indeed have declared that permanent salaries should be established for the judges, but the experiment has in some instances shown that such expressions are not sufficiently definite to preclude legislative evasions. Something still more positive and unequivocal has been evinced to be requisite ... This provision for the support of the judges bears every mark of prudence and efficacy; and it may be safely affirmed that, together with the permanent tenure of their offices, it affords a better prospect of their independence than is discoverable in the constitutions of any of the States in regard to their own judges.' (The Federalist, No. 79.)\n\n Mr. Justice Story declared that 'Without this provision, the other, as to the tenure of office, would have been utterly nugatory, and indeed a mere mockery ....' 2 Story,  1628. Chancellor Kent said: 'The provision for the permanent support of the judges is well calculated, in addition to the tenure of their office, to give them the requisite independence. It tends, also, to secure a succession of learned men on the bench, who, in consequence of a certain undiminished support, are enabled and induced to quit the lucrative pursuits of private business for the duties of that important station. The constitution of the United States, on this subject, was an improvement upon all our previously existing constitutions.' 1 Kent Com. 294.\n The first judicial construction of the clause was by the circuit court of the District of Columbia in 1803 in the case of United States v. More. \n6\n The opinion was written by Judge Cranch. The court sustained a demurrer to an \n\n[307 \nU.S. 277, 287]\n\u00a0\n indictment charging that More, a justice of the peace, under color of his office, exacted an illegal fee, 12 cents, for giving judgment upon a warrant for a small debt. The issue was whether an Act of Congress abolishing fees of justices of the peace in the District of Columbia could affect those who accepted their commissions while the fees were legally annexed to the office. The court said: 'The 3d article of the constitution provides for the independence of the judges of the courts of the United States, by certain regulations; one of which is, that they shall receive, at stated times, a compensation for their services, which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office. The act of Congress of 27th of February, 1801, which constitutes the office of justices of the peace ... ascertains the compensation which they shall have for their services in holding their courts .... This compensation is given in the form of fees, payable when the services are rendered. ... that his (the justice's) compensation shall not be diminished during his continuance in office, seems to follow as a necessary consequence from the provisions of the constitution. ... if his compensation has once been fixed by law, a subsequent law for diminishing that compensation (a fortiori for abolishing it) cannot affect that justice of the peace during his continuance in office; ....'\n The first attempt to tax compensation of federal judges was during the Civil War. Section 86 of the Act of July 1, 1862,7 levied 'on all salaries of officers, or payments to persons in the ... service of the United States ... when exceeding the rate of six hundred dollars per annum, a duty of three per centum on the excess above the said six hundred dollars', and directed disbursing officers to deduct and withhold the duty. These general provisions were construed by the revenue \n\n[307 \nU.S. 277, 288]\n\u00a0\n officers to comprehend the compensation of the President and the judges of the United States. By letter of February 16, 1863, Mr. Chief Justice Taney protested to the Secretary of the Treasury In the course of his letter,8 he said:\n'The act in question, as you interpret it, diminishes the compensation of every judge three per cent, and if it can be diminished to that extent by the name of a tax, it may in the same way be reduced from time to time at the pleasure of the legislature.\n\n'The Judiciary is one of the three great departments of the government, created and established by the Constitution. Its duties and powers are specifically set forth, and are of a character that requires it to be perfectly independent of the two other departments, and in order to place it beyond the reach and above even the suspicion of any such influence, the power to reduce their compensation is expressly withheld from Congress, and excepted from their powers of legislation.\n\n'Language could not be more plain than that used in the Constitution. It is moreover one of its most important and essential provisions. For the articles which limit the powers of the legislative and executive branches of the government, and those which provide safeguards for the protection of the citizen in his person and property, would be of little value without a judiciary to uphold and maintain them, which was free from every influence, direct or indirect, that might by possibility in times of political excitement warp their judgments. ...\n\n'Having been honored with the highest judicial station under the Constitution, I feel it to be more especially my duty to uphold and maintain the constitutional rights of that department of the government, and not by any act or word of mine, leave it to be supposed that I acquiesce in a measure that displaces it from the independent posi- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 277, 289]\n\u00a0\n tion assigned it by the statesmen who framed the Constitution; and in order to guard against any such inference, I present to you this respectful but firm and decided remonstrance against the authority you have exercised under this act of Congress, and request you to place this protest upon the public files of your office as the evidence that I have done everything in my power to preserve and maintain the Judicial Department in the position and rank in the government which the Constitution has assigned to it.'\n\n The letter of the Chief Justice was not answered and, at his request, the Court, May 10, 1863, ordered the letter entered on its records. In 1869, the Secretary of the Treasury requested the opinion of Attorney General Ebenezer Rockwood Hoar as to the constitutionality of the Act construed to extend to judges' salaries. He rendered an opinion in substantial accord with the views expressed in Chief Justice Taney's protest. 13 Op.Attys.Gen. 161. Accordingly, the tax on the compensation of the President and of judges was discontinued and the amounts theretofore collected from them were refunded-some through administrative channels; others through action of the court of claims and ensuing appropriations by Congress. See Wayne v. United States, 26 Ct.Cl. 274, 290; 27 Stat. 306.\n In 1889, Mr. Justice Miller, a member of the Court since 1862, said:9\n'The Constitution of the United States has placed several limitations upon the general power (of taxation), and ... some of them are implied. One of its provisions is that neither the President of the United States ( Art. II, sec. 1, par. 6), nor a judge of the Supreme or inferior courts ( Art. III, sec. 1), shall have his salary diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected, or during his continuance in office. It is very clear that \n\n[307 \nU.S. 277, 290]\n\u00a0\n when Congress, during the late (Civil) war, levied an income tax, and placed it as well upon the salaries of the President and the judges of the courts as those of other people, that it was a diminution of them to just that extent.'\n\n Although the Income Tax Act of 1894 said nothing about the compensation of the judges, Mr. Justice Field construed  3310 to tax that compensation and assigned that ground among others for joining in the decision that the Act was unconstitutional. Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., \n157 \nU.S. 429\n, 604-606, 15 S.Ct. 673, 698, 699. Mr. Justice Field, who was confirmed the day this Court ordered Chief Justice Taney's letter entered on its records, had taken his place upon this bench at the beginning of the following term. His opinion recited the facts of that incident and quoted extensively from the letter, which was printed as an appendix to the volume of the reports containing the opinions in the Pollock case. \n157 \nU.S. 701\n, 15 S.Ct. ix. The Justice ended his discussion of the matter by stating his belief, based on information, that the opinion of Attorney General Hoar had been followed ever since without question by the Treasury. And, upon reargument of the cause, Attorney General Olney said in his brief: 'There has never been a doubt since the opinion of Attorney General Hoar that the salaries of the President and judges were exempt.'\n The Revenue Acts of 191311 and 191612, being the first two after adoption of the Sixteenth Amendment, U.S.C.A.Const., ex- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 277, 291]\n\u00a0\n pressly excluded from gross income the compensation of judges then in office. But after this country engaged in the World War, the Revenue Act of 1918, approved February 24, 1919, defined gross income to include 'in the case of the President ... (and) the judges of the Supreme and inferior courts ... the compensation received as such.' \n13\n The reports of the congressional committees having the measure in charge indicate that the Congress was in doubt as to the constitutional validity of that provision and intended to have the question decided by the courts. \n14\n The question was raised and presented for decision in Evans v. Gore, \n253 \nU.S. 245\n, 40 S.Ct. 550, 551, 11 A.L.R. 519. The Collector included the salary for 1918 of Judge Evans, appointed before enactment of the taxing statute, in gross income. Had it been excluded, he would have had no taxable income. He paid the tax and brought suit to recover the amount so exacted. The United States district court for the western district of Kentucky held him not entitled to recover. But, after argument by eminent counsel including the Solicitor General, this Court held that the clause declaring that compensation of judges 'shall not be diminished during their continuance in office' prevents diminution by taxation and that it has been so construed in the actual practice of the government.\n For the purpose of disclosing the reasons for and true meaning of the clause forbidding diminution of compensation of judges, the opinion of the Court, written by Mr. Justice Van Devanter, brought forward statements of Alexander Hamilton, Chief Justice Marshall, Justice Story, Chancellor Kent, Chief Justice Taney, Justice Field, Attorneys General Hoar and Olney and others. sess., p. 29; Sen.Rept. No. 617, 65th 10370. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 277, 292]\n\u00a0\n Speaking for the Court, he said:\n'With what purpose does the Constitution provide that the compensation of the judges 'shall not be diminished during their continuance in office'? Is it primarily to benefit the judges, or rather to promote the public weal by giving them that independence which makes for an impartial and courageous discharge of the judicial function? Does the provision merely forbid direct diminution, such as expressly reducing the compensation from a greater to a less sum per year, and thereby leave the way open for indirect, yet effective, diminution, such as withholding or calling back a part as a tax on the whole? Or, does it mean that the judge shall have a sure and continuing right to the compensation, whereon he confidently may rely for his support during his continuance in office, so that he need have no apprehension lest his situation in this regard may be changed to his disadvantage?\n\n'... The primary purpose of the prohibition against diminution was not to benefit the judges, but, like the clause in respect of tenure, to attract good and competent men to the bench and to promote that independence of action and judgment which is essential to the maintenance of the guaranties, limitations, and pervading principles of the Constitution and to the administration of justice without respect to persons and with equal concern for the poor and the rich. Such being its purpose, it is to be construed, not as a private grant, but as a limitation imposed in the public interest; in other words, not restrictively, but in accord with its spirit and the principle on which it proceeds.\n\n'Obviously, diminution may be effected in more ways than one. Some may be direct and others indirect, or even evasive as Mr. Hamilton suggested. But all which by their necessary operation and effect withhold or take from the judge a part of that which has been promised by \n\n[307 \nU.S. 277, 293]\n\u00a0\n law for his services must be regarded as within the prohibition. Nothing short of this will give full effect to its spirit and principle. Here the plaintiff was paid the full compensation, but was subjected to an involuntary obligation to pay back a part, and the obligation was promptly enforced. Of what avail to him was the part which was paid with one hand and then taken back with the other? Was he not placed in practically the same situation as if it had been withheld in the first instance? Only by subordinating substance to mere form could it be held that his compensation was not diminished. ...\n\n'The prohibition is general, contains no excepting words, and appears to be directed against all diminution, whether for one purpose or another; and the reasons for its adoption, as publicly assigned at the time and commonly accepted ever since, make with impelling force for the conclusion that the fathers of the Constitution intended to prohibit diminution by taxation as well as otherwise-that they regarded the independence of the judges as of far greater importance than any revenue that could come from taxing their salaries. ...\n\n'When we consider ... what is comprehended in the congressional power to tax-where its exertion is not directly or impliedly interdicted- it becomes additionally manifest that the prohibition now under discussion was intended to embrace and prevent diminution through the exertion of that power; for, as this court repeatedly has held, the power to tax carries with it 'the power to embarrass and destroy'; may be applied to every object within its range 'in such measure as Congress may determine'; enables that body 'to select one lling and omit another, to tax one class of property and to forebear to tax another'; and may be applied in different ways to different objects so long as there is 'geographical uniformity' in the duties, imposts and excises imposed. (Citing.) Is it not therefore morally certain that the discern- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 277, 294]\n\u00a0\n ing statesmen who framed the Constitution and were so sedulously bent on securing the independence of the judiciary intended to protect the compensation of the judges from assault and diminution in the name or form of a tax? Could not the purpose of the prohibition be wholly thwarted if this avenue of attack were left open? Certainly there is nothing in the words of the prohibition indicating that it is directed against one legislative power and not another; and in our opinion due regard for its spirit and principle requires that it be taken as directed against them all.'\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes wrote a dissenting opinion, in which Mr. Justice Brandeis joined. With that expression his opposition to the decision ended. Two years later, in Gillespie v. Oklahoma, \n257 \nU.S. 501\n, 42 S.Ct. 171, writing for the Court, invalidating a state tax upon net income of a lessee from sales of his share of oil and gas received under leases of restricted Indian land, he said (257 U.S. page 505, 42 S.Ct. page 172): 'In cases where the principal is absolutely immune from interference an inquiry is allowed into the sources from which net income is derived and if a part of it comes from such a source the tax is pro tanto void, Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., \n157 \nU.S. 429\n, 15 S.Ct. 673; Id., \n158 \nU.S. 601\n, 15 S.Ct. 912; a rule lately illustrated by Evans v. Gore ...' And in that case he relied on the truth, as put by Chief Justice Marshall in M'Culloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 431, that 'the power to tax involves the power to destroy.' He quoted (257 U.S. page 505, 42 S.Ct. page 172) with approval from Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co. v. Oklahoma, \n240 \nU.S. 522\n, 36 S.Ct. 453, the statement of the opinion (240 U. S. page 530, 36 S.Ct. page 456) that \"A tax upon the leases is a tax upon the power to make them, and could be used to destroy the power to make them.\"15 \n\n[307 \nU.S. 277, 295]\n\u00a0\n Miles v. Graham, 1925, \n268 \nU.S. 501\n, 45 S.Ct. 601, 602, held invalid  213(a), Revenue Act of 1918, (condemned in Evans v. Gore) when applied to compensation of Judge Graham, \n\n[307 \nU.S. 277, 296]\n\u00a0\n appointed after its enactment. Mr. Justice Holmes joined in the decision. Mr. Justice Brandeis merely noted dissent.\n In the course of the opinion, we said:\n'Does the circumstance that defendant in error's appointment came after the taxing act require a different view concerning his right to exemption? The answer depends upon the import of the word 'compensation' in the constitutional provision.\n\n'The words and history of the clause indicate that the purpose was to impose upon Congress the duty definitely to declare what sum shall be received by each judge out of the public funds and the times for payment. When this duty has been complied with, the amount specified becomes the compensation which is protected against diminution during his continuance in office.\n\n'... The compensation fixed by law when defendant in error assumed his official duties was $7,500 per annum, and to exact a tax in respect of this would diminish it within the plain rule of Evans v. Gore.\n\n'The taxing Act became a law (February 24, 1919) prior to the statute prescribing salaries for judges of the Court of Claims (approved February 25, 1919), but if the dates were reversed it would be impossible to construe the former as an amendment which reduced salaries by the amount of the tax imposed. No judge is required to pay a definite percentage of his salary, but all are commanded to return, as a part of 'gross income,' 'the compensation received as such' from the United States. From the 'gross income' various deductions and credits are allowed, as for interest paid, contributions or gifts made, personal exemptions varying with family relations, etc., and upon the net result assessment is made. The plain purpose was to require all judges to return their compensation as an item of 'gross income,' and to tax this as other salaries. This is forbidden by the Constitution. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 277, 297]\n\u00a0\n 'The power of Congress definitely to fix the compensation to be received at stated intervals by judges thereafter appointed is clear. It is equally clear, we think, that there is no power to tax a judge of a court of the United States on account of the salary prescribed for him by law.'\n\n In O'Donoghue v. United States, 1933, \n289 \nU.S. 516\n, 53 S.Ct. 740, 741, we construed the Act of June 30, 193216 reducing the salaries of all judges 'except judges whose compensation may not, under the Constitution, be diminished during their continuance in office.' We there held that the supreme court and court of appeals of the District of Columbia were constitutional courts and therefore that the judges of those courts were excepted from the salary reduction. We cited the authorities, adopted the reasoning, and reaffirmed the conclusions on which rest the Court's judgments in Evans v. Gore, supra, and Miles v. Graham, supra. And see Booth v. United States, \n291 \nU.S. 339\n, 54 S.Ct. 379.\n Evidently the Court intends to destroy the decision in Evans v. Gore, supra. Without suggesting that there is any distinction between that case and Miles v. Graham, supra, it declares that the latter 'cannot survive.' But the decision of today fails to deal with, much less to detract from the reasoning of those cases. The opinion would imply that the letter of Chief Justice Taney to the Secretary of the Treasury, and the separate opinion of Mr. Justice Field in the Pollock case were treated as having weight as judicial decisions. But nowhere has that ever been suggested. However, all who are familiar with our judicial history know that entitled to great respect are the reasoned conclusions of these eminent American jurists as to the true intent and meaning of the Constitution of the United States. And similarly worthy of attention are the opinions of the Attorneys General and other public officials following the reasoning of Chief Justice Taney. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 277, 298]\n\u00a0\n Now the Court cites, as if entitled to prevail against those well- sustained opinions and the deliberate judgments of this Court, opposing views-if indeed upon examination they reasonably may be so deemed-of English speaking judges in foreign countries.\n It refers, footnote 6, to the decision of the Privy Council in Judges v. Attorney-General of Saskatchewan, 1937, 2 D.L.R. 209, construing income tax statutes of Saskatchewan. Neither the Dominion nor the Province has any law forbidding diminution of compensation of judges while in office and that decision has nothing to do with the question before us. The Australian and South African cases cited, footnotes 6 and 8, involved construction of income tax statutes under constitutions or charters created by legislative enactments and subject to authoritative interpretation or change by the local or British Parliament. They shed no light upon the issue in this case.\n The opinion claims no support from any state court decision. The one it cites, footnote 8, that of the Maryland Court of Appeals in Gordy v. Dennis, 5 A.2d 69, held that under a clause in the Constitution of Maryland like that in Art. III,  1, the compensation of state judges may not be taxed.\n The opinion also cites, footnote 7, selected gainsaying writings of professors,-some are lawyers and some are not-but without specification of or reference to the reasons upon which their views rest. And in addition it cites notes published in law reviews, some signed and some not; presumably the latter were prepared by law students.\n The suggestion that, as citizens, judges are not immune from taxation begs the question here presented. The Constitution itself puts judges in a separate class, declaring that at stated times they shall receive for their services compensation which 'shall not be diminished.' And so their salaries are distinguished from income of \n\n[307 \nU.S. 277, 299]\n\u00a0\n others. The immunity extends only to compensation for their services. No question of comparison or reasonableness is involved.\n Admittedly the Court now repudiates its earlier decisions upon the point here in issue. The provision defining tenure and providing for undiminishable compensation was adopted with unusual accord. There has been unanimity of opinion that, because in comparison with the legislative and executive the judicial department is weak, its independence is essential to our system of government. These safeguards go far to insure that independence. And, from the beginning, statesmen and jurists have agreed that the clause forbids diminution of judges' compensation by any form of legislation. The clause in question is plain: no exception is expressed; none may be implied. Its unqualified command should be given effect.\n For one convinced that the judgment now given is wrong, it is impossible to acquiesce or merely to note dissent. And so this opinion is written to indicate the grounds of opposition and to evidence regret that another landmark has been removed.\n I am of opinion that the judgment of the district court should be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The letter was written on February 16, 1863, and will be found in \n157 \nU.S. 701\n. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] '...

O'Keefe, \n306 \nU.S. 466\n, 59 S.Ct. 595, 603, 120 A.L.R. 1466, October Term, 1938. It is there said: 'A succession of decisions ( Gillespie v. Oklahoma is the first cited) thereby withdrew from the taxing power of the States and Nation a very considerable range of wealth without regard to the actual workings of our federalism, and this, too, when the financial needs of all governments began steadily to mount.'\n At another place in that concurrence, the writer stated: 'The volume of the Court's business has long since made impossible the early healthy practice whereby the Justices gave expression to individual opinions. But the old tradition still has relevance when an important shift in constitutional doctrine is announced after a reconstruction in the membership of the Court. ... The arguments upon which M'Culloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, rested ... have been distorted by sterile refinements unrelated to fairs. \n These refinements derived authority from an unfortunate remark in the opinion in M'Culloch v. Maryland. Partly as a flourish of rhetoric and partly because the intellectual fashion of the times indulged a free use of absolutes, Chief Justice Marshall gave currency to the phrase that 'the power to tax involves the power to destroy.' ... The web of unreality spun from Marshall's famous dictum was brushed away by one stroke of Mr. Justice Holmes's pen: 'The power to tax is not the power to destroy while this Court sits'. Panhandle Oil Co. v. Mississippi, \n277 \nU.S. 218, 223\n, 48 S.Ct. 451, 453, 56 A.L.R. 583 (dissent).'\n But, in the Gillespie case, Mr. Justice Holmes, speaking for the Court, had definitely applied the doctrine that the power to tax does involve the power to destroy.\n In the Panhandle case neither the Court, nor indeed another justice dissenting, was impressed by 'The power to tax is not the power to destroy while this Court sits.' The statement is vague and may be read to imply a power that this Court never possessed. If taken to mean that we are empowered to regulate or to limit the exertion by Congress of its power of taxation, it justly may be regarded as hyperbole; if taken to mean that this Court has power to prevent imposition by Congress of taxes laid to discourage, to destroy, or to protect, then it is in the teeth of the law.

Cotton, of San Francisco, Cal., for respondent, Industrial Accident Commission of California. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 493, 497]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question is whether the full faith and credit which the Constitution requires to be given to a Massachusetts workmen's compensation statute precludes California from applying its own workmen's compensation act in the case of an injury suffered by a Massachusetts employee of a Massachusetts employer while in California in the course of his employment.\n Petitioner, an insurance carrier, under the California Workmen's Compensation, Insurance and Safety Act, for the Pacific Coast branch of the employer, Dewey & Almy Chemical Company, a Massachusetts corporation, filed its petition in the California District Court of Appeal to set aside an award of compensation to an employee by the California Industrial Accident Commission. The grounds of the petition were, among others, that the employee, because he was regularly employed at the head office of the corporation in Massachusetts and was temporarily in California on the business of the employer when injured there, was subject to the workmen's compensation law of Massachusetts, and that the California Commission, in applying the California Act and in refusing to recognize the Massachusetts statute as a defense, had denied to the latter the full faith and credit to which it was entitled under Article 4,  1 of the Constitution, U.S.C.A. The order of the District Court of Appeal denying the petition was affirmed by the Supreme Court of California. 10 Cal.2d 567, 75 P.2d 1058. We granted certiorari October 10, 1938, the question presented being of public importance. \n305 \nU.S. 563\n, 59 S.Ct. 76, 83 L.Ed. --.\n The injured employee, a resident of Massachusetts, was regularly employed there under written contract in the laboratories of the Dewey & Almy Chemical Company as a chemical engineer and research chemist. In \n\n[306 \nU.S. 493, 498]\n\u00a0\n September 1935, in the usual course of his employment he was sent by his employer to its branch factory in California, to act temporarily as technical adviser in the effort to improve the quality of one of the employer's products manufactured there. Upon completion of the assignment he expected to return to the employer's Massachusetts place of business, and while in California he remained subject to the general direction and control of the employer's Massachusetts office, from which his compensation was paid.\n He instituted the present proceeding before the California Commission for the award of compensation under the California Act for injuries received in the course of his employment in that state, naming petitioner as insurance carrier under that Act; the Hartford Accident & Indemnity Company, as insurer under the Massachusetts Act, was made a party. The California Commission directed petitioner to pay the compensation prescribed by the California Act, including the amounts of lien claims filed in the proceeding for medical, hospital and nursing services and certain further amounts necessary for such services in the future.\n By the applicable Massachusetts statute,  24, 26, c. 152, Mass.Gen. Laws (Ter.Ed.1932), an employee of a person insured under the Act, as was the employer in this case, is deemed to waive his 'right of action at common law or under the law of any other jurisdiction' to recover for personal injuries unless he shall have given appropriate notice to the employer in writing that he elects to retain such rights. Section 26 directs that without the notice his right to recover be restricted to the compensation provided by the Act for injuries received in the course of his employment, 'whether within or without the commonwealth.' See McLaughlin's Case, 274 Mass. 217, 174 N.E. 338; Migues' Case, 281 Mass. 373, 183 N.E. 847. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 493, 499]\n\u00a0\n Article 20,  21 of the California Constitution vests the legislature with plenary power 'to create and enforce a complete system of workmen's compensation', including 'adequate provisions for the comfort, health and safety and general welfare' of employees injured in the course of their employment, and their dependents, and to make 'full provision for such medical, surgical, hospital and other remedial treatment as is requisite to cure and relieve from the effects of such injury'. Sections 6, 9 and 29 of the California Workmen's Compensation, Insurance and Safety Act, Cal. Gen.Laws (Deering 1931) Act 4749, provide for compensation from insurance procured by the employer, in prescribed amounts, for injuries received by his employees in the course of their employment without regard to negligence and for the costs of medical attendance occasioned by the injuries. Section 27(a) provides that 'No contract, rule or regulation shall exempt the employer from liability for the compensation fixed by this act'. And  58 provides that the commission shall have jurisdiction over claims for compensation for injuries suffered outside the state when the employee's contract of hire was entered into within the state. See Quong Ham Wah Co. v. Industrial Accident Comm., 184 Cal. 26, 192 P. 1021, 12 A.L.R. 1190. Both statutes are compensation acts, substituted for the common law remedy for negligence. The California Act is compulsory.  6(a). The Massachusetts Act is similarly effective unless the employee gives notice not to be bound by it, which in this case he did not do.  24.\n Petitioner, which as insurance carrier has assumed the liability of the employer under the California Act, relies on the provisions of the Massachusetts Act that the compensation shall be that prescribed for injuries suffered in the course of the employment, whether within or without the state. It insists that since the contract of employment was entered into in Massachusetts and the \n\n[306 \nU.S. 493, 500]\n\u00a0\n employer consented to be bound by the Massachusetts Act, that, and not the California statute, fixes the employee's right to compensation whether the injuries were received within or without the state, and that the Massachusetts statute is constitutionally entitled to full faith and credit in the courts of California.\n We may assume that these provisions are controlling upon the parties in Massachusetts, and that since they are applicable to a Massachusetts contract of employment between a Massachusetts employer and employee, they do not infringe due process. Bradford Electric Light Co. v. Clapper, \n286 \nU.S. 145\n, 156 et seq., 52 S.Ct. 571, 574 et seq., 82 A.L.R. 696. Similarly the constitutionality of the provisions of the California statute awarding compensation for injuries to an employee occurring within its borders, and for injuries as well occurring elsewhere, when the contract of employment was entered into within the state, is not open to question. Alaska Packers Association v. Industrial Accident Comm., \n294 \nU.S. 532\n, 55 S.Ct. 518; New York Central R. Co. v. White, \n243 \nU.S. 188\n, 37 S.Ct. 247, L.R.A.1917D, 1, Ann.Cas.1917D, 629; Mountain Timber Co. v. Washington, \n243 \nU.S. 219\n, 37 S.Ct. 260, Ann.Cas.1917D, 642.\n While in the circumstances now presented, either state, if its system for administering workmen's compensation permitted, would be free to adopt and enforce the remedy provided by the statute of the other, here each has provided for itself an exclusive remedy for a liability which it was constitutionally authorized to impose. But neither is bound, apart from the compulsion of the full faith and credit clause, to enforce the laws of the other, Milwaukee County v. White Co., \n296 \nU.S. 268, 272\n, 56 S.Ct. 229, 231; and the law of neither can by its own force determine the choice of law to be applied in the other. Cf. Ohio v. Chattanooga Boiler & Tank Co., \n289 \nU.S. 439\n, 53 S.Ct. 663. Petitioner, pointing to the conflict between the provisions of the two statutes, insists that the full faith and credit clause requires recognition of the Massachusetts statute as providing the ex- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 493, 501]\n\u00a0\n clusive remedy and as a defense to any proceeding for the award of compensation under the California Act. The Supreme Court of California has recognized the conflict and resolved it by holding that the full faith and credit clause does not deny to the courts of California the right to apply its own statute awarding compensation for an injury suffered by an employee within the state.\n To the extent that California is required to give full faith and credit to the conflicting Massachusetts statute it must be denied the right to apply in its own courts its own statute, constitutionally enacted in pursuance of its policy to provide compensation for employees injured in their employment within the state. It must withhold the remedy given by its own statute to its residents by way of compensation for medical, hospital and nursing services rendered to the injured employee, and it must remit him to Massachusetts to secure the administrative remedy which that state has provided. We cannot say that the full faith and credit clause goes so far.\n While the purpose of that provision was to preserve rights acquired or confirmed under the public acts and judicial proceedings of one state by requiring recognition of their validity in other states, the very nature of the federal union of states, to which are reserved some of the attributes of sovereignty, precludes resort to the full faith and credit clause as the means for compelling a state to substitute the statutes of other states for its own statutes dealing with a subject matter concerning which it is competent to legislate. As was pointed out in Alaska Packers Association v. Industrial Accident Comm., supra, page 547, 55 S.Ct. page 523: 'A rigid and literal enforcement of the full faith and credit clause, without regard to the statute of the forum, would lead to the absurd result that, wherever the conflict arises, the statute of each state must be enforced in the courts of the other, but cannot be in its own'. And in cases like the present it would create an impasse which \n\n[306 \nU.S. 493, 502]\n\u00a0\n would often leave the employee remediless. Full faith and credit would deny to California the right to apply its own remedy, and its administrative machinery may well not be adapted to giving the remedy afforded by Massachusetts. Similarly, the full faith and credit demanded for the California Act would deny to Massachusetts the right to apply its own remedy, and its Department of Industrial Accidents may well be without statutory authority to afford the remedy provided by the California statute.\n It has often been recognized by this Court that there are some limitations upon the extent to which a state may be required by the full faith and credit clause to enforce even the judgment of another state in contravention of its own statutes or policy. See Wisconsin v. Pelican Insurance Co., \n127 \nU.S. 265\n, 8 S.Ct. 1370; Huntington v. Attrill, \n146 \nU.S. 657\n, 13 S.Ct. 224; Finney v. Guy, \n189 \nU.S. 335\n, 23 S.Ct. 558; Milwaukee County v. White Co., supra, page 273 et seq., 56 S.Ct. page 232 et seq.; see, also, Clarke v. Clarke, \n178 \nU.S. 186\n, 20 S.Ct. 873; Olmsted v. Olmsted, \n216 \nU.S. 386\n, 30 S.Ct. 292, 25 L.R.A.,N.S., 1292; Hood v. McGehee, \n237 \nU.S. 611\n, 35 S.Ct. 718; cf. Gasquet v. Fenner, \n247 \nU.S. 16\n, 38 S.Ct. 416. And in the case of statutes, the extra- state effect of which Congress has not prescribed, as it may under the constitutional provision, we think the conclusion is unavoidable that the full faith and credit clause does not require one state to substitute for its own statute, applicable to persons and events within it, the conflicting statute of another state, even though that statute is of controlling force in the courts of the state of its enactment with respect to the same persons and events.\n This Court must determine for itself how far the full faith and credit clause compels the qualification or denial of rights asserted under the laws of one state, that of the forum, by the statute of another state. See Alaska Packers Association v. Industrial Accident Comm., supra, page 547, 55 S.Ct. page 523. But there would seem to be little room for the exercise of that function when the statute of the forum is the \n\n[306 \nU.S. 493, 503]\n\u00a0\n expression of domestic policy, in terms declared to be exclusive in its application to persons and events within the state. Although Massachusetts has an interest in safeguarding the compensation of Massachusetts employees while temporarily abroad in the course of their employment, and may adopt that policy for itself, that could hardly be thought to support an application of the full faith and credit clause which would override the constitutional authority of another state to legislate for the bodily safety and economic protection of employees injured within it. Few matters could be deemed more appropriately the concern of the state in which the injury occurs or more completely within its power. Considerations of less weight led to the conclusion, in Alaska Packers Association v. Industrial Accident Comm., supra, that the full faith and credit clause did not require California to give effect to the Alaska Compensation Act in preference to its own. There this Court sustained the award by California of the compensation provided by its own statute for employees where the contract of employment was made within the state, although the injury occurred in Alaska, whose statute also provided compensation for the injury. Decision was rested explicitly upon the grounds that the full faith and credit exacted for the statute of one state does not necessarily preclude another state from enforcing in its own courts its own conflicting statute having no extra-territorial operation forbidden by the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S.C.A.Const., and that no persuasive reason was shown for denying that right.\n Bradford Electric Light Co. v. Clapper, supra, on which petitioner relies, fully recognized this limitation on the full faith and credit clause. It was there held that a federal court in New Hampshire, in a suit brought against a Vermont employer by his Vermont employee to recover for an injury suffered in the course of his employment while temporarily in New Hampshire, was bound to apply \n\n[306 \nU.S. 493, 504]\n\u00a0\n the Vermont Compensation Act rather than the provision of the New Hampshire Compensation Act which permitted the employee, at his election, to enforce his common law remedy. But the Court was careful to point out that there was nothing in the New Hampshire statute, the decisions of its courts, or in the circumstances of the case, to suggest that reliance on the provisions of the Vermont statute, as a defense to the New Hampshire suit was obnoxious to the policy of New Hampshire. The Clapper case cannot be said to have decided more than that a state statute applicable to employer and employee within the state, which by its terms provides compensation for the employee if he is injured in the course of his employment while temporarily in another state, will be given full faith and credit in the latter when not obnoxious to its policy. See Bradford Electric Light Co. v. Clapper, supra, page 161, 52 S.Ct. page 576.\n Here, California legislation not only conflicts with that of Massachusetts providing compensation for the Massachusetts employee if injured within the state of California, but it expressly provides, for the guidance of its own commission and courts, that 'No contract, rule or regulation shall exempt the employer from liability for the compensation fixed by this act'. The Supreme Court of California has declared in its opinion in this case that it is the policy of the state, as expressed in its Constitution and Compensation Act, to apply its own provisions for compensation, to the exclusion of all others, and that 'It would be obnoxious to that policy to deny persons who have been injured in this state the right to apply for compensation when to do so might require physicians and hospitals to go to another state to collect charges for medical care and treatment given to such persons.' (10 Cal.2d 567, 75 P.2d 1063.)\n Full faith and credit does not here enable one state to legislate for the other or to project its laws across state \n\n[306 \nU.S. 493, 505]\n\u00a0\n lines so as to preclude the other from prescribing for itself the legal consequences of acts within it.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","93":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPACIFIC TELEPHONE & TELEGRAPH CO. v.

The appellant sought to restrain the State Board of Equalization of the State of California, its members, and the Attorney General of the state from enforcing the Use Tax of 1935, St.Cal.1935, p. 1297. A three-judge court granted an interlocutory injunction. Later, it denied a permanent injunction and dismissed the appellant's bill1 for the reasons stated in Southern Pacific Company v. Corbett, D.C., 23 F.Supp. 193.\n The appellant, a California corporation, operates a telephone and telegraph system in interstate and intrastate commerce. The same plant, facilities and organization are devoted to both interstate and intrastate business. In the necessary operation, maintenance and repair of its system, the appellant purchases outside California large amounts of equipment, apparatus, materials and supplies which are shipped to it in interstate commerce at various points within the state. The tangible \n\n[306 \nU.S. 182, 187]\n\u00a0\n personal property which the appellees threaten to tax is of two general classes: specific order and stand-by equipment. The first consists of central office switchboards, frames, cable racks, large private branch exchange switchboards, large underground cables, switches, central office cable, wire, protectors and other component parts of telephone and telegraph lines, which are purchased on specific order for installation at a particular place in the system. The second comprises goods bought from time to time for holding as stand-by supplies to meet fluctuating demands and emergencies and to make repairs.\n The specific order equipment is shipped to the appellant at the place of use. Its representative receipts for the goods at the dock or breaks the seal of the railroad car, and its employees unload the goods from the dock or car into its trucks. In most instances the trucks are driven directly to the building where the equipment is to be installed; in some, to distributing conters for reloading into other trucks which are driven to the place of installation. Occasionally, private branch exchange switchboards must be held by the appellant until the place of installation is ready. There is no holding in warehouses. The stand-by supplies which constitute a reserve to meet current requirements are replenished by monthly orders. The appellant's trucks pick them up at the dock or railroad depot and carry them to storage places at points on the system suitable for prompt distribution. When needed, the stand-by facilities are taken out of the stores and installed.\n The appellant exercises two rights of ownership in California- retention and installation-after the termination of the interstate shipment and before the use or consumption on its mixed interstate and instrastate telephone system. We see no material distinction between the contentions of the appellant and those disposed of in Southern Pacific Co. v. Gallagher, supra, decided today. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 182, 188]\n\u00a0\n The decree of the lower court dismissing the appellant's bill is affirmed.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice BUTLER dissent.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Pacific Tel. & Teleg.

There it has since remained. An episode in this new chapter, already four years old, is presented by this case. We brought it here, \n306 \nU.S. 627\n, 59 S.Ct. 644, because it raises important questions under the railroad bankruptcy law, particularly where it intersects the regulatory systems of the states. The District Court assumed power to supplant the relevant authority of the state-an authority which, apart from proceedings under  77, has not been conferred by Congress either upon the federal courts or the Interstate Commerce Commission. The Circuit Court of Appeals, one judge dissenting, reversed the District Court, Converse v. Commonwealth, 2 Cir., 101 F.2d 48.\n A summary of the facts will lay bare the legal issues. On December 28, 1937, the bankruptcy Trustees of the New Haven, acting under the requirements of Massachusetts law,2 applied to that Commonwealth's Department of Public Utilities for leave to abandon eighty-eight passenger stations. \n3\n Twenty-one hearings were held by \n\n[308 \nU.S. 79, 83]\n\u00a0\n the Department on the questions raised by this application. During the pendency of these hearings and before the Department had taken any action, the present litigation was initiated in the New Haven bankruptcy proceedings by creditors of the debtor for an order directing the Trustees to abandon these local services. The Trustees joined in the prayer, while the Commonwealth denied the jurisdiction of the District Court and asked that the proceedings before the Department be allowed to reach fruition. The District Judge ruled that  77 gave him the responsibility of disposing of the petition on its merits and, having taken evidence, gave the very relief for which the Trustees had applied to the Department and which was still in process of orderly consideration.\n Plainly enough the District Court had no power to deal with a matter in the keeping of state authorities unless Congress gave it. And so we have one of those problems in the reading of a statute wherein meaning is sought to be derived not from specific language but by fashioning a mosaic of significance out of the innuendoes of disjointed bits of a statute. At best this is subtle business, calling for great wariness lest what professes to be mere rendering becomes creation and attempted interpretation of legislation becomes legislation itself. Especially is wariness enjoined when the problem of con- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 79, 84]\n\u00a0\n struction implicates one of the recurring phases of our federalism and involves striking a balance between national and state authority in one of the most sensitive areas of government.\n To be sure, in recent years Congress has from time to time exercised authority over purely intrastate activities of an interstate carrier when, in the judgment of Congress, an interstate carrier constituted, as a matter of economic fact, a single organism and could not effectively be regulated as to some of its interstate phases without drawing local business within the regulated sphere. \n4\n But such absorption of state authority is a delicate exercise of legislative policy in achieving a wise accommodation between the needs of central control and the lively maintenance of local institutions. \n5\n Therefore, in construing legislation this court has disfavored in-roads by implication on state authority and resolutely confined restrictions upon the traditional power of states to regulate their local transportation to the plain mandate of Congress. Minnesota Rate Cases, \n230 \nU.S. 352\n, 33 S.Ct. 729, 48 L.R.A. N.S., 1151, Ann.Cas.1916A, 18; cf. Kelly v. Washington ex rel. Foss Co., \n302 \nU.S. 1\n, 58 S.Ct. 87.\n The dependence of local communities on local railroad services has for decades placed control over their curtailment within the regulatory authorities of the state. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n[308 \nU.S. 79, 85]\n\u00a0\n Even when the Transportation Act in 1920, 49 U.S.C.A.  1 (18-20), gave the Interstate Commerce Commission power to permit abandonment of local lines when the overriding interests of interstate commerce required it, Colorado v. United States, \n271 \nU.S. 153\n, 46 S.Ct. 452,7 this was not deemed to confer upon the Commission jurisdiction over curtailments of service and partial discontinuances. Public Convenience Application of Kansas City Southern Ry., 94 I.C.C. 691; see Proposed Abandonment, Morris & Essex Ry. Co., 175 I.C.C. 49. If this old and familiar power of the states was withdrawn when Congress gave district courts bankruptcy powers over railroads, we ought to find language fitting for so drastic a change.\n We are asked to find it in  77, sub. a, granting to the bankruptcy court 'exclusive jurisdiction of the debtor and its property wherever located',8 and in  77, sub. c(2), permitting the trustees, subject to the Court's control, 'to operate the business of the debtor'.9 In order to expedite the reorganization of insolvent railroads, such broad and general provisions doubtless suffice to confer \n\n[308 \nU.S. 79, 86]\n\u00a0\n upon the district courts power appropriate for adjusting property rights in the railroad debtor's estate and, as to such rights, beyond that in ordinary bankruptcy proceedings. Cf. Continental Bank & Trust Co. v. Rock Island Ry. Co., \n294 \nU.S. 648\n, 55 S.Ct. 595. But the District Court claimed power over the carrier's relation to the state. It has become the settled social policy both of the states and the nation to entrust the type of public interest here in question to expert administrative agencies because of 'the notion', as Judge Learned Hand pointed out below, 'that a judge is not qualified for such duties.' \n10\n\u00a0\n\n Not only is there no specific grant of the power which the District Court exercised, but the historic background of  77, the considerations governing Congress in its enactment, and the scheme of the legislation as disclosed by its specific provisions reject the claim. Until the amendment of March 3, 1933, railroads were outside the Bankruptcy Act. \n11\n But the long history of federal railroad receiverships, with the conflicts they frequently engendered between the federal courts and the public, left an enduring conviction that a railroad was not like an ordinary insolvent estate. \n12\n Also an insolvent railroad, it was realized, required the oversight of agencies specially charged with the public interest represented by the transportation system. Indeed, when, in the depth of \n\n[308 \nU.S. 79, 87]\n\u00a0\n the depression, legislation was deemed urgent to meet the grave crisis confronting the railroads, there was a strong sentiment in Congress to withdraw from the courts control over insolvent railroads and lodge it with the Interstate Commerce Commission. \n13\n Congress stopped short of this remedy. But the whole scheme of  77 leaves no doubt that Congress did not mean to grant to the district courts the same scope as to bankrupt roads that they may have in dealing with other bankrupt estates.\n The judicial process in bankruptcy proceedings under  77 is, as it were, brigaded with the administrative process of the Commission. From the requirement of ratification by the Commission of the trustees appointed by the Court to the Commission's approval of the Court's plan of reorganization the authority of the Court is intertwined with that of the Commission. \n14\n Thus, in  77, sub. c, and \n\n[308 \nU.S. 79, 88]\n\u00a0\n s 77, sub. o, the power of the district courts to permit abandonments is specifically conditioned on authorization of such abandonments by the Commission. In view of the judicial history of railroad receiverships and the extent to which  77 made judicial action dependent on approval by the Interstate Commerce Commission, it would violate the traditional respect of Congress for local interests and for the administrative process to imply power in a single judge to disregard state law over local activities of a carrier the governance of which Congress has withheld even from the Interstate Commerce Commission, except as part of a complete plan of reorganization for an insolvent road. \n15\n About a fourth of the railroad mileage of \n\n[308 \nU.S. 79, 89]\n\u00a0\n the country is now in bankruptcy. \n16\n The petitioners ask us to say that district judges in twenty-nine states have effective power, in view of the weight which often attaches to findings at nisi prius, to set aside the regulatory systems of these twenty-nine states with all the consequences implied for those communities. Congress gave no such power.\n Arguments of convenience against denial of the existence of this power have been strongly pressed upon us. Continuance of state control over these local passenger services will, it is urged, impair the bankruptcy court's power to formulate a reorganization plan for the approval of the Interstate Commerce Commission. Such embarrassments, due either to the time required for exhaustion of the orderly state procedure or to the financial losses that may be involved in the continuance of local services until duly terminated by the state, may easily be exaggerated. It is not without significance that after four years no reorganization plan for the New Haven has yet been evolved. Perhaps it is no less true that amenability to state laws will serve as incentive to the formulation of reorganization plans which, on approval by the Commission, do supplant state authority. But, in any event, against possible inconveniences due to observance of state law we must balance the feelings of local communities, the dislocation of their habits and the over-riding of expert state agencies by a single judge sitting, as in this case, in another state, removed from familiarity with local problems, and not necessarily gifted with statesman-like imagination that transcends the wisdom of local attachments. \n\n[308 \nU.S. 79, 90]\n\u00a0\n Other arguments, drawn from the legislative history of  77 and from the general equity powers conferred by  77, sub. a, and  77, sub. c(2), 17 were urged but we deem it unnecessary to say more.\n The decree below is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice BUTLER took no part in the consideration and decision of this cause. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Brandeis, 'Financial Condition of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad Co.'

On June 1, 1936, the New Haven Trustees disaffirmed, as they were empowered to do under  77, the Old Colony lease. After the disaffirmance the New Haven operated the lines on account of the Old Colony. On June 3, 1936, the Old Colony itself commenced proceedings under  77. The Trustees of the New Haven were then appointed trustees for the Old Colony. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] E.g., The Shreveport Cases, \n234 \nU.S. 342\n, 34 S.Ct. 833; Wisconsin R.R. Comm. v.

Haulsee, both of Wewoka, Okl., for appellant.\n The Court declined to hear further argument.\n\n PER CURIAM.\n In this suit, brought to recover his share of oil royalties, the plaintiff challenged the validity, under the contract clause and the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution, U.S.C.A.Const. Amend. 14, of the Well-Spacing Act of the State of Oklahoma (Chap. 59, art. 1, Okla.Sess. Laws 1935, 52 Okl.St. Ann.  85-87, 136-138) and an order made thereunder by the Corporation Commission of that State. The Supreme Court of the State, affirming the judgment of the District Court with a modification immaterial here, sustained the validity of the statute and order. 182 Okl. 155, 77 P.2d 83. The plaintiff brings this appeal.\n The Corporation Commission fixed the boundaries of the common source of oil supply in the North Wellston area in Lincoln County, Oklahoma, so as to include 520 acres and authorized ten-acre well-spacing units within that area. The well in question is in the approximate center of one of these ten-acre units. That unit consists of 6 1\/4 acres which lie in tract 'A' and 3 3\/4 acres in tract 'B', these tracts being in separate ownership. The well is located on tract 'A'. The statute (Sec. 4(c), 52 Okl.St.Ann.  87(c), provides:\n'In the event a producing well, or wells, is completed upon a unit where there are two or more separately owned \n\n[305 \nU.S. 376, 378]\n\u00a0\n tracts, any royalty owner, or group of royalty owners, holding the royalty interest under a separately owned tract, shall share in one-eighth (1\/8) of all the production from the well or wells drilled within the unit in the proportion that the acreage of their separately owned tract bears to the entire acreage of the unit'.\n\n Under that provision, as construed by the state court, the owners of the mineral rights in the 3 3\/4 acres of the drilling unit are permitted to share with the plaintiff, and his co-owners of the mineral rights in the other 6 1\/4 acres of the unit, the oil and gas produced from the well although it is located entirely upon the surface of the 6 1\/4 acre tract. Plaintiff contends that this distribution among the owners of the 3 3\/4 acres works an unconstitutional deprivation of his property and an impairment of his contractual rights. The Corporation Commission found as follows:\n'That the said well as above described is located in the approximate center of a 10-acre tract of land, and that taking into consideration the depth of the well now producing in said common source of supply, the thickness, porosity, and permeability of the producing sand, the nature and character of the reservoir energy, the formations encountered in the drilling of the well, and the history and productive characteristics of wells in other common sources of supply which have similar formations, and from other geological and scientific information and data as shown by the records, the Commission finds that a well-spacing and drilling unit of 10 acres and of uninform size should be established in the said North Wellston pool; that the same would tend to effect the proper drainage of oil from said pool, and would result in uniform withdrawal and in the greatest ultimate recovery of oil, and would best conserve reservoir energy, and would protect the relative rights of the leaseholders and royalty owners in said common source of supply'. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 376, 379]\n\u00a0\n It is admitted that the Commission made its findings and order after due hearing. The evidence underlying its findings is not in the record. Accordingly, as the state court said, it must be assumed 'that the source of supply of the well in question is common to the land adjoining it and that said pool underlies not only the 6 1\/4 acres of land on which the well is located but that it also extends beneath the 3 3\/4 acre tract'. In that view the state court applied well settled principles in denying plaintiff's contention under the Fourteenth Amendment (Ohio Oil Co. v. State of Indiana, \n177 \nU.S. 190\n, 20 S.Ct. 576; Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., \n220 \nU.S. 61\n, 31 S.Ct. 337, Ann.Cas. 1912C, 160; Walls v.

MCGRAW(1939)\nNo. 69\nArgued: Decided: December 4, 1939\n\n\n\n\n[308 \nU.S. 313, 314]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Willis S. Moore, of Salem, Or., Dean H. Dickinson, of Portland, Or., and I. H. Van Winkle, of Salem, Or., for petitioner.\n Mr. Fletcher Rockwood, of Portland, Or., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Hayes, respondents' decedent, died testate in 1936 and was at the time of his death a resident of and domiciled in Oregon. In earlier years when he had resided in the middle west he placed in possession of an Illinois trust company various stocks, bonds and other intangibles, which trust company acted as his agent in collecting principal and income on those securities and in the investment of his funds. When decedent established a domicile in Oregon in 1933, he continued that arrangement with the Illinois trust company, with the result that those securities were always physically present in Illinois, never in Oregon. August 8, 1935, about six months before decedent's death, he directed the Illinois trust company to sell and liquidate sufficient of his bonds held under that \n\n[308 \nU.S. 313, 315]\n\u00a0\n agency arrangement in Illinois to procure a sum which, together with cash balances in his checking account with the trust company, would equal $450, 000 and to purchase therewith, as his agent, federal reserve notes of the face amount of $450,000. Between August 8, 1935 and August 12, 1935, the Illinois trust company complied with decedent's directions1 and prior to August 15, 1935, it purchased $450,000 of federal reserve notes and held them in Illinois as agent for decedent for a few days.\n On August 15, 1935, decedent executed in Oregon a trust agreement under which the Illinois trust company was designated as trustee and by which decedent transferred to it as trustee the federal reserve notes. That trust was for the benefit of certain designated relatives and was irrevocable. Under it decedent retained no interest or power whatsoever. The trust company held those federal reserve notes under the trust agreement for about five days. Then from time to time after August 19, 1935, the Illinois trust company used the federal reserve notes, pursuant to the terms of the trust agreement, to purchase bonds and other personal property for the account of the trust. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[308 \nU.S. 313, 316]\n\u00a0\n Admittedly, Oregon had jurisdiction to tax but for the alleged prohibition in the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S.C.A.Const., for the statute in question imposed a tax on intangibles as well as tangibles which passed by deed or gift made in contemplation of the death of the grantor. \n3\n But the Supreme Court of Oregon held that that constitutional prohibition was present since neither the securities or cash used to purchase the federal reserve notes nor the notes themselves were ever in Oregon but always in Illinois. Though admitting that intangibles would have been taxable by Oregon under such circumstances, the court in reliance on Blodgett v. Silberman, \n277 \nU.S. 1\n, 48 S.Ct. 410, concluded that the federal reserve notes were tangibles. And since decedent had retained them in Illinois for a few days prior to August 15, 1935, without any intention of bringing them to Oregon, they had acquired a so-called business situs in Illinois which constitutionally prevented Oregon from exacting a tax for their transfer. \n4\n And this conclusion was reached though admittedly the transfer of the notes under the agreement of August 15, 1935, was made in contemplation of death. We granted certiorari, \n308 \nU.S. 531\n, 60 S.Ct. 76, 84 L.Ed. --, \n\n[308 \nU.S. 313, 317]\n\u00a0\n because of the importance of the constitutional question involved and of an alleged probable conflict with the principles underlying such decisions as Curry v. McCanless, \n307 \nU.S. 357\n, 59 S.Ct. 900\n\n\n We disagree with the conclusion of the Supreme Court of Oregon. Oregon having jurisdiction to tax by reason of the statute was not deprived of it by the Federal Constitution.\n On the facts of this case we believe that the various steps in the series must be considered as constituting but one integrated and indivisible transaction-a transfer by decedent of intangibles in contemplation of death. And we reach this result though each step in the series was real and though none was camouflaged or concealed. For basically the sale of intangibles, the acquisition of federal reserve notes, and their transfer under the agreement of August 15, 1935, were interdependent. Cf. Groman v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, \n302 \nU.S. 82\n, 58 S.Ct. 108; Helvering v. Bashford, \n302 \nU.S. 454, 455\n, 458 S., 58 S.Ct. 307, 309. From decedent's point of view, completion of the series of steps was necessary for consummation of his program to utilize $450,000 of his estate to provide for certain designated members of his family. \n5\n Any step short of the final transfer would not have done it. The mere sale of the intangibles and the acquisition of the federal reserve notes had no functional or business significance apart from the August 15, 1935 transfer. That is emphasized here because they created no legal relations and gave rise to no vested rights interfering with decedent's continuing power of disposition. Taken as isolated transactions, \n\n[308 \nU.S. 313, 318]\n\u00a0\n they have meaning and significance only in relation to the third step, a conclusion made especially evident by the close sequence of events. Hence, it is no answer to say that because the first two steps were not irrevocable but could be recalled, the third step was not a necessary on in the series. For that is as immaterial as is the revocability of any donor's plan to make a gift in contemplation of death at any moment prior to its consummation. Admittedly decedent had such a purpose on the transfer of the notes. To hold that such purpose was not present on the sale of the intangibles would be to isolate one part of the total transaction and to give it significance and meaning utterly inconsistent with the fact that the intangibles were sold for the purpose of acquiring the notes which, in turn, were to be placed under an irrevocable trust. Therefore we need not consider the nature of federal reserve notes, for in that posture of the case their taxability as such and in isolation from the whole transaction is not in issue.\n Hence to hold that there is a constitutional barrier to the tax sought to be imposed would be to make a fetish of form. It would make the principles of the decisions of this Court on the constitutional power to tax devoid of any reason or function apart from a ritual of tax avoidance. Cf. Minnesota Tea Co. v. Helvering, \n302 \nU.S. 609\n, 58 S.Ct. 393; Shotwell v. Moore, \n129 \nU.S. 590\n, 9 S.Ct. 362. Questions of due process are not to be treated 'narrowly or pedantically, in slavery to forms or phrases.' Burnet v. Wells, \n289 \nU.S. 670, 677\n, 678 S., 53 S.Ct. 761, 764.\n Accordingly, the transfer was taxable on the authority of Curry v. McCanless, supra, and related cases. For constitutionally the property was 'within the jurisdiction of the state' of Oregon since that jurisdiction is dependent not on the physical location of the property in the state but on control over the owner. \n\n[308 \nU.S. 313, 319]\n\u00a0\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of Oregon is reversed and the cause is remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.\n Reversed and remanded.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS is of the opinion that the judgment below should be affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE.\n I concur in the judgment of reversal on the ground that nothing in the Constitution prevents taxation by Oregon of a gift by its citizen of federal reserve notes located elsewhere.\n While I do not question that in the circumstances of this case a state could, if so advised, constitutionally tax its citizen for action taken for no other purpose than the evasion of its taxing statutes, no such question is, I think, presented by the record. Discussion of it seems at most to be academic and not to relieve us of the duty of deciding the only federal question which could by any possibility be said to be raised by the record, namely, whether the Constitution precludes taxation of the gift of the banknotes merely because of the physical fact that they are located without the state.\n In arriving at the conclusion that the gift of federal reserve notes located outside the state was not taxable, the Supreme Court of Oregon necessarily construed the Oregon statute, which imposes a tax on gifts of 'all property within the jurisdiction of the state ... whether tangible or intangible.' The court has said that the banknotes were not within the jurisdiction of the state because their situs was elsewhere, and that the acts of decedent in avoiding the tax by the acquisition of property having an extra-territorial situs were not reached for taxation by state law. If the court did anything more than rule \n\n[308 \nU.S. 313, 320]\n\u00a0\n that the statute, by its own terms, did not extend to the taxation of the gift of the notes because they were located outside the state, it held that the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S.C.A.Const., because of that physical fact withholds, from the state, jurisdiction over the property which the taxing statute asserts.\n Petitioner asks us to determine whether that holding is correct. He is entitled to have an answer. We do not rightly avoid giving the answer by saying that, by some statute other than that under review, the state could constitutionally tax its citizen for his action in avoiding the tax, by making the gift in a form of property which is by hypothesis beyond the taxing power. If the state has by its statute undertaken to lay a tax on gifts of banknotes outside the state without more-and we are without jurisdiction if it has not-no purpose is served by saying to the state that it could have reached the same result by another route, which, under its laws, does not appear to be open to it.\n As I am of opinion that there is nothing in the Constitution to compel a state to treat federal reserve notes for tax purposes, as chattels were treated in Frick v. Pennsylvania, \n268 \nU.S. 473\n, 45 S.Ct. 603, 42 A.L.R. 316, and as no reason has been advanced, even in Blodgett v. Silberman, \n277 \nU.S. 1, 18\n, 48 S.Ct. 410, 416, for a different view, cf. Baldwin v. Missouri, \n281 \nU.S. 586, 591\n, 50 S.Ct. 436, 437, 72 A.L.R. 1303, the judgment should, I think, be reversed upon that ground rather than upon a theory of permissible legislation, of which apparently Oregon's tax laws do not avail.\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER agrees with my views as to Oregon's power to tax these federal reserve notes, but is of opinion that the record sustains the ground taken in the Court's opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] On the sale of bonds in the open market the trust company realized for decedent's account $176,062.01. On August 12, 1935, decedent borrowed from the trust company on a demand note $183,937.99. On that date decedent had a balance in his checking account with the trust company in excess of $ 90,000. With the funds so obtained the trust company purchased the $450, 000 of federal reserve notes mentioned. Between August 12, 1935, and August 29, 1935, the trust company, on directions of decedent, sold in the open market additional bonds held by it in the agency account and as proceeds of those sales were received by it, it paid off the demand note. That note was entirely paid on August 29, 1935. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] None of the property thus acquired by the trustee was ever owned by decedent; the trustee did not purchase or acquire any of the bonds or other assets which at any time constituted a part of the property held by the trustee as agent for decedent under the earlier arrangement. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] 'All property within the jurisdiction of the state, and any interest therein, whether belonging to the inhabitants of this state or not, and whether tangible or intangible, which shall pass or vest ... by deed, grant, bargain, sale or gift, or as an advancement or division of his or her estate made in contemplation of the death of the grantor, ... to any person or persons, ... in trust or otherwise, ... shall be and is subject to tax at the rate hereinafter specified in section 10-603, to be paid to the treasurer of the state for the use of the state; ....'

LITTON(1939)\nNo. 39\nArgued: Decided: December 4, 1939\n\n\n\n\n[308 \nU.S. 295, 296]\n\u00a0\n Mr. M. M Heuser, of Norton, Va., for petitioner.\n Mr. Henry Roberts, of Bristol, Va., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case presents the question of the power of the bankruptcy court to disallow either as a secured or as a general or unsecured claim a judgment obtained by the dominant and controlling stockholder of the bankrupt corporation on alleged salary claims. The judgment of the District Court disallowing the claim was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, 4 Cir., 100 F.2d 830. We granted certiorari because of an apparent restriction imposed by that decision on the power of the bankruptcy court to disallow or to subordinate such claims in exercise of its broad equitable powers. \n307 \nU.S. 620\n, 59 S.Ct. 1042\n\n\n The findings of the District Court, amply supported by the evidence, reveal a scheme to defraud creditors reminiscent of some of the evils with which 13 Eliz. c. 5 was designed to cope. But for the use of a so-called- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 295, 297]\n\u00a0\n 'one-man' or family corporation, Dixie Splint Coal Company, of which respondent was the dominant and controlling stockholder, that scheme followed an ancient pattern.\n In 1931 Pepper, the petitioner, brought suit in a state court in Virginia against Dixie Splint Coal Company and Litton, the respondent, for an accounting of royalties due Pepper under a lease. \n1\n While this suit was pending and in anticipation that Pepper would recover, Litton caused Dixie Splint Coal Company to confess a judgment in Litton's favor in the amount of $33,468.89, representing alleged accumulated salary claims dating back at least five years. This was done by P. H. Smith, secretary and treasurer of Dixie Splint Coal Company, who, according to the District Court, was 'an employee of Litton and subservient to the latter's will.' This was on June 2, 1933. Execution was issued on this judgment the same day but no return was made thereon, Litton waiting 'quietly until the outcome of the Pepper suit was definitely known'. On February 19, 1934, Pepper obtained a judgment against Dixie Splint Coal Company for $9,000. On motion of the company, execution on the judgment was suspended for ninety days to permit an appeal. But defendant in that suit did not appeal. \n2\n Instead, on March 19, 1934, while execution on the Pepper judgment was suspended, Litton caused an execution to issue on his confessed judgment and levy to be made thereunder. Yet Litton 'had no intention of trying to satisfy his confessed judgment' against his corporation 'unless and until it became necessary to do so'; he was using it 'only as a shield against the Pepper debt'. Thus, when execution and levy were made March 19, 1934, no steps were \n\n[308 \nU.S. 295, 298]\n\u00a0\n taken for over two months towards a sale of the property on which levy had been made. On May 31, 1934, Pepper caused an execution to issue on her judgment, and levy was made June 2, 1934. On this latter date the sheriff 'who seems to have been cooperating with Litton' advertised the property for sale under the Litton levy made in the previous March. On June 14, 1934, the sale was held and Litton became the purchaser of the property sold at the sum of $3,200.\n The next step in the 'planned and fraudulent scheme' was the formation by Litton of 'another of his one-man corporations', Dixie Beaver Coal Company, to which Litton transferred the property he had acquired at the execution sale at a valuation of $20,135.36 to be paid for in stock of the new company. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n On September 4, 1934, the third step in Litton's scheme was taken. On that date Dixie Splint Coal Company, pursuant to a resolution of the board of directors, passed June 16, 1934, (two days after the Litton execution sale) filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy. This step, according to the findings below, was 'plainly for the sole purpose of avoiding payment of the Pepper debt'. The bankrupt at that time had $4,500 on bank deposit and $12,000 in accounts receivable, most of which was good. The cash on deposit was then more than sufficient to pay all creditors with the exception of Pepper. And Litton caused the voluntary petition to be filed 'feeling confident that his confessed judgment would cover and consume' the remaining assets. Adjudication followed on September 7, 1934. \n\n[308 \nU.S. 295, 299]\n\u00a0\n Litton's next step in his scheme to defeat the Pepper claim was to purchase wage claims against the bankrupt and to cause 'in some manner' other claims to be withdrawn. This was done, according to the District Court, so that Pepper might be made to appear as the only general creditor- a situation designed to give Litton a decided technical advantage, as we shall see.\n On June 13, 1934, Pepper had instituted suit in the Virginia state court to have the Litton judgment declared void. On June 15, 1934, the day following the sale under the Litton execution, the sheriff instituted an interpleader action joining Litton, Pepper and the Clinchfield Coal Corporation and alleging, inter alia, that that corporation had a prior lien on all the property sold for a debt of $2,153. Litton and Pepper both answered admitting the prior lien of the corporation, Pepper answering 'without prejudice to her rights' asserted in the chancery cause to have the Litton judgment set aside. On July 18, 1934, an order in the interpleader suit was entered directing payment of $2,153.00 to the Clinchfield Coal Corporation.\n Thereafter the trustee, with the authority of the bankruptcy court, moved in the state court to set aside the judgment and to quash the execution thereof on the ground that the judgment was void since it had not been confessed in the manner required by the Virginia statute. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n[308 \nU.S. 295, 300]\n\u00a0\n The court concluded that the Litton judgment was void but denied the motion on the grounds that the trustee was estopped to challenge it. The court held that Pepper in the interpleader suit had treated the fund derived from the execution sale under the Litton judgment as valid and consequently had elected to recognize the validity of the judgment. Since Litton had acquired, or caused to have withdrawn, all the remaining claims against the \n\n[308 \nU.S. 295, 301]\n\u00a0\n estate, the trustee in this suit was representing only Pepper. Therefore, since Pepper was estopped, so was the trustee. On appeal that judgment was affirmed on those grounds. Smith v. Litton, 167 Va. 263, 188 S.E. 214.\n Thereafter the question of the allowance of the Litton judgment came before the bankruptcy court on exceptions previously made by Pepper. That court concluded that the decision by the state court that the trustee was estopped to attack the Litton judgment there, did not prevent the bankruptcy court from considering its validity. It therefore reviewed all the facts and concluded (1) that Litton and the Dixie Splint Coal Company had made a 'deliberate and carefully planned attempt' to avoid 'the payment of a just debt'; (2) that Litton and the Dixie Splint Coal Company were 'in reality the same'; and (3) that the alleged salary claims underlying the Litton judgment did not represent an 'honest debt' of the bankrupt corporation, being merely bookkeeping entries for the double purpose of lessening income taxes and of enabling Litton to appear as a creditor of the corporation in case it became financially involved. 5 Accordingly, the \n\n[308 \nU.S. 295, 302]\n\u00a0\n District Court disallowed the Litton claim either as a secured or unsecured claim and directed the trustee to recover for the benefit of the estate the property or its value which Litton purchased at the execution sale on June 14, 1934. On appeal the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that judgment holding that the decision in the state court was res judicata in the bankruptcy proceedings.\n We think that the Circuit Court of Appeals was in error in reversing the judgment of the District Court.\n In the first place, res judicata did not prevent the District Court from examining into the Litton judgment and disallowing or subordinating it as a claim. When that claim was attacked in the bankruptcy court Litton did not show that the proceeding in the state court was anything more than a proceeding under Virginia practice to set aside the judgment in his favor on the ground that it was irregular or void upon its face. He failed to show that the judgment in the state court was conclusive in his favor on the validity or priority of the underlying claim, as respects the other creditors of the bankrupt corporation-a duty which was incumbent on him. On the pleadings in the state court the validity of the underlying claim was not in issue. Nor was there presented to the state court the question of whether or not the Litton judgment might be subordinated to the claims of other \n\n[308 \nU.S. 295, 303]\n\u00a0\n creditors upon equitable principles. The motion on which that proceeding was based challenged the Litton judgment on one ground only, viz., that it was void ab initio because it was not confessed by Dixie Splint Coal Company in the manner required by the Virginia statute and because P. H. Smith did not have either an implied or express power to confess it. In other words, in the state court, under the pleadings and practice, the only decree which was asked or could be given in the plaintiff's favor was for cancellation of the judgment as a record obligation of the bankrupt. It is therefore plain that the issue which the bankruptcy court later considered was not an issue in the trial of the cause in the state court and could not be adjudicated there. \n6\n Hence, the failure on the part of Litton to establish that the state judgment was res judicata plus his submission of his judgment to the bankruptcy court for allowance (as a preferred claim to the extent that it was secured by the alleged lien and as a common claim as respects the deficiency) plainly left the bankruptcy court with full authority to follow the course it took and to determine the validity of Litton's alleged secured claim and the priority which should be accorded it in the distribution of the bankrupt estate. In the second place, even though we assume that the alleged salary claim on which the Litton judgment was based was not fictitious but actually existed, we are of the opinion that the District Court properly disallowed or subordinated it.\n Courts of bankruptcy are constituted by  1 and 2 of the bankruptcy act 30 Stat. 544, 11 U.S.C.A.  1(8), 11, and by the latter \n\n[308 \nU.S. 295, 304]\n\u00a0\n section are invested 'with such jurisdiction at law and in equity as will enable them to exercise original jurisdiction in bankruptcy proceedings.' Consequently this Court has held that for many purposes 'courts of bankruptcy are essentially courts of equity, and their proceedings inherently proceedings in equity'. Local Loan Co. v. Hunt, \n292 \nU.S. 234, 240\n, 54 S.Ct. 695, 697, 93 A.L.R. 195. By virtue of  2 a bankruptcy court is a court of equity at least in the sense that in the exercise of the jurisdiction conferred upon it by the act, it applies the principles and rules of equity jurisprudence. Larson v. First State Bank of Vienna, S.D., 8 Cir., 21 F.2d 936, 938. Among the granted powers are the allowance and disallowance of claims;7 the collection and distribution of the estates of bankrupts and the determination of controversies in relation thereto;8 the rejection in whole or in part 'according to the equities of the case' of claims previously allowed;9 and the entering of such judgments 'as may be necessary for the enforcement of the provisions' of the act. \n10\n In such respects the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court is exclusive of all other courts. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Company v. Bray, \n225 \nU.S. 205, 217\n, 32 S.Ct. 620, 625.\n The bankruptcy courts have exercised these equitable powers in passing on a wide range of problems arising out of the administration of bankrupt estates. 11 They \n\n[308 \nU.S. 295, 305]\n\u00a0\n have been invoked to the end that fraud will not prevail, that substance will not give way to form, that technical considerations will not prevent substantial justice from being done. By reason of the express provisions of  2 these equitable powers are to be exercised on the allowance of claims, a conclusion which is fortified by  57, sub. k, 11 U.S.C.A.  93 sub. k. \n12\n For certainly if, as provided in the latter section, a claim which has been allowed may be later 'rejected in whole or in part, according to the equities of the case', disallowance or subordination in light of equitable considerations may originally be made.\n Hence, this Court has held that a bankruptcy court has full power to inquire into the validity of any claim asserted against the estate and to disallow it if it is ascertained to be without lawful existence. Lesser v. Gray, \n236 \nU.S. 70\n, 35 S.Ct. 227. And the mere fact that a claim has been reduced to judgment does not prevent such an inquiry. As the merger of a claim into a judgment does not change its nature so far as provability is concerned, Boynton v. Ball, \n121 \nU.S. 457\n, 7 S.Ct. 981, so the court may look behind the judgment to determine the essential nature of the liability \n\n[308 \nU.S. 295, 306]\n\u00a0\n for purposes of proof and allowance. Wetmore v. Markoe, \n196 \nU.S. 68\n, 25 S. Ct. 172, 2 Ann.Cas. 265. It may ascertain the validity of liens, marshal them, and control their enforcement and liquidation. Isaacs v. Hobbs Tie & Timber Company, \n282 \nU.S. 734\n, 51 S.Ct. 270. And the bankruptcy trustee may collaterally attack a judgment offered as a claim against the estate for the purpose of showing that it was obtained by collusion of the parties or is founded upon no real debt. \n13\n\u00a0\n\n That equitable power also exists in passing on claims presented by an officer, director, or stockholder in the bankruptcy proceedings of his corporation. The mere fact that an officer, director, or stockholder has a claim against his bankrupt corporation or that he has reduced that claim to judgment does not mean that the bankruptcy court must accord it pari passu treatment with the claims of other creditors. Its disallowance or subordination may be necessitated by certain cardinal principles of equity jurisprudence. A director is a fiduciary. Twin-Lick Oil Company v. Marbury, \n91 \nU.S. 587\n, 588. So is a dominant or controlling stockholder or group of stockholders. Southern Pacific Company v. Bogert, \n250 \nU.S. 483, 492\n, 39 S.Ct. 533, 537. Their powers are powers in trust. See Jackson v. Ludeling, 21 Wall. 616, 624. Their dealings with the corporation are subjected to rigorous scrutiny and where any of their contracts or engagements with the corporation is challenged the burden is on the director or stockholder not only to prove the good faith of the transaction but also to show its inherent fairness from the viewpoint of the corporation and those interested therein. Geddes v. Anaconda Copper Mining Company, \n254 \nU.S. 590, 599\n, 41 S.Ct. 209, 212. The essence of the test is whether or not under all the circumstances the transaction carries the earmarks of an \n\n[308 \nU.S. 295, 307]\n\u00a0\n arm's length bargain. \n14\n If it does not, equity will set it aside. While normally that fiduciary obligation is enforceable directly by the corporation, or through a stockholder's derivative action,15 it is, in the event of bankruptcy of the corporation, enforceable by the trustee. \n16\n For that standard of fiduciary obligation is designed for the protection of the entire community of interests in the corporation17-creditors as well as stockholders.\n As we have said, the bankruptcy court in passing on allowance of claims sits as a court of equity. Hence these rules governing the fiduciary responsibilities of directors and stockholders come into play on allowance of their claims in bankruptcy, in the exercise of its equita- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 295, 308]\n\u00a0\n ble jurisdiction the bankruptcy court has the power to sift the circumstances surrounding any claim to see that injustice or unfairness is not done in administration of the bankrupt estate. \n18\n And its duty so to do is especially clear when the claim seeking allowance accrues to the benefit of an officer, director, or stockholder. That is clearly the power and duty of the bankruptcy courts under the reorganization sections. In Taylor v. Standard Gas & Electric Co., \n306 \nU.S. 307\n, 59 S.Ct. 543, this Court held that the claim of Standard against its subsidiary ( admittedly a claim due and owing) should be allowed to participate in the reorganization plan of the subsidiary only in subordination to the preferred stock of the subsidiary. This was based on the equities of the case-the history of spoliation, mismanagement, and faithless stewardship of the affairs of the subsidiary by Standard to the detriment of the public investors. Similar results have properly been reached in ordinary bankruptcy proceedings. Thus, salary claims of officers, directors, and stockholders in the bankruptcy of 'one-man' or family corporations have been disallowed or subordinated where the courts have been satisfied that allowance of the claims would not be \n\n[308 \nU.S. 295, 309]\n\u00a0\n fair or equitable to other creditors. \n19\n And that result may be reached even though the salary claim has been reduced to judgment. \n20\n It is reached where the claim asserted is void or voidable because the vote of the interested director or stockholder helped bring it into being or where the history of the corporation shows dominancy and exploitation on the part of the claimant. \n21\n It is also reached where on the facts the bankrupt has been used merely as a corporate pocket of the dominant stockholder, who, with disregard of the substance or form of corporate management, has treated its affairs as his own. \n22\n And so-called loans or advances by the dominant or controlling stockholder will be subordinated to claims of other credi- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 295, 310]\n\u00a0\n tors and thus treated in effect as capital contributions by the stockholder not only in the foregoing types of situations but also where the paid-in capital is purely nominal, the capital necessary for the scope and magnitude of the operations of the company being furnished by the stockholder as a loan. \n23\n\u00a0\n\n Though disallowance of such claims will be ordered where they are fictitious or a sham,24 these cases do not turn on the existence or non- existence of the debt. Rather they involve simply the question of order of payment. \n25\n At times equity has ordered disallowance or subordination by disregarding the corporate entity. \n26\n That is to say, it has treated the debtor-corporation simply as a part of the stockholder's own enterprise, consistently with the course of conduct of the stockholder. But in that situation as well as in the others to which we have referred, a sufficient consideration may be simply the violation of rules of fair play and good conscience by the claimant; \n\n[308 \nU.S. 295, 311]\n\u00a0\n a breach of the fiduciary standards of conduct which he owes the corporation, its stockholders and creditors. He who is in such a fiduciary position cannot serve himself first and his cestuis second. He cannot manipulate the affairs of his corporation to their detriment and in disregard of the standards of common decency and honesty. He cannot by the intervention of a corporate entity violate the ancient precept against serving two masters. \n27\n He cannot by the use of the corporate device avail himself of privileges normally permitted outsiders in a race of creditors. He cannot utilize his inside information and his strategic position for his own preferment. He cannot violate rules of fair play by doing indirectly through the corporation what he could not do directly. He cannot use his power for his personal advantage and to the detriment of the stockholders and creditors no matter how absolute in terms that power may be and no matter how meticulous he is to satisfy technical requirements. For that power is at all times subject to the equitable limitation that it may not be exercised for the aggrandisement, preference, or advantage of the fiduciary to the exclusion or detriment of the cestuis. Where there is a violation of those principles, equity will undo the wrong or intervene to prevent its consummation.\n On such a test the action of the District Court in disallowing or subordinating Litton's claim was clearly correct. Litton allowed his salary claims to lie dormant for years and sought to enforce them only when his debtor corporation was in financial difficulty. Then he used them so that the rights of another creditor were impaired. Litton as an insider utilized his strategic position for his own preferment to the damage of Pepper. Litton as the dominant influence over Dixie Splint Coal Company used his power not to deal fairly with the \n\n[308 \nU.S. 295, 312]\n\u00a0\n creditors of that company but to manipulate its affairs in such a manner that when one of its creditors came to collect her just debt the bulk of the assets had disappeared into another Litton company. Litton, though a fiduciary, was enabled by astute legal manoeuvering to acquire most of the assets of the bankrupt not for cash or other consideration of value to creditors but for bookkeeping entries representing at best merely Litton's appraisal of the worth of Litton's services over the years.\n This alone would be a sufficient basis for the exercise by the District Court of its equitable powers in disallowing the Litton claim. But when there is added the existence of a 'planned and fraudulent scheme', as found by the District Court, the necessity of equitable relief against that fraud becomes insistent. No matter how technically legal each step in that scheme may have been, once its basic nature was uncovered it was the duty of the bankruptcy court in the exercise of its equity jurisdiction to undo it. Otherwise, the fiduciary duties of dominant or management stockholders would go for naught; exploitation would become a substitute for justice; and equity would be perverted as an instrument for approving what it was designed to thwart.\n The fact that Litton perfected his lien more than four months preceding bankruptcy is no obstacle to equitable relief. In the first place, that lien was but a step in a general fraudulent plan which must be viewed in its entirety. The subsequent sale cannot be taken as an isolated step unconnected with the long antecedent events, all designed to defeat creditors. Buffum, Trustee in Bankruptcy v. Peter Barceloux Co., \n289 \nU.S. 227, 232\n, 233 S., 53 S.Ct. 539, 541. In the second place, Litton is seeking approval by the bankruptcy court of his claim. The four months' provision of the bankruptcy act, is certainly not a statutory limitation on equitable defenses arising out of a breach of fiduciary duties by him who seeks allowance of a claim. \n\n[308 \nU.S. 295, 313]\n\u00a0\n In view of these considerations we do not have occasion to determine the legitimacy of the 'one-man' corporation as a bulwark against the claims of creditors. \n28\n\u00a0\n\n Accordingly the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and that of the District Court is affirmed.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] During this litigation A. P. Pepper, the plaintiff, died and the suit was continued in the name of Jean McNeil Pepper, as his executrix. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Plaintiff, however, did appeal on certain phases of the case. See Pepper v. Dixie Splint Coal Company, 165 Va. 179, 181 S.E. 406. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The resolution of the board of directors of this new company certified that in their opinion the property 'formerly owned by Dixie Splint Coal Company and now owned by Scott Litton is worth $20,135.36 in current money of the United States and we fix the value of the same at this sum, which is to be paid for in stock.' \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] At the first meeting of creditors held on September 26, 1934, the strategic position of Litton was further improved by two other events which later the District Court quite properly denounced. In the first place, P. H. Smith, secretary and treasurer of Dixie Splint Coal Company and the one who had caused the entry of the Litton judgment on June 2, 1933, by confession against the company, was elected trustee. In the second place, Smith was authorized to employ, and did in fact employ, as attorney for the trustee, one I. M. Quillen. Quillen, or his firm, was attorney for Dixie Splint Coal Company. As such he or his firm had prepared and filed the petition in bankruptcy for the company. And he appeared at the first meeting of creditors as counsel for the bankrupt and yet at that time, as attorney for Litton, filed the claim of Litton for $ 33,468.89 as a preferred or secured claim. And at the time these appointments were made the controversy between Pepper and Litton over the latter's judgment was known and recognized, although formal proof of the Pepper claim was not filed until November 8, 1934. The grave impropriety of these appointments became striking as administration of the estate was commenced.\n On October 6, 1934, Pepper moved in her state court action to quash all execution issued and outstanding on the Litton judgment. Quillen, attorney for the bankruptcy trustee, appeared in opposition to the motion, acting as attorney for Litton and contended that the intervention of bankruptcy had deprived the state court of jurisdiction. The state court reserved decision. On October 15, 1934, Pepper petitioned the referee to direct the trustee to contest the Litton judgment in the state court proceeding. \n Quillen, stating that he acted as attorney for Litton, opposed the petition. After some delay, new counsel for the trustee were obtained who soon asked the court for authority to institute a new and independent suit in the state court to have the Litton judgment declared void. This authority was granted.\n The District Court, though condemning such steps, stated it did not suggest that Smith and Quillen were acting 'with any fraudulent plan or intention of utilizing their positions in aid of Litton and to the detriment of the estate'. Yet he denounced the impropriety of such conduct and emphasized the incompatible and conflicting positions which these persons occupied. On the professional ethics of the conduct of Quillen, the District Court aptly observed: 'It is generally accepted that an attorney for the bankrupt should not be chosen attorney for the trustee in any case. And it is even more evident that an attorney who represents a creditor whose claim is under attack should not be chosen as attorney for the trustee who, on behalf of other creditors, is charged with the duty of making that attack.' \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] This conclusion was based on the history and nature of the claims for salary. Litton's alleged claim of $33,468.99 represented $7,427.25 owed Litton and $26,041.64 owed P. H. Smith which the latter had assigned to Litton for $1 and 'other considerations' which Litton was unable to recall. As we have noted, these claims date back over a number of years. The regular salaries paid Litton and Smith were entered on the corporation's books under a 'payroll' account; the salary claims here in question were carried under separate accounts, 'P. H. Smith-Personal' and 'Scott Litton-Personal'. No sums were paid Smith from that personal account. The District Court concluded that it was hard to believe that Smith, a bookkeeper and clerk, who had been paid $2700 a year, should, with no change in the nature of his work, receive a sudden increase in salary to $8,000 a year, except upon an understanding that it was merely for record purposes and not to be paid. This conclusion was strengthened by the fact that the $26,041.64 accumulated for over five years with no effort on Smith's part to collect it and by the fact that shortly before bankruptcy he assigned the claim to Litton for a nominal consideration. As to the $7,427.25 alleged to be owed Litton the court likewise concluded that it had been entered on the books for income tax purposes and was not a 'bona fide obligation' of the company. Furthermore, a substantial part of these claims was barred by the statute of limitations. On the most tolerant assumption that could be made, according to the court, the salaries credited to Litton and Smith were merely contingent or conditional obligations not provable since they were intended to be paid only whenever the profits of the company permitted. Hence they were not fixed liabilities absolutely owing. See  63, sub. a(1), 11 U.S.C.A.  103, sub. a(1). \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] It should be noted that there is authority for the conclusion that the trustee is not necessarily precluded from questioning a judgment in the bankruptcy proceedings merely because he attacked it in a state court proceeding, where the state court did not pass upon the validity of the underlying claim. In re James A. Brady Foundry Co., 7 Cir., 3 F.2d 437; Gilbert's Collier on Bankruptcy (4th ed.)  1247. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Section 2(2), 11 U.S.C.A.  11(2). The sections are cited as they were at the time of the bankruptcy in this case. But the amendments made by the Chandler Act (52 Stat. 840), approved June 22, 1938, are not material so far as the issues here involved are concerned. \n[\nFootnote 8\n] Section 2(7). \n[\nFootnote 9\n] Section 57, sub. k, 11 U.S.C.A.  93, sub. k. \n[\nFootnote 10\n] Section 2(15). \n[\nFootnote 11\n] Thus the bankruptcy court has been held to have jurisdiction over a supplemental and ancillary bill to enjoin a creditor, after adjudication and discharge of the bankrupt, from prosecuting his claim in a state court. Local Loan Co. v. Hunt, supra. As a court in equity it has been held to have the power to protect the bankrupt estate against a fraudulent assessment; Cross v. Georgia Iron & Coal Co., 5 Cir., 250 F. 438; to compel execution of a deed to make the bankrupt's equitable title a complete legal title; Dearborn Electric Light & Power Co. v. Jones, 8 Cir., 299 F. 432; to recover assets of the estate which have been used to pay dividends under a composition order later reversed; In re Lilyknit Silk Underwear Co., Inc., 2 Cir., 73 F.2d 52. And even though the act provides that claims shall not be proved against a bankrupt estate subsequent to six months after the adjudication, the bankruptcy court in the exercise of its equitable jurisdiction has power to permit claims to be proved thereafter in order to prevent a fraud or an injustice.

If he should be a sole director, or one of a smaller number vested with certain powers, this obligation would be still stronger, and his acts subject to more severe scrutiny, and their validity determined by more rigid principles of morality, and freedom from motives of selfishness.' \n[\nFootnote 15\n] Converse v.

Dallen, 3 Cir., 76 F.2d 867, the bankrupt, prior to bankruptcy, turned in to petitioner an old cash register as a credit on account of the purchase of a new one. Pending delivery of the new machine, petitioner loaned the bankrupt another one and after the bankruptcy adjudication sought to reclaim the loaned machine. The court affirmed an order of the District Court allowing the reclamation on condition that petitioner first deliver to the bankrupt the old machine or pay the amount of its agreed value. The court said, 76 F.2d page 868, 'We do not think it necessary to determine whether the contract for the purchase of the new cash register amounted to a bailment lease or a conditional sale. Bankruptcy courts may apply rules regulating equitable actions.' \n\n[\nFootnote 19\n] In re Burntside Lodge, Inc., D.C., 7 F.Supp. 785.

I speak of Litton and Dixie Splint Coal Company because they are in reality the same. In all the experience of the law, there has never been a more prolific breeder of fraud than the one-man corporation. It is a favorite device for the escape of personal liability. This case illustrates another frequent use of this fiction of corporate entity, whereby the owner of the corporation, through his complete control over it, undertakes to gather to himself all of its assets to the exclusion of its creditors.' \n\n\n\n\n","98":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPERKINS v. ELG(1939)\nNo. 454\nArgued: February 3, 1939Decided: May 29, 1939\n\n\n\n\n[307 \nU.S. 325, 326]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Frank Murphy, Atty. Gen., and Robert H. Jackson, Sol. Gen., for Perkins et al.\n Mr. Henry F. Butler, of Washington, D.C., for Elg.\n\n\n\n[307 \nU.S. 325, 327]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question is whether the plaintiff, Marie Elizabeth Elg. who was born in the United States of Swedish parents then naturalized here, has lost her citizenship and is subject to deportation because of her removal during minority to Sweden, it appearing that her parents resumed their citizenship in that country but that she returned here on attaining majority with intention to remain and to maintain her citizenship in the United States.\n Miss Elg was born in Brooklyn, New York, on October 2, 1907. Her parents, who were natives of Sweden, emigrated to the United States sometime prior to 1906 and her father was naturalized here in that year. In 1911, her mother took her to Sweden where she continued to reside until September 7, 1929. Her father went to Sweden in 1922 and has not since returned to the United States. In November, 1934, he made a statement before an American consul in Sweden that he had voluntarily expatriated himself for the reason that he did not desire to retain the status of an American citizen and wished to preserve his allegiance to Sweden.\n In 1928, shortly before Miss Elg became twenty-one years of age, she inquired an American consul in Sweden about returning to the United States and was informed that if she returned after attaining majority she should seek an American passport. In 1929, within eight months after attaining majority, she obtained an American passport which was issued on the instructions of the Secretary of State. She then returned to the United States, was admitted as a citizen and has resided in this country ever since. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 325, 328]\n\u00a0\n In April, 1935, Miss Elg was notified by the Department of Labor that she was an alien illegally in the United States and was threatened with deportation. Proceedings to effect her deportation have been postponed from time to time. In July, 1936, she applied for an American passport but it was refused by the Secretary of State upon the sole ground that he was without authority to issue it because she was not a citizen of the United States.\n Thereupon she began this suit against the Secretary of Labor, the Acting Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization, and the Secretary of State to obtain (1) a declaratory judgment that she is a citizen of the United States and entitled to all the rights and privileges of citizenship, and (2) an injunction against the Secretary of Labor and the Commissioner of Immigration restraining them from prosecuting proceedings for her deportation, and (3) an injunction against the Secretary of State from refusing to issue to her a passport upon the ground that she is not a citizen.\n The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint, asserting that plaintiff was not a citizen of the United States by virtue of the Naturalization Convention and Protocol of 1869 (proclaimed in 1872) between the United States and Sweden (17 Stat. 809) and the Swedish Nationality Law, and Section 2 of the Act of Congress of March 2, 1907, 8 U.S.C.  17, 8 U.S.C.A.  17. The District Court overruled the motion as to the Secretary of Labor and the Commissioner of Immigration and entered a decree declaring that the plaintiff is a native citizen of the United States but directing that the complaint be dismissed as to the Secretary of State because of his official discretion in the issue of passports. On cross appeals, the Court of Appeals affirmed the decree, 69 App.D.C. 175, 99 F.2d 408. Certiorari was granted, December 5, 1938, \n305 \nU.S. 591\n, 59 S. Ct. 245, 83 L.Ed. --.\n First.-On her birth in New York, the plaintiff became a citizen of the United States. Civil Rights Act of 1866, \n\n[307 \nU.S. 325, 329]\n\u00a0\n 14 Stat. 27; Fourteenth Amendment, Section 1, U.S.C.A.Const.; United States v. Wong Kim Ark, \n169 \nU.S. 649\n, 18 S.Ct. 456. In a comprehensive review of the principles and authorities governing the decision in that case-that a child born here of alien parentage becomes a citizen of the United States-the Court adverted to the 'inherent right of every independent nation to determine for itself, and according to its own constitution and laws, what classes of persons shall be entitled to its citizenship.' United States v. Wong Kim Ark, supra, 169 U.S. page 668, 18 S.Ct. page 164. As municipal law determines how citizenship may be acquired, it follows that persons may have a dual nationality. \n1\n And the mere fact that the plaintiff may have acquired Swedish citizenship by virtue of the operation of Swedish law, on the resumption of that citizenship by her parents, does not compel the conclusion that she has lost her own citizenship acquired under our law. As at birth she became a citizen of the United States, at citizenship must be deemed to continue unless she has been deprived of it through the operation of a treaty or congressional enactment or by her voluntary action in conformity with applicable legal principles.\n Second.-It has long been a recognized principle in this country that if a child born here is taken during minority to the country of his parents' origin, where his parents resume their former allegiance, he does not thereby lose his citizenship in the United States provided that on attaining majority he elects to retain that citizenship and to return to the United States to assume its duties. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[307 \nU.S. 325, 330]\n\u00a0\n This principle was clearly stated by Attorney General Edwards Pierrepont in his letter of advice to the Secretary of State Hamilton Fish, in Steinkauler's Case, 1875, 15 Op.Atty.Gen. 15. The facts were these: One Steinkauler, a Prussian subject by birth, emigrated to the United States in 1848, was naturalized in 1854, and in the following year had a son who was born in St. Louis. Four years later Steinkauler returned to Germany taking this child and became domiciled at Weisbaden where they continuously resided. When the son reached the age of twenty years the German Government called upon him to report for military duty and his father then invoked the intervention of the American Legation on the ground that his son was a native citizen of the United States. To an inquiry by our Minister, the father declined to give an assurance that the son would return to this country within a reasonable time. On reviewing the pertinent points in the case, including the Naturalization Treaty of 1868 with North Germany, 15 Stat. 615, the Attorney General reached the following conclusion:\n'Young Steinkauler is a native-born American citizen. There is no law of the United States under which his father or any other person can deprive him of his birthright. He can return to America at the age of twenty-one, and in due time, if the people elect, he can become President of the United States; but the father, in accordance with the treaty and the laws, has renounced his American citizenship and his American allegiance and has acquired for himself and his son German citizenship and the rights which it carries and he must take the burdens as well as the advantages. The son being domiciled with the father and subject to him under the law during his minority, and receiving the German protection where he has acquired nationality and declining to give any assurance of ever returning to the United States and claiming his American nationality by residence here, I am of the opinion that he cannot rightly invoke the aid of \n\n[307 \nU.S. 325, 331]\n\u00a0\n the Government of the United States to relieve him from military duty in Germany during his minority. But I am of opinion that when he reaches the age of twenty-one years he can then elect whether he will return and take the nationality of his birth with its duties and privileges, or retain the nationality acquired by the act of his father. This seems to me to be right reason' and I think it is law'.\n\n Secretary William M. Evarts, in 1879, in an instruction to our Minister to Germany with respect to the status of the brothers Boisseliers who were born in the United States of German parentage said:3\n'Their rights rest on the organic law of the United States. ... Their father, it is true, took them to Schleswig when they were quite young, the one four and the other two years old. They lived there many years, but during all those years they were minors, and during their minority they returned to the United States; and now, when both have attained their majority, they declare for their native allegiance and submit themselves to the jurisdiction of the country where they were born and of which they are native citizens. Under these circumstances this Government cannot recognize any claim to their allegiance or their liability to military service, put forth on the part of Germany, whatever may be the municipal law of Germany under which such claim may be asserted by that Government'.\n\n Secretary Evarts gave a similar instruction in 1880 with respect to a native citizen of Danish parentage who having been taken abroad at an early age claimed American citizenship on attaining his majority, saying:4\n'He lost no time when he attained the age of majority, in declaring that he claimed the United States as his country and that he considered himself a citizen of \n\n[307 \nU.S. 325, 332]\n\u00a0\n the United States. He appears to have adhered to this choice ever since and now declares it to be his intention to return to this country and reside here permanently. His father's political status (whether a citizen of the United States or a Danish subject) has no legal or otherwise material effect on the younger P---s' rights of citizenship'.\n\n Secretary Thomas F. Bayard, in answer to an inquiry by the Netherlands Legation whether one born in the United States, of Dutch parents, who during minority had been taken back to the Netherlands by his father, on the latter's resumption of permanent residence there, was an American citizen, answered: 5\n'But the general view held by this Department is that a naturalized American citizen by abandonment of his allegiance and residence in this country and a return to the country of his birth, animo manendi, ceases to be a citizen of the United States; and that the minor son of a party described as aforesaid, who was born in the United States during the citizenship there of his father, partakes during his legal infancy of his father's domicile, but upon becoming sui juris has the right to elect his American citizenship, which will be best evidenced by an early return to this country.\n\n'This right so to elect to return to the land of his birth and assume his American citizenship could not, with the acquiescence of this Government, be impaired or interfered with.'\n\n In 1906, a memorandum, prepared in the Department of State by its law officer, was sent by the Acting Secretary of State, Robert Bacon, to the German Ambassador \n\n[307 \nU.S. 325, 333]\n\u00a0\n as covering 'the principles' upon which the Department had acted. In this memorandum it was said:6\n'Assuming that Alexander Bohn (the father) never became a citizen of the United States, Jacob Bohn (the son) was born of German parents in the United States. According to the Constitution and laws of the United States as interpreted by the courts, a child born to alien parents in the United States is an American citizen, although such child may also be a citizen of the country of his parents according to the law of that country.\n\n'Although there is no express provision in the law of the United States giving election of citizenship in such cases, this department has always held in such circumstances that if a child is born of foreign parents in the United States, and is taken during minority to the country of his parents, such child upon arriving of age, or within a reasonable time thereafter, must make election between the citizenship which is his by birth and the citizenship which is his by parentage. In case a person so circumstanced elects American citizenship he must, unless in extraordinary circumstances, in order to render his election effective, manifest an intention in good faith to return with all convenient speed to the United States and assume the duties of citizenship'.7\n\n We have quoted liberally from these rulings-and many others might be cited-in view of the contention now urged by the petitioners in resisting Miss Elg's claim to citizenship. We think that they leave no doubt of the controlling principle long recognized by this Government. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 325, 334]\n\u00a0\n That principle, while administratively applied, cannot properly be regarded as a departmental creation independently of the law. It was deemed to be a necessary consequence of the constitutional provisions by which persons born within the United States and subject to its jurisdiction become citizens of the United States. To cause a loss of that citizenship in the absence of treaty or statute having that effect, there must be voluntary action and such action cannot be attributed to an infant whose removal to another country is beyond his control and who during minority is incapable of a binding choice.\n Petitioners stress the American doctrine relating to expatriation. By the Act of July 27, 1868,8 Congress declared that 'the right of expatriation is a natural and inherent right of all people'. Expatriation is the voluntary renunciation or abandonment of nationality and allegiance. 9 It has no application to the removal from this country of a native citizen during minority. In such a case the voluntary action which is of the essence of the right of expatriation is lacking. That right is fittingly recognized where a child born here, who may be, or may become, subject to a dual nationality, elects on attaining majority citizenship in the country to which he has been removed. But there is no basis for invoking the doctrine of expatriation where native citizen who is removed to his parents' country of origin during minority returns here on his majority and elects to remain and to maintain his American citizenship. Instead of being inconsistent with the right of expatriation, the principle which permits that election conserves and applies it.\n The question then is whether this well recognized right of election has been destroyed by treaty or statute. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 325, 335]\n\u00a0\n Third.-Petitioners invoke our treaty with Sweden of 1869.10 This treaty was one of a series of naturalization treaties with similar terms, which were negotiated with various countries between 1868 and 1872.11 The relevant portions of the text of the treaty with Sweden, and of the accompanying protocol, are set forth in the margin. \n12\n\u00a0\n\n[307 \nU.S. 325, 336]\n\u00a0\n The treaty manifestly deals with expatriation and the recognition of naturalization by the respective powers. The recital states its purpose; that is, 'to regulate the citizenship of those persons who emigrate' to one country from the other. The terms of the treaty are directed to that purpose and are appropriate to the recognition of the status of those who voluntarily take up their residence for the prescribed period in the country to which they emigrate. Article I of the treaty provides:\n'Citizens of the United States of America who have resided in Sweden or Norway for a continuous period of at least five years, and during such residence have become \n\n[307 \nU.S. 325, 337]\n\u00a0\n and are lawfully, recognized as citizens of Sweden or Norway, shall be held by the government of the United States to be Swedish or Norwegian citizens, and shall be treated as such.\n\n'Reciprocally, citizens of Sweden or Norway who have resided in the United States of America for a continuous period of at least five years, and during such residence have become naturalized citizens of the United States, shall be held by the government of Sweden and Norway to be American citizens, and shall be treated as such.\n\n'The declaration of an intention to become a citizen of the one or the other country has not for either party the effect of citizenship legally acquired'.\n\n We think that this provision in its direct application clearly implies a voluntary residence and it would thus apply in the instant case to the father of respondent. There is no specific mention of minor children who have obtained citizenship by birth in the country which their parents have left. And if it be assumed that a child born in the United States would be deemed to acquire the Swedish citizenship of his parents through their return to Sweden and resumption of citizenship there,13 still nothing is said in the treaty which in such a case would destroy the right of election which appropriately belongs to the child on attaining majority. If the abrogation of that right had been in contemplation, it would naturally have been the subject of a provision suitably explicit. Rights of citizenship are not to be destroyed by an ambiguity. Moreover, the provisions of Article III must be read in connection with Article I. Article III provides:\n'If a citizen of the one party, who has become a recognized citizen of the her party, takes up his abode once more in his original country and applies to be restored to his former citizenship, the government of the last-named \n\n[307 \nU.S. 325, 338]\n\u00a0\n country is authorized to receive him again as a citizen on such conditions as the said government may think proper'.\n\n If the first article could be taken to cover the case of a child through the derivation of citizenship from that of his emigrating parents, Article III by the same token would be applicable to the case of a child born here and taken to Sweden, who at majority elects to return to the United States and to assume the privileges and obligations of American citizenship. In that event, the Government of the United States is expressly authorized to receive one so returning 'as a citizen on such conditions as the said government may think proper'. And if this Government considers that a native citizen taken from the United States by his parents during minority is entitled to retain his American citizenship by electing at majority to return and reside here, there would appear to be nothing in the treaty which would gainsay the authority of the United States to recognize that privilege of election and to receive the returning native upon that basis. Thus, on the facts of the present case, the treaty does not purport to deny to the United States the right to treat respondent as a citizen of the United States, and it necessarily follows that, in the absence of such a denial, the treaty cannot be set up as a ground for refusing to accord to respondent the rights of citizenship in accordance with our Constitution and laws by virtue of her birth in the United States.\n Nor do we find anything in the terms of the protocol, accompanying the treaty, which can be taken to override the right of election which respondent would otherwise possess. Article III of the protocol refers to the case of a Swede who has become a naturalized citizen of the United States and later renews his residence in Sweden 'without the intent to return to America'. And \n\n[307 \nU.S. 325, 339]\n\u00a0\n it provides that the intent not to return may be held to exist when the person 'so naturalized' resides more than two years in Sweden. This does not appear to be applicable to respondent, who was born in the United States, but, apart from that, the intent not to return could not properly be attributed to her during minority, and if it were so attributed, the presumption would be rebutted by the election to return to the United States at majority. Compare United States v. Howe, D.C., 231 F. 546, 549. 14\n The views we have expressed find support in the construction placed upon the naturalization treaties of 1868 to 187215 in the period following their ratification. The first of those treaties was made in 1868 with the North German Confederation16 and contained provisions similar to those found in the treaty with Sweden. But it was under this German treaty that Steinkauler's case arose in 1875, to which we have already referred, where Attorney General Pierrepont upheld the right of election, saying:17 'Under the treaty, and in harmony with the American doctrine, it is clear that Steinkauler, the father, abandoned his naturalization in America and became a German subject (his son being yet a minor) and that by virtue of German laws the son acquired German nationality. It is equally clear that the son by birth has American nationality; and hence he has two nationalities, one natural, the other acquired. ... There is no law of \n\n[307 \nU.S. 325, 340]\n\u00a0\n the United States under which his father or any other person can deprive him of his birthright'. To the same effect, as to the right of election, was the ruling of Secretary Evarts in 1879 in his instruction, above quoted, to our minister to Germany with respect to the brothers Boisseliers. \n18\n\u00a0\n\n There were provisions, similar to those in the treaty with Sweden in the naturalization treaty with Denmark of 1872,19 but Secretary Evarts evidently did not regard those provisions as inconsistent with the claim, which he sustained, of one born here of Danish parentage who was taken abroad by his parents but insisted upon his American citizenship when he arrived at his majority. \n20\n These rulings, following closely upon the negotiation of these naturalization treaties, show beyond question that the treaties were not regarded as abrogating the right of election for which respondent here contends.\n Later rulings were to the same effect. Thus, in 1890, in dealing with a native American citizen who, upon his own application, had been admitted to Danish citizenship during his minority, and who had not yet come of age, the Secretary of State, while recognizing that 'when a citizen of the United States voluntarily becomes naturalized or renaturalized in a foreign country, he is to be regarded as having lost his rights as an American citizen', was careful to make the following qualifications in support of the right of election at majority, saying:\n'As Mr. Andersen has not yet attained his majority, the Department is not prepared to admit that proceedings taken on his behalf in Denmark during his minority would deprive him of his right, upon reaching the age of twenty-one years, to elect to become an American \n\n[307 \nU.S. 325, 341]\n\u00a0\n citizen by immediately returning to this country to resume his allegiance here'.21\n\n Petitioners refer to an instruction by Secretary Sherman in 189722 in answer to a question as to the effect of a person's return to his native country for a visit on his rights as an American citizen which had been acquired through the naturalization of his father. While Secretary Sherman recognized 'the acquisition of United States citizenship by an alien-born minor through the lawful naturalization of his father under the operation of Section 2172, Revised Statutes', 8 U.S.C.A.  7, the Secretary added the following:\n'If such a party having thus become a recognized citizen of the United States, takes up his abode once more in his original country, and applies to be stored to his former citizenship, the government of the last named country is authorized to receive him again as a citizen, on such conditions$as the said Government may think proper (Treaty of 1869, Article III). Or he may by residence in the country of origin, without intent to return to the United States, be held to have renounced his American citizenship (Protocol, May 26, 1869). But this presumption, like all presumptions of intent, may be rebutted by proof. Until a person so circumstanced shall be held to have voluntarily abandoned his American citizenship, or shall have acquired another citizenship upon application to that end and by due process of law, this Government is entitled to claim his allegiance and constrained to protect him as a citizen so long as he shall be found bona fide entitled thereto'. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 325, 342]\n\u00a0\n We find nothing in that instruction which is inconsistent with the maintenance of respondent's right of election in the instant case. So far as the instruction in relation to a naturalized minor may be deemed to be pertinent, it confirms rather than opposes respondent's right to be considered an American citizen.\n\n That the Department of State continued to maintain the right of election is further shown by the memorandum of applicable principles which it issued in 1906, above quoted, to the effect that the Department had 'always held in such circumstances that if a child is born of foreign parents in the United States, and is taken during minority to the country of his parents, such child upon arriving of age, or within a reasonable time thereafter, must make election between the citizenship which is his by birth and the citizenship which is his by parentage'.23\n Fourth.-We think that petitioners' contention under Section 2 of the Act of March 2, 1907,24 is equally untenable. That statutory provision is as follows:\n'That any American citizen shall be deemed to have expatriated himself when he has been naturalized in any foreign State in conformity with its laws, or when he has taken an oath of allegiance to any foreign State.\n\n'When any naturalized citizen shall have resided for two years in the foreign State from which he came, or for five years in any other foreign State it shall be presumed that he has ceased to be an American citizen, and the place of his general abode shall be deemed his place of residence during said year. Provided, however, That such presumption may be overcome on the presentation of satisfactory evidence to a diplomatic or consular officer of the United States, under such rules and regulations as \n\n[307 \nU.S. 325, 343]\n\u00a0\n the Department of State may prescribe. And provided also, That no American citizen shall be allowed to expatriate himself when this country is at war'.25\n\n Petitioners contend that respondent's acquisition of derivative Swedish citizenship makes here a person who has been 'naturalized under Swedish law', and that therefore 'she has lost her American citizenship' through the operation of this statute. We are unable to accept that view. We think that the statute was aimed at a voluntary expatriation and we find no evidence in its terms that it was intended to destroy the right of a native citizen, removed from this country during minority, to elect to retain the citizenship acquired by birth and to return here for that purpose. If by virtue of derivation from the citizenship of one's parents a child in that situation can be deemed to have been naturalized under the foreign law, still we think in the absence of any provision to the contrary that such naturalization would not destroy the right of election. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 325, 344]\n\u00a0\n It should also be noted that the Act of 1907 in Sections 5 and 6, 8 U. S.C.A.  8, 6,26 has specific reference to children born without the United States of alien parents but says nothing as to the loss of citizenship by minor children born in the United States.\n That in the latter case the child was not deemed to have lost his American citizenship by virtue of the terms of the statute but might still with reasonable promptness on attaining majority manifest his election is shown by the views expressed in the instructions issued under date of November 24, 1923, by the Department of State to the American Diplomatic and Consular Officers. 27 These instructions dealt with the questions arising under the citizenship act of March 2, 1907, and cases of dual nationality. It was stated that it was deemed desirable 'to inform diplomatic and consular officers of the department's conclusions, for their guidance in handling individual cases'. Commenting on dual nationality the instructions said:\n'The term 'dual nationality' needs exact appreciation. It refers to the fact that two States make equal claim to the allegiance of an individual at the same time. Thus, one State may claim his allegiance because of his birth within its territory, and the other because at the time of his birth in foreign territory his parents were its nationals. The laws of the United States purport to clothe persons with American citizenship by virtue of both principles.'\n\n And after referring to the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S.C.A.Const., and the Act of February 10, 1855, R.S.  1993, 8 U.S.C.A.  6, the instructions continued: \n\n[307 \nU.S. 325, 345]\n\u00a0\n 'It thus becomes important to note how far these differing claims of American nationality are fairly operative with respect to persons living abroad, whether they were born abroad or were born in the United States of alien parents and taken during minority to reside in the territory of States to which the parents owed allegiance. It is logical that, while the child remains or resides in territory of the foreign State claiming him as a national, the United States should respect its claim to allegiance. The important point to observe is that the doctrine of dual allegiance ceases, in American contemplation, to be fully applicable after the child has reached adult years. Thereafter two States may in fact claim him as a national. Those claims are not, however, regarded as of equal merit, because one of the States may then justly assert that his relationship to itself as a national is, by reason of circumstances that have arisen, inconsistent with, and reasonably superior to, any claim of allegiance asserted by any other State. Ordinarily the State in which the individual retains his residence after attaining his majority has the superior claim. The statutory law of the United States affords some guidance but not all that could be desired, because it fails to announce the circumstances when the child who resides abroad within the territory of a State reasonably claiming his allegiance forfeits completely the right to perfect his inchoate right to retain American citizenship. The department must, therefore, be reluctant to declare that particular conduct on the part of a person after reaching adult years in foreign territory produces a forfeiture or something equivalent to expatriation.\n'The statute does, however, make a distinction between the burden imposed upon the person born in the United States of foreign parents and the person born abroad of American parents. With respect to the latter, section 6 of the Act of March 2, 1907, lays down the requirement \n\n[307 \nU.S. 325, 346]\n\u00a0\n that, as a condition to the protection of the United States, the individual must, upon reaching the age of 18, record at an American consulate an intention to remain a citizen of the United States, and must also take an oath of allegiance to the United States upon attaining his majority.\n\n'The child born of foreign parents in the United States who spends his minority in the foreign country of his parents' nationality is not expressly required by any statute of the United States to make the same election as he approaches or attains his majority. It is, nevertheless, believed that his retention of a right to demand the protection of the United States should, despite the absence of statute, be dependent upon his convincing the department within a reasonable period after the attaining of his majority of an election to return to the United States, there to assume the duties of citizenship. In the absence of a definite statutory requirement, it is impossible to prescribe a limited period within which such election should be made. On the other hand, it may be asserted negatively that one who has long manifested no indication of a will to make such an election should not receive the protection of the United States save under the express approval of the department'.\n\n It thus appears that as late as 1925, when the Department issued its 'Compilation' including the circular instruction of November 24, 1923, it was the view of the Department of State that the Act of March 2, 1907, had not taken away the right of a native citizen on attaining majority to retain his American citizenship, where he was born in the United States of foreign rents. We do not think that it would be a proper construction of the Act to hold that while it leaves untouched the right of election on the part of a child born in the United States, in case his parents were foreign nationals at the time of his birth and have never lost their foreign nationality, still the statute should be treated as destroying that \n\n[307 \nU.S. 325, 347]\n\u00a0\n right of election if his parents became foreign nationals through naturalization. That would not seem to be a sensible distinction. Having regard to the plain purpose of Section 2 of the Act of 1907, to deal with voluntary expatriation, we are of the opinion that its provisions do not affect the right of election, which would otherwise exist, by reason of a wholly involuntary and merely derivative naturalization in another country during minority. And, on the facts of the instant case, this view apparently obtained when in July, 1929, on the instructions of the Secretary of State, the Department issued the passport to respondent as a citizen of the United States.\n But although respondent promptly made her election and took up her residence in this country accordingly, and had continued to reside here, she was notified in April, 1935, that she was an alien and was threatened with deportation.\n When, precisely, there occurred a change in the departmental attitude is not clear. \n28\n It seems to have resulted in a conflict with the opinion of the Solicitor of the Department of Labor in the case of Ingrid Therese Tobiassen, and the Secretary of Labor because of that conflict requested the opinion of the Attorney General, which was given on June 16, 1932.29 It appeared that Miss Tobiassen, aged 20, was born in New York in 1911; that her father, a native of Norway, became a citizen of the United States by naturalization in 1912; that in 1919 Miss Tobiassen was taken by her parents to Norway where the latter had since resided; that at the age of 18 she returned to the United States and took up her permanent residence in New Jersey. The question arose \n\n[307 \nU.S. 325, 348]\n\u00a0\n when she asked for a return permit to visit her parents. The Department of State refused to issue a passport on the ground that Miss Tobiassen had acquired Norwegian nationality and had ceased to be an American citizen. The Attorney General's opinion approved that action.\n His opinion quoted the provisions of the treaty with Sweden and Norway of 1869 30 and referred to the Norwegian Nationality Law of August 8, 1924, and to the provisions of the Act of Congress of March 2, 1907. The opinion noted that the claim that Miss Tobiassen had ceased to be an American citizen did 'not rest upon the terms of the Naturalization Treaty with Norway, but upon a law of that country, as a result of the renunciation by her father, a native of Norway, of his American citizenship, and the resumption of his Norwegian nationality in pursuance of the terms of that treaty'. The law of Norway was deemed to be analogous to our statutes 'by virtue of which foreign-born minor children of persons naturalized in the United States are declared to be citizens of this country'; and hence the conclusion that Miss Tobiassen having acquired Norwegian nationality had in consequence ceased to be an American citizen was said to be correct.\n The opinion does not discuss the right of election of a native citizen of the United States when he becomes of age to retain American citizenship and does not refer to the repeated rulings of the Department of State in recognition of that right, the exercise of which, as we have pointed out, should not be deemed to be inconsistent with either treaty or statute. We are reluctant to disagree with the opinion of the Attorney General, and we are fully conscious of the problems incident to dual nationality and of the departmental desire to limit them, \n\n[307 \nU.S. 325, 349]\n\u00a0\n but we are compelled to agree with the Court of Appeals in the instant case that the conclusions of that opinion are not adequately supported and are opposed to the established principles which should govern the disposition of this case. \n31\n\u00a0\n\n Nor do we think that recent private acts of Congress32 for the relief of native citizens who have been the subject of administrative action denying their rights of citizenship, can be regarded as the equivalent of an Act of Congress providing that persons in the situation of the respondent here have lost the American citizenship which they acquired at birth and have since duly elected to retain. No such statute has been enacted.\n We conclude that respondent has not lost her citizenship in the United States and is entitled to all the rights and privileges of that citizenship.\n Fifth.-The cross petition of Miss Elg, upon which certiorari was granted in No. 455, is addressed to the part of the decree below which dismissed the bill of complaint as against the Secretary of State. The dismissal was upon the ground that the court would not undertake by mandamus to compel the issuance of a passport or control by means of a declaratory judgment the discretion of the Secretary of State. But the Secretary of State, according to the allegation of the bill of complaint, had refused to issue a passport to Miss Elg 'solely on the ground that she had lost her native born American citizenship.' The court below, properly recognizing the existence of an actual controversy with the defendants \n\n[307 \nU.S. 325, 350]\n\u00a0\n (Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth, \n300 \nU.S. 227\n, 57 S.Ct. 461, 108 A.L.R. 1000), declared Miss Elg 'to be a natural born citizen of the United States' (99 F.2d 414) and we think that the decree should include the Secretary of State as well as the other defendants. The decree in that sense would in no way interfere with the exercise of the Secretary's discretion with respect to the issue of a passport but would simply preclude the denial of a passport on the sole ground that Miss Elg had lost her American citizenship.\n The decree will be modified accordingly so as to strike out that portion which dismisses the bill of complaint as to the Secretary of State, and so as to include him in the declaratory provision of the decree, and as so modified the decree is affirmed. It is so ordered.\n Decree modified and, as modified, affirmed.\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Oppenheim's International Law, Vol. I, Sec. 308; Moore, International Law Digest, Vol. III, p. 518; Hyde, International Law, Vol. I, Sec. 372; Flournoy, Dual Nationality and Election, 30 Yale Law Journal, 546; Borchard, Diplomatic Protection of Citizens Abroad, Sec. 253; Van Dyne, Citizenship of the United States, p. 25; Fenwick, International Law, p. 165. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Hyde, op. cit., Secs. 374, 375; Borchard, op. cit., Sec. 259; Van Dyne, op. cit., pp. 25-31; Moore, Int.

I. Citizens of the United States of America who have resided in Sweden or Norway for a continuous period of at least five years, and during such residence have become and are lawfully recognized as citizens of Sweden or Norway, shall be held by the government of the United States to be Swedish or Norwegian citizens, and shall be treated as such.\n\n'Reciprocally, citizens of Sweden or Norway who have resided in the United States of America for a continuous period of at least five years, and during such residence have become naturalized citizens of the United States, shall be held by the government of Sweden and Norway to be American citizens, and shall be treated as such.\n\n'The declaration of an intention to become a citizen of the one or the other country has not for either party the effect of citizenship legally acquired.\n\n'Art. III.

Relating to the first article of the convention. \n\n'It is understood that if a citizen of the United States of America has been discharged from his American citizenship, or, on the other side, if a Swede or a Norwegian has been discharged from his Swedish or Norwegian citizenship, in the manner legally prescribed by the government of his original country, and then in the other country in a rightful and perfectly valid manner acquires citizenship, then an additional five years' residence shall no longer be required; but a person who has in that manner been recognized as a citizen of the other country shall, from the moment thereof, be held and treated as a Swedish or Norwegian citizen, and, reciprocally, as a citizen of the United States.\n\n'III. Relating to the third article of the convention.\n\n'It is further agreed that if a Swede or Norwegian, who has become a naturalized citizen of the United States, renews his residence in Sweden or Norway without the intent to return to America, he shall be held by the government of the United States to have renounced his American citizenship.\n\n'The intent not to return to America may be held to exist when the person so naturalized resides more than two years in Sweden or Norway'. \n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] Compare Secretary Hay to Mr. Harris, Foreign Relations, 1900, p. 13. \n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] While the nationality law of Sweden is not to be regarded as controlling unless the treaty makes it so-which we have found is not the case-it may be observed that it is not clear that the law of Sweden would operate so as to preclude recognition that respondent is a citizen of the United States.

STATE OF LA.(1939)\nNo. 142\nArgued: Decided: February 27, 1939\n\n\n\n Mr. Maurice R. Woulfe, of New Orleans, La., for petitioner.\n Mr. John E. Fleury, of Gretna, La., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Indicted for murder, petitioner, a member of the negro race, was convicted and sentenced to death in a State court of the Parish of St. John the Baptist, Louisiana. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 354, 355]\n\u00a0\n The Louisiana Supreme Court affirmed. \n1\n His petition for certiorari to review the Louisiana Supreme Court's judgment rested upon the grave claim- earnestly, but unsuccessfully urged in both State courts-that because of his race he had not been accorded the equal protection of the laws guaranteed to all races in all the States by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution, U.S.C.A. For this reason, we granted certiorari. \n 2\n\u00a0\n\n The indictment against petitioner was returned January 18, 1937. He made timely motion to quash the indictment and the general venire from which had been drawn both the Grand Jury that returned the indictment and the Petit Jury for the week of his trial. His motion also prayed that the Grand Jury Panel and the Petit Jury Panel be quashed. This sworn motion alleged that petitioner was a negro and had been indicted for murder of a white man; that at least one-third of the population of the Parish from which the Grand and Petit Juries were drawn were members of the negro race, but the general venire had contained no names of negroes when the Grand Jury that indicted petitioner was drawn; that the State officers charged by law with the duty of providing names for the general venire had 'deliberately excluded therefrom the names of any negroes qualified to serve as Grand or Petit Jurors, ...' and had 'systematically, unlawfully and unconstitutionally excluded negroes from the Grand or Petit Jury in said Parish' for at least twenty years 'solely and only because of their race and color'; and that petitioner had thus been denied the equal protection of the laws guaranteed him by the Constitution of Louisiana 1921, art. 1,  2, and the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n No pleadings denying these allegations appear in the record, and the State offered no witnesses on the mo- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 354, 356]\n\u00a0\n tion. Petitioner offered twelve witnesses who were questioned by his counsel, the State's Assistant District Attorney, and the court. On the basis of this evidence, the trial judge sustained the motion to quash the Petit Jury Panel and venire and subsequently ordered the box containing the general venire (from which both Grand and Petit Juries had been drawn) emptied, purged and refilled. This was done; a new Petit Jury Panel composed of both whites and negroes was subsequently drawn from the refilled Jury box and from this Panel a Petit Jury was selected which tried and convicted petitioner. Although the Grand Jury that indicted petitioner and the quashed Petit Jury Panel had been selected from the same original general venire3 the trial judge overruled that part of petitioner's motion seeking to quash the Grand Jury Panel and the indictment.\n First. The reason assigned by the trial judge for refusing to quash the Grand Jury Panel and indictment was that 'the Constitutional rights of the defendant (are) ... not affected by reason of the fact that persons of the Colored or African race are not placed on the Grand Jury, because ... the mere presentment of an indictment is not evidence of guilt ... it simply informs the Court \n\n[306 \nU.S. 354, 357]\n\u00a0\n of a commission of a crime and brings the accused before the court for prosecution.' But the bill of rights of the Louisiana Constitution 1921 ( Dart. 1932, Art. 1,  9) provides that 'no person shall be held to answer for capital crime unless on a presentment or indictment by a grand jury , ....' And the State concedes here, as the Supreme Court of Louisiana pointed out in its opinion in this case, that '... it is specially provided in the (Louisiana) law prescribing the method of drawing grand and petit jurors to serve in both civil and criminal cases that 'there shall be no distinction made on account of race, color, or previous condition (of servitude)\" and 'If ... (qualified) members of the Negro ... race ... have been systematically excluded from ... service in the parish of St. John, ... solely because of their race or color, the indictment should have been quashed ....' (189 La. 764, 180 So. 631, 632 .) Exclusion from Grand or Petit Jury service on account of race is forbidden by the Fourteenth Amendment. \n4\n In addition to the safeguards of the Fourteenth Amendment, Congress has provided that 'No citizen possessing all other qualifications ... shall be disqualified for service as grand or petit jurors in any court of the United States, or of any State, on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude ; ....'5 Petitioner does not here contend that Louisiana laws required an unconstitutional exclusion or negroes from the Grand Jury which indicted him. His evidence was offered to show that Louisiana-acting through its administrative officers-had deliberately and systematically excluded negroes from jury service because of race, in violation of the laws and Constitutions of Louisiana and the United States. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n[306 \nU.S. 354, 358]\n\u00a0\n If petitioner's evidence of such systematic exclusion of negroes from the general venire was sufficient to support the trial court's action in quashing the Petit Jury drawn from that general venire, it necessarily follows that the indictment returned by a Grand Jury, selected from the same general venire, should also have been quashed.\n Second. But the State insists, and the Louisiana Supreme Court held ( the Chief Justice dissenting), that this evidence failed to establish that members of the negro race were excluded from the Grand Jury venire on account of race, and that the trial court's finding of discrimination was erroneous. Our decision and judgment must therefore turn upon these disputed questions of fact. In our consideration of the facts the conclusions reached by the Supreme Court of Louisiana are entitled to great respect. Yet, when a claim is properly asserted-as in this case-that a citizen whose life is at stake has been denied the equal protection of the country's laws on account of his race, it becomes our solemn duty to make independent inquiry and determination of the disputed facts7-for equal protection to all is the basic principle upon which justice under law rests. Indictment by Grand jury and trial by jury cease to harmonize with our traditional concepts of justice at the very moment particular groups, classes or races-otherwise qualified to serve as jurors in a community-are excluded as such from jury service8. The Fourteenth Amendment intrusts those who because of race are denied equal protection of the laws in a State first 'to the revisory power of the higher courts of the State, and ultimately to the review of this court.' \n9\n\u00a0\n\n Petitioner's witnesses on the motion were the Clerk of the court-ex- officio a member of the Jury Commission; \n\n[306 \nU.S. 354, 359]\n\u00a0\n the Sheriff of the Parish; the Superintendent of Schools who had served the Parish for eleven years; and other residents of the Parish, both white and colored. The testimony of petitioner's witnesses (the State offered no witnesses) showed that from 1896 to 1936 no negro had served on the Grand or Petit Juries in the Parish; that a venire of three hundred in December, 1936, contained the names of three negroes, one of whom was then dead, one of whom (D. N. Dinbaut) was listed on the venire as F. N. Dinfant; the third-called for Petit Jury service in January, 1937-was the only negro who had ever been called for jury service within the memory of the Clerk of the court, the Sheriff, or any other witnesses who testified; and that there were many negro citizens of the Parish qualified under the laws of Louisiana to serve as Grand or Petit Jurors. According to the testimony, negroes constituted 25 to 50 per cent of a total Parish population of twelve to fifteen thousand. The report of the United States Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, for 1930, shows that the total Parish population was fourteen thousand and seventy-eight, 49.7 per cent native white, and 49.3 per cent negro. In a total negro population (ten years old and over) of five thousand two hundred and ninety, 29.9 per cent were classified by the census as illiterate.\n The Louisiana Supreme Court found-contrary to the trial judge-that negroes had not been excluded from jury service on account of race, but that their exclusion was the result of a bona fide compliance by the Jury Commission with State laws prescribing jury qualifications. With this conclusion we cannot agree. Louisiana law requires the Commissioners to select names for the general venire from persons qualified to serve without distinction as to race or color. In order to be qualified a person must be: \n\n[306 \nU.S. 354, 360]\n\u00a0\n (a) A citizen of the State, over twenty-one years of age with two years' residence in the Parish.\n\n\n (b)\n Able to read and write the English language,\n\n\n (c)\n Not charged with any offense or convicted of a felony,\n\n\n (d)\n Of well known good character and standing in the community. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n The fact that approximately one-half of the Parish's population were negroes demonstrates that there could have been no lack of colored residents over twenty-one years of age.\n It appears from the 1930 census that 70 per cent of the negro population of the Parish was literate, and the County Superintendent of Schools testified that fully two thousand five hundred (83 per cent), of the Parish's negro population estimated by him at only three thousand, were able to read and write. Petitioner's evidence established beyond question that the majority of the negro population could read and write, and, in this respect, were eligible under the statute for selection as jurymen.\n There is no evidence on which even an inference can be based that any appreciable number of the otherwise qualified negroes in the Parish were disqualified for selection because of bad character or criminal records.\n We conclude that the exclusion of negroes from jury service was not due to their failure to possess the statutory qualifications.\n The general venire box for the Parish in which petitioner was tried was required11-under Louisiana law-to contain a list of three hundred names selected by Jury Commissioners appointed by the District Judge, and this list had to be supplemented from time to time so as to \n\n[306 \nU.S. 354, 361]\n\u00a0\n maintain the required three hundred names. Although Petit Jurors are drawn from the general venire box after the names have been well mixed,12 the law provides13 that 'the commission shall select ... (from the general venire list) the names of twenty citizens, possessing the qualifications of grand jurors, ....' (Italics supplied.) The twenty names out of which the challenged Grand Jury of twelve was drawn, actually were the first twenty names on a new list of fifty names supplied-on the day the Grand Jury List was selected-by the Jury Commission as a 'supplement' to the general venire of three hundred. Thus, if colored citizens had been named on the general venire, they apparently were not considered, because the Commission went no further than the first twenty names on the supplemental list which itself contained no names of negroes. Furthermore, the uncontradicted evidence on the motion to quash showed that no negro had ever been selected for Grand Jury service in the Parish within the memory of any of the witnesses who testified on that point.\n The testimony introduced by petitioner on his motion to quash created a strong prima facie showing that negroes had been systematically excluded- because of race-from the Grand Jury and the venire from which it was selected. Such an exclusion is a denial of equal protection of the laws, contrary to the Federal Constitution-the supreme law of the land. \n14\n 'The fact that the testimony ... was not challenged by evidence appropriately direct, cannot be brushed aside.' \n15\n Had there been evidence obtainable to contradict and disprove the testimony offered \n\n[306 \nU.S. 354, 362]\n\u00a0\n by petitioner, it cannot be assumed that the State would have refrained from introducing it. The Jury Commissioners, appointed by the District Judge, were not produced as witnesses by the State. The trial judge, who had appointed the Commission, listening to the evidence and aided by a familiarity with conditions in the Parish of many years' standing, as judge, prosecutor and practicing attorney, concluded that negroes had been excluded from Jury service because of their race, and ordered the venire quashed and the box purged and refilled. Our examination of the evidence convinces us that the bill of exceptions which he signed correctly stated that petitioner 'did prove at the trial of said motion to Quash that negroes as persons of color had been purposely excluded from the Grand Jury Venire and Panel which returned said indictment against ... ( petitioner) on account of their color and race, ....'\n Principles which forbid discrimination in the selection of Petit Juries also govern the selection of Grand Juries. 'It is a right to which every colored man is entitled, that, in the selection of jurors to pass upon his life, liberty, or property, there shall be no exclusion of his race, and no discrimination against them because of their color.' \n16\n This record requires the holding that the court below was in error both in affirming the conviction of petitioner and in failing to hold that the indictment against him should have been quashed. The cause is reversed and remanded to the Supreme Court of Louisiana.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 189 La. 764, 180 So. 630. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] \n305 \nU.S. 586\n, 59 S.Ct. 100, 83 L.Ed. --. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Under Louisiana practice the District Judge orders the Jury Commission to select three hundred qualified jurors in a given Parish, who compose the general venire list, to be kept complete and supplemented from time to time.

Gen., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[308 \nU.S. 21, 29]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Home Owners' Loan Corporation brought this proceeding in the Baltimore City Court for a writ of mandamus requiring the Clerk of the Superior Court of Baltimore to record a mortgage executed to the Corporation upon the payment of the ordinary recording charge and without affixing stamps for the state recording tax. Demurrer to the petition was overruled, the Clerk did not avail himself of the opportunity to answer, and mandamus was granted. The order was affirmed by the Court of Appeals of Maryland. 175 Md. 512, 2 A.2d 689. We granted certiorari. \n306 \nU.S. 628\n, 59 S.Ct. 787\n\n\n The Maryland statute imposes a tax upon every mortgage, recorded or offered for record, at the rate of 10 cents for each $100, or fraction thereof, of the principal amount of the debt secured by the mortgage. \n1\n As the Home Owners' Loan Corporation is expressly declared to be an instrumentality of the United States, Home \n\n[308 \nU.S. 21, 30]\n\u00a0\n Owners' Loan Act of 1933, c. 64, 48 Stat. 128, 12 U.S.C.A.  1461 et seq., and the mortage was acquired in that capacity, the Court of Appeals held the tax as thus applied to be invalid.\n The court relied upon our decision in Federal Land Bank v. Crosland, \n261 \nU.S. 374\n, 43 S.Ct. 385, 29 A.L.R. 1. The question there related to a tax imposed by Alabama as a condition for the recording of a mortgage executed to a Federal Land Bank. The Federal Farm Loan Act of 1916 provides that first mortgages executed to Federal Land Banks shall be deemed 'instrumentalities of the Government of the United States, and as such they and the income derived therefrom shall be exempt from Federal, State, municipal, and local taxation'. 39 Stat, 360, 380  26, 12 U.S.C.A .  931. We held that the state tax, as distinguished from a reasonable fee to meet the expenses of the registry, constituted a general tax on mortgages, using the condition attached to registration as a practical mode of collecting it, and that the tax on the mortgage in question was beyond the power of the State.\n Petitioner suggests that the Crosland case may be distinguished; that the Alabama tax was imposed on the lender, whereas the Maryland tax is on the privilege of recording the instrument and the statute is silent as to \n\n[308 \nU.S. 21, 31]\n\u00a0\n the one who shall pay the tax; also that the Federal Farm Loan Act expressly declared the mortgages of Federal Land Banks to be instrumentalities of the Federal Government. The Court of Appeals thought these differences to be immaterial. As to the first, the court rightly observed that in the Crosland case the provision for the payment of tax by the lender was regarded as having no determining significance. We said that 'whoever pays it it is a tax upon the mortgage and that is what is forbidden by the law of the United States'. 261 U.S. pages 378, 379, 43 S. Ct. page 387, 29 A.L.R. 1. Here, also, the tax is imposed upon the mortgage and is graded according to the amount of the loan,2 and the condition attached to the regislation is a practical method of collection. The recording sought was for the protection of the interest of the Home Owners' Loan Corporation. In fact, the mortgage in the instant case was offered for record by the Corporation and the tax was demanded from the Corporation.\n The second suggested distinction rests upon the terms of the Home Owners' Loan Act. That provides3 that the Home Owners' Loan Corporation, its franchise, capital, reserves and surplus, and its loans and income shall be exempt from all state or municipal taxes. The critical term, in the present relation, is 'loans'. We think that this term, in order to carry out the manifest purpose of the broad exemption, should be construed as covering the entire process of lending, the debts which result therefrom and the mortgages given to the Corporation as security. The Home Owners' Loan Act requires that the loans made by the Corporation 'shall be secured by \n\n[308 \nU.S. 21, 32]\n\u00a0\n a duly recorded home mortgage'. 4 Both the mortgage and its recordation were indispensable elements in the lending operations authorized by Congress. We agree with the state court that there is no sound distinction which makes inapplicable the reasoning which was dicisive in the Crosland case.\n Alive to this consideration, petitioner advances a broader contention, asking us to review and overrule the Crosland decision as being out of harmony with correct principle. Petitioner insists that the tax is not discriminatory; that it does not impose a burden upon the Home Owners' Loan Corporation; and that if the Act of Congress be construed as conferring an immunity, it went beyond the power of Congress, as Congress cannot 'grant an immunity of greater extent than the constitutional immunity'.\n We assume here, as we assumed in Graves v. New York ex rel. O'Keefe, \n306 \nU.S. 466\n, 59 S.Ct. 595, 120 A.L.R. 1466, that the creation of the Home Owners' Loan Corporation was a constitutional exercise of the congressional power and that the activities of the Corporation through which the national government lawfully acts must be regarded as governmental functions and as entitled to whatever immunity attaches to those functions when performed by the government itself through its departments. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, pages 421, 422; Smith v. Kansas City Title Co., \n255 \nU.S. 180, 208\n, 209 S., 41 S.Ct. 243, 248; Graves v. New York ex rel. O'Keefe, supra. Congress has not only the power to create a corporation to facilitate the performance of gov- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 21, 33]\n\u00a0\n ernmental functions, but has the power to protect the operations thus validly authorized. 'A power to create implies a power to preserve'. McCulloch v. Maryland, supra, 4 Wheat. page 426. This power to preserve necessarily comes within the range of the express power conferred upon Congress to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution all powers vested by the Constitution in the Government of the United States. Const. Art. I, sec. 8, cl. 18, U.S. C.A. In the exercise of this power to protect the lawful activities of its agencies, Congress has the dominant authority which necessarily inheres in its action within the national field. The Shreveport Case, \n234 \nU.S. 342, 351\n, 352 S., 34 S.Ct. 833, 836. The exercise of this protective power in relation to state taxation has many illustrations. See, e.g., Bank of New York v. Supervisors of New York County, 7 Wall. 26, 31; Choate v. Trapp, \n224 \nU.S. 665, 668\n, 669 S., 32 S.Ct. 565, 566; Smith v. Kansas City Title Co., supra, 255 U.S. page 207, 41 S.Ct. page 247; Trotter v. Tennessee, \n290 \nU.S. 354, 356\n, 54 S.Ct. 138, 139; Lawrence v. Shaw, \n300 \nU.S. 245, 249\n, 57 S.Ct. 443, 445. In this instance, Congress has undertaken to safeguard the operations of the Home Owners' Loan Corporation by providing the described immunity. As we have said, we construe this provision as embracing and prohibiting the tax in question. Since Congress had the constitutional authority to enact this provision, it is binding upon this Court as the supreme law of the land. Const. Art.

Fitzgerald, a citizen of Ireland, and his wife Lida, entered into an agreement with each other and with Josiah V. Thompson, Charles E. Lenhart, and Fitzgerald, as trustees, which recited the marriage of the two first named, that they had three sons, and that, on December 5, 1906, Lida had obtained a decree of divorce in Ireland. The agreement provided \n\n[305 \nU.S. 456, 458]\n\u00a0\n for payments of alimony by Gerald to Lida pending an absolute divorce ( which was eventually granted), and for payments thereafter by Gerald to the trustees for the benefit of Lida and the children, to be made out of his share of the profits of two partnerships of which he was a member. From these profits Gerald was to pay the trustees for Lida's benefit an annuity of $15,000 for the first three years and $20,000 thereafter. He was further to pay any difference between the amount of the annuity and one-third of his share of the profits annually until a fund should be established in the hands of the trustees amounting to $300,000, in which Lida, the sons, and Gerald were given interests, either of income or principal or both. In the event of death, resignation, or disability of a trustee, or a successor trustee, the vacancy was to be filled by appointment of the two remaining trustees, or, on their failure to appoint, by the Court of Common Pleas of Fayette County, Pennsylvania, on the petition of a remaining trustee or of Lida.\n Lida and the three sons are living. Gerald has assigned his interest in the trust to the Second National Bank of Uniontown, Pennsylvania.\n Gerald performed the agreement until June, 1910, when he repudiated it. Thompson, one of the trustees, Lida and her sons, brought suit in equity in the Common Pleas Court of Fayette County, Pennsylvania, seeking performance of the agreement by Gerald and other relief. Gerald answered praying a declaration that the agreement was void. After a hearing the court entered a decree sustaining the agreement; ordering Gerald to account and to pay what might be shown to be due; removing him as a trustee; fixing a lien upon his partnership interests; and restraining him from encumbering or conveying them until the $300,000 fund contemplated by the agreement should be accumulated in the hands of the trustees. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 456, 459]\n\u00a0\n In March, 1915, the trustees then in office petitioned for leave to amend the agreement and for modification of the earlier decree to provide that Gerald should pay and secure to the trustees the payment of sums sufficient to create two funds, one of $400,000 for Lida's benefit and the other of $300,000 principally for the sons' benefit. The court approved the petition and modified its former decree accordingly. May 25, 1925, the trustees then in office acknowledged receipt of all the sums due under the decree of the court as modified and directed that satisfaction of the decree be entered of record. This was done June 3, 1925\n\n\n October 9, 1925, the three acting trustees filed an account in the Common Pleas Court, which, in the absence of exceptions, was confirmed. July 7, 1930, a second and partial account was filed in the same court by two surviving trustees on behalf of themselves and a deceased trustee.\n On the next day Lida and her son John brought suit in equity in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania against the two trustees and the administrators of the deceased trustee, alleging mismanagement of the trust funds and praying that the trustees be removed and all the defendants be made to account and repay the losses of the estate. Thereafter the Court of Common Pleas extended the time for filing exceptions to the second account and, on February 16, 1931, exceptions were filed by Gerald P. Fitzgerald, Jr. Meantime the trustees moved to dismiss the bill in the federal court for lack of indispensable parties and because the state court had exclusive jurisdiction of the controversy. May 12, 1931, the federal court refused the motion to dismiss and required the defendants to answer, declaring that it would not decide the question of jurisdiction until after answers had been filed. May 18, 1931, the defendants \n\n[305 \nU.S. 456, 460]\n\u00a0\n answered setting up that the controversy was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the state court. Nothing further was done in the federal suit until April 17, 1937, when the plaintiffs amended their bill. May 5, 1937, the trustees answered the amendment. Meantime, on May 1, 1937, the trustees had presented a petition in the state court for a rule upon the plaintiffs in the District Court, the petitioners herein, to show cause why they should not be restrained from prosecuting their suit in the federal court. After an answer by Lida denying that the Common Pleas Court had control or possession of the trust funds or that any controversy was therein pending when suit was instituted in the federal court, the rule was made absolute June 17, 1937. July 6, 1937, John Fitzgerald, one of the petitioners, applied to the federal court for an injunction to restrain the defendants in the case there pending, the respondents herein, from further prosecution of the proceedings in the state court. On the same day the petitioners took an appeal from the order of the Common Pleas Court to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. July 19, 1937, the trustees filed in the Common Pleas Court a third and partial account of the trust to which exceptions were filed. Testimony was thereafter taken on the exceptions to the second account. September 18, 1937, the federal court temporarily enjoined the defendants in that court, the respondents herein, from further prosecution of the proceedings in the state court to enjoin the plaintiffs, the petitioners herein, from having the jurisdictional issue tried in the District Court, and set November 8, 1937, for a trial of that issue. Trial was accordingly had.\n March 21, 1938, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania affirmed the order of the Common Pleas Court enjoining the petitioners from prosecuting their suit in the District Court,1 and, on the same day, the District Court rendered \n\n[305 \nU.S. 456, 461]\n\u00a0\n an opinion holding it had jurisdiction notwithstanding the proceedings in the Common Pleas Court. The District Judge entered no decree but stated that requests for findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a form of decree, might be submitted, and that he would proceed thereafter to try the merits of the cause.\n We are thus confronted with a situation where each of the courts claiming jurisdiction has restrained the parties before it from proceeding in the other. In view of this unusual state of affairs, of the importance of the question involved, and of the claim that the action of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania is in conflict with our decisions, we granted the writ of certiorari. Princess Lida et al. v. Fitzgerald, \n305 \nU.S. 582\n, 59 S. Ct. 72, 83 L.Ed. --.\n First. The suit brought in Common Pleas Court in 1910 was for the specific performance of the agreement of December 6, 1906. The decree in that suit declared the agreement valid and commanded performance in accordance with its terms. As the agreement called for a continuing performance, and the decree was for enforcement of that performance, the court retained jurisdiction to render the granted relief effective. It exercised this retained jurisdiction in 1915 when, by consent of the parties, it modified its decree to comport with amendments of the agreement. But the court's jurisdiction under the bill ceased when Fitzgerald had completely performed in accordance with the amended decree of 1915, as evidenced by the trustees' acknowledgment filed of record in the court on June 3, 1925, that the terms of the decree had been satisfied. The trust was created by agreement inter partes, one of whom repudiated and failed to perform it. When performance had been obtained the equity proceeding was at an end; the trust res in the hands of the trustees, who were the creatures of the agreement, then had the same status as if the court had never been called upon to act.\n Second. Although the agreement provided that vacancies occurring by death, resignation, or incapacity of a \n\n[305 \nU.S. 456, 462]\n\u00a0\n trustee should be filled by the remaining trustees, and that application to the Court of Common Pleas to appoint a new trustee should only be made in the event the trustees in office could not agree on the appointment of a successor, it appears that from time to time trustees presented their resignations to that court and the court purported to accept them. And when the remaining trustees appointed new trustees to fill vacancies they reported their action to the court which sometimes purported to confirm and ratify that action. The record does not disclose that the first method provided in the agreement for filling vacancies ever was impracticable, or that there was occasion for resort to the court. The petitioners contend that in the circumstances, the court's approval was unnecessary and did not amount to an assumption of jurisdiction. We find it unnecessary to pass upon the contention.\n Third. The important questions are whether the filing of the trustees' account on July 7, 1930, gave the Common Pleas Court jurisdiction, and, if so, what was the nature and extent of that jurisdiction. The Court of Common Pleas is given 'the jurisdiction and powers of a court of chancery, so far as relates to: ... The control, removal and discharge of trustees, and the appointment of trustees, and the settlement of their accounts.' \n2\n Respecting the character of the jurisdiction conferred by a statutory grant so phrased the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has said: 'The scope of supervisory control of necessity includes any matter which concerns the integrity of the trust res-its administration, its preservation, and its disposition and any other matter wherein its officers (trustees) are affected in the discharge of their duties.' 3 This jurisdiction is vested \n\n[305 \nU.S. 456, 463]\n\u00a0\n in the Court of Common Pleas of the county in which 'any such trustee shall have resided at the commencement of the trust.' 4 Two of the original trustees named in the agreement were residents of Fayette County. Two methods are provided for invoking the jurisdiction with respect to the administration of the trust. The court may cite the trustee on the application of any person in interest to 'exhibit an account of the management of the trust estate.' \n5\n The trustee may, on the other hand, obtain an adjudication of his management of the trust by filing his account in the office of the prothonotary of the court and, upon such filing, proceedings are to be had in the same manner as if he had filed the account under compulsion. \n6\n The trustee is permitted to have an adjudication of his stewardship in this manner every three years. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n It thus appears that whether an account be filed pursuant to citation or as the voluntary act of the trustee the jurisdiction of the court attaches and may be exercised over all the matters which fall within its supervisory control of the administration of the estate. The \n\n[305 \nU.S. 456, 464]\n\u00a0\n court has the power to fix the compensation of the trustee,8 to require him to take over from the trust investments improperly made and to restore the amount expended for them to the trust estate,9 to surcharge him with losses incurred, to allow him his proper expenses, to find against him a balance due the estate, and to make the balance found due a lien upon his real estate. \n10\n In the case of a continuing trust such as that here in question, after adjudication, the corpus is reawarded to the trustee for further administration in accordance with the terms of the trust. In the case of an account filed at the close of administration the court has power to decree distribution to the parties entitled. Under the equity powers conferred upon it the court may enforce its orders against a trustee by attachment for contempt. \n11\n The jurisdiction extends to a trust like the present created by deed or voluntary agreement. 12 The audit and confirmation of the account is to be had after advertisement and other forms of notice and is binding on all those anywise interested in the estate who have had the required statutory notice of the audit. \n13\n The parties in in- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 456, 465]\n\u00a0\n terest are permitted by exception and objection to the account to raise all pertinent questions respecting the management of the trust, and to invoke the powers of the court over the subjects above mentioned. \n14\n The audit will further disclose whether there be probable ground for the removal of the trustee and the appointment of another in his place and if that be done the court has jurisdiction to compel the removed trustee to transfer the trust assets to his successor.\n It is obvious that the filing of their account on July 7, 1930, subjected the respondents, as the trustees then in office, to the exercise of the powers thus conferred upon the Court of Common Pleas.\n We turn to the suit instituted in the District Court to ascertain what relief was there sought. In the bill as originally filed sundry investments made by the trustees were attacked and they were charged with mismanagement of the estate. The prayers were that they be cited to file an account of the trust; that they be removed; that all trustees under the agreement be required to give bond for the faithful performance of their duties; and for general relief. By the amended bill additional trust investments were attacked. New prayers were substituted asking that the defendants be required to answer, to restore to the trust funds the moneys lost by their illegal and negligent conduct; that they be removed; that all trustees be required to give bond; and for general relief.\n The plaintiffs in the District Court were but two of the five cestuis. One of the others has appeared in the Common Pleas proceeding and excepted to the trustees' accounts. Certain it is, therefore, that if both courts were to proceed they would be required to cover the same ground. This of itself is not conclusive of the question \n\n[305 \nU.S. 456, 466]\n\u00a0\n of the District Court's jurisdiction, for it is settled that where the judgment sought is strictly in personam, both the state court and the federal court, having concurrent jurisdiction, may proceed with the litigation at least until judgment is obtained in one of them which may be set up as res judicata in the other. \n15\n On the other hand, if the two suits are in rem, or quasi in rem, so that the court, or its officer, has possession or must have control of the property which is the subject of the litigation in order to proceed with the cause and grant the relief sought the jurisdiction of the one court must yield to that of the other. 16 We have said that the principle applicable to both federal and state courts that the court first assuming jurisdiction over property may maintain and exercise that jurisdiction to the exclusion of the other, is not restricted to cases where property has been actually seized under judicial process before a second suit is instituted, but applies as well where suits are brought to marshal assets, administer trusts, or liquidate estates, and in suits of a similar nature where, to give effect to its jurisdiction, the court must control the property. \n17\n The doctrine is necessary to the harmonious cooperation of federal and state tribunals. \n18\n While it has no application to a case in a federal court based upon diversity of citizenship, wherein the plaintiff seeks merely an adjudication of his right of his interest as a basis of a claim against a fund in the possession of a state court,19 this is \n\n[305 \nU.S. 456, 467]\n\u00a0\n not such a case. No question is presented in the federal court as to the right of any person to participate in the res or as to the quantum of his interest in it. The contentions are solely as to administration and restoration of corpus.\n Petitioners insist that Shelby v. Bacon, 10 How. 56, is conclusive that, under the law of Pennsylvania, the filing of an account on July 7, 1930, did not constitute the institution of a suit by the trustees, did not confer exclusive jurisdiction on the state court and did not bar the subsequent institution of a suit in the federal court for the same relief. In this we think they are in error. What was there said by this court to the effect that the filing of an account in the state court did not constitute a suit and did not confer jurisdiction on the state court, was not necessary to the decision and is not in accord with the law of Pennsylvania as declared by its own Supreme Court. \n20\n Assuming, however, that the state court had jurisdiction, this court held merely that the plaintiff had a right to establish his claim by suit in the Circuit Court notwithstanding the State court's jurisdiction over the trust. The court was careful to say that it was unnecessary to consider questions which might arise in the exercise of the jurisdiction of the federal court. The decision is in entire accord with many cases which hold that an action in the federal court to establish the validity or the amount of a claim constitutes no interference with a state court's possession or control of a res.\n The Common Pleas Court could not effectively exercise the jurisdiction vested in it, without a substantial measure of control of the trust funds. Its proceedings are, as the court below held, quasi in rem, and the jurisdiction acquired upon the filing of the trustees' account is exclusive. The District Court for the Western District of \n\n[305 \nU.S. 456, 468]\n\u00a0\n Pennsylvania is without jurisdiction of the suit subsequently brought for the same relief, and the petitioners were properly enjoined from further proceeding in that court.\n The judgment is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Thompson v.

Notice is to be given to the parties in interest that the account has been filed and will be audited.

Linton, both of Jefferson City, Mo., for appellants.\n No appearance for appellees.\n\n PER CURIAM.\n Appellees, Brashear Freight Lines, Inc., and others, common carriers of property for hire by motor vehicles operated in interstate commerce over the highways of Missouri and other States, brought this suit to restrain the enforcement of the statute of Missouri known as the Missouri Bus and Truck Act, effective September 15, 1931, Mo.St.Ann.  5264 et seq., p. 6679 et seq.\n As an interlocutory injunction was sought, a temporary restraining order was issued and a court of three judges was convened pursuant to Section 266 of the Judicial Code. 28 U.S.C.  380, 28 U.S.C.A.  380. It was later agreed 'that the temporary restraining order should remain in effect until final decision on the merits of the relief asked in the plaintiffs' bill of complaint and that hearing on plaintiffs' application for a temporary and permanent injunction should be consolidated'.\n Defendants, Public Service Commission of Missouri and several state officers, in their answer included a counterclaim of the Public Service Commission seeking an accounting from plaintiffs for fees due to the State under the above mentioned Act for the use of the public highways during the time that the temporary restraining order was in effect. Upon stipulation, the restraining order was modified so as to provide for deposit of license fees with a trustee pending the termination of the litigation.\n On hearing, the District Court entered its final decree as follows:\n'1. That the plaintiffs are not entitled to a permanent injunction against the defendants;\n\n'2. That the relief prayed for in plaintiffs' bill of complaint should be and is hereby in all respects denied, and \n\n[306 \nU.S. 204, 206]\n\u00a0\n plaintiffs' bill of complaint is hereby dismissed on its merits;\n\n'3. That the temporary restraining order heretofore granted to plaintiffs by this court against the defendants, be and the same hereby is dissolved;\n\n'4. That the issue raised by the defendants' counterclaim, not having been urged nor presented by the parties, and the court being in doubt as to the right of the defendants to maintain such counterclaim, it is ordered that the same be and it hereby is dismissed without prejudice to the right of the defendants, or either of them, to maintain an independent action or suit thereon, if they, or either of them, shall be so advised;\n\n'5. That defendants recover their costs and disbursements herein, to be taxed as provided by law and inserted herein in the sum of _ _ Dollars'.\n\n On motion for rehearing, paragraph 4 of the decree was modified by striking out the following words relating to the defendants' counterclaim, to wit, 'not having been urged nor presented by the parties', and rehearing was denied.\n The Public Service Commission brings this appeal seeking to review paragraph 4 of the decree, as amended, dismissing the counterclaim.\n The appellate jurisdiction of this Court on direct appeal from a final decree by a District Court composed of three judges under Section 266 of the Judicial Code is strictly limited as follows:\n'a direct appeal to the Supreme Court may be taken from a final decree granting or denying a permanent injunction in such suit'.\n\n The Public Service Commission as the successful party below has no standing to appeal from the decree denying the injunction. New York Telephone Co. v. Maltbie, \n291 \nU.S. 645\n, 54 S.Ct. 443; Lindheimer v. Illinois Bell Telephone Co., 292 U.S. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 204, 207]\n\u00a0\n 151, 176, 54 S.Ct. 658, 668. And as no appeal has been taken to review the decree denying the injunction, this Court is without jurisdiction.\n Section 266 as originally enacted applied only to cases in which an interlocutory injunction was granted or denied and the purpose was to make interference by such an injunction with the enforcement of state legislation a matter for the adequate hearing and full deliberation which the presence of three judges was likely to secure. Cumberland Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Louisiana Public Service Commission, \n260 \nU.S. 212, 216\n, 43 S.Ct. 75, 76; Stratton v. St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co., \n282 \nU.S. 10, 14\n, 51 S.Ct. 8, 9. The amendment that the requirement of a court of three judges should also apply to the final hearing on the application for a permanent injunction was to end the anomalous situation in which a single judge might reconsider and decide questions already passed upon by three judges on the application for an interlocutory injunction. Smith v. Wilson, \n273 \nU.S. 388, 390\n, 391 S., 47 S.Ct. 385, 386; Stratton v. St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co., supra. And, as direct appeal to this Court was permitted from an order granting or denying an interlocutory injunction, the amendment provided also for such a direct appeal from a final decree granting or denying a permanent injunction.\n It necessarily follows that, unless there is a proper appeal from a decree granting or denying an interlocutory or permanent injunction, the provision in Section 266 for a direct appeal to this Court has no application. The appeal is dismissed. It is so ordered.\n Appeal dismissed. \n\n\n\n","103":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPULLMAN CO. v.

Phillips, of Los Angeles, Cal., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question is whether petitioner, the Pullman Company, was entitled to remove this cause to the federal court. The Circuit Court of Appeals, reversing the District Court, ordered remand (9 Cir., 96 F.2d 405) and because of conflict in the ground of its ruling with decisions of this Court, we granted certiorari, \n305 \nU.S. 583\n, 59 S.Ct. 83, 83 L.Ed. --, October 10, 1938\n\n\n Respondent, Mrs. Jenkins, and her son Robert W. Jenkins, by Mrs. Jenkins as guardian ad litem, brought this action on September 27, 1935, in the Superior Court for Los Angeles County, California, to recover damages for injuries causing the death of her husband. He was \n\n[305 \nU.S. 534, 536]\n\u00a0\n employed by the Southern Pacific Company as conductor of a train running from Los Angeles to San Francisco. His injuries were due to a blow struck by A. J. Kash, who was being removed from the train by police officers called to assist the conductor in ejecting Kash because of his disorderly conduct. The suit was brought against the Southern Pacific Company, the Pullman Company, Kash, Hatch, the Pullman conductor, John Doe One, described as employed by the Pullman Company as porter, and John Doe Two, described as employed by the Southern Pacific Company as gate tender at the passenger depot as Los Angeles.\n The complaint alleged two causes of action, one against all the defendants, the other against Kash alone. The plaintiffs and defendant Kash were stated to be residents of California. The Southern Pacific Company was described as a Kentucky corporation and the Pullman Company as an Illinois corporation. The residences of the defendants Hatch and John Doe One and John Doe Two were not set forth.\n On November 20, 1935, the Pullman Company, as a citizen and resident of Illinois, insisting that the controversy as to it was a separable one, filed its petition for removal to the federal court, with bond; and on November 25, 1935, the petition and bond were approved and removal was ordered. On the day on which that order was entered, an amended complaint was filed in the state court which contained the allegation that the action was brought against the Southern Pacific Company under the Federal Employers' Liability Act 45 U.S.C.  51, 45 U.S.C.A.  51. On December 27, 1935, Mrs. Jenkins as administratrix of the estate of the decedent was substituted as plaintiff. On January 17, 1936, the defendant Hatch demurred to the amended complaint upon the ground that it stated no cause of action against him, and on January 29, 1936, the demurrer was sustained. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 534, 537]\n\u00a0\n On January 22, 1936, the plaintiffs moved to remand, stating that Edward E. Meyers, the Pullman porter, sued as John Doe One, had been served with process on January 14, 1936, and that he and the defendant Hatch were residents and citizens of California, and that the action as against them and the Pullman Company was not a separable controversy. Pending this motion, on February 8, 1936, the plaintiffs filed in the federal court a second amended complaint identifying Meyers as the Pullman porter and Fred M. Dolsen as John Doe Two, described as the Southern Pacific gate tender. This amended complaint repeated the allegation that the Southern Pacific was sued under the Federal Employers' Liability Act. On February 19, 1936, the court denied the motion to remand.\n On December 28, 1936, the action was dismissed as against the Southern Pacific and Dolsen as the result of a compromise. Supplemental answers were then filed by the remaining defendants respectively claiming release by reason of the agreement with the Southern Pacific. The District Court sustained this defense and entered judgment dismissing the complaint.\n On appeal, the Circuit Court of Appeals, passing the other questions, held that if it did not sufficiently appear at the time of the petition for removal that the cause was not separable, it did so appear when the second amended complaint was filed and hence that the District Court erred in denying the motion to remand. 96 F.2d page 410. This ruling was placed upon an erroneous ground. The second amended complaint should not have been considered in determining the right to remove, which in a case like the present one was to be determined according to the plaintiffs' pleading at the time of the petition for removal. Barney v. Latham, \n103 \nU.S. 205\n, 213-216; Graves v. Corbin, \n132 \nU.S. 571, 585\n, 10 S.Ct. 196, 200; Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. Wangelin, \n132 \nU.S. 599, 601\n, 10 S.Ct. 203; \n\n[305 \nU.S. 534, 538]\n\u00a0\n Salem Company v. Manufacturers' Company, \n264 \nU.S. 182, 189\n, 190 S., 44 S.Ct. 266, 267, 31 A.L.R. 867; Saint Paul Mercury Indemnity Co. v. Red Cab Co., \n303 \nU.S. 283, 294\n, 295 S., 58 S.Ct. 586, 592, 593.\n The question then is whether the original complaint set forth a separable controversy between the plaintiffs and the Pullman Company, that is, a controversy 'which is wholly between citizens of different States, and which can be fully determined as between them.' 28 U.S.C.  71, 28 U.S. C.A.  71. If, as to the non-resident defendant seeking removal, the controversy is separable within the purview of the statute as construed, the fact that under the state practice it may be joined in the same suit with another controversy as against other defendants, does not preclude removal. Barney v. Latham, supra; Nichols v. Chesapeake & Ohio R. Co., 6 Cir., 195 F. 913, 915, 916; Stewart v. Nebraska Tire & Rubber Co., 8 Cir., 39 F.2d 309, 311; Des Moines Elevator & Grain Co. v. Underwriters' Grain Association, 8 Cir., 63 F.2d 103, 105; Culp v. Baldwin, 8 Cir., 87 F.2d 679, 680-682.\n This is so whether the action sounds in contract or in tort. The question is determined by the plaintiff's pleading. Thus if defendants are charged with negligence, but the charge against the non-resident defendant is based on different and non-concurrent acts of negligence and a cause of action which is joint in character is not alleged, a separable controversy is presented. See Culp v. Baldwin, supra. Where, in the absence of clear proof of bad faith in the joinder, concurrent acts of negligence on the part of the defendants sued as joint tort-feasors are sufficiently alleged, a separable controversy is not presented and the fact that the defendants might have been sued separately affords no ground for removal. This rule is applied where a nonresident employer and its resident employee, whose negligence caused the injury, are sued jointly. Chesapeake & Ohio R. Co. v. Dixon, \n179 \nU.S. 131, 139\n, 21 S.Ct. 67, 70; Alabama Great Southern R. Co. v. Thompson, 200 U.S. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 534, 539]\n\u00a0\n 206, 212, 213, 220, 26 S.Ct. 161, 162, 165, 4 Ann.Cas. 1147; Chicago, R.I. & P.R. Co. v. Dowell, \n229 \nU.S. 102\n, 111-113, 33 S.Ct. 684, 685, 686; Hay v. May Department Stores Company, \n271 \nU.S. 318, 321\n, 322 S., 46 S.Ct. 498, 499; Watson v. Chevrolet Motor Co., 8 Cir., 68 F.2d 686, 689; Harrelson v. Missouri Pacific Transportation Co., 8 Cir., 87 F.2d 176, 177.\n In the instant case, the original complaint did not charge any negligence or wrongful conduct in ejecting Kash from the train. On the contrary, it was alleged that he was intoxicated and was acting in an offensive, threatening and quarrelsome manner in which he persisted despite remonstrance. There was clearly a separable controversy with respect to Kash. He was sued for his unlawful assault upon the conductor.\n The negligence charged against the Southern Pacific Company and its gate tender was in the action of the latter in permitting Kash to enter the station and go through the gates to board the train without displaying his ticket and while drunk and disorderly. The negligence charged against the Pullman Company and its porter was alleged to consist in the action of the porter in permitting Kash to board the Pullman sleeper. No facts were alleged upon which liability of the Pullman Company and its employees could be predicated upon the negligence of the Southern Pacific Company and its gate tender. It was not shown that either the Pullman Company or the Southern Pacific Company was liable for the acts of the other or that they joined in the commission of any wrong. With respect to these companies in relation to each other, the cases above cited, so far as they hold that a separable controversy is not presented when master and servant are joined because of concurrent negligence, are not in point.\n Nor was any negligence or wrongful act alleged on the part of the Pullman conductor.\n The question, however, remains as to the effect of the joinder of the Pullman porter. If the porter had been \n\n[305 \nU.S. 534, 540]\n\u00a0\n sued in his proper name, instead of John Doe, had been described as a citizen of California, and had been served with process prior to the petition for removal, there could be no question that the Pullman Company would not have been entitled to remove. Chesapeake & Ohio R. Co. v. Dixon, supra; Alabama Great Southern R. Co. v. Thompson, supra; Hay v. May Department Stores Company, supra.\n We think that the fact that the Pullman porter was sued by a fictitious name did not justify removal. His relation to the Pullman Company and his negligence as its servant were fully alleged. See Grosso v. Butte Electric R. Co., D.C., 217 F. 422. Nor does the fact that the residence of the porter was not set forth justify disregarding him. It was incumbent upon the Pullman Company to show that it had a separable controversy which was wholly between citizens of different States. As in determining whether there was such a separable controversy with respect to the Pullman Company its porter could not be ignored, the Company was bound to show that he was a non-resident in order to justify removal.\n At the time of the petition for removal the Pullman porter had not yet been served with process. Where there is a non-separable controversy with respect to several non-resident defendants, one of them may remove the cause, although the other defendants have not been served with process and have not appeared. Tremper v. Schwabacher, C.C., 84 F. 413, 416; Bowles v. H. J. Heinz Co., C.C., 188 F. 937; Hunt v. Pearce, D.C., 271 F. 498; Id., 8 Cir., 284 F. 321, 323, 324; Community Building Co. v. Maryland Casualty Co., 9 Cir., 8 F.2d 678; Trower v. Stonebraker-Zea Co., D.C., 17 F.Supp. 687, 690; Kelly v. Alabama Quenelda Graphite Co., D.C., 34 F.2d 790, 791. In such a case there is diversity of citizenship, and the reason for the rule is stated to be that the defendant not served may never be served, or may be served after the time has expired for the defendant who has been served to apply for a removal, and unless \n\n[305 \nU.S. 534, 541]\n\u00a0\n the latter can make an effective application alone, his right to removal may be lost. Hunt v. Pearce, 8 Cir., 284 F. page 324. But the rule is otherwise where a non-separable controversy involves a resident defendant. In that case the fact that the resident defendant has not been served with process does not justify removal by the non-resident defendant. Patchin v. Hunter, C.C., 38 F. 51, 53; Armstrong v. Kansas City Southern R. Co., 8 Cir., 192 F. 608, 615; Hunt v. Pearce, D.C., 271 F. page 502; Del Fungo Giera v. Rockland Light & Power Co., D.C., 46 F.2d 552, 554; Hane v. Mid- Continent Corporation, D.C., 47 F.2d 244, 246, 247. It may be said that the non-resident defendant may be prejudiced because his co-defendant may not be served. On the other hand there is no diversity of citizenship, and the controversy being a nonseparable one, the non-resident defendant should not be permitted to seize an opportunity to remove the cause before service upon the resident co-defendant is effected. It is always open to the non-resident defendant to show that the resident defendant has not been joined in good faith and for that reason should not be considered in determining the right to remove. Wecker v. National Enameling Co., \n204 \nU.S. 176, 185\n, 186 S., 27 S.Ct. 184, 188, 9 Ann.Cas. 757; Chesapeake & Ohio R. Co. v. Cockrell, \n232 \nU.S. 146, 152\n, 34 S.Ct. 278, 280; Wilson v. Republic Iron & Steel Co., \n257 \nU.S. 92, 97\n, 42 S.Ct. 35, 37; Clancy v. Brown, 8 Cir., 71 F.2d 110, 112, 113.\n In the instant case there was no charge that the joinder was fraudulent. On the motion to remand it appeared that the Pullman porter, identified as Meyers, was a resident of California and had then been served with process.\n We conclude that the District Court erred in denying the motion to remand and that the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be affirmed.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 534, 542]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK, concurring.\n I agree that it was incumbent upon the Pullman Company, seeking removal, to show that it was sued in a controversy 'wholly between citizens of different States;'1 that the Company failed to meet this burden; that plaintiff's joining the Pullman Company with a Pullman porter designated by a fictitious name did not relieve the Company of its statutory burden; that consequently the District Court erred in denying a motion to remand, and that the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals, reversing the District Court's refusal to remand, should be affirmed. To certain portions of the opinion, which this affirmance does not require, I cannot agree.\n First. The original complaint filed in the State court indicated plaintiff's intention to rest its case against the Southern Pacific Company upon the Federal Employers' Liability Act, under which suits brought in State courts are not removable to Federal courts. \n2\n The pleadings did not disclose that the suit was based on the Federal Act as clearly as good pleading requires, and the complaint was doubtless subject to special demurrer because of its generality. But the mere fact that a complaint based on the Federal Act is demurrable does not make it subject to removal. In addition, both an amendment filed in the State court before the order of removal (but after the petition for removal), and a second amendment filed after removal, served to make the original complaint more precise and made clear the original purpose of claiming under the Federal Employers' Liability Act without changing the original cause of action. 'It is true that the declaration was amended after the petition to remove ..., but the amendment, if not unnecessary, merely made the original cause of action more precise. On the question of \n\n[305 \nU.S. 534, 543]\n\u00a0\n removal we have not to consider more than whether there was a real intention to get a joint judgment, and whether there was a colorable ground for it shown as the record stood when the (petition for removal was ruled on) ... We are not to decide whether a flaw could be picked in the declaration on special demurrer.' \n 3\n\u00a0\n\n Both from the original complaint and from its amendments it seems clear to me that plaintiff sought relief under the Federal Employers' Liability Act and that the ruling of the Court of Appeals on that ground was proper.\n Second. The disposition of this case on the ground set out in the opinion does not require the statement that 'If, as to the nonresident defendant seeking removal, the controversy is separable within the purview of the statute as construed, the fact that under the state practice it may be joined in the same suit with another controversy as against other defendants, does not preclude removal.' Nor do I agree that this is a correct construction of the removal statute. The statement is rested on the case of Barney v. Latham, \n103 \nU.S. 205\n, and opinions from two Circuit Courts of Appeals. \n4\n However, this Court later refused to accept the Latham Case as authority for the proposition that the statutory right of removal 'takes no account of ... what may be the rules of practice, whether common law or statutory, of the State in which the action may be pending;' instead, it held exactly the opposite. Alabama Great Southern Railway Co. v. Thompson, \n200 \nU.S. 206\n, see argument of counsel, page 209 (26 S.Ct. 161, 4 Ann.Cas. 1147). And in Cincinnati, N.O. & Texas Pac. Ry. Co. v. Bohon, \n200 \nU.S. 221\n, 225, \n\n[305 \nU.S. 534, 544]\n\u00a0\n 226 (26 S.Ct. 166, 167, 168, 4 Ann.Cas. 1152) (considered and decided with the Thompson Case), the Court stated:\n'While the case did not show an attempt to remove, the discussion of the subject by the Chief Justice strongly intimates that if the action was properly joint in the form in which it was being prosecuted, it could not be removed as a separable controversy under the act of Congress. We have under consideration an action for tort which by the Constitution and laws of the State, as interpreted by the highest court in the state, gives a joint remedy against master and servant to recover for negligent injuries. This court has repeatedly held that a separable controversy must be shown upon the face of the petition or declaration, and that the defendant has no right to say that an action shall be several which the plaintiff elects to make joint. See cases cited in Alabama Great Southern Railway Co. v. Thompson (supra). A state has an unquestionable right by its constitution and laws to regulate actions for negligence, and where it has provided that the plaintiff in such cases may proceed jointly or severally against those liable for the injury, and the plaintiff, in due course of law and in good faith, has filed a petition electing to sue for a joint recovery given by the laws of the state, we know of nothing in the Federal removal statute which will convert such action into a separable controversy for the purpose of removal, because of the presence of a nonresident defendant therein, properly joined in the action under the Constitution and laws of the state wherein it is conducting its operations, and is duly served with process.'\n\n It was thus broadly held that there can be no other or separable controversy, if a plaintiff properly elects under State practice to sue defendants jointly. Even a separate defense, which may defeat a joint recovery, can \n\n[305 \nU.S. 534, 545]\n\u00a0\n not create a separable controversy when the plaintiff has a right to make his cause of action joint. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n In cases which have involved the right of removal since the Latham Case, this Court has repeatedly held that the 'joint liability of the defendants (one of whom is a non-resident) under the declaration as amended is a matter of state law, and upon that we shall not attempt to go behind the decision of the highest court of the state before which the question could come.' \n6\n\u00a0\n\n Only two Circuit Courts of Appeals have held that causes of action properly joined under State practice may nevertheless be separable for purposes of removal; other Circuits have followed the decisions of this Court. \n7\n Cases from the two Circuits are relied upon to support the \n\n[305 \nU.S. 534, 546]\n\u00a0\n language in the opinion of the Court to which I cannot agree. \n8\n However, the cases relied upon from one of these two Circuits no longer appear to represent the rule even in that Circuit. \n9\n And the lone case in the other of the two Circuits was contrary to and decided before the most recent decisions of this Court on the subject. \n 10\n\u00a0\n\n Third. It is, of course, true that where governing State law characterizes actionable negligence of a local and a non-resident defendant as 'concurrent negligence,' there can be no right of removal. However, this is but one application of the rule governing removals under which we look to State law to determine the propriety of joining two or more defendants in a single suit. 11 The opinion in the Thompson Case, supra, was expressly designed to resolve the 'conflict in the authorities as to whether a corporation whose liability does not arise from an act of concurrence or direction on its part, but solely as a result of the relation of master and servant, may be jointly \n\n[305 \nU.S. 534, 547]\n\u00a0\n sued with the servant whose negligent conduct directly caused the injury.' ( at pages 213, 214, 26 S.Ct. at pages 162, 163). The question submitted for decision in that case was (pages 212, 213, 26 S.Ct. pages 161, 162): 'May a railroad corporation be jointly sued with two of its servants ... though ... not charged with any concurrent act of negligence?' This Court gave an affirmative answer.\n The principle has been well stated by the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Second Circuit:\n'Appellees contend that removal is prevented only where a master and servant are charged with concurrent negligence. The rule is settled otherwise. In Alabama Great So. Ry. Co. v. Thompson, supra, and Cincinnati, N.O. & Texas Pac. Ry. v. Bohon, supra, the master was alleged to be liable on the doctrine of respondeat superior. It is immaterial that the liability of the master and that of the servant proceed on different grounds; even more distinct were the bases of liability of the lessee and lessor railroad companies in Chicago, B. & Q. Ry. Co. v. Willard, (\n220 \nU.S. 413\n, 31 S.Ct. 460) where the lessor was held on its obligation to the public of which it could not be relieved by virtue of a lease. ... Nothing in Hay v. May Department Stores Co., \n271 \nU.S. 318\n, 46 S.Ct. 498, supports the claim that the rule of nonremovability is limited to instances of concurrent negligence.'12\n\n The Constitution authorizes Congress to fix the jurisdiction of Federal District Courts. The constitutional division of powers between the States and the National government makes it necessary that the jurisdictional policy declared by Congress be scrupulously observed. This is especially so in view of the fact that after removal of a cause from a State court by reason of diversity of citizenship, the Federal court must proceed under State law and practice. Questions of State constitutional, \n\n[305 \nU.S. 534, 548]\n\u00a0\n statutory and general law which have not been clearly and finally determined by the State's highest court may arise in the Federal court. The State court need not thereafter, in other litigation, follow the Federal court's decision on such questions. However, cases for which Congress has not authorized removal from a State court can be appealed to the State's highest judicial tribunal, thus giving each litigant a final determination of his rights under State laws by the body vested with final authority to interpret those laws. Rights and privileges under the Federal Constitution and laws, which may be involved in such litigation in a State court, can still be protected by appeal to this Court.\n The statutory privilege of removal should be protected. But I do not believe that judicial construction should expand the statutory privilege beyond limits intended by the statute and properly recognized by this Court in previous decisions. Particularly, I think it unwise to indicate this step in a case in which decision and judgment do not require discussion of the question. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] c. 3, Sec. 71, 28 U.S.C., 28 U.S.C.A.  71. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] c. 2, Sec. 51,  56, 45 U.S.C., 45 U.S.C.A.  51, 56. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Chicago, I.R. & Pac.

Int.Rev.Acts, page 79 et seq., so far as now material, reappeared in  501 et seq. of the 1932 Act, 47 Stat. 169, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 580 et seq. Other pertinent provisions of the earlier act \n\n[308 \nU.S. 54, 56]\n\u00a0\n were reenacted without change of present moment in  501, 510, 801, 26 U. S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, pages 580, 589, 640. The applicable estate tax provisions are  302(c)(d) of the 1926 Act, 44 Stat. 40, 71, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, pages 227, 228. Section 501(c) of the 1932 Act, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 580, added a new provision that transfers in trust, with power of revocation in the donor, should be taxed on relinquishment of the power. This was repealed by  511 of the Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 680, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 769, because Burnet v. Guggenheim, \n288 \nU.S. 280\n, 53 S.Ct. 369, had declared that such was the law without specific legislation. H.R. No. 704, 73rd Cong., 2d Sess., p. 40; Sen.Rep. No. 558, 73rd Cong., 2d Sess., p. 50.\n For the reasons stated in our opinion in the Sanford case we conclude that the reserved power in the donor at the time of the creation of the trust rendered the gift incomplete and not subject to the gift tax. As pointed out in our opinion in the Sanford case the Treasury regulation under the 1932 Act, Art. III, Regulation 79 (1933 edition), in force when the trust was created, affords no basis for modification of our construction of the statute. Whatever validity the amended regulation of 1936 may have in its prospective operation, we think it is so plainly in conflict with the statute as to preclude its application retroactively so as to subject to tax such transfer as was made by the creation of the trust in 1934.

UNITED STATES(1939)\nNo. 481\nArgued: March 7, 1939Decided: April 17, 1939\n\n\n\n On Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the Western District of New York.\n Messrs. T. Carl Nixon and Justin J. Doyle, both of Rochester, N.Y., for appellant. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 125, 126]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Hugh B. Cox, of Washington, D.C., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal, under Sec. 238 of the Judicial Code as amended, 28 U.S.C.  345, 28 U.S.C.A.  345, from a final decree by a district court of three judges, under the Urgent Deficiencies Act of October 22, 1913, 28 U.S.C.  45, 47a, 28 U.S.C.A.  45, 47a, as extended by Sec. 402(a) of the Federal Communications Act, 47 U.S.C.  402(a), 47 U.S.C.A.  402(a), dismissing on the merits a bill to review an order of the Federal Communications Commission.\n At the outset a challenge to the jurisdiction of the District Court confronts us. It involves those problems of administrative law which are implied by the doctrine of 'negative orders.' Inasmuch as this phrase is shorthand for a variety of situations, sharp heed must be given to the precise circumstances-inter alia, the statutory provisions for review, the terms of the contested order, the grounds of objection to it-which in this and other cases have invoked the doctrine.\n Section 2(b) of the Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C.A.  152(b), provides that, with certain exceptions not here material, the Communications Commission shall not have jurisdiction over any carrier 'engaged in interstate or foreign communication solely through physical connection with the facilities of another carrier not directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by, or under direct or indirect common control with, such carrier.' The appellant, Rochester Telephone Corporation (hereafter called the Rochester), is a New York corporation maintaining a system of telephone communications in and around the City of Rochester. For present purposes the Rochester is to be \n\n[307 \nU.S. 125, 127]\n\u00a0\n deemed as engaged in interstate communications solely because of physical connections with the facilities of the New York Telephone Company ( hereafter called the New York).\n The present controversy grew out of a ruling by the Federal Communications Commission that the Rochester owed obedience to a series of orders issued by the Commission. These orders required all telephone carriers subject to the Act to file schedules of their charges, copies of contracts with other telephone carriers, information concerning their corporate and service history, their relations with affiliates, their use of franks and passes. Copies of these orders were duly served on the Rochester. No response being had, the Telephone Division of the Communications Commission, on October 9, 1935, ordered the Rochester to show cause why it should not be required to file responses to the general orders theretofore served upon it. \n1\n The Rochester answered, claiming to be outside the requirements of the Act except as to matters not here questioned.\n To ascertain the facts in the contested issue, the Commission appointed a trial examiner. At hearings held by him the Rochester entered a special appearance, denying the Commission's jurisdiction and contending that the burden of proof was on the Commission to show that Rochester did not come within the exclusionary provisions of Section 2(b)(2). After a thorough hearing2 and the submission of briefs, the examiner filed his report, to which the Rochester duly excepted. Upon the basis of these proceedings and of argument before it, the Commission, through its Telephone Division, sustained the findings of its chief examiner, determined that the Rochester was \n\n[307 \nU.S. 125, 128]\n\u00a0\n under the 'control' of the New York and therefore not entitled to the classification of a mere connecting carrier under Section 2(b)(2). Accordingly, the Commission ordered the Rochester classified 'as subject to all common carrier provisions of the Communications Act of 1934, and, therefore, subject to all orders of the Telephone Division.' A petition for rehearing before the full Commission was denied.\n The Rochester thereupon filed the present bill, alleging that the order entered by the Commission on November 18, 1936, pursuant to its Report, was contrary to undisputed facts and erroneous as a matter of law, and that the Commission's threat to enforce it put the Rochester to the hazard of irreparable injury, and praying that the District Court 'make and enter its order and decree setting aside and annulling said orders of the Federal Communications Commission hereinbefore mentioned, and each and all of them, and enjoining the enforcement of said orders, except in so far as the provisions of said orders ... have already been complied with.'\n The case was disposed of in the District Court on the pleadings and the record before the Commission.\n Below, the Government made no objection to the District Court's jurisdiction, nor did that Court raise the question sua sponte. \n3\n It sustained the Commission's action on the merits and dismissed the bill. Here, the Government urges that under the doctrine of 'negative orders' the Commission's order was not reviewable, but, in the alternative, supports the decree on the merits.\n The relation of action by the Federal Communications Commission to the reviewing power of the courts is here \n\n[307 \nU.S. 125, 129]\n\u00a0\n for the first time. The jurisdictional objection raised by the Government in this case implicates other federal regulatory bodies as well, because the various statutory schemes for judicial review have either been carried over from the Urgent Deficiencies Act, pertaining to orders under the Acts to Regulate Commerce, or because different statutory provisions have by analogy been assimilated to the 'negative order' doctrine. That doctrine has not had wholly plain sailing in the many cases, both here and in the lower federal courts, since it first got under way in 1912, in Procter & Gamble Co. v. United States, \n225 \nU.S. 282\n, 32 S.Ct. 761\n\n\n The important procedural problems with which this case is entangled therefore call for clarification.\n The prior decisions involving the 'negative order' doctrine fall into three categories:4\n\n\n (1)\n Where the action sought to be reviewed may have the effect of forbidding or compelling conduct on the part of the person seeking to review it, but only if some further action is taken by the Commission. Such a situation is presented by an attempt to review a valuation made by the Interstate Commerce Commission which has no immediate legal effect although it may be the basis of a subsequent rate order.\n\n\n (2)\n Where the action sought to be reviewed declines to relieve the complainant from a statutory command forbidding or compelling conduct on his part. The most obvious case is a denial of permission by the Interstate Commerce Commission for a departure from the long-short haul clause. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 125, 130]\n\u00a0\n (3) Where the action sought to be reviewed does not forbid or compel conduct on the part of the person seeking review but is attacked because it does not forbid or compel conduct by a third person. A familiar example is that of a shipper requesting the Interstate Commerce Commission for an order compelling the carrier to adopt certain rates or practices which the Commission, on the merits, declines. Another instance is where the Commission authorizes the carrier to depart from the long-short haul clause and a shipper adversely affected seeks to have the authorization set aside.\n In group (1) the order sought to be reviewed does not of itself adversely affect complainant but only affects his rights adversely on the contingency of future administrative action. In view of traditional conceptions of federal judicial power, resort to the courts in these situations is either premature or wholly beyond their province. Thus, orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission setting a case for hearing despite a challenge to its jurisdiction, 5 or rendering a tentative6 or final valuation7 under the Valuation Act, 49 U.S.C.A.  19a, although claimed to be inaccurate, or holding that a carrier is within the Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C.A.  151 et seq., and therefore amenable to the National Mediation Board, are not reviewable. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n The governing considerations which keep such orders without the area of judicial review were thus summarized for the Court by Mr. Justice Brandeis in denying reviewability of a 'final valuation' under the Valuations Act: 'The so-called order here complained of is one which does not command the carrier to do, or to refrain from \n\n[307 \nU.S. 125, 131]\n\u00a0\n doing, anything; which does not grant or withhold any authority, privilege, or license; which does not extend or abridge any power or facility; which does not subject the carrier to any liability, civil or criminal; which does not change the carrier's existing or future status or condition; which does not determine any right or obligation.' United States v. Los Angeles R.R., \n273 \nU.S. 299, 309\n, 310 S., 47 S.Ct. 413, 414.\n Plainly the denial of judicial review in these cases does not derive from a regard for the special functions of administrative agencies. Judicial abstention here is merely an application of the traditional criteria for bringing judicial action into play. Partly these have been written into Article 3 of the Constitution, U.S.C.A., by what is implied from the grant of 'judicial power' to determine 'Cases' and 'Controversies,' Art. 3, Sec. 2, U.S.Constitution. \n9\n Partly they are an aspect of the procedural philosophy pertaining to the federal courts whereby, ever since the first Judiciary Act, Congress has been loathe to authorize review of interim steps in a proceeding. 10 \n\n[307 \nU.S. 125, 132]\n\u00a0\n Group (2) is composed of instances of statutory regulations which place restrictions upon the free conduct of the complainant. To rid himself of these restrictions the complainant either asks the Interstate Commerce Commission to place him outside the statute, or, being concededly within it, be invokes the Commission's dispensing power. In this type of situation a complainant seeking judicial review under the Urgent Deficiencies Act of adverse action by the Commission must clear three hurdles: (a) 'case' or 'controversy' under Article 3; (b) the conventional requisites of equity jurisdiction; (c) the specific terms of the statute granting to the district courts jurisdiction in suits challenging 'any order' of the Commission.\n Where a complainant seeks the Commission's authority under the terms of a statute and the Commission's action is followed by legal consequences, as was the case in Lehigh Valley R.R. v. United States, \n243 \nU.S. 412\n, 37 S. Ct. 397, or where the Commission's order denies an exemption from the terms of the statute, as in the Inter-Mountain Rate Case, \n234 \nU.S. 476\n, 34 S.Ct. 986, the road to the courts' jurisdiction seems to be clear. There is a constitutional 'case' or 'controversy,' Interstate Commerce Commission v. Brimson, \n154 \nU.S. 447\n, 14 S.Ct. 1125; the requirements of equity are satisfied if disregard of the Commission's adverse action entails threat of oppressive penalties; and the suit is within the express language of the Urgent Deficiencies Act in that it is one 'to enjoin, set aside, annul' an 'order of said commission.' 28 U.S.C. Sec. 46, 47, 28 U.S.C.A.  46, 47.11 While the penal- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 125, 133]\n\u00a0\n ties may be imposed by the statute for its violation and not for disobedience of the Commission's order, a favorable order would render the prohibitions of the statute inoperative. The complainant can come into court, of course, not to review action within the discretionary au- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 125, 134]\n\u00a0\n thority of the Commission to render an adverse rather than a favorable decision but because he urges errors of law outside the Commission's final say-so. Such an analysis emerges from a long sequence of cases under the Urgent Deficiencies Act viewed in the setting of general doctrines of federal jurisdiction. On the other hand, the result in the Lehigh Valley case was reached in the earlier phases of modern administrative law and did not deal with its specific jurisdictional problems in the perspective of underlying principles governing federal equitable jurisdiction. In consequence, the phrase 'negative orders' gained currency as though it were descriptive of some technical doctrine of jurisdiction having peculiar relevance to judicial review of orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission and comparable regulatory bodies. \n12\n\u00a0\n\n[307 \nU.S. 125, 135]\n\u00a0\n This brings us to the cases in group (3). Here review is sought of action by the Commission which affects the complainant because it does not forbid or compel conduct with reference to him by a third person. This type of situation is illustrated by Procter & Gamble Co. v. United States, \n225 \nU.S. 282\n, 32 S.Ct. 761. Since this case gave rise to the notion that there is a specialized jurisdictional doctrine pertaining to 'negative orders,' it calls for re-examination. Procter & Gamble Co. filed a complaint with the Interstate Commerce Commission to set aside demurrage rules that imposed charges on private cars left unloaded for over forty-eight hours on private tracks. The Commission dismissed the complaint on the ground that the rules were within the carriers' authority to make conditions for the acceptance of private cars. Procter & Gamble then petitioned the Commerce Court to annul the Commission's action and to enjoin the carriers from enforcing the rules. The Commerce Court took jurisdiction but found the Commission's action to be within its authority. On appeal this Court held that the Com- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 125, 136]\n\u00a0\n merce Court erred in taking jurisdiction and remanded the cause for dismissal.\n Clearly Procter & Gamble was authorized under Section 13 of the Act to Regulate Commerce, 49 U.S.C.A.  13, to institute the proceedings before the Commission. Since it asserted a legal right under that Act to have the Commission apply different principles of law from those which led the Commission to dismiss the complaint, the ingredients for an adjudication-constituting a case or controversy-were present. Compare Interstate Commerce Commission v. Brimson, supra; Interstate Commerce Commission v. Baird, \n194 \nU.S. 25, 38\n, 24 S.Ct. 563, 566. Judicial relief would be precisely the same as in the recognized instances of review by courts of Commission action: if the legal principles on which the Commission acted were not erroneous, the bill would be ordered dismissed; if the Commission was found to have proceeded on erroneous legal principles, the Commission would be ordered to proceed within the framework of its own discretionary authority on the indicated correct principles. The requisites of equity have of course to be satisfied, but by the conventional criteria. They were satisfied in the Procter & Gamble case, since the bill sought to avoid a multiplicity of suits. Finally, the shipper was within the express language of Congress authorizing suits 'to enjoin, set aside, annul, ... any order of the Interstate Commerce Commission.' To be sure the opinion in the Procter & Gamble case partly yielded to the Government's main contention in that case that the jurisdictional statute only applied where the order complained of was one which was to be enforced by the Commission. More recent decisions of this Court, however, have dispensed with this requisite for review. \n13\n\u00a0\n\n[307 \nU.S. 125, 137]\n\u00a0\n The impelling consideration underlying the decision in the Procter & Gamble case did not concern technical procedure. It was part of the process of adjusting relations between the Interstate Commerce Commission and the courts to effectuate the purposes of the Commission. This is made abundantly clear by the general atmosphere of the opinion as well as by its language,14 particularly when regard is had to the fact that the Court's spokesman was Chief Justice White, who had such a large share in developing modern administrative law. \n15\n While the \n\n[307 \nU.S. 125, 138]\n\u00a0\n Interstate Commerce Commission had been in existence since 1887, the enlargement of its powers through the Hepburn Act, in 1906,16 and the Mann- Elkins Act, in 1910,17 the establishment of similar agencies in many states following the lead of New York18 and Wisconsin,19 the widespread recognition that these specific instances marked a general movement,20 made increasingly manifest the place of administrative agencies in enforcing legislative policies and called for accommodation of the duties entrusted to them to our traditional judicial system. This Court 'ascribed' to the findings of the Commission 'the strength due to the judgments of a tribunal appointed by law and informed by experience.' Illinois Central R.R. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n206 \nU.S. 441, 454\n, 27 S.Ct. 700, 704. Recognition of the Commission's expertise also led this Court not to bind the Commission to common \n\n[307 \nU.S. 125, 139]\n\u00a0\n law evidentiary and procedural fetters in enforcing basic procedural safeguards. \n 21\n\u00a0\n\n From these general considerations the Court evolved two specific doctrines limiting judicial review of orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission. One is the primary jurisdiction doctrine, firmly established in Texas & Pacific Ry. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co., \n204 \nU.S. 426\n, 27 S.Ct. 350, 9 Ann.Cas. 1075. Thereby matters which call for technical knowledge pertaining to transportation must first be passed upon by the Interstate Commerce Commission before a court can be invoked. \n22\n The other is the doctrine of administrative finality. Even when resort to courts can be had to review a Commission's order, the range of issues open to review \n\n[307 \nU.S. 125, 140]\n\u00a0\n is narrow. Only questions affecting constitutional power, statutory authority and the basic prerequisites of proof can be raised. If these legal tests are satisfied, the Commission's order becomes incontestable. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Illinois Central R.R., \n215 \nU.S. 452, 470\n, 30 S.Ct. 155, 160; Interstate Commerce Commission v. Union Pacific R.R., \n222 \nU.S. 541\n, 32 S.Ct. 108.\n In translating these important objectives for effectuating the Congressional scheme to enlarge the independent powers of the Interstate Commerce Commission into a seemingly technical distinction between 'negative' and 'affirmative' orders, the opinion in Procter & Gamble v. United States gave authority to a doctrine which harmonizes neither with the considerations which induced it nor with the course of decisions which have purported to follow it. \n23\n Subsequent cases have made it abundantly clear that 'negative order' and 'affirmative order' are not appropriate terms of art. \n24\n Thus, the Court has had occa- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 125, 141]\n\u00a0\n sion to find that while an order was 'negative in form' it was 'affirmative in substance.' \n25\n 'Negative' has really been an obfuscating adjective in that it implied a search for a distinction-non-action as against action-which does not involve the real considerations on which rest, as we have seen, the reviewability of Commission orders within the framework of its discretionary authority and within the general criteria of justiciability. 26 'Negative' \n\n[307 \nU.S. 125, 142]\n\u00a0\n and 'affirmative,' in the context of these problems, is as unilluminating and mischief-making a distinction as the out-moded line between 'nonfeasance' and 'misfeasance'.27\n The considerations of policy for which the notions of 'negative' and affirmative' orders were introduced, are completely satisfied by proper application of the combined doctrines of primary jurisdiction and administrative finality. The concept of 'negative orders' has not served to clarify the relations between administrative bodies and the courts but has rather tended to obscure them. An action before the Interstate Commerce Commission is akin to an inclusive equity suit in which all relevant claims are adjusted. \n28\n An order of the Commission dismissing a complaint on the merits and maintaining the status quo is an exercise of administrative function, no more and no less, than an order directing some change in status. The nature of the issues foreclosed by the Commission's action and the nature of the issues left open, so far as the reviewing power of courts is concerned, are the same. Refusal to change an existing situation may, of course, itself be a factor in the Commission's allowable exercise of discretion. In the application of relevant canons of judicial review an order of the Commission directing the adoption of a practice might raise considerations absent from a situation where the Commission merely allowed such a practice to continue. But this bears on the disposition of a case and should not control jurisdiction. The nature of judicial relief, that is the \n\n[307 \nU.S. 125, 143]\n\u00a0\n form of directions available, in situations like those presented by the Procter & Gamble and the Lehigh Valley cases, were the Commission's orders reviewed, would be no different than was that used in the Inter-Mountain Rate and the New River Co. cases. \n29\n In both types of situations 'a judgment rendered will be a final and indisputable basis of action as between the Commission and the defendant,' Interstate Commerce Commission v. Baird, \n194 \nU.S. 25, 38\n, 24 S.Ct. 563, 566. We conclude, therefore, that any distinction, as such, between 'negative' and 'affirmative' orders, as a touchstone of jurisdiction to review the Commission's orders, serves no useful purpose, and insofar as earlier decisions have been controlled by this distinction, they can no longer be guiding.\n The order of the Communications Commission in this case was therefore reviewable. It was not a mere abstract declaration regarding the status of the Rochester under the Communications Act,30 nor was it a stage in an incomplete process of administrative adjudication. The \n\n[307 \nU.S. 125, 144]\n\u00a0\n contested order determining the status of the Rochester necessarily and immediately carried direction of obedience to previously formulated mandatory orders addressed generally to all carriers amenable to the Commission's authority. Into this class of carriers the order under dispute covered the Rochester, and by that fact, in conjunction with the other orders, made determination of the status of the Rochester a reviewable order of the Commission.\n But while the Rochester had a right to challenge the order, it cannot prevail on the merits.\n The ultimate legal issue is the validity of the Commission's finding that the Rochester 'is under the control of the New York Telephone Company'. The justification for this finding clearly emerges from a rapid summary of the governing facts adduced before the Commission concerning the relationship between the New York and the Rochester.\n Prior to 1920 an independent telephone company and the New York ( which was part of the Bell system) were competitors in Rochester. As part of an endeavor to meet an arrangement which the Bell system had, in 1913, made with the Department of Justice, the details of which need not here be recited, the Rochester was formed to consolidate the two previously competing enterprises. The property of the independent was paid for by bonds of the Rochester, and the property of the New York by preferred stock, later designated as second preferred, of which the New York had the entire issue, 48,140 shares at $100 par. The Rochester issued 1000 shares of common stock, at $100 par, of which the New York purchased 335 shares. The New York also paid the officers of the independent company $70,000 for their services in consummating the consolidation, but $66,500 of this amount was to be used in purchasing the remaining 665 shares of common stock \n\n[307 \nU.S. 125, 145]\n\u00a0\n for deposit in a voting trust. Other outstanding securities of the Rochester, first preferred stock and bonds, neither of which had any voting rights, were held by the public. There were complicated limitations upon the voting rights of the second preferred stockholders, but the dominating circumstances touching voting rights were that in major matters no vote of stockholders could be effective unless concurred in by eighty per cent of the common stock and that the Executive Committee and the Board of Directors were elected by cumulative voting of the common stock, thereby assuring New York five out of fifteen members of the Board of Directors and two members in an Executive Committee of five.\n Putting all these factors in the context of the circumstances under which the Rochester came into being, the manner in which it was financed, the operation of the voting trust, and the stake of the New York in the Rochester, the Commission, after full hearing and due consideration, concluded that 'the New York Company, through stock ownership, is the dominant financial factor in the respondent company and also, that this, taken together with their contractual arrangements and other pertinent facts and circumstances appearing in the record, unquestionably gives the New York Company power to control the functions of the Rochester Telephone Corporation.'\n The record amply justified the Communications Commission in making such findings. Investing the Commission with the duty of ascertaining 'control' of one company by another, Congress did not imply artificial tests of control. 31 This is an issue of fact to be determined by the special circumstances of each case. So long \n\n[307 \nU.S. 125, 146]\n\u00a0\n as there is warrant in the record for the judgment of the expert body it must stand. The suggestion that the refusal to regard the New York ownership of only one third of the common stock of the Rochester as conclusive of the former's lack of control of the latter should invalidate the Commission's finding, disregards actualities in such intercorporate relations. Having found that the record permitted the Commission to draw the conclusion that it did, a court travels beyond its province to express concurrence therewith as an original question. 'The judicial function is exhausted when there is found to be a rational basis for the conclusions approved by the administrative body.' Mississippi Valley Barge Line Co. v. United States, \n292 \nU.S. 282, 286\n, 287 S., 54 S.Ct. 692, 693, 694; Swayne & Hoyt, Ltd. v. United States, \n300 \nU.S. 297\n, 303, et seq., 57 S.Ct. 478, 480.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS concurs in the result.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER, concurring.\n Appellant's complaint shows that prior to making its final order November 18, 1936, the commission made general orders 1, 2, 3, 5, 6a and 9, directing that every telephone carrier subject to the Act file statements concerning its business and affairs. Declining to recognize the Act as applying to it, appellant withheld compliance. The commission ordered it to obey or to file answer setting forth the facts on which it relied as justification for failure so to do. Appellant then applied to the commission for determination that it is not subject to the Act or the commission's jurisdiction because exempted under  2(b)(2). After hearing, the commission made the final order declaring appellant subject to all common carrier provisions of the Act 'and, therefore, subject to all orders of the Telephone Division applicable to wire telephone car- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 125, 147]\n\u00a0\n riers ...' Thus plainly it made the general orders above mentioned applicable to appellant.\n The complaint challenged the validity of these orders on the ground inter alia that appellant as a matter of law is, and by the evidence and facts found by the commission is shown to be, not subject to any of them. The prayer is for decree 'setting aside and annulling said orders ... and each and all of them and enjoining the enforcement of' them. In the district court, appellees raised no question as to its jurisdiction. But here they argue: The commission's determination classifying the appellant as subject to its jurisdiction and to the general orders is not an order reviewable under the terms of the Urgent Deficiencies Act of 1913; the determination neither commands nor directs appellant to do or refrain from doing anything; the commission could not have instituted a proceeding to enforce it and consequently the court has no jurisdiction to set it aside.\n The final order is much more than a mere determination that appellant is subject to the Act. When read, as it must be, in connection with the general orders, it unmistakably puts appellant under a series of affirmative mandates which, if valid, may be enforced under the Act. See 47 U.S.C.  401, 409, 501, 502, 47 U.S.C.A.  401, 409, 501, 502; 28 U.S. C.  47, 28 U.S.C.A.  47, made applicable by 47 U.S.C.  402(a), 47 U.S.C. A.  402(a). These unequivocally impose upon appellant burden and expense of preparing and reporting to the commission a vast amount of statistical and other information.\n The case presents no debatable question as to the jurisdiction of the district court. A statement of the facts alleged conclusively shows that in purpose, terms and effect the final order constitutes not mere determination or declaration but affirmative commands. There is no occasion to review earlier decisions dealing with affirmative and negative administrative orders and obviously \n\n[307 \nU.S. 125, 148]\n\u00a0\n none to overrule any of them or to repudiate or impair the doctrine they establish. \n1\n The Court's discussion, extraneous to the issue involved, confuses rather than clarifies.\n The findings of the district court are amply sustained by the evidence, and its decree should be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, concurs in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] On November 13, 1935, the order was amended in matters not here relevant. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] The hearing before the examiner lasted two days; 221 pages of testimony were taken and 34 exhibits were introduced. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Under United States v.

United States, \n219 \nU.S. 346\n, 31 S.Ct. 250. \n[\nFootnote 10\n] Prior to Section 7 of the Act of March 3, 1891, 26 Stat. 828, authorizing an appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals from a decree granting a preliminary injunction, review in a case not involving a final judgment was unknown in the federal judicial system, except insofar as it was present in the practice of certification introduced by Section 6 of the Act of April 29, 1802, 2 Stat. 159. See United States v. Bailey, 9 Pet. 267. For state court decisions the requirements for finality of the original Judiciary Act have been adhered to. Section 237, Judicial Code as amended, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 344, 28 U.S.C.A.  344. Review of action of the federal district courts not involving final judgments can be had only in a limited class of cases dealing with interlocutory injunctions, receiverships, and criminal appeals. Section 129 and 238 of the Judicial Code as amended, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 227, 345, 28 U.S.C.A.  227, 345. This Court, however, may take jurisdiction on certiorari before the appellate jurisdiction of the circuit court of appeals is exhausted. \n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] The Lehigh Valley case apparently originated the statement, often made in 'negative order' cases, that the risk results from the statute, not from the order. But this formula hardly squares with the actualities of the situation in that case. The Panama Canal Act, paragraphs (19-21) of Section 5 of the Act to Regulate Commerce, as amended, 49 U.S.C.A.  5 (19- 21), forbade community of interest between any common carrier subject to the Act and a competing water carrier. Under paragraph (20), jurisdiction was conferred on the Commission to determine questions of fact as to the existence of actual or potential competitive conditions, either on the application of the carrier or on the Commission's motion, its determination to be final. Under paragraph (21), the Commission was given jurisdiction to extend the time within which operations otherwise prohibited by the statute might be carried on after July 1, 1914, if such extension did not reduce competition and benefited the public. After receipt of notice of the Act from the Commission, the Lehigh applied to the Commission for a ruling that it was not subject to the Act, or, the alternative, for an extension. The Commission issued an order subjecting the Lehigh to the Act and denying an extension. Thereupon the Lehigh brought a suit to set aside this order and to enjoin the Commission from enforcing it. \n As a practical matter the risk of prosecution to which the Lehigh was subjected if it wished to continue to operate its boats was the result of the order. Since the Panama Canal Act provided that the Commission should find the facts under it, there could have been no prosecution without a previous finding by the Commission that the Lehigh was within the Act; once such a finding was made it was subject to the rule of administrative finality. Compare Keogh v. Chicago & N.W. Ry., \n260 \nU.S. 156\n, 43 S.Ct. 47. Therefore the Commission's order that the Lehigh was subject to the Panama Canal Act was responsible for the risk, as much so as if it had expressly commanded the Lehigh to stop running its boat lines. And assuming the Lehigh was within the prohibition of the statute, the Commission's order denying an exception had the same practical effect as a direct command. Inter-Mountain Rate Case, \n234 \nU.S. 476\n, 34 S.Ct. 986.\n Piedmont & Northern Ry. v. United States, \n280 \nU.S. 469\n, 50 S.Ct. 192, presents a more complicated situation. Section 1(18-22) of the Act to Regulate Commerce, as amended, 49 U.S.C.A.  1(18-22), prohibits any common carrier by rail subject to the Act from extending its lines or constructing new lines without a certificate of convenience and necessity. This requirement did not apply to 'interurban electric railways, which are not operated as a part or parts of a general steam railroad system of transportation.' Upon an application for a certificate by the Piedmont & Northern, coupled with a motion to dismiss on the ground that it was an 'interurban electric' railway, for which no certificate was required, the Commission denied the motion to dismiss and denied the certificate on the merits. The bill to enjoin the Commission from taking any proceedings against the Piedmont & Northern under this order attacked the action of the Commission solely on its assumption of jurisdiction. The Court held the order was not reviewable, on the ground that the order did not adjudicate the railroad's status, did not command it to do anything, but only had the effect of increasing the Piedmont's doubts as to the correctness of its construction of the statute. To be sure, statutory construction is a judicial function. But this is to view the matter too abstractly. For the Commission itself had instituted the system whereby it requested preliminary submission to it of the status of interurban roads. Such a decision was at least the equivalent of a threat of prosecution under the statute, and, in fact, considerable weight is given to administrative practice in ascertaining the meaning of such legislation. Compare United States v. Village of Hubbard, \n266 \nU.S. 474\n, 45 S.Ct. 160. \n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] The initial decision in this group of cases, the Inter-Mountain Rate Case, \n234 \nU.S. 476\n, 34 S.Ct. 986, held reviewable the action of the Commission in refusing to grant requested consent to depart from the long-short haul clause. Section 4 of the Act to Regulate Commerce, as amended, 49 U.S.C.A.  4. While this case would seem to control the Lehigh Valley case and at least to be persuasive in the Piedmont & Northern case, it was not mentioned them. After these two cases, subsequent decisions in this group indicated that the 'negative order' doctrine might prevent review of the refusal by the Secretary of Agriculture to accept rates for filing, the Packers and Stockyards Act, 7 U.S.C.A.  181 et seq., prohibiting the charging of rates except those on file with the Secretary, United States v. Corrick, \n298 \nU.S. 435\n, 56 S.Ct. 829, and of the refusal to grant an increase in rates of compensation for carrying of mail, the Railway Mail Pay Act of 1916, 39 U. S.C.A.  523 et seq., requiring the carrier to carry the mail at the rate set, United States v. Griffin, \n303 \nU.S. 226\n, 58 S.Ct. 601. But in both these decisions the result reached was supported by factors irrelevant to the present discussion. On the other hand, in Powell v. United States, \n300 \nU.S. 276\n, 57 S.Ct. 470, action of the Commission, striking from its files a tariff on the ground that a point was not served by the carrier, was held subject to review as a command to the railway which had filed the tariff not to give the service covered by the tariff. \n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] The Chicago Junction Case, \n264 \nU.S. 258\n, 44 S.Ct. 317; Venner v.

On the contrary, by a long line of decisions, whereby applications to enforce orders of the Commission were considered and disposed of, or where requests to restrain the enforcement of such orders were passed upon, it appears by the reasoning indulged in that it was never considered that there was power in the courts as an original question, without previous affirmative action by the Commission, to deal with what might be termed in a broad sense the administrative features of the act to regulate commerce by determining as an original question that there had been a compliance or noncompliance with the provisions of the act.' 225 U.S. at pages 296, 297, 32 S.Ct. at page 766. '... the recognition of a right in a court to assert the power now claimed would, of necessity, amount to a substitution of the court for the Commission, or, at all events, would be to create a divided authority on a matter where, from the beginning, primary singleness of action and unity was deemed to be imperative.' 225 U.S. at pages 298, 299, 32 S.Ct. at page 767. \n[\nFootnote 15\n] See Chief Justice Taft's estimate of the services of Chief Justice White in 'a new field of administrative law': 'The capital importance which our railroad system had come to have in the welfare of this country made the judicial construction of the interstate commerce act of critical moment. It is not too much to say that Chief Justice White, in construing the measure and its great amendments has had more to do with placing this vital part of our practical government on a useful basis than any other judge. His opinions in the case of the Texas & Pacific Railway Co. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co. (\n204 \nU.S. 426\n, 27 S.Ct. 350, 9 Ann. Cas. 1075), and the cases which followed it, are models of clear and satisfactory reasoning which gave to the people, to state legislatures, to Congress, and the courts a much-needed knowledge of the practical functions the Commerce Commission was to discharge, and of how they were to be reconciled to existing governmental machinery, for the vindication of the rights of the public in respect of national transportation. They are a conspicuous instance of his unusual and remarkable power and facility in statesmanlike interpretation of statute law.'

Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp., \n303 \nU.S. 41\n, 58 S.Ct. 459 (National Labor Relations Board). Compare, also, Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line Co., \n211 \nU.S. 210\n, 29 S.Ct. 67; Anniston Mfg. Co. v. Davis, \n301 \nU.S. 337\n, 57 S. Ct. 816. \n\n[\nFootnote 23\n] In Manufacturers' Railway Co. v. United States, \n246 \nU.S. 457\n, 38 S. Ct. 383, the Court treated as reviewable the action of the Commission in failing to require an absorption of switching charges or a requested joint rate but held not reviewable refusal to fix divisions. In part this may have been on the theory that the issue of the divisions was not properly before the Commission. See 246 U.S. at pages 482, 483, 38 S. Ct. at page 390. In United States v. New River Co., \n265 \nU.S. 533\n, 44 S.Ct. 610, the Court held reviewable the action of the full Commission dismissing a complaint by a shipper against certain car practices held invalid by one division of the Commission. Standard Oil Co. v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 235\n, 51 S.Ct. 429, held not reviewable the action of the Commission refusing to grant reparations, but the main basis of the decision was not the 'negative order' doctrine but the statutory scheme dealing with reparations. In Alton R.R. v. United States, \n287 \nU.S. 229\n, 53 S.Ct. 124, the Court held reviewable the action of the Commission refusing to interfere with divisions set by a railroad in violation of a previous agreement, the Court stating that the action of the Commission validated divisions which were previously invalid. See 287 U.S. at pages 236, 237, 53 S.Ct. at page 127. \n[\nFootnote 24\n] The only test which can be derived from the cases in notes 11-13, 23, supra, is that an order is 'affirmative' if it has the legal effect of changing the status quo, permitting what was previously not allowed or compelling what was previously not required. But on this test the order in the Lehigh Valley case was 'affirmative'. The decision in the New River Co. case could hardly be hung on such a gossamer thread as this test, since there the only change in the status quo resulting from an order considered 'affirmative' was that the order of the full Commission held unobjectionable a car practice which was the subject of complaint. A division of the Commission in the same proceeding had stated that the practice was invalid and should be abandoned and it was abandoned. After the full Commission found the practice not invalid and dismissed the complaint, the practice was adopted again. \n\n[\nFootnote 25\n] See Alton R.R. v. United States, \n287 \nU.S. 229, 235\n, 53 S.Ct. 124, 126. \n[\nFootnote 26\n] This becomes clear on analysis of the precise problem presented in the Procter & Gamble case. It was a dispute between shippers who owned private cars and those who did not as to the distribution of the cars owned by the carriers. The Commission was called upon to resolve that economic conflict by virtue of its authority to prevent practices which unfairly discriminated against one group at the expense of the other. Its final decision was based on a comprehensive policy concerning the place of private cars in our transportation system. Had the prior practice of the carriers been inconsistent with this policy, and the order of the Commission compelled a change, the private car shippers would admittedly have been entitled to test the validity of the Commission ruling in the courts, subject, of course, to the canons of administrative finality. It seems capricious that the fact that the Commission's order authorized the preservation of the status quo should block any review at all. The force of this reasoning is emphasized when it is realized what small factors may determine whether the status quo has been changed, e.g., a difference of views within the Commission, as in the New River Co. case, supra, note 24. See the opinion of the Commerce Court sustaining reviewability in Procter & Gamble Co. v. United States, 188 F. 221. \n\n[\nFootnote 27\n] The Restatement of Torts does not employ this nomenclature. See, also, 7 Labatt, Master and Servant,  2586. \n[\nFootnote 28\n] Compare Inland Steel Co. v. United States, \n306 \nU.S. 153\n, 59 S.Ct. 415, 418: '... the Commission was acting in the interest of shippers generally and in behalf of the public and the national railroad system.' \n\n[\nFootnote 29\n] In the Procter & Gamble case the judicial relief asked was that the order of the Commission dismissing the complaint against the demurrage rules be annulled and that the carriers be enjoined from applying those rules. In the New River Co. case the judicial relief asked was that the car rule under attack be adjudged invalid, that the order of the Commission dismissing the complaint against it be adjudged invalid, that the carriers be enjoined from complying with the rule and that the Commission be enjoined from restricting the commerce of the complainants by its order and by the rule.\n In the Lehigh Valley case the judicial relief asked was that the enforcement of the order of the Commission and the institution of any proceedings thereunder against the complainant be enjoined. In the Inter- Mountain Rate case the judicial relief asked was that the order of the Commission be set aside, that Section 4 of the Act to Regulate Commerce, 49 U.S.C.A.  4, and be declared invalid, and that the Commission and the Attorney General be enjoined from taking any proceedings to prosecute the carriers for violation of Section 4. \n[\nFootnote 30\n] Compare United States v.

BOARD OF COM'RS OF EVERGLADES DRAINAGE DIST.(1939)\nNo. 554\nArgued: Decided: May 15, 1939\n\n\n\n\n[307 \nU.S. 208, 209]\n\u00a0\n Mr. William Roberts, of New York City, for appellants.\n Mr. Clarence G. Ashby, of Jacksonville, Fla., for appellee Board of Com'rs of Everglades Drainage Dist.\n Messrs. Tyrus A. Norwood and Marvin C. McIntosh, both of Tallahassee, Fla., for appellees Trustees of Internal Improvement Fund of Florida.\n\n Opinion by Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER.\n The case is here on appeal under Section 238 of the Judicial Code as amended (28 U.S.C.  345, 28 U.S.C.A.  345) to review a decree of a district court of three judges convened under Section 266 of the Judicial Code as amended (28 U.S.C.  380, 28 U.S.C.A.  380) denying an interlocutory injunction and dismissing the bill and supplemental bills. The bills challenged the validity of certain Florida statutes as impairments of the obligation of contract between the Board of Commissioners of Everglades Drainage District and the appellants, as holders of some of its outstanding bonds. The decree of the district court was based on its conception of the applicability of Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, \n304 \nU.S. 64\n, 58 S.Ct. 817, 114 A.L.R. 1487, but this and other questions are not now open for consideration if Section 266 does not cover a situation like the present. If there be a jurisdictional barrier here, it binds us though not invoked by the appellees.\n The record is singularly obscure. This litigation, which has extended over eight years, is but one phase of a complicated controversy pursued in both state and federal courts. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 208, 210]\n\u00a0\n The bill was filed on May 19, 1931. A supplemental bill was filed July 4, 1931. The prayers of the bills were amended on November 5, 1931. A district court of three judges was convened on November 14, 1931. On September 17, 1932, orders were entered denying a motion to dismiss, and granting an interlocutory injunction conditioned on the filing of a bond for $50,000. Answers were filed in October and November, 1932. The required bond was not given and on February 23, 1933 an order was entered that the interlocutory junction should be vacated. The matter then lay dormant until a second supplemental bill was filed on July 19, 1937. It was not until August 2, 1938, that the order sought here to be reviewed, denying the motion for an interlocutory injunction and dismissing the bill, was made.\n The facts will be summarized only to the extent necessary to expose the jurisdictional problem. The Everglades Drainage District (hereafter called District), comprising a large acreage in the southern part of Florida, was established by Chapter 6456, Laws of Florida, Acts of 1913. The administration of the District was entrusted to a Board of Commissioners (hereafter called the Board), a body corporate. The lands were originally part of a grant made by Congress to Florida in 1850 (43 U. S.C.A.  982-984), whereby Florida undertook to apply the lands and proceeds derived from them to drainage and reclamation purposes. In fulfillment of this obligation Florida, in 1885 (Chapter 610, Laws of Florida, Acts of 1855), vested the lands in trustees of the Internal Improvement Fund (hereafter called Trustees) consisting of designated state officials. Subsequent legislation for the District made numerous changes affecting its financial administration and the relations between the District and the Trustees (Chapters 13633, 14717; 17902, Laws of Florida, 1929, 1931 and 1937). The changes concerned rates of taxes, disposition of their proceeds, procedure in cases of tax delinquency, and authorization of bond issues. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 208, 211]\n\u00a0\n Appellants sued as holders of bonds issued prior to these latter statutes claiming that they impaired obligations created by such bonds as defined by Section 23 of the Act of 1913 which specifically provided that the terms of that Act should constitute 'an irrepealable contract' between bondholders and the District. In substance the bill and the supplemental bills alleged a reduction of the available taxes below those in effect at the time the bonds were issued, an adverse change in the debt service, and a diversion of revenues to purposes other than those required by the Act of 1913. The bills also complained of important changes effected by the later Acts regarding tax delinquencies on the lands in the District. It was alleged that under the earlier Act lands on which taxes were delinquent were to be sold at auction and, for want of bidders for the amount of taxes plus costs, were to be bid off to Trustees who were under a duty to pay for tax certificates as well as the drainage taxes in the future. Violation of contractual rights were alleged in that Trustees had ceased paying for the tax certificates as well as the drainage taxes, and that Section 65 of the 1931 statute had declared that Trustees held the certificates in trust for the District and required them to transfer the certificates to the District. Further violations of the contract were attributed to powers given to the District, after 1913, whereby it was authorized to compromise taxes, to accept bonds for redemption of lands, and to cancel tax liens on lands which came into the ownership of the United States Finally, a claim of impairment of contract was based on changes in the membership of the District after 1913\n\n\n The Board of Commissioners, the Trustees and various county tax officials were named as defendants in the suit. The bills sought to enjoin the defendants distributively, and with much particularity, from effectuating the various difications made by the Acts of 1929, 1931 and 1937 concerning the rates of taxes, the disposition of \n\n[307 \nU.S. 208, 212]\n\u00a0\n their proceeds, the procedure in cases of tax delinquency, the authorization of bond issues, and the internal relations between the District and the Trustees as all these were claimed to be originally defined by the Act of 1913.\n This appeal is properly here only if the present suit required the convening of a district court of three judges under Section 266. We do not think that this was such a suit, because the state statutes from which relief was sought do not constitute legislation 'of general application,' Ex parte Collins, \n277 \nU.S. 565\n, 48 S.Ct. 585, 586.\n Ex parte Collins, supra, reinforced by Ex parte Public National Bank of New York, \n278 \nU.S. 101\n, 49 S.Ct. 43, authoritatively established the restricted class of cases to which the special procedure of Section 266 must be confined. 'Despite the generality of the language' of that Section, it is now settled doctrine that only a suit involving 'a statute of general application' and not one affecting a 'particular municipality or district' can invoke Section 266. Plainly, the matter here in controversy is not one of statewide concern but affects exclusively a particular district in Florida. This Court in effect so held in denying a motion for leave to file a petition for writ of mandamus to convene a court under Section 266 made by the Board of Commissioners in a suit by a bondholder claiming impairment of the obligation of contracts existing under the 1913 Act. Ex parte Everglades Drainage District, \n293 \nU.S. 521\n, 55 S.Ct. 68. The present suit differs from the earlier case in that here the Trustees of the Internal Improvement Fund were made defendants. But what is decisive under Section 266 is not the formal status of the officials sued but the sphere of their functions regarding the matter in issue. An official though localized by his geographic activities and the mode of his selection may, when he enforces a statute which 'embodies a policy of statewide concern,' be performing a state function within the meaning of Section 266. Spielman Motor Sales Co. v. Dodge, \n295 \nU.S. 89\n, 55 S.Ct. 678. Conversely a \n\n[307 \nU.S. 208, 213]\n\u00a0\n state official charged with duties under a statute not of statewide concern is not a state functionary within the purposes for which Section 266 was designed. What was matter of local concern in Ex parte Everglades Drainage District, supra,-the administration of the affairs of the District-remains matter of local concern in the present suit. The nature of the controversy-legislation affecting a locality 'as against a policy of statewide concern'-has remained unchanged even though the present bills made it pertinent to join the Trustee. This suit thus fails to satisfy an essential requirement of Section 266.\n Since the time for appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals has expired, and since the jurisdictional problem determined in this case had not been fully settled prior to this decision, we will not terminate the litigation by dismissing the appeal but, in accordance with the practice followed in Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co. v. Oklahoma Packing Co., \n292 \nU.S. 386\n, 54 S.Ct. 732, we will order the decree vacated and the cause remanded to the district court for further proceedings to be taken independently of Sec. 266 of the Judicial Code. So ordered.\n Decree vacated and cause remanded.\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS took no part in the consideration or disposition of this case. \n\n\n\n","107":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nRORICK v.

Effler, of Toledo, Ohio, for petitioner.\n Mr. George D. Welles, of Toledo, Ohio, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The case is here on a writ of certiorari to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. We granted the writ because the court below had decided an important question of local law in a way probably in conflict with applicable local decisions and probably had misconstrued certain federal statutes and a decision of this Court thereunder. \n306 \nU.S. 626\n, 59 S.Ct. 643, 83 L.Ed. --.\n The basic question here involved is whether a federal district court, in the absence of jurisdiction in personam and after removal of a cause from a state court where jurisdiction in rem over certain property of a defendant \n\n[307 \nU.S. 299, 301]\n\u00a0\n has already been acquired, can issue an order of attachment or garnishment against other property of the same defendant.\n Petitioner, a resident of Ohio, brought suit on June 19, 1930, in a state court in Ohio against respondent, a nonresident corporation organized under Canadian law, on a contract claim for personal services rendered. \n1\n Summons was concurrently issued, but personal service was never had; and simultaneously, an affidavit in attachment and garnishment was filed. A second affidavit in attachment and garnishment was filed on June 27, 1930, naming additional persons; and shortly thereafter certain funds and property of respondent were garnisheed. Subsequently, service by publication was completed; and soon afterwards, and before judgment, respondent appeared specially and obtained a removal of the cause to the District Court of the United States for the Northern District of Ohio, Western Division. In the District Court respondent also appeared specially and moved to quash the service by publication and to dismiss the attachment and garnishment. Nothing further was done in the cause for over five years. Then, on February 17, 1936, petitioner, with leave of the District Court, filed a supplemental and amended petition repeating in substance the allegations of the original petition; and a supplemental affidavit in garnishment which named as garnishees the same persons designated in the original affidavits of June 1930 in the state court. On the same day, the District Court issued an order of attachment and notices to garnishees. Under the latter additional funds in the hands of one of the garnishees were reached. And on April 11, 1936, respondents again appeared specially in the District \n\n[307 \nU.S. 299, 302]\n\u00a0\n Court, and moved, inter alia, to dismiss the attachment and garnishment under the supplemental affidavit of February 17, 1936. After removal to the District Court there was neither personal service, nor, so far as appears, service by publication.\n By its motions of January 26, 1931, and April 11, 1936, respondent asserted that the affidavits in attachment and garnishment were defective and void under Ohio law; that there was no property of respondent within the jurisdiction of the District Court or the state court on which any valid attachment could be or was levied; that there was no property of respondent in the possession of any of the garnishees; that the attachment and garnishment and the service of summons were void by reason of incorrect designation of respondent; that there was no lawful service of summons under the supplemental and amended petition made on respondent; that the supplemental attachment and garnishment under the amended petition were also void for lack of personal service; and that the District Court had no jurisdiction over either the respondent or its property appropriate for the maintenance of this action.\n After oral argument on respondent's motions, the District Court entered an order discharging the attachment and garnishment and striking the petition from the files of the court, on the grounds that the affidavits in attachment and garnishment, dated June 19 and June 27, 1930, were defective and void, and that the supplemental affidavit in attachment and garnishment was also void and ineffective, since no personal service had been made on respondent. On appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals the judgment was affirmed on the grounds that the original attachment or garnishment in the state court was premature and void; that on removal the federal District Court could not validate an attachment not perfected in the state court proceeding; and that attachment may not \n\n[307 \nU.S. 299, 303]\n\u00a0\n issue in a federal District Court until the defendant has been personally served or has voluntarily appeared.\n Of the various questions raised below and briefed here, only those urged in the petition for certiorari and incidental to their determination will be considered on review. General Talking Pictures Corp. v. Western Electric Co., \n304 \nU.S. 175\n, 58 S.Ct. 849; Connecticut Railway & Lighting Co. v. Palmer, \n305 \nU.S. 493\n, 59 S.Ct. 316.\n Before coming to the basic question here involved, namely, whether the garnishment secured in the District Court under the supplemental affidavit of February 17, 1936, was void, there are two preliminary questions. These are (1) whether the notary public before whom the affidavits in attachment and garnishment of June 19 and June 27, 1930, were taken was disqualified, thus rendering the garnishment proceedings void and of no effect; and (2) whether the garnishments obtained in the state court were premature and void because they were secured without personal service and prior to the first publication of notice of constructive service.\n First. The Ohio General Code provided that an affidavit might be used to obtain a provisional remedy such as attachment or garnishment, Sec. 11523, and that an affidavit might be made before any person authorized to take depositions, Sec. 11524. Sec. 11532 provided that 'The officer before whom depositions are taken must not be a relative or attorney of either party, or otherwise interested in the event of the action or proceeding.' The notary in question was D. W. Drennan, a member of the Ohio bar and of the bar of the District Court. Although Drennan had some private practice of his own, he was in the employ of a corporation, of which petitioner was president, and previously in the employ of a predecessor partnership, of which petitioner was a member. But he did not represent petitioner in this case; nor had he ever represented him as personal counsel; nor was he consulted \n\n[307 \nU.S. 299, 304]\n\u00a0\n by petitioner with reference to this case; nor was he related to petitioner; nor did he have any financial stake in the outcome of this suit. His sole connection with the case was that he acted as notary on a few papers. Furthermore, the petition in this case alleged a cause of action personal to petitioner, not one on behalf of the corporation by which Drennan was employed or on behalf of its predecessor partnership.\n Since Drennan was not a 'relative or attorney' of petitioner, he was not disqualified to take the affidavit unless within the meaning of the Ohio statute he was 'otherwise interested in the event of the action or proceeding.' The District Court held that he was so interested. We do not so interpret the Ohio law. Absent some legal or material interest, it seems to us, on the basis of the Ohio authorities which we have found, that there must be some immediate interest in the action akin to that of a relative in order for the notary to run afoul of the statutory prohibition. Disability thus depends on the particular circumstances of each case-the degree of intimacy in relationship between petitioner and notary. In Rhinelander Paper Co. v. Pittsburgh Co., 15 Ohio Cir.Ct.,N.S., 286, an Ohio court held that a young man working as a salaried employee for a firm of attorneys retained in the case was not disqualified by the foregoing section from taking an affidavit in the case as notary. The interest which disqualifies under the Ohio statute, said that Court, is 'some legal, certain and immediate interest such as formerly disqualified a witness from testifying.' Id., 15 Ohio Cir.Ct.,N.S., page 286. Certainly, if an employee of one who himself is disqualified to act as notary is qualified so to act, an employee of a corporation whose officer is suing not on behalf of the corporation but for himself would seem to be similarly qualified under Ohio law. This seems to us especially persuasive, since the notary in question was in fact taking not a deposition but an affidavit and since \n\n[307 \nU.S. 299, 305]\n\u00a0\n the affidavit was not for use as evidence. \n2\n Accordingly, we conclude that the affidavits of June 19 and June 27, 1930, were not defective because they were sworn to before D. W. Drennan. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n[307 \nU.S. 299, 306]\n\u00a0\n Second. Sec. 11279 of the Ohio General Code provides that 'A civil action must be commenced by filing in the office of the clerk of the proper court a petition, and causing a summons to be issued thereon.' Sec. 11819 provides that 'In a civil action for the recovery of money, at or after its commencement, the plaintiff may have an attachment against the property of the defendant' upon various enumerated grounds. In this case the petition was filed, summons was issued, and an affidavit in attachment and garnishment was filed-all on June 19, 1930 It would seem, therefore, that Sec. 11819 was satisfied. But the Circuit Court of Appeals held that an attachment which issued before personal service was obtained, or before the beginning of publication for substituted service, was premature and void. Under that test the attachments and garnishments sought in the state court on June 19 and June 27, 1930, were defective since personal service was never had and since service by publication was not commenced until several months later.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals reached this conclusion in reliance upon its earlier decision in Doherty v. Cremering, 6 Cir., 83 F.2d 388, and upon the decision of the Supreme Court of Ohio in Seibert v. Switzer, 35 Ohio St. 661.\n We think the Circuit Court of Appeals erred. The chronology of events in the Doherty case is the same as the chronology here-attachment was issued on the day the petition was filed and substantially in advance of commencement of service by publication. Personal service was not had. The court relied upon Sec. 11230 of the Ohio General Code and upon Seibert v. Switzer, supra. Sec. 11230 is contained in Chapter 2 of Division 1 of \n\n[307 \nU.S. 299, 307]\n\u00a0\n Title IV of the Ohio General Code. Title IV is entitled 'Procedure In Common Pleas Court'. Chapter 2 of Division 1 is entitled 'Limitation Of Actions'. Sec. 11230 provides: 'An action shall be deemed to be commenced within the meaning of this chapter, as to each defendant, at the date of the summons which is served on him or on a co-defendant who is a joint contractor, or otherwise united in interest with him. When service by publication is proper, the action shall be deemed to be commenced at the date of the first publication, if it be regularly made' (Italics added.)\n It seems clear to us that the words 'An action shall be deemed to be commenced within the meaning of this chapter' confine the operation of the section to matters concerning the limitation of actions, the subject to which the chapter is expressly devoted. The Supreme Court Commission of Ohio in Becher v. Shawhan, 41 Ohio St. 271, so interpreted Sec. 4988, Rev. Stats. (now Sec. 11231 of the Ohio General Code) which provided: 'An attempt to commence an action shall be deemed to be equivalent to the commencement thereof within the meaning of this chapter, when the party diligently endeavors to procure service; but such attempt must be followed by service within sixty days.' The court held that the trial court did not lose jurisdiction because service by publication was not commenced, personal service not being had, until some seven months after suit was brought and an order of attachment was issued and levied. The court said: 'It will be observed that the restrictive words 'within the meaning of this chapter,' confine the operation of the section to matters concerning the limitations of actions. It seems to us that the legislative intent was to prevent parties from indefinitely prolonging a suspension of the statute by a mere attempt to sue.' Id., 41 Ohio St. page 272.\n On that authority we conclude that 'at or after its commencement' as used in Sec. 11819 means the commence- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 299, 308]\n\u00a0\n ment described in Sec. 11279, not the commencement described in Sec. 11230. Additional support for this conclusion is found in Seibert v. Switzer, 35 Ohio St. 661, on which the Circuit Court of Appeals$ relied for the contrary conclusion. There the validity of an order of attachment which had been issued and served prior to the filing of the petition was in issue. At that time Sec. 11279 (then Civil Code,  55) was identically the same as at present. Sec. 11819 (then Civil Code,  191) was, so far as material here, substantially the same as it is now; i.e., it allowed the plaintiff in a civil action for the recovery of money to have an attachment 'at or after the commencement' of the action. Sec. 11820 (then Civil Code,  192) at that time, as now, provided that the order of attachment should be made 'by e clerk of the court in which the action is brought'. And Sec. 11821 (then Civil Code,  193) required in case of attachment, as it does now, a bond by the 'plaintiff' to the 'defendant' except in case defendant was a non-resident or a foreign corporation. The court in Seibert v. Switzer, supra, held that the order of attachment was unauthorized and void,4 and said: 'No action was, in fact, commenced by the filing of a petition, until some three or four hours after the order of attachment was served and returned.\n'The statute does not authorize an attachment except in an action, and the clerk of the court has no authority to issue the order of attachment until an action is brought, and the relation of plaintiff and defendant is established in the case.\n\n'An action is commenced or brought, within the meaning of sections 192 and 193, by the filing of a petition and \n\n[307 \nU.S. 299, 309]\n\u00a0\n causing a summons to issue thereon. Code,  55. ...' Id., 35 Ohio St. page 665.\n\n The Seibert case and the Bacher case thus seem to be wholly consistent. An order of attachment issued prior to the filing of a petition and issuance of summons is void; an order of attachment issued after filing of the petition and the issuance of summons but prior to the commencement of service by publication is valid, though personal service is not had.\n In view of these Ohio authorities, we conclude that the attachments or garnishments secured in the state court were not premature or void because obtained prior to personal service or before commencement of service by publication. See, also, St. John v. Parsons, 54 Ohio App. 420, 7 N.E.2d 1013. Those liens, having been obtained in the state court prior to removal, are preserved intact after removal. Sec. 646 of the Revised Statutes, 28 U.S.C.  79, 28 U.S.C.A.  79.5\n Third. This brings us to the main issue in the case-whether a federal District Court has the power to issue an order of attachment or garnishment in a removed cause if jurisdiction in rem has been obtained prior to removal. The Circuit Court of Appeals relied upon the rule laid down in Big Vein Coal Company of West Virginia v. Read, \n229 \nU.S. 31\n, 33 S. Ct. 694, that an attachment may not issue in a federal District Court \n\n[307 \nU.S. 299, 310]\n\u00a0\n where no personal service has been had upon defendant or where defendant has made no personal appearance. One of the earliest antecedents of the Big Vein Coal Company case, supra, was Toland v. Sprague, 12 Pet. 300. In that case a citizen of Pennsylvania brought suit in the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Pennsylvania against a citizen of Massachusetts who was domiciled abroad. No personal service was had, but an attachment was levied upon defendant's property in Pennsylvania. Sec. 739 of the Revised Statutes then provided that no civil suit should be brought in either the circuit or district court against any inhabitant of the United States by any original process in any other district than that whereof he was an inhabitant or in which he was found at the time of the serving of the writ. This Court by a divided vote concluded that an attachment could not be issued except as a part of, or together with, process served upon defendant personally. And in Ex parte Des Moines & M. Railway Company, \n103 \nU.S. 794\n, this Court concluded that since the defendant was an inhabitant of a state outside the jurisdiction of the federal court and was not found or served with process in that jurisdiction, no attachment could issue from that court against his property. It was on the basis of those two precedents that this Court later made its decision in Big Vein Coal Company of West Virginia v. Read, supra. In that case, plaintiff instituted suit in the federal court. A summons was issued and returned not found. Thereafter an order of attachment was issued. It was held that unless jurisdiction in personam is obtained over the defendant, his estate may not be attached in the federal court, an attachment being but 'an incident to a suit' and not a means of acquiring jurisdiction. Id., 229 U.S. page 38, 33 S.Ct. page 696. This conclusion was reached in spite of the fact that Sec. 739, 28 U.S.C.A.  112 had been changed since Ex parte Des Moines & M. Railway Company, supra, by addition of a diversity of citizenship clause permitting suit 'in the district of the residence of either the plaintiff or the defendant', \n\n[307 \nU.S. 299, 311]\n\u00a0\n and in spite of Sec. 915 of the Revised Statutes, 28 U.S.C.  726, 28 U.S. C.A.  726, discussed hereafter. Nevertheless, this Court held that since Congress had not explicitly provided for service by publication in such cases, attachment could be obtained only in cases where service was adequate for a judgment in personam.\n The argument for extension or application of the rule followed from Toland v. Sprague to Big Vein Coal Company of West Virginia v. Read, supra, to cases such as the instant one loses its persuasiveness. Ingrained in those decisions is the feeling that it would be unjust for a person to have his rights passed upon in the absence of the notice afforded by personal service, so that he might appear and defend himself. That philosophy was perhaps best expressed by Mr. Justice Miller sitting in circuit in Nazro v. Cragin, Fed.Cas.No.10,062, 3 Dill. 474, 476, where he said, in 1873, that a contrary doctrine would 'compel citizens of the Pacific coast to go to New York to defend their property which happened to be there and would give the great central cities vast power'. But that viewpoint had not been expressed by the Congress in Sec. 646. That section gave validity in the federal court to attachments obtained in the state court prior to removal, by its provision that any attachment in the state court it 'shall hold the goods or estate so attached' to answer the final judgment or decree. And this Court has solicitiously protected attachments obtained prior to removal, even though jurisdiction in rem had not been perfected in the state court by service by publication. Clark v. Wells, \n203 \nU.S. 164\n, 27 S.Ct. 43. So to a considerable degree, this Court in pursuance of the policy of the Congress as expressed in Sec. 646, has not adhered rigorously to the philosophy underlying the antecedents of the Big Vein Coal Company case. For most assuredly a defendant whose property is attached in a state court prior to removal may not have been given notice of the kind which personal service would provide, since the state pro- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 299, 312]\n\u00a0\n cedure as in this case commonly permits attachment or garnishment where only service by publication can be made.\n But we need not rely merely on inferences drawn from statutory construction, since the Congress has provided plaintiffs in federal courts with procedural remedies available in state courts. Sec. 915 of the Revised Statutes, 28 U.S.C.A.  726, provides:\n'In common-law causes in the district courts the plaintiff shall be entitled to similar remedies, by attachment or other process, against the property of the defendant, which were on June 1, 1872, provided by the laws of the State in which such court is held for the courts thereof; and such district courts may, from time to time, by general rules, adopt such State laws as may be in force in the States where they are held in relation to attachments and other process. Similar preliminary affidavits or proofs, and similar security, as required by such State laws, shall be first furnished by the party seeking such attachment or other remedy.'\n\n This section when read with Sec. 646, indicates to us that where jurisdiction in rem has been acquired prior to removal, plaintiff may obtain in the federal court after removal such orders of attachment or garnishment as would have been available to him had he been permitted to remain in the state court. Such interpretation merely makes it possible for a lien obtained in a state court prior to removal to be extended by the federal court to other property of the same defendant. It introduces no new element in the statutory scheme for, as we have said, the lien which Sec. 646 protects may often have been obtained without personal service. The policy which recognizes the validity of a lien preserved by virtue of Sec. 646, though personal service is lacking, permits extension of that lien by a federal District Court under like circumstances to other property of the same defendant by reason of Sec. 915. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 299, 313]\n\u00a0\n This holding can be brought within the rule of the Big Vein Coal Company case, supra, if that decision is narrowly limited For in one sense it can be said that attachment or garnishment is here used only as an 'auxiliary remedy'. Id., 229 U.S. page 37, 33 S.Ct. page 696. The garnishment effected under the affidavit of February 17, 1936, if valid under Ohio law, would merely extend the proceedings in rem to reach other property of the same defendant. Accordingly, if that extension is permissible under Section 915, it is not defective merely because jurisdiction in personam is absent. Whether or not such extension is permissible is a matter of state law on which we do not pass. Since the case will be remanded, that question and other questions raised by the respondent can be more appropriately disposed of by the District Court.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n Judgment reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Paris E. Singer was also named a defendant in the original petition but died pending the action. Since subsequent proceedings were continued against respondent alone, the cause is treated as if Devon Syndicate, Limited, were the sole defendant. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] There is Ohio authority for the view that Sec. 11532 of the Ohio General Code under which the notary's disqualification is asserted was intended only to define and regulate the taking of affidavits to be used as testimony in a judicial proceeding. City Commission of City of Gallipolis v. State, 36 Ohio App. 258, 173 N.E. 36. On the other hand, Leavitt & Milroy Co. v. Rosenberg Bros. & Co., 83 Ohio St. 230, 93 N.E. 904, squarely held that an attachment was defective because the affidavit was made before a notary who was the attorney for the plaintiff in violation of Sec. 11532.-then Sec. 5271, Rev.Stat. And though that case, so far as appears, has never been overruled, its holding and Sec. 11532 were nevertheless before the court in Evans v. Lawyer, 123 Ohio St. 62, 173 N.E. 735. There the Court referred to certain sections of the General Code (including Sec. 11532) which relate to execution of affidavits and said 'The sections of the Code referred to relate to the mode of taking testimony, and are found under part third, title IV, division III, relating to procedure in common pleas court, in chapter 3 in regard to evidence. We think these sections of the Code relate to affidavits to be used in the sense of evidence.' Id., 123 Ohio St. page 66, 173 N.E. page 736. Though we are not justified on these authorities in concluding that the prohibitions contained in Sec. 11532 are inapplicable to notaries before whom affidavits in attachment and garnishment are taken, nevertheless they lend support to the view that in considering whether or not a notary is 'otherwise interested' in the event of the action within the meaning of the section, it is appropriate to give some weight to the function which the affidavit in question is to perform, in the absence of a contrary ruling by the Ohio courts. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Another reason urged by respondent for the invalidity of the affidavits in question is that the notary was disqualified by Sec. 121 of the Ohio General Code which provides: 'No banker, broker, cashier, director, teller, or clerk of a bank, banker or broker, or other person holding an official relation to a bank, banker, or broker, shall be competent to act as notary public in any matter in which such bank, banker, or broker is interested.' Respondent claims that the corporation of which petitioner was an officer and by which the notary was employed, as well as the predecessor partnership, was a municipal bond broker; that petitioner, being an officer of the corporation, was himself a broker; and that therefore the notary was a 'clerk of' or 'other person holding an official relation to' a 'broker'. Suffice it to note (1) that the notary was not in the employ of petitioner; and (2) that neither the corporation nor its predecessor partnership appears to be 'interested' in the action. As alleged, the action seems to be personal to petitioner. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] It should also be noted that Sec. 11230 (Civil Code,  20) was substantially the same then as now.

YABUCOA SUGAR CO.(1939)\nNo. 498\nArgued: March 7, 1939Decided: March 27, 1939\n\n\n\n As Amended on Denial of Rehearing May 22, 1939\n\n\n Mr. William C. Rigby, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Earle T. Fiddler, of San Juan, P.R., for respondent. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 505, 506]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent sued the Treasurer of Porto Rico in a local district court for recovery of 1927 income taxes paid under the laws of the Island. By construction of the local Porto Rican statutes permitting suits for refunds, the local district court found that no right had been granted to sue at law for taxes voluntarily paid. The bill of complaint was then dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, because it disclosed that the tax in question had been paid voluntarily and without protest. The Supreme Court of Porto Rico affirmed, but was reversed by the United States Circuit Court of Appeals. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n As conceded by respondent, this suit cannot be maintained unless authorized by a Porto Rican law, because Porto Rico cannot be sued without its consent. \n2\n It is also conceded that the Porto Rican legislature is not obligated to provide a judicial remedy for tax refunds. \n3\n Respondent's contentions here are that the governing statutes of the Island do authorize the present suit 'either by express language or by necessary implication,' and that the Porto Rican courts erroneously construed the local statutes.\n Section 75 of the controlling Income Tax Act of Porto Rico, approved August 6, 1925,4 authorizes the Treasurer 'to remit, refund, and pay back all taxes erroneously or illegally assessed or collected, ... and all taxes that appear to be unjustly assessed or excessive in amount, or in \n\n[306 \nU.S. 505, 507]\n\u00a0\n any manner wrongfully collected,' and requires him to 'report to The Legislature of Porto Rico at the beginning of each regular session ... all transactions under this section.'\n The courts of Porto Rico construed Section 75 to mean that the Treasurer's refusal to refund taxes not paid under protest is final; that the local statutes grant the courts no jurisdiction to review this refusal; and that after the Treasurer's report to the legislature, a voluntary taxpayer's complaint must be addressed to the legislature. Disagreeing with this construction given the statute by the courts of Porto Rico, the Circuit Court of Appeals (one Judge dissenting) found that the 1925 Act plainly provided a resort to the courts, even in suits to recover taxes voluntarily paid without protest.\n It is necessary that we examine some of the considerations which led to the Porto Rican courts' construction of Section 75 of the 1925 Act. For illustration, Section 66 of the Porto Rican Income Tax Law of 19195 imposed upon the Treasurer the duty of making tax refunds (as in Section 75 of the 1925 Act), but Section 66 contained an express provision for 'appeal to the courts' if a taxpayer's claim were denied by the Treasurer. 6 The omission of this express provision from Section 75 and all other Sections of the 1925 \n\n[306 \nU.S. 505, 508]\n\u00a0\n Act was logically considered by the Porto Rican courts to be of significance in the construction of that Act. The right of appeal to the courts contained in Section 66 of the 1919 Law was first omitted from the 1921 Porto Rican Law, 7 and this led the Supreme Court of Porto Rico to declare in the present case that 'since 1921, ... the right to bring suits for the recovery of taxes other than those paid under protest has been abrogated.' \n8\n\u00a0\n\n Furthermore, four different sections of the 1925 Act (57, 60, 62 and 76(a) constitute a statutory plan under which a taxpayer who pays under protest is granted the right to sue in the courts for refund. Such a taxpayer can sue at law under these sections only if he has been denied relief by both the Treasurer and the Board of Review and Equalization of the Island. But these sections nowhere expressly authorize appeal from the Treasurer to the Board by one who paid taxes without protest. And Section 76(b), which the Circuit Court of Appeals interpreted as authorizing suit by a taxpayer who paid without protest, expressly prohibits suit in court 'until a claim for refund or credit has been duly filed with ... the Board of Review and Equalization on appeal, according to the provisions of law in that regard, and the regulations established in pursuance thereof.' ( Italics supplied.) Since a voluntary taxpayer is given no express right of appeal from the Treasurer to the Board by the 'provisions of law in ... regard' to such appeals, he is not expressly authorized to comply with the condition precedent to right of suit under Section 76(b). Rights denied by the statutes could not be granted by regulations. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 505, 509]\n\u00a0\n In addition, Section 76(b) of the 1925 Act is practically identical in language with Section 3226 of United States Revised Statutes governing suits for refunds of United States taxes. \n9\n But the legislature of Porto Rico-while apparently using Section 3226 as a model-omitted from 76(b) the clause of Section 3226 reading 'suit or proceeding (for tax refund) may be maintained, whether or not such tax ... has been paid under protest or duress.' This substantial adoption of Section 3226, omitting the clause authorizing suit without protest (as well as the similar omission from the 1921 Act), could hardly represent accidental oversight, but instead indicate a deliberate legislative purpose. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n Congress first granted local authority to the government of Porto Rico in 190011 and comprehensively revised the original plan in 1917.12 Both enactments manifest a congressional purpose to preserve-consistently with our system of government-the then existing governmental practices. Laws and ordinances then in effect and not contrary to our laws or Constitution were continued in full force, subject to alteration by the Porto Rican legislature or Congress. Original and appellate local courts, their jurisdiction and procedure, were preserved by Congress, and local officials were left in office. 13 And this Court has declared its unwillingness to overrule Porto Rican tribunals upon matters of purely local concern14 or to decide against the local understanding of a local matter, not believed by this Court to be clearly wrong;15 and a disposition to accept the construction \n\n[306 \nU.S. 505, 510]\n\u00a0\n placed by a local court upon a local statute16 and to sustain such a construction in the absence of clear or manifest error. \n17\n\u00a0\n\n Taxing acts of Porto Rico are purely local and the traditional reluctance of this Court to overturn constructions of such local statutes by local courts is particularly applicable to interpretations of Porto Rican statutes by Porto Rican tribunals. \n18\n Orderly development of the government of Porto Rico as an integral part of our governmental system is well served by a careful and consistent adherence to the legislative and judicial policy of deferring to the local procedure and tribunals of the Island.\n The judgments of the Porto Rican courts in this case are not unsupported by logic or reason. They embody a recognition of our constitutional division of powers between the legislative and judicial branches of government. Believing the legislature had declined to give the right to sue to a taxpayer who computed his own tax from his own records and voluntarily paid it without protest, the Porto Rican courts properly declined to read implications into a statute which they could not fairly find there. In passing upon a previous construction of a Porto Rican statute by the Supreme Court of Porto Rico, this Court said, 'The construction adopted in Porto Rico at least does no violence to the words of the statute; it concerns local affairs under a system with which the court of the Island is called on constantly to deal, and we are not prepared, as against the weight properly attributed to the local decision, to say that it is wrong.' \n19\n So \n\n[306 \nU.S. 505, 511]\n\u00a0\n here, we cannot say the Porto Rican courts were wrong. In failing to uphold their construction of the local statutes, the Circuit Court of Appeals was in error.\n The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the complaint in the district court of Porto Rico must stand dismissed, as ordered by that court and affirmed by the Supreme Court of Porto Rico.\n It is so ordered.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 1 Cir., 98 F.2d 398.

Gen., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This and its companion case, Rasquin v. Humphreys, \n308 \nU.S. 54\n, 60 S. Ct. 60, present the single question of statutory construction whether in the case of an inter vivos transfer of property in trust, by a donor reserving to himself the \n\n[308 \nU.S. 39, 41]\n\u00a0\n power to designate new beneficiaries other than himself, the gift becomes complete and subject to the gift tax imposed by the federal revenue laws at the time of the relinquishment of the power. Co-relative questions, important only if a negative answer is given to the first one, are whether the gift becomes complete and taxable when the trust is created or in the case where the donor has reserved a power of revocation for his own benefit and has relinquished it before relinquishing the power to change beneficiaries, whether the gift first becomes complete and taxable at the time of relinquishing the power of revocation.\n In 1913, before the enactment of the first gift tax statute of 1924, decedent created a trust of personal property for the benefit of named beneficiaries, reserving to himself the power to terminate the trust in whole or in part, or to modify it. In 1919 he surrendered the power to revoke the trust by an appropriate writing in which he reserved 'the right to modify any or all of the trusts' but provided that this right 'shall in no way be deemed or construed to include any right or privilege' in the donor 'to withdraw principal or income from any trust.' In August, 1924, after the effective date of the gift tax statute, 43 Stat. 313,  319 et seq., 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 79 et seq., decedent renounced his remaining power to modify the trust. After his death in 1928, the Commissioner following the decision in Hesslein v. Hoey, 2 Cir., 91 F.2d 954, in 1937, ruled that the gift became complete and taxable only upon decedent's final renunciation of his power to modify the trusts and gave notice of a tax deficiency accordingly.\n The order of the Board of Tax Appeals sustaining the tax was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, 103 F.2d 81, which followed the decision of the Court of Appeals for the second circuit in Hesslein v. Hoey, supra, in which we had denied certiorari, \n302 \nU.S. 756\n, 58 S.Ct. 284. In the Hesslein case, as in the Humphreys case now \n\n[308 \nU.S. 39, 42]\n\u00a0\n before us, a gift in trust with the reservation of a power in the donor to alter the disposition of the property in any way not beneficial to himself, was held to be incomplete and not subject to the gift tax under the 1932 Act so long as the donor retained that power.\n We granted certiorari in this case May 15, 1939, \n307 \nU.S. 618\n, 59 S. Ct. 836, and in the Humphreys case May 22, 1939, \n307 \nU.S. 619\n, 59 S.Ct. 1034, upon the representation of the Government that it has taken inconsistent positions with respect to the question involved in the two cases and that because of this fact and of the doubt of the correctness of the decision in the Hesslein case decision of the question by this Court is desirable in order to remove the resultant confusion in the administration of the revenue laws.\n It has continued to take these inconsistent positions here, stating that it is unable to determine which construction of the statute will be most advantageous to the Government in point of revenue collected. It argues in this case that the gift did not become complete and taxable until surrender by the donor of his reserved power to designate new beneficiaries of the trusts. In the Humphreys case it argues that the gift upon trust with power reserved to the donor, not afterward relinquished, to change the beneficiaries was complete and taxable when the trust was created. It concedes by its brief that 'a decision favorable to the government in either case will necessarily preclude a favorable decision in the other.'\n In ascertaining the correct construction of the statutes taxing gifts, it is necessary to read them in the light of the closely related provisions of the revenue laws taxing transfers at death, as they have been interpreted by our decisions. Section 319 et seq. of the Revenue Act of 1924, 43 Stat. 253, 313, reenacted as Sec. 501 et seq. of the 1932 Act, 47 Stat. 169, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev. Acts, page 580 et seq., imposed a graduated tax upon gifts. It supplemented that laid on transfers at death, which had long been a feature of the revenue laws. When the gift tax \n\n[308 \nU.S. 39, 43]\n\u00a0\n was enacted Congress was aware that the essence of a transfer is the passage of control over the economic benefits of property rather than any technical changes in its title. See Burnet v. Guggenheim, \n288 \nU.S. 280, 287\n, 53 S.Ct. 369, 371. Following the enactment of the gift tax statute this Court in Reinecke v. Northern Trust Company, 1929, \n278 \nU.S. 339\n, 49 S.Ct. 123, 66 A.L.R. 397, held that the relinquishment at death of a power of revocation of a trust for the benefit of its donor was a taxable transfer. Cf. Saltonstall v. Saltonstall, \n276 \nU.S. 260\n, 48 S.Ct. 225; Chase National Bank v. United States, \n278 \nU.S. 327\n, 49 S.Ct. 126, 63 A.L.R. 388, and similarly in Porter v. Commissioner, 1933, \n288 \nU.S. 436\n, 53 S.Ct. 451, that the relinquishment by a donor at death of a reserved power to modify the trust except in his own favor is likewise a transfer of the property which could constitutionally be taxed under the provisions of  302(d) of the 1926 Revenue Act, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 228, reenacting in substance 302(d) of the 1924 Act, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 67, although enacted after the creation of the trust. Cf. Bullen v. Wisconsin, \n240 \nU.S. 625\n, 36 S.Ct. 473; Curry v. McCanless, \n307 \nU.S. 357\n, 59 S.Ct. 900; Graves v. Elliott, \n307 \nU.S. 383\n, 59 S.Ct. 913. Since it was the relinquishment of the power which was taxed as a transfer and not the transfer in trust, the statute was not retroactively applied. Cf. Nichols v. Coolidge, \n274 \nU.S. 531\n, 47 S. Ct. 710, 52 A.L.R. 1081; Helvering v. Helmholz, \n296 \nU.S. 93, 98\n, 56 S.Ct. 68, 70.\n The rationale of decision in both cases is that 'taxation is not so much concerned with the refinements of title as it is with the actual command over the property taxed.' See Corliss v. Bowers, \n281 \nU.S. 376, 378\n, 50 S.Ct. 336; Saltonstall v. Saltonstall, supra, 276 U.S. page 261, 48 S.Ct. page 225; Burnet v. Guggenheim, supra, 288 U.S. page 287, 53 S.Ct. page 371, and that a retention of control over the disposition of the trust property, whether for the benefit of the donor or others, renders the gift incomplete until the power is relinquished whether in life or at death. The rule was thus established, and has ever since been consistently followed by the Court, that a transfer of property upon trust, with power reserved to the donor either to revoke it and recapture the trust property or to modify its terms \n\n[308 \nU.S. 39, 44]\n\u00a0\n so as to designate new beneficiaries other than himself is incomplete, and becomes complete so as to subject the transfer to death taxes only on relinquishment of the power at death.\n There is nothing in the language of the statute, and our attention has not been directed to anything in its legislative history to suggest that Congress had any purpose to tax gifts before the donor had fully parted with his interest in the property given, or that the test of the completeness of the taxed gift was to be any different from that to be applied in determining whether the donor has retained an interest such that it becomes subject to the estate tax upon its extinguishment at death. The gift tax was supplementary to the estate tax. The two are in pari materia and must be construed together. Burnet v. Guggenheim, supra, 288 U. S. page 286, 53 S.Ct. page 371. An important, if not the main purpose of the gift tax was to prevent or compensate for avoidance of death taxes by taxing the gifts of property inter vivos which, but for the gifts, would be subject in its original or converted form to the tax laid upon transfers at death. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[308 \nU.S. 39, 45]\n\u00a0\n Section 322 of the 1924 Act, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 82, provides that when a tax has been imposed by  319 upon a gift, the value of which is required by any provision of the statute taxing the estate to be included in the gross estate, the gift tax is to be credited on the estate tax. The two taxes are thus not always mutually exclusive as in the case of gifts made in contemplation of death which are complete and taxable when made, and are also required to be included in the gross estate for purposes of the death tax. But  322 is without application unless there is a gift inter vivos which is taxable independently of any requirement that it shall be included in the grossestate. Property transferred in trust subject to a power of control over its disposition reserved to the donor is likewise required by  302(d) to be included in the gross estate. But it does not follow that the transfer in trust is also taxable as a gift. The point was decided in the Guggenheim case where it was held that a gift upon trust, with power in the donor to revoke it is not taxable as a gift because the transfer is incomplete, and that the transfer whether inter vivos or at death becomes complete and taxable only when the power of control is relinquished. We think, as was pointed out in the Guggenheim case, supra, 288 U.S. page 285, 53 S.Ct. page 370, that the gift tax statute does not contemplate two taxes upon gifts not made in contemplation of death, one upon the gift when a trust is created or when the power of revocation, if any, is relinquished, and another on the transfer of the same property at death because the gift previously made was incomplete. \n\n[308 \nU.S. 39, 46]\n\u00a0\n It is plain that the contention of the taxpayer in this case that the gift becomes complete and taxable upon the relinquishment of the donor's power to revoke the trust cannot be sustained unless we are to hold, contrary to the policy of the statute and the reasoning in the Guggenheim case, that a second tax will be incurred upon the donor's relinquishment at death of his power to select new beneficiaries, or unless as an alternative we are to abandon our ruling in the Porter case. The Government does not suggest, even in its argument in the Humphreys case, that we should depart from our earlier rulings, and we think it clear that we should not do so both because we are satisfied with the reasoning upon which they rest and because departure from either would produce inconsistencies in the law as serious and confusing as the inconsistencies in administrative practice from which the Government now seeks relief.\n There are other persuasive reasons why the taxpayer's contention cannot be sustained. By  315(b), 324, 43 Stat. 312, 316, 26 U.S.C.A. Int. Rev.Acts, pages 77, 83, and more specifically by  510 of the 1932 Act, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code,  1009, the donee of any gift is made personally liable for the tax to the extent of the value of the gift if the tax is not paid by the donor. It can hardly be supposed that Congress intended to impose personal liability upon the donee of a gift of property, so incomplete that he might be deprived of it by the donor the day after he had paid the tax. Further,  321(b)(1), 43 Stat. 315, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev. Acts, page 82, exempts from the tax, gifts to religious, charitable, and educational corporations and the like. A gift would seem not to be complete, for purposes of the tax, where the donor has reserved the power to determine whether the donees ultimately entitled to receive and enjoy the property are of such a class as to exempt the gift from taxation. Apart from other considerations we should hesitate to accept as correct a construction under which it could plausibly be maintained that a gift in trust \n\n[308 \nU.S. 39, 47]\n\u00a0\n for the benefit of charitable corporations is then complete so that the taxing statute becomes operative and the gift escapes the tax even though the donor should later change the beneficiaries to the non-exempt class through exercise of a power of modify the trust in any way not beneficial to himself.\n The argument of petitioner that the construction which the Government supports here, but assails in the Humphreys case, affords a ready means of evasion of the gift tax is not impressive. It is true, of course, that under it gift taxes will not be imposed on transactions which fall short of being completed gifts. But if for that reason they are not taxed as gifts they remain subject to death taxes assessed at higher rates, and the Government gets its due, which was precisely the end sought by the enactment of the gift tax.\n Nor do we think that the provisions of  219[g] of the 1924 Act, 43 Stat. 277, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 31, have any persuasive influence on the construction of the gift tax provisions with which we are now concerned. One purpose of the gift tax was to prevent or compensate for the loss of surtax upon income where large estates are split up by gifts to numerous donees. \n2\n Congress was aware that donors in trust might distribute income among several beneficiaries, although the gift remains so incomplete as not to be subject to the tax. It dealt with that contingency in  219(g) which taxes to the settlor the income of a trust paid to beneficiaries where he reserved to himself an unexercised power to 'revest in himself title' to the trust property producing the income. Whether this section is to be read as relieving the donor of the income tax where the power reserved is to modify the trust, except for his own benefit, we do not now decide. If Congress, in enacting it, undertook to \n\n[308 \nU.S. 39, 48]\n\u00a0\n define the extent to which a reserved power of control over the disposition of the income is equivalent to ownership of it so as to mark the line between those cases on the one hand where the income is to be taxed to the donor and those on the other where, by related sections, the income is to be taxed to the trust or its beneficiaries, we do not perceive that the section presents any question so comparable to that now before us as to affect our decision. We are concerned here with a question to which Congress has given no answer in the words of the statute, and it must be decided in conformity to the course of judicial decision applicable to a unified scheme of taxation of gifts whether made inter vivos or at death. If Congress, for the purpose of taxing income, has defined precisely the amount of control over the income which it deems equivalent to ownership of it, that definition is controlling on the courts even though without it they might reach a different conclusion, and even though retention of a lesser degree of control be deemed to render a transfer incomplete for the purpose of laying gift and death taxes.\n The question remains whether the construction of the statute which we conclude is to be derived from its language and history, should be modified because of the force of treasury regulations or administrative practice. Article I of Regulations 67, under the 1924 Act (adopted without any change of present significance in Article III, Regulations 79, under the 1932 Act) provides that the creation of a trust where the grantor retains the power to revest in himself title to the corpus of the trust does not constitute a gift subject to the tax and declares that 'where the power retained by the grantor to revest in himself title to the corpus is not exercised a taxable transfer will be treated as taking place in the year in which such power is terminated'. Petitioner urges that \n\n[308 \nU.S. 39, 49]\n\u00a0\n the regulation is in terms applicable to the trust presently involved because it was subject to a power of revocation in favor of the donor before the enactment of the gift tax which was later relinquished. But we think, as the court below thought, that the regulation was not directed to the case of the relinquishment of a reserved power to select new beneficiaries other than the donor and did not purport to lay down any rule for cases where there was a reserved power different from or in addition to the power to revest the title in the donor. At most the regulation is ambiguous and without persuasive force in determining the true construction of the statute. Burnet v. Chicago Portrait Co., \n285 \nU.S. 1, 16\n, 20 S., 52 S.Ct. 275, 280, 282. The amended regulation of 1936 under the 1932 Act, Art. III, Reg. 79, removed the ambiguity by declaring that the gift is complete and subject to the tax when 'the donor has so parted with dominion and control as to leave in him no power to cause the beneficial title to be revested in himself'. But this regulation is by its terms applicable only to gifts made after June 6, 1932 and is of significance here only so far as it is declaratory of the correct construction of the 1924 Act.\n Petitioner also insists that the construction of the statute for which he contends is sustained by the administrative practice. That practice is not disclosed by any published Treasury rulings or decisions and our only source of information on the subject is a stipulation appearing in the record. It states that in the administration of the gift tax under the 1924 and 1932 Acts and until the decision in the Hesslein case it was 'the uniform practice of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue in adjusting cases of the character of that here involved to treat the taxable transfer subject to gift tax as occurring when the transferor relinquished all power to revest in himself title to the property constituting the subject of \n\n[308 \nU.S. 39, 50]\n\u00a0\n the transfer'; and that three hundred cases 'of such character' have been closed or adjusted in conformity to this practice.\n This definition of the practice appears as a part of a stipulation of facts setting forth in some 126 printed pages the original trust deed of December 24, 1913, and thirteen modifications of it between that date and the final relinquishment of the power of modification on August 20, 1924. They reveal a varied and extensive power of control by the donor over the disposition of the trust property which survived the relinquishment, in 1919, of the power of revocation for his own benefit, and with which he finally parted after enactment of the gift tax. The description of the practice as that resorted to in adjusting 'cases of the character of that here involved', presupposes some knowledge on our part of what the signers of the stipulation regarded as the salient features of the present case which, although not specified by the stipulation, were necessarily embraced in the practice. Administrative practice, to be accepted as guiding or controlling judicial decision, must at least be defined with sufficient certainty to define the scope of the decision. If relinquishment of the power of revocation mentioned by the stipulation was of controlling significance in defining the practice, that circumstance was not present in the Hesslein case or in the Humphreys case. Whether in any of the three hundred cases mentioned in the stipulation the relinquishment of the power of revocation was followed by the relinquishment inter vivos of a power of changing the beneficiaries like that in this case, does not appear.\n Such a stipulated definition of the practice is too vague and indefinite to afford a proper basis for a judicial decision which undertakes to state the construction of the statute in terms of the practice. Moreover, if we regard the stipulation as agreeing merely that the legal \n\n[308 \nU.S. 39, 51]\n\u00a0\n questions involved in the present case have uniformly been settled administratively in favor of the contention now made by the petitioner, it involves conclusions of law of the stipulators, both with respect to the legal issues in the present case and those resolved by the practice. We are not bound to accept, as controlling, stipulations as to questions of law. Swift & Co. v. Hocking Valley Railway Co., \n243 \nU.S. 281, 289\n, 37 S.Ct. 287, 289.\n Without attempting to say what the administrative practice has actually been we may, for present purposes, make the assumption most favorable to the taxpayer in this case that the practice was as stated by the Government in its brief in the Humphreys case, viz., that until the decision in the Hesslein case 'the Bureau consistently took the position that the gift tax applied to a transfer in trust where the grantor reserved the right to modify the trust but no right to revest title in himself.'\n But the record here shows that no such practice was recognized as controlling in 1935 when the present case first received the attention of the Bureau. On February 21, 1935, the Assistant General Counsel gave an opinion reviewing at length the facts of the present case and the applicable principles of law, and concluded on the reasoning and authority of the Guggenheim and Porter cases that the gift was not complete and taxable until the relinquishment in August, 1924 of the power to modify the trust by the selection of new beneficiaries. In April, 1935, the matter was reconsidered and a new opinion was given which was finally adopted by the assistant secretary who had intervened in the case. This opinion reversed the earlier one on the authority of the Guggenheim case. It was at pains to point out that in that case the Court had held that the relinquishment of the power of revocation was a taxable gift but it made no mention of the fact that there, unlike the present case, there was no power of modification which survived the relinquishment of the \n\n[308 \nU.S. 39, 52]\n\u00a0\n power of revocation, which was crucial in the Porter case. Neither opinion rested upon or made any mention of any practice affecting cases where such a power of modification is reserved. After the decision in the Hesslein case the ruling of the Bureau in this case was again reversed and notice of deficiency sent to the taxpayer.\n From this record it is apparent that there was no established administrative practice before the opinion of April, 1935,3 and if the practice was adopted then it was because of a mistaken departmental ruling of law based on an obvious misinterpretation of the decisions in the Porter and Guggenheim cases.\n Administrative practice may be of persuasive weight in determining the construction of a statute of doubtful meaning where the practice does not conflict with other provisions of the statute and is not so inconsistent with applicable decisions of the courts as to produce inconsistency and confusion in the administration of the law. Such a choice, in practice, of one of two possible constructions of a statute by those who are expert in the field and specially informed as to administrative needs and convenience, tends to the wise interpretation and just administration of the laws. This is the more so when reliance has been placed on the practice by those affected by it.\n But courts are not bound to accept the administrative construction of a statute regardless of consequences, even when disclosed in the form of rulings. See Helvering v. New York Trust Co., \n292 \nU.S. 455, 468\n, 54 S.Ct. 806, 810. Here the practice has not been revealed by any published rulings or action of the Department on which taxpayers could have relied. The taxpayers in the present cases are contend- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 39, 53]\n\u00a0\n ing for different rulings. In Harriet Rosenau v. Com'r, 1938, 37 B.T.A. 468, as in the Humphreys case, the taxpayer contended that the date when the power to change the beneficiary is renounced is controlling. The petitioner here, who contends that the date of relinquishment of the power of revocation is controlling, rather than the date of surrender of power of modification, set up his trust and relinquished the power of revocation before the gift tax was enacted. The reenactment of the gift tax statute by the 1932 Act can not be said to be a legislative approval of the practice which had not been disclosed by Treasury regulation, ruling or decision, and which does not appear to have been established before the adoption of the 1932 Act. Cf. McCaughn v. Hershey Chocolate Co., \n283 \nU.S. 488, 492\n, 51 S.Ct. 510, 512; Massachusetts Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. United States, \n288 \nU.S. 269, 273\n, 53 S.Ct. 337, 339; Helvering v. New York Trust Co., \n292 \nU.S. 455, 468\n, 54 S.Ct. 806, 810.\n The very purpose sought to be accomplished by judicial acceptance of an administrative practice would be defeated if we were to regard the present practice as controlling. If a practice is to be accepted because of the superior knowledge of administrative officers of the administrative needs and convenience, see Brewster v. Gage, \n280 \nU.S. 327, 336\n, 50 S.Ct. 115, 117, there is no such reason for its acceptance here. The Government by taking no position confesses that it is unable to say how administrative need and convenience will best be served. If, as we have held, we may reject an established administrative practice when it conflicts with an earlier one and is not supported by valid reasons, see Burnet v. Chicago Portrait Co., \n285 \nU.S. 1, 16\n, 52 S.Ct. 275, 280, we should be equally free to reject the practice when it conflicts with out own decisions. A change of practice to conform to judicial decision, such as has occurred since the decision in the Hesslein case, or to meet administrative exigencies, will be accepted as controlling when consistent with our decisions. Morrissey v. Com- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 39, 54]\n\u00a0\n missioner, \n296 \nU.S. 344, 354\n, 56 S.Ct. 289, 293. Here we have an added, and we think conclusive reason for rejecting the earlier practice and accepting the later. The earlier, because in sharp conflict with our own decisions, as we have already indicated, cannot be continued without the perpetuation of inconsistency and confusion comparable to that of which the Government asks to be relieved by our decision.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice BUTLER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The gift tax provisions of the Revenue Act of 1924 were added by amendments to the revenue bill introduced on the floor of the House and the Senate. Cong.Rec., Vol. 65, Part 3, pp. 3118-3119; Part 4, pp. 3170, 3171; Part 8, p. 8094. The sponsor of the amendment in both houses urged the adoption of the bill as a 'corollary' or as 'supplemental' to the estate tax. Cong.Rec., Vol. 65, Part 3, pp. 3119-3120, 3122; Part 4, p. 3172; Cong.Rec., Vol. 65, Part 8, pp. 8095, 8096.\n The gift tax of 1924 was repealed when Congress, concurrently with the enactment of  302(c) of the Revenue Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 70, 125, 126, establishing a conclusive presumption that gifts within two years of death were made in contemplation of death and therefore subject to the estate tax. A gift tax was reenacted by  501 of the Revenue Act of 1932, 47 Stat. 169, 26 U.S.C.A.Int.Rev.Acts, page 580, shortly after it was decided in Heiner v. Donnan, \n285 \nU.S. 312\n, 52 S.Ct. 358, that the legislative enactment of such a presumption violated the Fifth Amendment. U.S.C.A.Const.\n Section 501(c) of the 1932 Act, 26 U.S.C.A.Int.Rev.Acts, page 580, added a new provision that transfers in trust, with power of revocation in the donor, should be taxed on relinquishment of the power. This was repealed by  511 of the Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 680, 758, 26 U.S.C.A.Int. Rev.Acts, page 769, because Burnet v. Guggenheim, \n288 \nU.S. 280\n, 53 S.Ct. 369, had declared that such was the law without specific legislation. H.R. No. 704, 73rd Cong., 2d Sess., p. 40; Sen.Rep.

'Hand-Bill' shall mean any hand-bill, dodger, commercial advertising circular, folder, booklet, letter, card, pamphlet, sheet, poster, sticker, banner, notice or other written, printed or painted matter calculated to attract attention of the public.'\n\n'Sec. 2801. No person shall distribute any hand-bill to or among pedestrians along or upon any street, sidewalk or park, or to passengers on any street car, or throw, place or attach any hand-bill in, to or upon any automobile or other vehicle.'\n\n The appellant was charged in the Municipal Court with a violation of Sec. 28.01. Upon his trial it ws proved that he distributed handbills to pedestrians on a public sidewalk and had more than three hundred in his possession for that purpose. Judgment of conviction was entered and sentence imposed. The Superior Court of Los Angeles County affirmed the judgment. \n2\n That court being the highest court in the State authorized to pass upon such a case, an appeal to this court was allowed.\n The handbill which the appellant was distributing bore a notice of a meeting to be held under the auspices of 'Friends Lincoln Brigade' at which speakers would discuss the war in Spain.\n The court below sustained the validity of the ordinance on the ground that experience shows littering of the \n\n[308 \nU.S. 147, 155]\n\u00a0\n streets results from the indiscriminate distribution of handbills. \n3\n It held that the right of free expression is not absolute but subject to reasonable regulation and that the ordinance does not transgress the bounds of reasonableness. Lovell v. City of Griffin, \n303 \nU.S. 444\n, 58 S.Ct. 666, was distinguished on the ground that the ordinance there in question prohibited distribution anywhere within the city while the one involved forbids distribution in a very limited number of places.\n No. 18.\n An ordinance of the City of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, provides: 'It is hereby made unlawful for any person ... to ... throw ... paper ... or to circulate or distribute any circular, hand-bills, cards, posters, dodgers, or other printed or advertising matter ... in or upon any sidewalk, street, alley, wharf, boat landing, dock or ther public place, park or ground within the City of Milwaukee.'\n The petitioner, who was acting as a picket, stood in the street in front of a meat market and distributed to passing pedestrians hand-bills which pertained to a labor dispute with the meat market, set forth the position of organized labor with respect to the market, and asked citizens to refrain from patronizing it. Some of the bills were thrown in the street by the persons to whom they were given and it resulted that many of the papers lay in the gutter and in the street. The police officers who arrested the petitioner and charged him with a violation \n\n[308 \nU.S. 147, 156]\n\u00a0\n of the ordinance did not arrest any of those who received the bills and threw them away. The testimony was that the action of the officers accorded with a policy of the police department in enforcement of the ordinance to the effect that, when such distribution resulted in littering of the streets, the one who was the cause of the littering, that is, he who passed out the bills, was arrested rather than those who received them and afterwards threw them away. The Milwaukee County court found the petitioner guilty and fined him. On appeal the judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n The court held that the purpose of the ordinance was to prevent an unsightly, untidy, and offensive condition of the sidewalks. It distinguished Lovell v. City of Griffin, supra, on the ground that the ordinance there considered manifestly was not aimed at prevention of littering of the streets. The court approved the administrative construction of the ordinance by the police officials and felt that this construction sustained its validity. The court said: 'Unless and until delivery of the handbills was shown to result in a littering of the streets their distribution was not interfered with.'\n No. 29.\n An ordinance of the City of Worcester, Massachusetts, provides: 'No person shall distribute in, or place upon any street or way, any placard, handbill, flyer, poster, advertisement or paper of any description.'\n The appellants distributed in a street leaflets announcing a protest meeting in connection with the administration of State unemployment insurance. They did not throw any of the leaflets on the sidewalk or scatter them. \n\n[308 \nU.S. 147, 157]\n\u00a0\n Some of those to whom the leaflets were handed threw them on the sidewalk and the street, with the result that some thirty were lying about.\n The appellants were arrested and charged with a violation of the ordinance. The Superior Court of Worcester County rendered a judgment of conviction and imposed sentence. The Supreme Judicial Court overruled exceptions. \n5\n That court held the ordinance a valid regulation of the use of the streets and sought thus to distinguish it from the one involved in Lovell v. City of Griffin, supra, which the court said was not such a regulation. Referring to the ordinance the court said: 'It interferes in no way with the publication of anything in the city of Worcester, except only that it excludes the public streets and ways from the places available for free distribution. It leaves open for such distribution all other places in the city, public and private.'\n No. 11.\n An ordinance of the Town of Irvington, New Jersey, provides: 'No person except as in this ordinance provided shall canvass, solicit, distribute circulars, or other matter, or call from house to house in the Town of Irvington without first having reported to and received a written permit from the Chief of Police or the officer in charge of Police Headquarters.' It further enacts that a permit to canvass shall specify the number of hours or days it will be in effect; that the canvasser must make an application giving his name, address, age, height, weight, place of birth, whether or not previously arrested or convicted of crime, by whom employed, address of employer, clothing worn, and description of project for which he is can- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 147, 158]\n\u00a0\n vassing; that each applicant shall be fingerprinted and photographed; that the Chief of Police shall refuse a permit in all cases where the application, or further investigation made at the officer's discretion, shows that the canvasser is not of good character or is canvassing for a project not free from fraud; that canvassing may only be done between 9 A. M. and 5 P.M.; that the canvasser must furnish a photograph of himself which is to be attached to the permit; that the permittee must exhibit the permit to any police officer or other person upon request, must be courteous to all persons in canvassing, must not importune or annoy the town's inhabitants or conduct himself in an unlawful manner and must, at the expiration of the permit, surrender it at police headquarters. Persons delivering goods, merchandise, or other articles in the regular course of business to the premises of persons ordering, or entitled to receive the same, are exempted from the operation of the ordinance. Violation is punishable by fine or imprisonment.\n The petitioner was arrested and charged with canvassing without a permit. The proofs show that she is a member of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society and, as such, certified by the society to be one of 'Jehovah's Witnesses'. In this capacity she called from house to house in the town at all hours of the day and night and showed to the occupants a so called testimony and identification card signed by the society. The card stated that she would leave some booklets discussing problems affecting the person interviewed; and that, by contributing a small sum, that person would make possible the printing of more booklets which could be placed in the hands of others. The card certified that the petitioner was an ordained minister sent forth by the society, which is organized to preach the gospel of God's kingdom, and cited passages from the Bible with respect to the obligation so to preach. The petitioner left, or \n\n[308 \nU.S. 147, 159]\n\u00a0\n offered to leave, the books or booklets with the occupants of the houses visited. She did not apply for, or obtain, a permit pursuant to the ordinance because she conscientiously believed that so to do would be an act of disobedience to the command of Almighty God.\n The petitioner was convicted in the Recorder's Court. The Court of Common Pleas affirmed the judgment. On a further appeal the Supreme Court affirmed. 6 The Court of Errors and Appeals affirmed the judgment of the Supreme Court. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n The Supreme Court held that the petitioner's conduct amounted to the solicitation and acceptance of money contributions without a permit, and held the ordinance prohibiting such action a valid regulation, aimed at protecting occupants and others from disturbance and annoyance and preventing unknown strangers from visiting houses by day and night. It overruled the petitioner's contention that the measure denies or unreasonably restricts freedom of speech or freedom of the press. The Court of Errors and Appeals thought Lovell v. City of Griffin, supra, not controlling, since the ordinance in that case prohibited all distribution of printed matter and was not limited to ways which might be regarded as consistent with the maintenance of public order or as involving disorderly conduct, molestation of inhabitants, or misuse or littering of the streets, whereas the ordinance here involved is aimed at canvassing or soliciting, subjects not embraced in that condemned in the Lovell case. The Court said: 'A municipality may protect its citizens against fraudulent solicitation, and when it enacts an ordinance to do so, all persons are required to abide thereby. The ordinance in question was evidently designed for that purpose ....' \n\n[308 \nU.S. 147, 160]\n\u00a0\n The freedom of speech and of the press secured by the First Amendment, U.S.C.A.Const., against abridgment by the United States is similarly secured to all persons by the Fourteenth against abridgment by a state. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n Although a municipality may enact regulations in the interest of the public safety, health, welfare or convenience, these may not abridge the individual liberties secured by the Constitution to those who wish to speak, write, print or circulate information or opinion.\n Municipal authorities, as trustees for the public, have the duty to keep their communities' streets open and available for movement of people and property, the primary purpose to which the streets are dedicated. So long as legislation to this end does not abridge the constitutional liberty of one rightfully upon the street to impart information through speech or the distribution of literature, it may lawfully regulate the conduct of those using the streets. For example, a person could not exercise this liberty by taking his stand in the middle of a crowded street, contrary to traffic regulations, and maintain his position to the stoppage of all traffic; a group of distributors could not insist upon a constitutional right to form a cordon across the street and to allow no pedestrian to pass who did not accept a tendered leaflet; nor does the guarantee of freedom of speech or of the press deprive a municipality of power to enact regulations against \n\n[308 \nU.S. 147, 161]\n\u00a0\n throwing literature broadcast in the streets. Prohibition of such conduct would not abridge the constitutional liberty since such activity bears no necessary relationship to the freedom to speak, write, print or distribute information or opinion.\n This court has characterized the freedom of speech and that of the press as fundamental personal rights and liberties. \n9\n The phrase is not an empty one and was not lightly used. It reflects the belief of the framers of the Constitution that exercise of the rights lies at the foundation of free government by free men. It stresses, as do many opinions of this court, the importance of preventing the restriction of enjoyment of these liberties.\n In every case, therefore, where legislative abridgment of the rights is asserted, the courts should be astute to examine the effect of the challenged legislation. Mere legislative preferences or beliefs respecting matters of public convenience may well support regulation directed at other personal activities, but be insufficient to justify such as diminishes the exercise of rights so vital to the maintenance of democratic institutions. And so, as cases arise, the delicate and difficult task falls upon the courts to weigh the circumstances and to appraise the substantiality of the reasons advanced in support of the regulation of the free enjoyment of the rights.\n In Lovell v. City of Griffin, supra, this court held void an ordinance which forbade the distribution by hand or otherwise of literature of any kind without written permission from the city manager. The opinion pointed out that the ordinance was not limited to obscene and immoral literature or that which advocated unlawful conduct, placed no limit on the privilege of distribution in the interest of public order, was not aimed to prevent molestation of inhabitants or misuse or littering of \n\n[308 \nU.S. 147, 162]\n\u00a0\n streets, and was without limitation as to time or place of distribution. The court said that, whatever the motive, the ordinance was bad because it imposed penalties for the distribution of pamphlets, which had become historical weapons in the defense of liberty, by subjecting such distribution to license and censorship; and that the ordinance was void on its face, because it abridged the freedom of the press. Similarly in Hague v. C.I.O., \n307 \nU.S. 496\n, 59 S.Ct. 954, an ordinance was held void on its face because it provided for previous administrative censorship of the exercise of the right of speech and assembly in appropriate public places.\n The Los Angeles, the Milwaukee, and the Worcester ordinances under review do not purport to license distribution but all of them absolutely prohibit it in the streets and, one of them, in other public places as well.\n The motive of the legislation under attack in Numbers 13, 18 and 29 is held by the courts below to be the prevention of littering of the streets and, although the alleged offenders were not charged with themselves scattering paper in the streets, their convictions were sustained upon the theory that distribution by them encouraged or resulted in such littering. We are of opinion that the purpose to keep the streets clean and of good appearance is insufficient to justify an ordinance which prohibits a person rightfully on a public street from handing literature to one willing to receive it. Any burden imposed upon the city authorities in cleaning and caring for the streets as an indirect consequence of such distribution results from the constitutional protection of the freedom of speech and press. This constitutional protection does not deprive a city of all power to prevent street littering. There are obvious methods of preventing littering. Amongst these is the punishment of those who actually throw papers on the streets. \n\n[308 \nU.S. 147, 163]\n\u00a0\n It is argued that the circumstance that in the actual enforcement of the Milwaukee ordinance the distributor is arrested only if those who receive the literature throw it in the streets, renders it valid. But, even as thus construed, the ordinance cannot be enforced without unconstitutionally abridging the liberty of free speech. As we have pointed out, the public convenience in respect of cleanliness of the streets does not justify an exertion of the police power which invades the free communication of information and opinion secured by the Constitution.\n It is suggested that the Los Angeles and Worcester ordinances are valid because their operation is limited to streets and alleys and leaves persons free to distribute printed matter in other public places. But, as we have said, the streets are natural and proper places for the dissemination of information and opinion; and one is not to have the exercise of his liberty of expression in appropriate places abridged on the plea that it may be exercised in some other place.\n While it affects others, the Irvington ordinance drawn in question in No. 11, as construed below, affects all those, who, like the petitioner, desire to impart information and opinion to citizens at their homes. If it covers the petitioner's activities it equally applies to one who wishes to present his views on political, social or economic questions. The ordinance is not limited to those who canvass for private profit; nor is it merely the common type of ordinance requiring some form of registration or license of hawkers, or peddlers. It is not a general ordinance to prohibit trespassing. It bans unlicensed communication of any views or the advocacy of any cause from door to door, and permits canvassing only subject to the power of a police officer to determine, as a censor, what literature may be distributed from house to house and who may distribute it. The applicant must submit to that \n\n[308 \nU.S. 147, 164]\n\u00a0\n officer's judgment evidence as to his good character and as to the absence of fraud in the 'project' he proposes to promote or the literature he intends to distribute, and must undergo a burdensome and inquisitorial examination, including photographing and fingerprinting. In the end, his liberty to communicate with the residents of the town at their homes depends upon the exercise of the officer's discretion.\n As said in Lovell v. City of Griffin, supra, pamphlets have proved most effective instruments in the dissemination of opinion. And perhaps the most effective way of bringing them to the notice of individuals is their distribution at the homes of the people. On this method of communication the ordinance imposes censorship, abuse of which engendered the struggle in England which eventuated in the establishment of the doctrine of the freedom of the press embodied in our Constitution. To require a censorship through license which makes impossible the free and unhampered distribution of pamphlets strikes at the very heart of the constitutional guarantees.\n Conceding that fraudulent appeals may be made in the name of charity and religion, we hold a municipality cannot, for this reason, require all who wish to disseminate ideas to present them first to police authorities for their consideration and approval, with a discretion in the police to say some ideas may, while others may not, be carried to the homes of citizens; some persons may, while others may not, disseminate information from house to house. Frauds may be denounced as offenses and punished by law. Trespasses may similarly be forbidden. If it is said that these means are less efficient and convenient than bestowal of power on police authorities to decide what information may be disseminated from house to house, and who may impart the information, the answer is that considerations of this sort do not empower a municipality to abridge freedom of speech and press. \n\n[308 \nU.S. 147, 165]\n\u00a0\n We are not to be taken as holding that commercial soliciting and canvassing may not be subjected to such regulation as the ordinance requires. Nor do we hold that the town may not fix reasonable hours when canvassing may be done by persons having such objects as the petitioner. Doubtless there are other features of such activities which may be regulated in the public interest without prior licensing or other invasion of constitutional liberty. We do hold, however, that the ordinance in question, as applied to the petitioner's conduct, is void, and she cannot be punished for acting without a permit.\n The judgment in each case is reversed and the causes are remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. So ordered.\n Reversed and remanded.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS is of opinion that the judgment in each case should be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] On account of the importance of the question we granted certiorari in two of the cases, and noted jurisdiction in the others.

THE FERNCLIFF(1939)\nNo. 548\nArgued: March 2, 1939Decided: March 27, 1939\n\n\n\n\n[306 \nU.S. 444, 445]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Charles R. Hickox, of New York City, for Smith et al.\n Messrs. George Whitefield Betts, Jr., of New York City, and George Forbes, of Baltimore, Md., for The Ferncliff et al.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals, Fourth Circuit, has certified to us the following Statement of Facts and Questions (U.S.C.A. Title 28,  346)-\n'Statement of Facts.\n\n'This was a suit in admiralty to recover damages to shipments of fish meal made in March 1936 (on Motorship Ferncliff) from points in Japan to consignees in Norfolk, Va. and Baltimore, Md. under bills of lading containing the following provision:\n\n\"All claims for which the ship and or carrier may be liable shall be adjusted and settled on the value declared by the shipper or on the net invoice cost plus disbursements, whichever shall be the least. The carrier shall not be liable for any profit or consequential or special damages, and shall have the option of replacing any lost or damaged goods.'\n\n'No lower rate was offered the shipper for the service rendered because of this provision; and no choice of rates with and without the valuation clause was afforded him. The record shows that no value was declared by the shipper on the shipment in question. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 444, 446]\n\u00a0\n 'The invoice cost of the fish meal was $32.50 per ton. The value of the damaged portion of the shipment upon arrival at the ports of destination was $25.00 per ton. The market value of undamaged fish meal at the ports of destination at the time of the arrival of the shipment was $ 36.00 per ton.\n\n'The court below held the valuation clause valid and computed the damages on the basis of the difference between the invoice cost ($32.50 per ton) and the value of the damaged fish meal at the time and place of delivery ($25.00 per ton). 22 F.Supp. 728, 741-742.\n\n'Appellants, while not contending before us that the clause quoted is absolutely invalid, contend that in view of the decision in The Ansaldo San Giorgio I v. Rheinstrom Bros. Co., \n294 \nU.S. 494\n, 55 S.Ct. 483, its validity can be sustained only if it be construed as requiring that, in estimating damages, the percentage of loss on the damaged shipment be ascertained and applied to the invoice cost. Under this contention, the loss here would be determined, not by deducting the value upon arrival ($25.00 per ton) from the invoice cost ($32.50 per ton), but by ascertaining the proportion of the invoice cost ($32.50) corresponding to the proportion which the actual loss ($36.00-$25.00 =$11.00) bears to sound value ($36.00), i.e. by taking 11\/36 of $32.50. It is pointed out that this is the method used in calculating the amount of loss under a valued marine insurance policy on cargo and also the method prescribed by rule 16 of the York-Antwerp rules for a general average adjustment. And it was stated at the bar of the court by counsel for appellant that the same method has been generally employed in estimating cargo damage since the decision in The Ansaldo San Giorgio I v. Rheinstrom Bros. Co., supra. At the time this statement of counsel was made it was challenged by opposing counsel and nothing appears in the record with regard thereto. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 444, 447]\n\u00a0\n 'In the absence of the decision in the Ansaldo San Giorgio case, we should affirm the decision below on the authority of Gulf, C. & S.F.R.

In view of that decision, however, we are divided and in doubt as to the validity of such a clause as is here involved and as to the method which should be employed in computing damages under it. Notwithstanding the passage of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act of April 16, 1936, c. 229, sec. 4(5), 49 Stat. 1210, 46 U.S.C.A.  1304(5), the question as to the correct method of computing damages under a valuation clause is deemed an important one, as to which an authoritative decision would seem desirable. We, therefore, respectfully certify to the Supreme Court of the United States the following questions of law as indispensable to a proper decision of this case:\n\n'Questions.\n\n'1. Is an invoice cost valuation clause, such as that here involved, inserted in a marine bill of lading without offering a choice of rates to a shipper, valid and binding upon the parties?\n\n'2. If so, should damages to a shipment be ascertained, under such a valuation clause, by deducting the value of the damaged goods in their damaged condition at the time and place of delivery from the invoice cost valuation as fixed by such clause?\n\n'3. Or, should the percentage of loss of the damaged goods, based on difference between sound value and damaged value, be ascertained and the percentage applied to the invoice value for the purpose of ascertaining the damage?' \n\n[306 \nU.S. 444, 448]\n\u00a0\n The Ansaldo San Giorgio I v. Rheinstrom Bros. Co., \n294 \nU.S. 494\n, 55 S. Ct. 483, considered and held invalid, because against sound public policy, the following limitation agreement in a maritime bill of lading: 'In the event of claims for loss, damage or short delivery the same shall be adjusted on the basis of the invoice value of the entire shipment adding expenses necessarily incurred.' The opinion did not adjudicate the validity or effect of a clause, such as the one now before us, where the parties adopted 'an agreed value as a measure of recovery for loss or damage to goods not delivered by the carrier or damaged in transit', and it does not control the questions here involved.\n\n The clause in question prescribes a measure of recovery rather than limits the amount which may be recovered when loss or damage occurs. For a long time, in the absence of a controlling statute, fraud or imposition, such provisions in bills of lading have been recognized as valid by this and other federal courts. Also by many-perhaps a majority-of the state courts. Hart v. Pennsylvania Railroad Co., \n112 \nU.S. 331\n, 337-340, 5 S.Ct. 151, 154, 155; Phoenix Insurance Co. v.

Co. v. McCaull-Dinsmore Co., \n253 \nU.S. 97, 98\n, 99 S., 100, 40 S.Ct. 504, involved the following clause in a bill issued by the railway-'The amount of any loss or damage for which any carrier is liable shall be computed \n\n[306 \nU.S. 444, 449]\n\u00a0\n on the basis of the value of the property at the place and time of shipment under this bill of lading, including freight charges, if paid.' We said-\n'Before the passage of this amendment (The Cummins Amendment, Act March 4, 1915, c. 176, 38 Stat. 1196) the Interstate Commerce Commission had upheld the clause in the bill of lading as in no way limiting the carriers' liability to less than the value of the goods, but merely offering the most convenient way of finding the value. ... We appreciate the convenience of the stipulation in the bill of lading and the arguments urged in its favor. We understand that it does not necessarily prevent a recovery of the full actual loss, and that if the price of wheat had gone down the carrier might have had to pay more under this contract than by the common law rule. But the question is how the contract operates upon this case.'\n\n The clause was declared inoperative because forbidden by the Cummins Amendment, which did not extend to ocean carriers. Union Pac. R.R. Co. v. Burke, \n255 \nU.S. 317, 322\n, 41 S.Ct. 283, 284.\n The District Court upheld and applied the agreement, and supported its views by a careful opinion-(22 F.Supp. 728, 742-744). It said-\n'The clause we are here dealing with does not appear to operate in that way (i.e., 'to relieve the carrier from the consequences of its negligence'). ... The clause is gratified by determining the amount of the whole tonnage damaged, and multiplying by the damage per ton. ... In operation the clause only eliminates prospective profit, and limits the damage to the owner's actual loss in the transaction. It may even operate to his advantage if the market value at destination is less than the invoice value. In my opinion the clause is therefore different in its operation and effect from that condemned in the Ansaldo Case. (\n294 \nU.S. 494\n, 55 S.Ct. 483.) \n\n[306 \nU.S. 444, 450]\n\u00a0\n 'In the Ansaldo Case two general types of valuation clauses were considered, one described as a 'true limitation agreement' and the other as a 'true valuation clause.' The one involved in this case would seem to fall in the latter category. ... I take the view after reading the cases specially cited in the opinion and other consideration of the subject, that the clause as here worded is not against public policy and should be given effect. ... The general rule of our law is freedom of contract, subject only to statute and considerations of the public interest. Where a contract stipulation is not clearly opposed to public policy it should be upheld, as it is the agreement of the parties. The particular question is not likely to again arise as the subject is now regulated by the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act,  4(5), 46 U.S.C.A.  1304(5).\n\n'Assuming the validity of the bill of lading clause that claims against the carrier shall be adjusted and settled on the net invoice cost plus disbursements ... it is now contended that the proper method of calculation is to first determine what was the percentage of damage or loss, and then apply this percentage to the invoice value.\n\n'Counsel for the libelants point out that this is the method of calculating the amount of loss under a valued marine insurance policy on cargo. ... It is frankly admitted by counsel that this method of calculating damages has never heretofore been applied by any court in a case dealing with a clause submitting invoice value for market value. On the contrary it is my understanding that the calculation as made in the opinion, which was to deduct from the invoice value (which in this case in \n\n[306 \nU.S. 444, 451]\n\u00a0\n cluded freight and other expenses) the damaged value has been uniformly applied.'\n\n We think the District Court reached the correct conclusion in respect of the mooted clause upon adequate authority and reasoning.\n To the first certified question, we reply, Yes where there has been no fraud or imposition; to the second the answer is, Yes; to the third, No. \n\n\n\n","112":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSOCONY-VACUUM OIL CO., INC. v. SMITH(1939)\nNo. 195\nArgued: December 15, 1938Decided: January 3, 1939\n\n\n\n Messrs. Louis Mead Treadwell and Henry B. Potter, both of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. George J. Engelman, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question is whether assumption of risk is a defense in a suit brought by a seaman under the Jones Act to recover for injuries resulting from his use, while on duty, \n\n[305 \nU.S. 424, 425]\n\u00a0\n of a defective appliance of the ship, when he chose to use the unsafe appliance instead of a safe method of doing his work, which was known to him.\n Respondent, a seaman, brought the present suit in the District Court for southern New York to recover, under the Jones Act, 41 Stat. 1007, 46 U. S.C.  688, 46 U.S.C.A.  688, for an injury received from a fall in the engine room of petitioner's vessel. The fall was caused by a defective step on which respondent stood while on duty, when seeking to learn, by touching with his finger, whether an engine bearing was overheated.\n In submitting the case to the jury the trial court applied the admiralty rule of comparative negligence, instructing the jury that negligence of respondent contributing to the accident was not a bar to recovery but was to be considered in mitigation of damages. The court refused petitioner's request for an instruction that if respondent could have performed his duty without use of the defective step, he assumed the risk of injury from it. Instead, the court charged that there was no assumption of risk by the seaman where the shipowner failed in its duty to furnish a safe appliance.\n Judgment of the district court, upon a verdict in respondent's favor, was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, 96 F.2d 98, on authority of The Arizona v. Anelich, \n298 \nU.S. 110\n, 56 S.Ct. 707, and Beadle v. Spencer, \n298 \nU.S. 124\n, 56 S.Ct. 712. The court's decision was predicated upon its conclusion that respondent had free choice of a way to reach and touch the bearing, without standing on the defective step, and it held that in the circumstances, and since the seaman had not used the defective appliance contrary to orders, the trial judge had correctly instructed the jury that assumption of risk was not a bar to recovery. We granted certiorari, \n305 \nU.S. 586\n, 59 S.Ct. 81, 83 L.Ed. --, upon a petition asking us to review this ruling in the light of our decisions in The Arizona and the Beadle Cases, supra, \n\n[305 \nU.S. 424, 426]\n\u00a0\n the question being one of public importance in the application of the maritime law as supplemented by the Jones Act.\n A preliminary point, much discussed in brief and argument here, is whether the question ruled upon below is presented by the record. Respondent insists that there was no evidence from which the jury could conclude that there was a safe method known to him by which he could have reached the bearing without using the defective step and that he chose the unsafe instead of the safe method.\n Respondent was employed as an oiler in petitioner's engine room. It was his duty while the vessel was under way to touch with his finger, at intervals of twenty minutes, a bearing of the propeller shaft, in order to ascertain whether it was overheating and in need of additional lubrication. Directly in front of the bearing, as he approached it, was an iron step, located about one foot above the engine room floor and bolted to the bedplate which supported the bearing. Respondent testified that the step was braced on its underside by a bracket or strut, and that about two or three weeks before the accident he had observed that the bracket was loose and out of place and had reported the fact to a superior officer.\n Respondent also gave the only account of what occurred at the time of the accident. He testified that in order to reach the bearing it was necessary for him and was his uniform practice to stand with his right foot upon the step with his left advanced and placed upon the bedplate, and with his left hand holding, for support, the upper edge of an adjacent vertical slush pan; that, standing in this position, he placed his right hand in a hole extending downward through the bearing cap a distance of eight or ten inches, where he touched the shaft and the adjoining bearing to discover whether they were overheated and to inspect the oil which stuck to his fingers \n\n[305 \nU.S. 424, 427]\n\u00a0\n and which, if discolored, would indicate that the journal was beginning to gripe because of excessive friction; that as he stepped down his left foot struck the loose bracket, which had projected beyond the edge of the step, causing him to fall and suffer the injuries complained of. There was testimony by petitioner's witnesses, all denied by respondent, from which the jury could have found that it was possible for respondent to have reached the bearing while standing on the floor, without the use of the defective step, by seizing with his right hand a grab iron located on a nearby column and reaching with his left hand to touch the left end of the bearing, which extended through the bedplate; that this was the usual and only appropriate way to examine the bearing, and that respondent had been seen to reach it in that manner. There was also testimony that other oilers had touched the bearing without using the step while standing on the floor, with right hand grasping the upper edge of the vertical crank- pit guard, which was adjacent on the right and nearer to the bearing than the grab iron. There was evidence of the relative localities of the several parts of the structure mentioned and of the distances between them, indicating that respondent could have reached the bearing, either at its left end or through the hole in the bearing cap, while standing on the engine room floor and without using the step.\n We must accept the verdict as establishing the negligent failure of petitioner to furnish a safe appliance, the iron step, and that the plaintiff knew that it was defective at the time of the accident, for the only evidence of any breach of duty by petitioner was respondent's testimony that he knew of the defect and had reported it to the first assistant engineer two or three weeks before the accident. Upon all the evidence it was for the jury to say whether respondent was aware that in reaching the bearing with one hand, either at its end or through the hole in the bear- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 424, 428]\n\u00a0\n ing cap he could avoid the use of the defective step by standing on the engine room floor and steadying himself by seizing with his right hand the grab iron or the crank-pit guard on his right, or by placing his left hand on the edge of the slush pan.\n No specific instruction was asked or given as to what the verdict should be if the jury concluded that respondent had knowingly made such an election. Instead, the court charged generally 'that the ship owner is under a duty to furnish the seaman with a safe place in which to work' and 'There is no contributory negligence or assumption of risk on the part of a plaintiff in so far as the defendant fails in these duties.' Consequently, there is no basis for disturbing the judgment unless this charge is erroneous as applied to the evidence taken most favorably to petitioner.\n The question whether assumption of risk is a bar to a suit by a seaman to recover under the Jones Act for injuries caused by a defective appliance, when he has a free choice to avoid the use of it, is a novel one in this Court. No such choice was involved in The Arizona or Beadle Cases. There assumption of risk by the seaman, which would have barred recovery at common law, was concededly not a defense under the admiralty rule. The decision was that the Jones Act, in extending to seamen all the rights to recover for injuries resulting from defective appliances given to railway employees by the Federal Employers' Liability Act, 35 Stat. 65, 45 U.S.C.  51 et seq., 45 U.S.C.A.  51 et seq., had left undisturbed the admiralty rule with respect to assumption of risk. In holding that the rule had not been changed, we did not consider the question now presented whether, within that rule, assumption of risk is a defense where the seaman could have avoided the use of the unsafe appliance by the free choice of a safe one.\n Before the Jones Act a seaman was entitled to recover, from a vessel or its owner, indemnity for injuries due to an \n\n[305 \nU.S. 424, 429]\n\u00a0\n unseaworthy vessel, or for 'failure to supply and keep in order the proper appliances appurtenant to the ship.' The Osceola, \n189 \nU.S. 158, 175\n, 23 S. Ct. 483, 487; The Arizona v. Anelich, supra, page 120 et seq ., 56 S.Ct. page 710. Contributory negligence, then as now, was not a defense in suits brought by seamen to recover for injuries attributable to defective equipment, but was ground only for mitigation of damages. See The Max Morris, \n137 \nU.S. 1\n, 11 S.Ct. 29; The Arizona v. Anelich, supra, page 122, 56 S.Ct. page 711, and cases cited. And no American case appears to have recognized assumption of risk as a defense to such a suit. In numerous cases this defense was either denied or ignored in circumstances plainly calling for its application had it been available. Halverson v. Nisen, Fed.Cas.No.5,970, 3 Sawy. 562; The Edith Godden, D.C., 23 F. 43; The Noddleburn, D.C., 28 F. 855; Olson v. Flavel, D.C., 34 F. 477; The A. Heaton, C.C., 43 F. 592; The Julia Fowler, D.C., 49 F. 277; Lafourche Packet Co. v. Henderson, 5 Cir., 94 F. 871; The Fullerton, 9 Cir., 167 F. 1; Globe S.S. Co. v. Moss, 6 Cir., 245 F. 54; The Colusa, 9 Cir., 248 F. 21; Cricket S.S. Co. v. Parry, 2 Cir., 263 F. 523; Storgard v. France and Canada S.S. Corp., 2 Cir., 263 F. 545.\n In some of these cases the seaman had voluntarily shipped on a vessel which he knew to be unseaworthy, Cricket S.S. Co. v. Parry, supra; see Scheffler v. Moran Towing & Transportation Co., 2 Cir., 68 F.2d 11, 12. In others it was apparent that the seaman had chosen to expose himself to the dangers of unsafe appliances when there was a safe alternative. The Julia Fowler, supra; Olson v. Flavel, supra.\n In some cases arising after the Jones Act where the defense was allowed, the employee was thought to have had the status of a stevedore or shore worker and not that of a seaman. The Maharajah, D.C., 40 F. 784; Cunard S.S. Co. v. Smith, 2 Cir., 255 F. 846; Hardie v. New York Harbor Dry Dock Corp., 2 Cir., 9 F.2d 545; Skolar v. Lehigh Valley R.R. Co., 2 Cir., 60 F. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 424, 430]\n\u00a0\n 2d 893; Scheffler v. Moran Towing & Transportation Co., supra, page 12; Yaconi v. Brady & Gioe, Inc., 246 N.Y. 300, 306, 158 N.E. 876. In Johnson v. United States, 2 Cir., 74 F.2d 703, the seaman had made his choice in disobedience of orders, and in another where the defense was allowed the seaman, while not on duty, though in the course of his employment, had chosen to go into an unsafe part of the vessel, knowing that there was an alternative. Holm v. Cities Service Transp. Co., 2 Cir., 60 F.2d 721.1\n Here respondent was a seaman; he was on duty when injured; and there was no evidence that he acted in disobedience of orders. In the absence of any controlling or persuasive authority we look to the reason of the admiralty rule of assumption of risk in order to ascertain its appropriate limits. Many considerations which apply to the liability of a vessel or its owner to a seaman for the failure to provide safe appliances and a safe place to work are absent or are of little weight in the circumstances which attend shore employment, in relation to which the common law rules of assumption of risk and contributory negligence have been developed.\n The seaman, while on his vessel, is subject to the rigorous discipline of the sea and has little opportunity to appeal to the protection from abuse of power which the law makes readily available to the landsman. His complaints to superior officers of unsafe working conditions not infrequently provoke harsh treatment. He cannot leave the vessel while at sea. Abandonment of it in port before his \n\n[305 \nU.S. 424, 431]\n\u00a0\n discharge, to avoid unnecessary dangers of employment, exposes him to the risk of loss of pay and to the penalties for desertion. \n2\n In the performance of duty he is often under the necessity of making quick decisions with little opportunity or capacity to appraise the relative safety of alternative courses of action. Withal, seamen are the wards of the admiralty, whose traditional policy it has been to avoid, within reasonable limits, the application of rules of the common law which would affect them harshly because of the special circumstances attending their calling. The Arizona v. Anelich, supra, page 123, 56 S.Ct. page 711, and cases cited; Calmar Steamship Corporation v. Taylor, \n303 \nU.S. 525\n, 58 S.Ct. 651. It is for this reason that remedial legislation for the benefit and protection of seamen has been liberally construed to attain that end. Chelentis v. Luckenbach S.S. Co., \n247 \nU.S. 372, 380\n, 381 S., 38 S. Ct. 501, 502, 503; Jamison v. Encarnacion, \n281 \nU.S. 635, 639\n, 50 S.Ct. 440, 442; Alpha S.S. Corp. v. Cain, \n281 \nU.S. 642\n, 50 S.Ct. 443; Cortes v. Baltimore Insular Line, \n287 \nU.S. 367, 375\n, 53 S.Ct. 173, 175; Warner v. Goltra, \n293 \nU.S. 155, 157\n, 55 S.Ct. 46, 47.\n Any rule of assumption of risk in admiralty, whatever its scope, must be applied in conjunction with the established admiralty doctrine of comparative negligence and in harmony with it. Under that doctrine contributory negligence, however gross, is not a bar to recovery but only mitigates damages. There being no defense of assumption of risk where the seaman is without opportunity to use a safe appliance, it seems plain that his choice of a defective instead of a safe one, resulting in injury, does not differ in either the quality of the act or in its injurious consequences, in any practical way, from his correspondingly negligent use of a safe or an unsafe appliance, where its use has contributed to an injury resulting from a breach of duty by the owner. See The Wanderer, C.c ., 20 F. 140; The Frank and Willie, D.C., 45 F. 494; \n\n[305 \nU.S. 424, 432]\n\u00a0\n John A. Roebling's Sons Co. v. Erickson, 2 Cir., 261 F. 986, 987; Storgard v. France and Canada S.S. Corp., 2 Cir., 263 F. 545. In either case the seaman's negligence is a contributing cause of his injury, without which the ship owner would be liable to the full extent of the damage.\n The incongruity and practical embarrassments in the application of a rule that the negligence in the one case bars recovery, while that in the other only reduces the recoverable damages, are evident. The common law is consistent in holding that both contributory negligence and assumption of risk are defenses. But other considerations apart, it seems inconsistent, and an impracticable refinement, to apply the rule for which petitioner contends in a system of law which maintains the comparative negligence rule to the fullest extent. This was recognized in Olson v. Flavel, supra, and The Julia Fowler, supra, where the choice by the seaman of an unsafe appliance was held not to bar recovery but to be a proper basis for a substantial reduction of damages because of the negligence of the choice. In The Julia Fowler, supra, the eminent admiralty judge, Addison Brown, held that a seaman who had suffered injury through the deliberate use of a halliard known to be defectively spliced when a sound rope was available was entitled to recover, but with diminution of damages because of his negligence in using the unsafe rope.\n We think that the consistent development of the maritime law in conformity to its traditional policy of affording adequate protection to seamen through an exaction of a high degree of responsibility of owners for the seaworthiness of vessels and the safety of their appliances will be best served by applying the rule of comparative negligence, rather than that of assumption of risk, to the seaman who makes use of a defective appliance knowing that a safe one is available. The power of the trial judge \n\n[305 \nU.S. 424, 433]\n\u00a0\n to guide and instruct the jury and his control over excessive verdicts afford as adequate a protection to owners as in any other case where the negligence of the seaman, whatever its degree, has contributed to an actionable injury.\n Upon the facts of this case, there was no error in the charge of the trial court as to assumption of risk. Its instruction as to the application of the rule of comparative negligence was general and no exception was taken to it. Petitioner would have been entitled to a more specific instruction, if requested, as to the appropriate effect upon the amount of the verdict of the relative degrees of petitioner's and respondent's negligence if the jury should find that respondent had knowingly failed to choose an available safe method of doing his work.\n We leave to future cases as they may arise the determination of what rule is to apply in cases where the seaman's election to use an unsafe appliance is in disobedience of orders or made while not on duty.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS thinks the petitioner's request for the charge in respect of assumption of risk should have been granted and that, for that reason, the challenged judgment should be reversed.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In Tampa Interocean S.S.

CO. v. GALLAGHER(1939)\nNo. 212\nArgued: December 12, 1938Decided: January 30, 1939\n\n\n\n\n[306 \nU.S. 167, 168]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Harry H. McElroy, of San Francisco, Cal., for appellant.\n\n\n\n[306 \nU.S. 167, 170]\n\u00a0\n Mr. H. H. Linney, of San Francisco, Cal., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The California Use Tax Act of 19351 is assailed as violative of the commerce clause and the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S.C.A.Const. art. 1,  8, cl. 3; amend. 14, when imposed upon tangible personal property, bought outside of the state by the Southern Pacific Company, an interstate railroad, and installed on importation, or kept available for use, as a part of its transportation facilities.\n The attack comes by means of a bill of the Southern Pacific Company seeking, before a three-judge district court,2 an interlocutory and final injunction against the State Board of Equalization of California, its members and the Attorney General of the state, to restrain them from enforcing the Use Tax Act. 3 The trial court granted \n\n[306 \nU.S. 167, 171]\n\u00a0\n an interlocutory injunction and denied a motion to dismiss4 but later refused a permanent injunction and sustained the motion to dismiss. \n5\n The case comes here by appeal. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n The Use Tax Act is complemental to the California Retail Sales Tax Act of 1933.7 The latter levies a tax upon the gross receipts of California retailers from sales of tangible personal property; the former8 imposes an excise on the consumer at the same rate for the storage, use or other consumption in the state of such property when purchased from any retailer. As property covered by the sales tax is exempt under the use tax, all tangible personalty sold or utilized in California is taxed once for the support of the state government. Definitions in the Use Tax Act of taxpayer, retailer, storage and use are designed to make the coverage complete. A retailer is 'every person engaged in the business of making sales for storage, use or other consumption'; use is the exercise of any right or power incident to ownership, except sale in the regular course of business; storage is any 'keeping or retention' with a similar exemption; and a taxpayer includes everyone 'storing, using or otherwise consuming' the property subject to the use tax. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n The principle of the use tax as applied to property brought into the state after its retail purchase for intrastate use has been upheld in Henneford v. Silas Mason Co.,10 against the charge that it was a tax upon the operations of interstate commerce or a tax upon a foreign \n\n[306 \nU.S. 167, 172]\n\u00a0\n sale, violative of the Fourteenth Amendment. Under the Washington statute, there considered, discrimination against interstate commerce, arising from a second exaction for use after a foreign tax on sale, could not exist as provision was made for a credit against the local tax of any such foreign levy. No such problem arises here by evidence, finding or assignment of error11 even though the California Act does not have this provision. It will be time enough to resolve that argument 'when a taxpayer paying in the state of origin is compelled to pay again in the state of destination.' 12 A discrimination against goods of out-of-state origin on the face of the sales and use acts is suggested because the local retailer may absorb the sales tax while the consumer of an imported article must pay the use tax. \n13\n But this is not a discrimination in the law. California's exaction for the distribution of tangible personal property is the same, whether purchased within or without her borders or whether paid by the retailer or consumer. There is an equal charge against what is used, whatever its source. In this case we have a distinctly different application of a use tax. The tax is not sought from personal property used in transactions entirely disassociated from any agency connected with interstate transportation, as builders' supplies for local work in the Silas Mason Case, but from tangible personalty purchased out of the state for immediate or subsequent installation in an interstate railway facility.\n The appellant, the Southern Pacific Company, a Kentucky corporation, handles intrastate, interstate and foreign commerce over its railroad system which traverses a number of states and connects with the lines of carriers \n\n[306 \nU.S. 167, 173]\n\u00a0\n covering the continent. The findings and stipulation of facts show continual extrastate purchases of tangible personalty for the operation of the road; rails, equipment, machinery, tools and office supplies. Some of the purchases are used in the general offices of the corporation, located in California, for the supervision of the wide-flung activities; others are for material kept in readiness as a stand-by supply to replace or repair equipment damaged, destroyed or worn out in the operation of the road; and still others are to make improvements, replacements or extensions pursuant to previously determined plans and specifications. Few, if any, of the supplies are stored for long term needs. Storage is merely incidental to protection until use, as office supplies in a closet or an extra frog at a section tool house. For construction or reconstruction upon a large scale, special orders are given and arrangements made, so that the material is fabricated for a particular use in the transportation facilities, shipped to its California destination and installed upon arrival. To avoid delay and cost the movement from loading to final placement is as nearly continuous as managerial efficiency can contrive. While some articles are capable of general use, the major purchases of rails, repair parts and supplies for the maintenance and operation of the system are adapted only to railroad use. The purchases are paid for out of railroad operating capital and move on company material waybills, without transportation charge. All purchases may be said to be dedicated to consumption in the interstate transportation business of appellant. No new rolling stock is involved. Subsequent to repairing and reconditioning, rolling stock moves again in interstate transportation, as do cars after being stocked with supplies. The California tax on storage or use, it is said, cannot apply to these articles, as such a tax would be an unconstitutional burden upon the facilities of interstate commerce, of which the articles are a part. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 167, 174]\n\u00a0\n There is agreement upon the principle involved. Appellant states that an excise tax imposed directly upon the privilege of using instrumentalities in carrying on interstate transportation is a direct and unconstitutional burden on commerce. Appellees do not dispute the premise but contend that the tax is on intrastate storage and use. They point to the definition of use as the exercise of a right of ownership, and of storage as any keeping or retention. By the definitive terms themselves, it is urged, the taxable events are retention and installation, not such storage as warehousing connotes, or use in the sense of consumption or operation. If we conclude retention and installation, under the circumstances here developed, are intrastate taxable events, viewed apart from commerce, we must still inquire whether taxes laid upon them are not, in effect, upon commerce, and forbidden. \n14\n\u00a0\n\n Two lines of authority aid in considering the effect of this tax on commerce. The first makes it quite clear that a state tax upon the privilege of operating in, or upon carrying on, interstate commerce is invalid. States cannot tax interstate telegraph messages,15 or freight shipments. \n16\n A license tax on sales by samples burdens one selling only goods from other states. \n17\n A tax act as applied to the business of interstate communication18 is unconstitutional. Where a similar levy by other states may be imposed, with consequent multiplicity of exaction on commerce for the same taxable event, local tax of a privilege, measured by total gross receipts from interstate transactions, is considered identical with an action on \n\n[306 \nU.S. 167, 175]\n\u00a0\n the commerce itself. 19 This rule is applicable to a tax on gross receipts from interstate transportation;20 an occupation tax measured by gross receipts from radio broadcasting,21 and a general tax at specified rates upon the gross income of every resident, construed as 'a tax upon gross receipts from commerce'22 'without apportionment.' \n23\n The measurement of a tax by gross receipts where it cannot result in a multiplication of the levies is upheld. \n24\n\u00a0\n\n Appellant selects from this line the Helson Case25 as determinative of the contention that a tax on use of supplies or equipment is a tax on the commerce. A state tax of three cents per gallon was imposed on all gasoline 'sold at wholesale.' This phrase was defined to include gasoline bought out of the state and used within the state. There was no definition of the word use or used. The taxpayers operated an interstate ferry, purchased gasoline in Ohio and used that portion sought to be taxed in propelling their craft in the territorial waters of Kentucky. That court considered the tax on the consumption of the fas the same as a tax on the operation of the ferry \n\n[306 \nU.S. 167, 176]\n\u00a0\n boat and therefore invalid under the rule discussed in the preceding paragraph.\n The second line of authority supports the view that use and storage as defined in the California act are taxable intrastate events, separate and apart from interstate commerce. A recent discussion of the topic sets out the precedents in support of a ruling that a tax upon the production of power by the use of which compressors drove natural gas in interstate commerce is valid. Such production is a taxable event distinct from its consumption in commerce. \n26\n Particular attention is called by the state to the Wallace Case. \n27\n There the tax was on 'selling or storing or distributing gasoline.' It became due on withdrawal from storage. The tax was held applicable to gasoline, purchased out of the state and stored in the state, when 'all is withdrawn and used ... as a source of motive power in interstate railway operation' and valid against the objection that 'it is in effect a tax upon the use' in interstate commerce. \n28\n The invalidity of such a tax arises from a levy on commerce itself or its gross receipts, not upon events prior to the commerce. \n29\n\u00a0\n\n The principle illustrated by the Helson Case forbids a tax upon commerce or consumption in commerce. The Wallace Case, and precedents analogous to it, permit state taxation of events preliminary to interstate commerce. The validity of any application of a taxing act depends upon a classification of the facts in the light of these theories. In the present case some of the articles were ordered out of the state under specification suitable only for utilization in the transportation facilities and installed \n\n[306 \nU.S. 167, 177]\n\u00a0\n immediately on arrival at the California destination. If articles so handled are deemed to have reached the end of their interstate transit upon 'use or storage,' no further inquiry is necessary as to the rest of the articles which are subjected to a rentention, by comparison, farther removed from interstate commerce. We think there was a taxable moment when the former had reached the end of their interstate transportation and had not begun to be consumed in interstate operation. At that moment, the tax on storage and use-retention and exercise of a right of ownership, respectively-was effective. The interstate movement was complete. The interstate consumption had not begun. Champlain Realty Co. v. Brattleboro 30 and Carson Petroleum Co. v. Vial31 are therefore inapplicable. Bacon v. Illinois,32 where taxation of grain during stoppage in transit was validated, presents a closer analogy. 'Practical continuity' does not always make an act a part of interstate commerce. \n33\n This conclusion does not give preponderance to the language of the state act over its effect on commerce. State taxes upon national commerce or its incidents do not depend for their validity upon a choice of words but upon the choice of the thing taxed. It is true, the increased cost to the interstate operator from a tax on installation is the same as from a tax on consumption or operation. This is not significant. \n34\n The prohibited burden upon commerce between the states is created by state interference with that commerce, a matter distinct from the expense of doing \n\n[306 \nU.S. 167, 178]\n\u00a0\n business. A discrimination against it, or a tax on its operations as such, is an interference. A tax on property or upon a taxable event in the state, apart from operation, does not interfere. This is a practical adjustment of the right of the state to revenue from the instrumentalities of commerce and the obligation of the state to leave the regulation of interstate and foreign commerce to the Congress.\n But it is urged by the appellant that our former opinions make this conclusion a departure from precedent; the events are so close to or so inseparably intertwined with interstate commerce, as to be a part of it. \n35\n Cooney v. Mountain States Telephone Co.36 is cited to show that a 'state excise tax cannot be validly applied indiscriminately and without apportionment to an instrumentality common to interstate and intrastate commerce.' The Telephone Company was taxed a sum on each telephone in use. As the instrument was employed part of the time in interstate commerce, this Court held the tax to be upon that commerce and invalid. Since there was no apportionment the entire tax fell. Unless the taxable events here, all of which are intrastate, are in effect a part of interstate commerce, our previous discussion of their separable character would render the Cooney Case inapplicable. For this point we are referred to Puget Sound Co. v. Tax Commission37 and Ozark Pipe Line Corp. v. Monier. \n38\n\u00a0\n\n In the former case, the distinction in the opinion between stevedoring in loading and unloading interstate cargoes, held nontaxable as a burden upon commerce, and the business of supplying longshoremen for others to load and unload, held taxable as a local business is \n\n[306 \nU.S. 167, 179]\n\u00a0\n applicable here. The invalid tax in the Puget Sound Case was on the business of stevedoring, measured by a percentage of gross receipts from interstate activity. The valid tax was a similar percentage on the local activity as an employment agency. Here, under our analysis, we find only intrastate events taxed. \n39\n\u00a0\n\n In the Ozark Case, Missouri sought to justify a franchise tax on a company engaged in the operation of an interstate pipe line by suggesting the tax was upon certain intrastate events, such as operation of communications, repair and purchase of supplies. The tax was forbidden because on the privilege of doing an exclusively interstate business. The opinion is to be read in the light of the statement by the Court of its interpretation of the facts and legal deductions which control its decision. The Missouri Act called for a franchise tax of a percentage of the par of its stock, apportioned to its assets in that state. This Court said that 'the tax is one upon the privilege or right to do business,' and as the taxpayer 'is engaged only in interstate commerce' the tax 'constitutionally cannot be imposed.' There was then added this paragraph:\n'The maintenance of an office, the purchase of supplies, employment of labor, maintenance and operation of telephone and telegraph lines and automobiles, and appellant's other acts within the state, were all exclusively in furtherance of its interstate business, and the property itself, however extensive or of whatever character, was likewise devoted only to that end. They were the means and instrumentalities by which that business was done and in no proper sense constituted, or con- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 167, 180]\n\u00a0\n tributed to, the doing of a local business. The protection against imposition of burdens upon interstate commerce is practical and substantial and extends to whatever is necessary to the complete enjoyment of the right protected.'40\n\n This Court pointed out that the corporation had a license to engage exclusively in interstate business. \n41\n The language just quoted shows that this Court interpreted the transactions in Missouri as merely a part of the interstate commerce and the tax on the franchise an interference therewith because a tax directly upon it. \n42\n '... nothing was done in Missouri except in furtherance of transportation.' \n43\n It was this conclusion of the Court on the factual situation which brought about the Ozark decision. Where there is also intrastate activity, an apportioned state franchise tax on foreign corporations doing an interstate business is upheld. \n44\n A franchise tax on an exclusively interstate business is a direct burden; proportioned to an intermingled business, it is valid. \n45\n Since the incidence of the California tax as here interpreted is upon events outside of interstate commerce, the Ozark opinion is not applicable. There the Missouri tax was upon activities found wholly interstate.\n Finally, appellants urge that the tax violates the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because exacted for consumption of office and car supplies outside the state, upon their appropriation in California by the general office to the use of the whole system. \n46\n This con- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 167, 181]\n\u00a0\n tention falls with the determination that the taxable event is the exercise of the property right in California. This Court declined to accept a similar argument in the Silas Mason Company Case. \n47\n\u00a0\n\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice BLACK concurs in the result.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and I are of opinion that the judgment should be reversed.\n The facts stated in the opinion just announced leave nothing of substance to support its conclusion that the California tax is not upon the operation-maintenance and use-of appellant's railroad for interstate transportation. Discussion can neither obscure nor more plainly disclose the truth that the tax in question directly burdens commerce among the States. Concededly, that is repugnant to the commerce clause as, from the beginning, it has been construed by this Court. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Cal.Stats.1935, ch. 361, p. 1297. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Sec. 266, Jud.Code, 28 U.S.C.A.  380. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] As the bill was filed July 10, 1936, there was jurisdiction. 50 Stat. 738, 28 U.S.C.A.  41(1, 1a). \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Southern Pac.

UNITED STATES(1939)\nNo. 613\nArgued: March 29, 1939Decided: May 29, 1939\n\n\n\n Mr. James R. Bell, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 393, 394]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Sam E. Whitaker, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case involves the right of the Government to deduct from the public terminal-to-terminal tariffs of a railroad over a route, partly of land-grant aided mileage, identical with part of the mileage of another earlier constructed route of the same road between the same terminals, sums based upon the higher proportion of land-grant aided mileage in this latter route. On account of the importance of the question in administration, certiorari was granted. \n1\n\u00a0\n306 \nU.S. 625\n, 59 S.Ct. 586, 83 L. Ed. --.\n The carrier owns and operates two lines of railroad between Portland, Oregon, and Roseville, California, and Davis, California, both southern points being on the Central Pacific, now the Southern Pacific, Railroad in California. From the California junctions, there is direct connection over the same Southern Pacific rails into San Francisco. The older line is called the Siskiyou, the newer the Cascade Route. For a considerable portion of the distance between Portland and San Francisco, the two routes are identical. There are two differences; one is between Eugene, Oregon, and Black Butte, California. On \n\n[307 \nU.S. 393, 395]\n\u00a0\n the west the Siskiyou Route passes through Grant's Pass and Siskiyou, a distance of 300 miles, to connect Eugene and Black Butte. The eastern, or Cascade Route, joins the same two points by a shorter (275 miles) line through Natron and Klamath Falls. The second deviation is between Tehama, California, and Davis and Roseville respectively. Here the Siskiyou Route is to the east, 104 miles long, and the Cascade Route to the west, 110 miles.\n Where the routes are identical, some of the mileage is land-grant aided. Some is not. The mileage of the Siskiyou which is different from the Cascade is largely land-grant aided. None of the Cascade Route, except where it uses the same rails as the Siskiyou, has land grants. Based on the proportion of aided mileage and the percentage of deduction allowed to the Government from the tariffs charged private shippers, the United States, between San Francisco and Portland, is entitled to a land-grant deduction via the Siskiyou Route of 42.792 per cent. Via the Cascade Route, the deduction is 17.801 per cent. There are slight variations for East Portland.\n During December, 1931, and January, 1932, the carrier transported, in both directions, certain property of the United States on Government bills of lading from Portland or East Portland to San Francisco. No directions were given by the Government as to the routes over which the shipments were to move. While before November 11, 1931, the terminal-to-terminal rates over the two routes were the same, after that date authorized revisions resulted in a rate competitive with water borne commerce over the Cascade and a higher rate over the Siskiyou. These public tariffs were so much lower over the Cascade than they were over the Siskiyou Route, that the net cost to the Government, after the deductions \n\n[307 \nU.S. 393, 396]\n\u00a0\n deemed applicable by the railroad, was less over the Cascade than it was over the Siskiyou, despite the higher percentage of deduction allowed the latter route.\n The Government was billed on the Cascade tariffs with deductions for land-grant mileage of about 17 per cent. It paid on the basis of the Cascade tariffs but deducted on the ratio of the land-grant to total miles between the terminals on the Siskiyou Route, or some 42 per cent. The Government claims that it is entitled to the lowest rate, between the terminals, less the percentage of deduction over the original land-grant aided route. The carrier protested and brought this action in the Court of Claims to recover the difference between the Cascade tariffs less the Cascade ratio of land-grant mileage and that paid by the Government, the Cascade tariffs less the Siskiyou ratio. The Court of Claims, after making special findings of fact, adjudged that the carrier was not entitled to recover and dismissed its petition.\n The Government obtained concessions from the established tariffs by virtue of the acceptance by the carrier of grants of land, ten alternate sections per mile on each side of the line, to aid in the construction of a railroad as described in the statute authorizing the conveyance. \n2\n This statute was similar in form to the land grant construed in Burke v. Southern Pacific Railroad Company3 and upon compliance with its requirements became a contract, 'obligatory on both'4 the carrier and Government. The carrier agreed it should 'be and remain a public highway for the use of the government of the United States, free of all toll or other charges upon the transportation of the property or troops of the United States; and the same shall be transported over said road at the cost, charge, \n\n[307 \nU.S. 393, 397]\n\u00a0\n and expense of the corporations or companies owning or operating the same, when so required by the government of the United States.' The authorization was 'to lay out, locate, construct, finish, and maintain a railroad and telegraph line between the city of Portland, in Oregon, and the Central Pacific Railroad, in California ....' The road was located in accordance with these requirements.\n In December, 1887, the Siskiyou Route was finished. The road running from its southern terminus at Roseville to San Francisco had been finished in 1870. This gave a through route from San Francisco to Portland, 774.16 miles long with 663.16 land-grant aided. The Cascade Route was built later in small sections primarily for local service or links in other projected distinct railroad undertakings. The California deviation from the Siskiyou between Tehama and Davis was finished in 1882. The Oregon section, forming with that portion of the Siskiyou an irregular ovoid figure, was put together between 1905 and 1926, being completed September first of the latter year. This route is 725.03 miles between Portland and San Francisco with 258.13 miles built with grants in aid. Each route is necessary for adequate transportation service to the areas traversed. At the time of the completion of the Cascade and until November 10, 1931, the tariffs over the two routes between the terminals were the same.\n On May 23, 1928, there was enacted an act for the relief of the land- grant railroad operated between East Portland, Oregon, and Roseville, California. 5 As Rose- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 393, 398]\n\u00a0\n ville is the junction terminal of the Siskiyou and is not served by the Cascade, this description covers only the Siskiyou line built under the 1866 act. By its terms, the Government relinquished its privilege of free transportation and accepted in lieu thereof a right to the same rate as is paid to other land-grant roads. This is fifty per cent of the public tariff for land-grant aided mileage. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n The Act of 1866, granting the aid, specified, only generally, the route of the new road. It was to begin at some point on the Central Pacific Railroad in the Sacramento Valley and thence run northerly to Portland. By the grant of millions of acres of public lands, the Government prepaid for transportation 7 over the line, wherever it might be built. It was entitled to service for its property or troops without further cost from whomsoever owned or operated the aided facility between the Central Pacific and Portland. 8 By the 1928 act, the Government agreed, for the 'relief of the land-grant' road, to put it upon the same basis as other land-grant roads. By this concession, no change was made in the extent of the obligation to give land-grant service.\n The two acts are quite clear in their requirement that the company which constructed the road or its successors in ownership or operation should transport the property \n\n[307 \nU.S. 393, 399]\n\u00a0\n or troops of the United States over the railroad at the rate fixed by their provisions. The uncertainty as to the meaning arises in the application of the right of transportation to the mileage. On completion of the original project between Portland and the Central Pacific, there was a definite right of way, the present Siskiyou Route, with every mile between East Portland and the Central Pacific aided by land grants. This same situation existed as to all or parts of other bond or land aided roads. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n[307 \nU.S. 393, 400]\n\u00a0\n Soon there were changes and shortening of these lines. The Government was faced with the problem of the proper ratio of land-grant or bond-aided deductions or allocations to be applied where new non-aid mileage is used between terminals formerly served in a higher proportion by land-grant mileage. Cut-offs and the elimination of curves furnished occasion for these decisions. Thus in 1888 in a ruling as to transportation services rendered by the Central Pacific Railroad, where the Central had three lines from Sacramento to San Francisco, with varying bond-aided mileages, the Comptroller of the Treasury ruled, when the road sought to render statements for the line actually used, that all United States accounts should be stated in terms of the bond-aided mileage of the original route. As the amounts due to the carrier were applied to retirement of the bonds in aid, this ruling preserved the charges for this purpose. This ruling has been \n\n[307 \nU.S. 393, 401]\n\u00a0\n followed in roads aided by land grants. \n10\n The long continued administrative interpretation has decided weight in reaching a conclusion upon the construction of this contract,11 particularly when the Congress after such interpretation gives up a right for free transportation between the terminals. Any doubt must be resolved in favor of the Government. \n 12\n\u00a0\n\n The construction adopted in the Court of Claims was reached in United States v. Northern Pac. Ry. Co.13 where there was a shortening of 94.24 miles in the through route between St. Paul and Seattle by means of a cut- off. In that case, too, the old route was maintained for local use.\n It is urged, however, that in this instance we have a new line, an addition, rather than a cut-off in or a shortening or straightening of an original line. 14 So far as terminal-to-terminal transportation is concerned, the Cascade Route does not function as a new line or an addition. It is simply another way carrying goods by the same railroad between San Francisco and Portland. By which route the shipment moves, is immaterial on the question of deduction for land grants. The conclusion that the lowest public tariffs are to have land-grant deductions \n\n[307 \nU.S. 393, 402]\n\u00a0\n based upon the proportion of the land-grant mileage in the original line, seems consonant with the purpose of the acts.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER, dissenting.\n The land-grant Act of July 25, 1866, and compliance with it constitute a contract. \n1\n This case calls for construction of a provision in  5.2 The court of claims sustained the government's deduction on account of land-grant mileage that is not included in or possibly attributable to the railroad over which the shipments moved. The inclusion, as a part of the aided railroad, of 275.6 miles of the Cascade Route between Springfield Junction, Oregon and Black Butte, California, is not permissible \n\n[307 \nU.S. 393, 403]\n\u00a0\n under the terms of the contract, nor is computation of the land-grant deduction from charges for transportation via Cascade on the percentage applicable to charges for transportation via Siskiyou warranted by constructions heretofore put upon like Acts. See (below) reproduction of map submitted as an exhibit at the argument in this Court.\n\n\n I. \n\n\nThe grant was made to induce and aid construction of a railroad between Portland and some point to be selected by the grantees on the Central Pacific to serve the Willamette, Umqua, and Rogue River Valleys in Oregon, and the Sacramento and Shasta Valleys in California, and to be located as shown on maps made by the grantees and filed with the Secretary of the Interior. The railroad was located and constructed, and, since its completion in 1887, has been maintained and kept in use, in accordance with the contract. The aided portion is 663.13 miles long, extending between East Portland, Oregon and Roseville, California, a point on the Central Pacific east of Sacramento and about 111 miles from San Francisco. It is now called the Siskiyou Route.\n Section 5 declares that the grantees shall keep 'said railroad' in repair and use; that it shall be 'a public highway' for the use of the United States; and that property and troops of the United States shall be transported over 'said road' at the cost, charge, and expense of the corporations or companies owning or operating 'the same', when so required by the government.\n Plainly the contract applies only to the land-aided railroad between Portland and Roseville; not to the haul between Portland and San Francisco, nor to that between Roseville and San Francisco. The contract neither expresses nor implies any special undertaking by the carrier as to charges for government transportation be- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 393, 403]\n\u00a0\n-Continued\n PLAINTIFF'S EXHIBIT NO. 23. \n\u00a0\n tween the port or terminal of Portland and that of San Francisco.\n The Act of May 23, 19283 merely substitutes 50 per cent of the commercial charges for free transportation under  5. Thus, as modified, the Act of 1866 requires plaintiff to furnish government transportation between points on and wholly via the land-grant railroad for one-half the charges applicable to like service for private parties. And for government transportation between a point on the aided railroad and one on another line there is deducted from charges generally made one-half the percentage that aided mileage attributable to that service is of the total miles hauled.\n The Cascade stretch was not completed until 1926 and, as shown by the findings, it is made up of branches extended during a number of years prior to 1912 little by little from Black Butte to Kirk to reach productive forest and agricultural areas. See Diagram 1, following page. At its northerly end a short piece from Springfield Junction to Natron was completed in 1891; in 1912 that branch was built to Oakridge to serve timber areas on both sides of the Cascades and ultimately to be a part \n\n[307 \nU.S. 393, 405]\n\u00a0\n of a line connecting with the Central Pacific in Nevada or with the Union Pacific in eastern Oregon. These systems re then under one control. About the same time-1911-1914-plaintiff built from Fernley, Nevada, a point on the Central Pacific, northwesterly to Westwood, California to serve industries there. Consummation of the project to complete the line between Fernley and Springfield Junction via Natron, Oakridge, Kirk, and Klamath Falls was delayed because of the suit brought in 1908 under the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, 15 U.S.C.A.  1-7, 15 note, by the United States in the Circuit Court for the district of Utah (see United States v. Union P.R. Co ., 188 F. 102), which resulted in decree dissolving control by the Union Pacific of the Southern Pacific. United States v. Union Pacific R.R. Co., \n226 \nU.S. 61\n, 33 S.Ct. 53. In 1929, with the approval of the Interstate Commerce Commission, plaintiff completed the connection between Springfield Junction and Fernley to form a part of the through route between Portland, Salt Lake City, and points east.\n The court of claims found that since the completion of the Cascade stretch 'plaintiff has had and now has two complete lines of railroad or routes in Oregon and northern California, one the Siskiyou route ... serving the valleys and areas described ... producing much tonnage of timber, agricultural products, livestock, etc., and the other the Cascade route ... also serving large timber areas and agricultural and livestock producing areas, each of these lines of railroad serving producing areas quite generally at all points. Plaintiff has maintained the Siskiyou route, transporting a substantial and varied traffic and serving a large and important area. The Siskiyou route and the Cascade route are two separate and distinct routes or lines of railroad, necessary for adequate transportation service to the interested areas or territories traversed by such lines.'\n [405-Continued]\n DIAGRAM 1.\n\n\u00a0\n The stretch of railroad between Spring-field Junction and Black Butte via Siskiyou, all land-aided, is 300.42 miles long; it is used for through transportation and also serves locally in the Willamette, Umqua, and Rogue River Valleys. All land-aided mileage in that route continuously has been operated and maintained for the service of the public, including transportation of property and troops of the United States. The stretch between the same points via Cascade, none of it land-aided, is 275.6 miles long, most of which is east of the Cascade Mountains. It also carries through and local traffic. To illustrate how unreasonable and arbitrary it is to attribute that mileage to the aided railroad built, as required by the Act of 1866, to open and develop the great valleys west of the mountains, let it be noted that except at and near the connecting points, Springfield Junction and Black Butte, these stretches serve widely separated territories of vast extent; the area between them is greater than that of the State of Massachusetts. The mileage of the Cascade stretch is greater than the distance between Washington and West Point via New York City. The mileage of the Siskiyou stretch is substantially the same as the distance between Washington and Pittsburg.\n Upon completion of the Siskiyou Route, plaintiff established through rates between Oregon and California points; in order to meet competition of water carriers, it was compelled to make rates between Portland and San Francisco lower than rates between intermediate points. In 1912, after enactment of the long and short haul clause of  4, Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C.A.  4, the Commission permitted the maintenance of lower through rates; it found they were forced by water competition and were lower than normal, fair and reasonable rates. In 1920,  4 was again amended to require the Commission to find that the lower through rates permitted by it were reasonably com- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 393, 407]\n\u00a0\n pensatory. In 1927, the Commission, upon plaintiff's showing of operating costs on the Siskiyou Route, found that the through rates were less than reasonable and granted authority to establish rates between the terminals lower than intermediate rates but so much higher than the competing water rates that plaintiff could not share in the business. The Commission thereafter reopened the case. In order to show the reasonably compensatory nature of the lower through rates, plaintiff based its showing on the more favorable transportation conditions and substantially lower operating costs on the Cascade Route. Pursuant to the Commission's report and order of July, 1930, the plaintiff revised its tariffs effective November 11, 1931. The low through rates on the Siskiyou Route were discontinued and higher rates in accord with  4 were substituted. Much lower rates, to meet water competition, were established via the Cascade Route as to transportation of about 25 per cent of all articles that move between the cities of Portland and San Francisco. During the period between completion of the Cascade Route and the effective date of the new rates, the through rates were the same via both routes.\n The aided mileage in the Siskiyou Route, 663.16 miles, between Portland and San Francisco, is 85.584 per cent of the total. The aided mileage in the Cascade Route is 258.13 miles, or 35.602 per cent of the total. Charges for the shipments in question applicable via the Cascade Route, less 17.801 per cent (one-half of the per cent of land-grant mileage to total) are substantially less than those via Siskiyou, less 42. 792 per cent. The government did not expressly direct the shipments in question to be hauled over the Cascade Route but it did in fact choose to have them go that way. It was plaintiff's duty to send them over the route on which the charges would be lower. The government refused to pay more than \n\n[307 \nU.S. 393, 408]\n\u00a0\n the lower rates applicable via Cascade minus the land-grant deduction of 42.792 per cent applicable to the higher charges over the Siskiyou Route.\n The findings compel the conclusions that the Cascade stretch between Springfield Junction and Black Butte was not built to better alignment or lessen grades of, add trackage to or otherwise improve, the landaided stretch via Siskiyou between the same points; that it was made up of branches and extensions constructed from time to time to develop productive areas, to serve local needs and, upon completion, to be a separate and distinct railroad between Springfield Junction and Black Butte, a part of which was also to serve as a section of the transcontinental route above referred to. Clearly it is not a part of the railroad aided by the grant of 1866. It was not constructed to aid transportation on, or as a substitute for, any part of the aided railroad. The fact that it is used to haul government shipments like those in question does not suggest any failure of plaintiff fully to perform the land-grant contract to maintain and keep in use the aided railroad between Portland and Roseville. There is nothing in the grant, or in the circumstances under which it was made and complied with, that gives any support to the government's claim that, from the lower charges applicable to shipments by private parties via Cascade, it is entitled to deduct the higher land-grant percentage applicable to transportation via Siskiyou.\n II. The opinion of the court of claims shows its judgment to have been reached on an assumption of fact that is not sustained by the findings or otherwise supported. It says: 'The method of settlement with plaintiff used by the General Accounting Office in this case has been consistently and uniformly followed by the defendant's ac- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 393, 409]\n\u00a0\n counting officers for more than fifty years in cases involving the same or similar questions.'\n There is no finding to that effect, but to support the statement the opinion continues: 'The principle was stated by the Second Comptroller of the Treasury in a decision April 17, 1888, as follows: 'If a railroad have a line between two points, aided in whole or in part, and subsequently acquire a new line or lines nonaided between those same points, the accounts for Government transportation, when performed over the new line or lines, shall be stated in the same proportion of aided to nonaided miles as though the transportation were over the original line.\"\n The decision referred to has not been reported or anywhere published. It may be found on file in the General Accounting Office, Miscellaneous Claims Division, Vol. 55, p. 422. The passage above-quoted is one of two sentences excerpted from different parts of the document and together published, without more, as paragraph 1160, Vol. 3, p. 299 of Kern's 1893 Digest of Decisions of the Second Comptroller of the Treasury. \n4\n As counsel failed to make available to us the unreported text of the decision, it is assumed that nothing more than the statement in the Digest was brought to the attention of the lower court.\n To give weight to the Second Comptroller's dictum and justify its application to this case, the lower court adds: 'This rule as stated has been uniformly observed in the settlement of accounts for government transportation of property and troops of the United States, and has been applied in settlement of accounts for transportation ren- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 393, 410]\n\u00a0\n dered the Government where through service has been rendered by a shorter line substituted in whole or in part for the longer aided and original line. See stipulations of the parties in United States v. Northern Pacific Ry. Co., 8 Cir., 30 F.2d 655. This long established rule has been acquiesced in by land-grant railroads generally and was acquiesced in by this plaintiff during the period between the completion of its Cascade line in 1926 to 1931 when its accounts against the Government for the transportation of Government property were settled in this manner. It was not until the shipments involved in this suit were moved that plaintiff made protest against the position of the Government. We do not regard the fact the rates between San Francisco and Portland were the same over both routes between 1926 and 31 as material or altering in any way the principle involved.'\n As to that passage, it is to be observed:\n The opinion states that the rule, said to have been established by administrative practice, has been applied to transportation rendered by a 'shorter line substituted in whole or in part for the longer aided and original line.' The court definitely found that the Cascade stretch is a line separate and distinct from the aided railroad. It was not substituted for or used in lieu of the Siskiyou Route. It was chosen by or for the government because applicable charges, whatever the basis of calculation of land grant deductions, were less than those for like transportation via the other stretch.\n The cited stipulation between the Northern Pacific Railway and the United States cannot here be made to serve in lieu of special findings of fact. \n5\n Moreover, as \n\n[307 \nU.S. 393, 411]\n\u00a0\n will be shown, the circuit court of appeals in that case held against the carrier on the ground that new unaided mileage had been substituted for aided mileage in the original route. That case makes strongly in favor of plaintiff here, for the findings of the court of claims show that no part of the original aided railroad had been abandoned as to the traffic in question or otherwise.\n The lower court's statement that, from the completion of the Cascade stretch in 1926 until the shipments here involved, plaintiff acquiesced in the rule adopted by the court is not supported by the findings. But, even if warranted, it is without significance for the question presented in this case did not and could not arise while the rates applicable between Portland and San Francisco were the same.\n III. The court of claims failed to find as fact that the government followed, or the carriers accepted as sound, the dictum excerpted by Kern from the decision of the Second Comptroller of April 17, 1888. To supply the omission, the government cites in its brief, without adequate statement of the facts or explanation, all administrative rulings and judicial decisions it deems to have any bearing on the question now before us. The former are referred to in footnote 10 of this Court's opinion. \n6\n Here the material substance of each will be indicated. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 393, 412]\n\u00a0\n 1. Ruling of April 17, 1888, by Second Comptroller of the Treasury, Butler. At that time, the Central Pacific had three lines between Sacramento and San ancisco. They are indicated on Diagram 2, following page. Route 1, via Brighton, Tracy and Niles was the original railroad, 140 miles, of which 103 were bond-aided. Route 2 via Davis and Port Costa, 90 miles, had no aided mileage. Route 3 via Brighton, Tracy, and Port Costa was 151 miles, of which 63 belonged to the bond-aided stretch in Route 1. The bonds in aid were given under the Act of July 1, 1862, 12 Stat. 489, 494. See also amendatory Acts of July 2, 1864, 13 Stat. 356, and May 7, 1878, 20 Stat. 56. Section 6 declares that the aid grants are made on condition that the company shall keep the railroad in repair and use, transport troops and property of the government 'at fair and reasonable rates of compensation, not to exceed the amounts paid by private parties for the same kind of service,' and that all compensation for that transportation shall be applied to the payment of the bonds. For a time immediately preceding the Second Comptroller's decision, the government stated the accounts of the company as though all shipments had been hauled over Route 1. The railroad maintained that payment should be made in accordance with the bond-aided mileage in the route used. Thus arose the issue decided.\n The bond-aid contract had been construed to require the Treasury to retain the compensation for government transportation over bond-aided mileage and to apply it in payment of the bonds. United States v. Kansas Pac. Railway Co., \n99 \nU.S. 455\n; United States v. Central Pacific R.R. Co., \n118 \nU.S. 235\n, 6 S.Ct. 1038. These cases definitely established that compensation for government transportation over nonaided extensions of the aided railroads should not be withheld or applied to pay the bond debt. But the Sec- [412-Continued]\n DIAGRAM 2.\n\n\u00a0\n ond Comptroller held that rule not applicable. He found that accounting officers were required by the Act to determine whether the rates are 'fair and reasonable' and stated the problem thus: 'Given a certain state of facts, what is the service rendered by the railroad, and what is a fair and reasonable compensation therefor?'\n More specifically to disclose the point, the Second Comptroller referred to the contractual relations between the government and the carriers, and asked himself: 'Are those relations impaired by the railroad, if it pursues the course which in the present case it contends to be right?' He answered affirmatively and to sustain that view reasoned as follows: To reimburse itself the government may withhold compensation for 'carriage over an aided line.' The security is impaired if the railroad 'parallels or duplicates an aided line between two points and diverts the government business to that line without in some way recognizing its indebtedness to the government.' \n7\n\u00a0\n\n Then, granting that on strictest legal construction of the statutes and of the decisions of this Court there was nothing to preclude such a course by the railroad, the Second Comptroller went on to say: 'But the principles of equity and ethics forbid the application of such a construction.' Invoking the maxim 'He that seeks equity must do equity' as being 'most forcibly pertinent,' he declared that so long as the railroad is indebted to the government on account of the bond-aided line, it must \n\n[307 \nU.S. 393, 414]\n\u00a0\n not imperil the government's opportunity to recoup, and concluded that all accounts, without regard to the route used, should be stated upon the basis of bond-aided mileage.\n The company claimed that acquisition of Route 2 was necessary because it threatened the existence of the Central Pacific and that Route 3 was acquired for convenience because it had better grades than the original line. It argued that the Government had an interest in the new lines and should be willing to pay entire compensation for carriage over them. Against that contention the Second Comptroller said: 'But the acquiring or building by a railroad of new lines connecting two points already connected by the road of the company is one of the ordinary elements of modern railroading, intended to enhance the usefulness of the original line, in the same way as does the replacing of iron by steel rails, or wooden by stone buildings, of handbrakes by automatic appliances. \n8\n Is the Government to lose its right of withholding compensation for carriage over a trestle, the construction of which in wood it aided, simply because the railroad has seen fit to replace the wooden structure by one of iron?'\n He denounced as untenable both the position of the government and that of the company, and declared 'that a medium course is not only practicable and equitable, but is justified under the Acts ... by the changed and apparently unanticipated condition of affairs since the construction of the railroad was contemplated.' He suggested that the company should recognize that the government's security should not be impaired by a duplicating line, and that the government should recognize such an improvement of route as materially lessens distance or difficulties of transportation between two points. Then reasoning in more definite terms, he said: \n\n[307 \nU.S. 393, 415]\n\u00a0\n 'If the original line ..., 140 miles in length, were entirely aided, and the Government's supplies were taken over the new and unaided line, 90 miles in length, it would not be right on the one hand for the railroad to demand actual compensation for the 90 miles, or, on the other hand, for the Government to maintain that the account should be adjusted on a basis of 140 miles and that amount passed to the credit of the railroad on the Government's books. The non-aided line was used to replace the aided line, and credit for the 90 miles only should be given the railroad on the Government's books. The same reasoning applies when the original line was aided in part.\n'If of the original 140 miles ... 103 were aided, and the accounts were so stated as to pay the railroad for 37 miles and carry 103 miles to the railroad's credit, the same ratio should be applied when transportation is over a new line between those points and 103\/140 of the total distance traversed should be considered as aided and should be carried to the railroad's credit on the Government's books, compensation for the balance of 37\/140 being paid direct to the railroad.'\n\n Following these passages the Second Comptroller said: 'If a railroad have a line between two points, aided in whole or in part, and subsequently acquire a new line or lines nonaided between those same points, the accounts for Government transportation, when performed over the new line or lines, shall be stated in the same proportion of aided to nonaided miles, as though the transportation were over the original line.' This is the statement found in par. 1160, 3 Dig.2d Comp. 299, on which the court of claims grounded its judgment.\n Applying the generalization so attempted he ruled: 'On this basis the accounts of the railroad coming to this bureau will be finally settled. I am of the opinion that \n\n[307 \nU.S. 393, 416]\n\u00a0\n substantial justice would thus be done-the railroad would not impair the security of the Government, and the Government would recognize the right of the railroad to make improvements.'\n The crucial phrase of the generalization, 'a new line or lines nonaided', would include mileage that is separate and distinct from an aided railroad maintained and kept in use between the same points. But the Second Comptroller, on the grounds that acquisition of new lines was the same as making additions and betterments to the original aided line and that Routes 2 and 3 were used to replace Route 1, treated the lines constituting the three routes as a single railroad bond-aided to the extent of 103\/140 of its length. 9 It thus appears that the broad generalization does not express the principle of the decision or fit the situation described by it as mere betterment of the line built pursuant to the bond-aid contract.\n The decision does not relate to the question in this case. Plaintiff does not contend that, if aided mileage of the Siskiyou stretch not used may be attributed to the Cascade stretch that was used to do the hauling in question, the corresponding percentage, 42.792 per cent, should not be applied. Plaintiff's point is that the findings preclude the assignment of any aided mileage to the nonaided Cascade stretch. The text of the Second Comptroller's decision shows that he did not decide or deal with any such issue.\n\n 2. \nRuling of January 5, 1899 by Acting Comptroller Mitchell in a Southern Pacific case, V Dec. of Comp. of \n\n[307 \nU.S. 393, 417]\n\u00a0\n Treas. 364. See Diagram 2. A government clerk traveled to Sacramento via Stockton. A part of the route used was bond-aided. He returned via Benicia on the shorter and usually traveled nonaided route. The question was whether payment should be made to the company for transportation over the nonaided route. This decision merely follows the uncalled for and inapplicable generalization attempted by Second Comptroller Butler in the Central Pacific case.\n\n 3. \nRuling of November 19, 1900 by Assistant Comptroller Mitchell in an Illinois Central case, VII Dec. of Comp. of Treas. 224. See Diagram 3. The company operated a land-aided railroad between Cairo and Chicago. It had two routes for passenger travel between Cairo and St. Louis: the shorter via Carbondale and Pinckneyville, had some unaided mileage; the longer, via Du Quoin, was aided throughout. The government having failed to designate either route and the shorter being the usually traveled one over which all through trains operated, the company carried the government passenger that way. The question was whether the land-grant deduction should be calculated on the percentage of land-aided mileage in the route used or on the greater percentage in the other route. Assistant Comptroller Mitchell did not follow the general statement of Second Comptroller Butler in the Central Pacific case but held that, as the government did not choose between the routes, the deduction should be calculated on the mileage used.\n In the list of administrative rulings, cited by the government, this is the first one that involves construction of a land-grant Act. Land-aid differs essentially from bond-aid. Contracts in respect of the latter require government transportation over aided mileage at 'fair and reasonable rates' and that the compensation earned be applied on the bond debt. No diminution of charges for government transportation is exacted. The railroad re- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 393, 418]\n\u00a0\n ceives credit instead of cash for the charges calculated at full rates. But the land-grant Acts require service either free or at half rates forever. Questions as to compensation under them concern not merely form of payment of full charges but the amount of payment. Unreasonable indeed would it be to hold that carriers' acquiescence in government construction of bond-aid Acts is binding or entitled to weight in cases involving construction of the land-grant Acts.\n DIAGRAM 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 4. \nRuling of January 21, 1902 by Comptroller Tracewell in a Great Northern case, VIII Dec. of Comp. of Treas. 474. See Diagram 4. The government shipped \n\n[307 \nU.S. 393, 419]\n\u00a0\n property from St. Paul, Minnesota, to points west of Larimore, North Dakota. The company had three routes between the points just named. The percentage of aided mileage in the route via Crookston, 'a', is larger than that in either route 'b' or 'c'. The government having failed to choose a route, the company hauled by the shortest route, 'c'; it was generally used for like service. The question was whether land-grant deduction should be calculated on the percentage of the shorter line actually used or the higher percentage of the longer one not used.\n\n DIAGRAM 4. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The decision, as well as the quoted generalization, of Second Comptroller Butler are in terms broad enough to \n\n[307 \nU.S. 393, 420]\n\u00a0\n cover the question presented but Comptroller Tracewell, refusing to follow either, decided against the government's contention. He said: 'Where, with Government aid, two separate and independent lines of railroad have been constructed from a common point to entirely different points, but which subsequently by extension and independent connections are projected through a common point, and all these lines have subsequently passed to the control of a single company, and transportation is furnished between such common points for the Government by the most usually traveled of said routes, deduction for land grant should be made on the basis of such route, in the absence of a contract or a request for transportation by the other route.'\n If followed, this ruling would require land-grant deduction in the case at bar to be calculated on the land-grant mileage of the Cascade Route used. Compare Diagrams 1 and 4.\n\n 5. \nRuling of February 28, 1911 by Comptroller Tracewell in a St. Louis, Iron Mountain & Southern (Missouri Pacific) case, XVII Dec. of Comp. of Treas. 633. See Diagram 5. The company had a land-aided railroad between Birds Point, Missouri (on the west bank of the Mississippi opposite Cairo, Illinois) and Texarkana, Arkansas, via Dexter, Missouri. Government shipments from Cairo to Dexter were generally transported across the river at Birds Point and thence by the land-aided line. On government shipments between Cairo and Texarkana by that route, 99.247 per cent was land-aided. Because of a change in the bed of the river, it was necessary to haul the shipments in question via Thebes and Illmo. The land- grant deduction applicable to that route was 81.234 per cent. The railroad insisted that, having been forced to give up the old route, it should not be required to make deduction for the non-aided mileage between Cairo and Dexter via Thebes. But the Comptroller re- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 393, 421]\n\u00a0\n fused to accept that contention and ordered settlement on the basis of land-aided mileage in the route via Birds Point.\n\n DIAGRAM 5. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n There is a fundamental difference between that case and the one before us. The carrier had abandoned the land-aided route for hauls between Cairo and Dexter. The Southern Pacific kept the Siskiyou Route in use.\n\n 6. \nRuling of October 19, 1914 by Comptroller Downey in an Atchison case, XXI Dec. of Comp. of Treas. 238. See Diagram 6. The company has a line in Kansas between Lawrence and Chanute, land-aided to the extent of 91.3 miles and unaided as to 3.02 miles, part of the distance between Chanute and Humboldt. It has another line between Atchison and the Colorado boundary via Topeka and Emporia, all of which is land-aided. To connect these two aided lines there was built an unaided branch between Lawrence and Topeka and later another between Ottawa and Emporia. The government shipped cement from Chanute to Holbrook, Arizona. Earlier the shipment would have moved through Humboldt, Ottawa, Lawrence, Topeka, Emporia, and thence to point of des- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 393, 422]\n\u00a0\n DIAGRAM 6. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n tination. But, because of the construction of the branch between Ottawa and Emporia, the shipment in question was hauled over that line. By this route the haul be- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 393, 423]\n\u00a0\n tween Chanute and Holbrook was 59.13 miles less than over the other route and aided mileage between those points was less by 91.42 miles. The Comptroller held that the land-grant deduction should be based on the land- aided mileage of the original route. He found that the land-grant Act (12 Stat. 772) required the aided railroads 'to be and remain public highways for the use of the government' and that the branch lines made new through routes 'to the abandonment, in part, of the aided through route.' He said: 'It has long been the holding of the accounting officers that the changing of a line of railroad and abandoning of any part of the original aided line does not deprive the Government of its original rights, and settlement for service over the new line is, therefore, required to be made as if the transportation were over the original line. (See 3 Dig.Dec. 2d Comp. 299; V Dec. of Comp. of Treas. 364)'.\n As the ground on which that ruling rests is abandonment of a part of the aided line, it gives no support to the judgment before us.\n\n 7. \nRuling of October 1, 1917, by Comptroller Warwick in a Missouri Pacific case, XXIV Dec. of Comp. of Treas. 193. The published report does not disclose the physical situation. It is indicated by Diagram 7 prepared on the basis of information found in an unpublished opinion in the same case rendered May 8, 1917. The government shipped stone from Batesville, Arkansas on an unaided line via Kansas City to Leavenworth Penitentiary, Kansas. An older route between the same points was via White River Branch Connection, Cairo Branch Connection, Carondolet Branch Connection, Pacific, and Kansas City. The ratio applicable in computing land-grant deduction for shipments hauled that way is 17.933 per cent. The Warden at Leavenworth paid the company for the service in question over the unaided line, without any land-grant deduction. However, the Comptroller held \n\n[307 \nU.S. 393, 424]\n\u00a0\n the carrier subject to the same percentage of deduction as applied to the aided route. On the company's application he granted rehearing, upheld the principle on which he ordered the deduction, and declared it would be applied to future shipments. But, in view of particular facts and equities involved, he concluded that the accounts paid prior to the date of the decision could be allowed without land-grant deduction.\n It requires no discussion to show that the direct route used should have been chosen for the transportation in question. The Comptroller cited no land-grant contract to support the rule that he made applicable to future shipments. Nor did he cite Second Comptroller Butler's ruling or any case-and so far as disclosed by diligent research, briefs of counsel and this Court's opinion just announced-there is none that tends to sustain so incongruous an attribution of aided mileage not used to an unaided route used.\n\n 8. \nRuling of October 27, 1923 by Comptroller McCarl in a Southern Pacific case, 3 Comp.Gen. 267. See Diagram 8. This case involved a government shipment from Marshall (Spokane), Washington to Roseburg, Oregon. It was routed over an unaided line of the Oregon-Washington Railroad & Navigation Company subject to an equalization agreement that charges would not exceed the amount payable had the service been by the land-grant line yielding the lowest net rate. The Northern Pacific line between Marshall and Portland via Pasco and Tacoma was land-aided. Later there was built between Pasco and Portland a line jointly owned by the Northern Pacific and the Great Northern; it is a part of the Spokane, Portland & Seattle Railway. Upon completion of that line, the Northern Pacific canceled its rates applicable between Marshall and Portland by its aided line through Tacoma and announced that the rates in its tariffs would \n\n[307 \nU.S. 393, 425]\n\u00a0\n only apply via the new unaided line. The Comptroller held that, as to the government transportation in question, the aided stretch of the Northern Pacific had been abandoned, and that the government was therefore entitled 'to the transportation over the substituted line on the same basis as though transportation was furnished\n DIAGRAM 7.\n\n\n over the original land-grant line,' and directed that land-grant deduction should be allowed.\nThat case differs form the one at bar in that the Northern Pacific, having no tariff applicable to the shipment \n\n[307 \nU.S. 393, 426]\n\u00a0\n via its aided line, had abandoned that line and for it substituted a new one.\n\n 9. \nThe decisions in Northern Pac. Ry. Co. v. United States are next in chronological order. See Diagram 9, following page.\n DIAGRAM 8.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn government request, the company transported two Marines by through passenger train from St. Paul to Seattle. The Northern Pacific land grant \n\n[307 \nU.S. 393, 427]\n\u00a0\n aided a route from a point on Lake Superior to one on Puget Sound. Pursuant to the terms of the statute (Act of July 2, 1864, 13 Stat. 365) the aided railroad was built from the terminal established at Ashland in Wisconsin to the one established at Tacoma in Washington. Neither St. Paul nor Seattle is or ever was a terminal on that or any other land-grant line of the Northern Pacific. See United States v. Northern Pacific Ry. Co., \n177 \nU.S. 435, 441\n, 20 S.Ct. 706, 708. St. Paul is more than 100 miles off the aided line; Seattle, more than 50 miles. In the route traveled by the train in question the only aided mileage between St. Paul and the original Northern Pacific land-grant line is a stretch of about 20 miles between Watab and Little Falls, which is a part of the land-aided railroad between Watab and Brainerd constructed by the Western Railroad Company under the Act of March 3, 1857, 11 Stat. 195.10 There is no aided mileage between Seattle and Palmer Junction, where the original line connects with the route used.\n The issue in the case was whether, in addition to an undisputed deduction of 3 per cent, there should be deducted from the full commercial fare, $63.16, a land-grant percentage of 46.001 per cent, as claimed by the company, leaving a balance of $33.09, or 47.285 per cent, as claimed by the government, leaving a balance of $32.29. Thus the amount in issue as to each passenger was 80 cents.\n The controversy arose from the fact that the government attributed to the route used the stretches of aided mileage between Little Falls and Staples via Brainerd and between Palmer Junction and Auburn via Meeker, amounting in all to 94.24 miles.\n The government's theory was that the new unaided lines were 'merely alternate or lieu routes-routes estab- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 393, 428]\n\u00a0\n DIAGRAM 9.\n\n\u00a0\n lished by the railroad to shorten or straighten its line' and that therefore the calculation of land-grant deduction should take into account aided mileage not used to render the service in question. The District Court refused so to interpret the facts and held the deduction should be calculated on mileage actually used. 22 F.2d 858, 859. But the Circuit Court of Appeals, one judge dissenting, found that the unused aided mileage had been abandoned. 8 Cir., 30 F.2d 655. And upon that interpretation of the stipulated facts, it said (30 F.2d page 659): 'It thus appears that, except by this latter route (i.e. via unaided stretches between Little Falls and Staples, and between Palmer Junction and Auburn), through carriage by the Northern Pacific (from St. Paul) to the entire Pacific Coast is abandoned.' The facts early distinguish that case from the one now under consideration. It is here immaterial whether the judgment rests on a correct or erroneous interpretation of the stipulation on which the case was submitted. It is enough to say that the aided stretches were excluded by the company because not used and were included by the government on the ground that having been abandoned, they should be attributed to the route used.\n 10. Ruling of June 23, 1931 by Comptroller General McCarl in a Missouri Pacific case, 10 Comp.Gen. 522. See Diagram 10.\n The company constructed an unaided cut-off between Jedburg Junction and Eureka Junction, intermediate points on its land-aided line between St. Louis and Pacific. The distance between them via the cut-off is 2.99 miles. Over the old land-aided line via Glencoe, it is 4.93 miles. That track was still in use for some local trains. At another place on its line, within the city of St. Louis, the company substituted 0.68 of a mile of nonaided line for a longer one which is aided. The Comptroller General held that the aided mileage not used should be attributed to the cut-off mileage used. He said: 'It would seem to be too clear for serious argument that \n\n[307 \nU.S. 393, 430]\n\u00a0\n of the distances shown after the cut-off ... between Eureka and Jedburg and the 0.68 miles from union station connection to the union station, or a total of 3.67 miles is not over the land-grant line, but it is equally clear that the new mileage of 3.67 miles was substituted for mileage over the original line for which grants of public lands were made.'\n It requires imagination to discover in that case anything in principle or in fact that will support the conclusion reached by the court of claims in the case at bar.\n 11. Ruling of January 16, 1936 by Comptroller General McCarl, 15 Comp. Gen. 614. It has no bearing upon the case at bar. The question was whether, in computing percentage of land grant deduction, the line of the Spokane, Portland & Seattle Railway between Pasco and Portland (see Diagram 8), owned jointly by the Northern Pacific and the Great Northern, is to be regarded as a Northern Pacific line. The Comptroller General answered in the affirmative.\n IV. There is apparent attempt to draw from the Act of 1928 some support for the construction on which this Court affirms the judgment below. But, so far as concerns the question in this case, that Act does not indicate any congressional interpretation of the land-grant Act of 1866. The sole purpose of that measure was to substitute 50 per cent deduction in place of free transportation; it was passed in order to relieve the Southern Pacific of a burden to which other aided railroads were not subject. When it was enacted, May 23, 1928, only eight of the rulings above referred to had been made; two related to bond-aid contracts and are not in point; two were in favor of the railroads and do not support the judgment in this case. And, as above shown, none gives any support to \n\n[307 \nU.S. 393, 431]\n\u00a0\n the expansion of the terms of the contract that is here made. The 1928 Act was passed while the decision of the district court in the Northern Pacific case remained \n\n DIAGRAM 10. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n unreversed. 1927, 22 F.2d 858. That case was not decided in the Circuit Court of Appeals until 1929, 30 F.2d 655. If the Act could be deemed to be a construction of \n\n[307 \nU.S. 393, 432]\n\u00a0\n the land-grant-as plainly it may not-it would have to be read as approving the decision of the district court, for that was the only judicial decision in that field.\n V. The land-grant line has been kept in use. The contract is that, where government transportation is wholly over that line, deduction of 50 per cent shall be made and that, where it is partly over that line, there shall be deducted the percentage that aided mileage used is of total haul. But this Court holds that, even if the government elects to have its freight move over a separate and distinct unaided railroad, the plaintiff is bound to apply the percentages applicable to charges for transportation over the aided line. Thus the decision implies a formula or rule to the effect that a land-grant deduction once found applicable to charges for transportation over a route made up of aided and unaided mileage between two points is to be applied to all subsequent government shipments between those points, even if the route actually used includes no aided mileage. There is nothing in this contract or in any of the railroad land-grant Acts, either as written or as hitherto construed, to warrant that construction.\n I am of opinion that the judgment should be reversed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice ROBERTS join in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Cf.

This shows the land-grant mileage in the United States at the date of issue.

This was construed to require the railroad to furnish only free use of the rails and permanent structures. Lake Superior & Mississippi R.R. Co. v. United States, \n93 \nU.S. 442\n.

BANK(1939)\nNo. 543\nArgued: March 28, 1939Decided: April 24, 1939\n\n\n\n\n[307 \nU.S. 161, 162]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Harvey D. Eaton, of Waterville, Me., for petitioner.\n Mr. George P. Barse, of Washington, D.C., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The case is here on certiorari to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit which affirmed, 99 F.2d 583, a decree of the District Court for the District of Maine, Sprague v. Picher, 23 F.Supp. 59, denying a petition for the allowance of counsel fees and expenses over and above the regular taxable costs. Certiorari was granted, \n306 \nU.S. 623\n, 59 S.Ct. 463, 83 L.Ed. --, because an important question of judicial administration pertaining to the exercise of federal equity jurisdiction was raised.\n This case is another phase of a litigation that has been here before, Ticonic Bank v. Sprague, \n303 \nU.S. 406\n, 58 S.Ct. 612, the circumstances of which must be summarized to lay bare the problem now before us. On March 28, 1931, Lottie F. Sprague, the petitioner here, delivered $5,022.18 to the Ticonic National Bank of Waterville, Maine, in trust in which she and others had beneficial interests. Under the trust agreement part of the amount was to be deposited by the Bank in its savings department. The rest of the funds was deposited by the Bank in its commercial checking department, as were other trust funds awaiting investment or distribution, secured by an appropriate amount of bonds set aside in its trust department as required by Section 11(k) of the amended Federal Reserve Act, 38 Stat. 262, as amended, 49 Stat. 722, 12 U.S.C.  248(k), 12 U.S.C.A.  248(k). On August 3, \n\n[307 \nU.S. 161, 163]\n\u00a0\n 1931, the People's National Bank took over all the assets, including these earmarked bonds, and assumed the indebtedness of the Ticonic Bank. On March 4, 1933, the People's Bank closed, and both banks went into the hands of a receiver. Thereafter, on July 29, 1935, the petitioner and her beneficiary filed a bill in the District Court against the banks and their receiver to impress upon the proceeds of the bonds a lien for their trust deposit. The District Court sustained the claim and entered a decree for the discharge of the lien with interest from the date of the filing of the bill and payment to the plaintiffs' of 'their taxable costs,' 14 F.Supp. 900. On appeal, the Circuit Court of Appeals at first disallowed interest, 1 Cir., 87 F.2d 365, but on rehearing affirmed the decree of the District Court 'with costs,' 90 F.2d 641. This Court then granted certiorari 'limited to the question as to the allowance of interest' \n302 \nU.S. 675\n, 58 S.Ct. 55. Before its disposition, Ticonic Bank v. Sprague, supra, the present proceedings were begun.\n Petitioner alleged that, by vindicating her claim to a lien on the proceeds of the earmarked bonds to the amount of her trust funds, she had established as a matter of law the right to recovery in relation to fourteen trusts in situations like her own; that she had prosecuted the litigation solely at her own expense; that although the total assets of the bank were not sufficient to satisfy the unsecured creditors, the proceeds of the bonds were more than sufficient to discharge all trust obligations; and she therefore prayed the court for reasonable counsel fees and litigation expenses to be paid out of the proceeds of the bonds.\n The District Court held that it 'had no authority to grant the petition' on the ground that, after the appeal from its decree in 14 F. Supp. 900, it 'had no further function to perform other than to carry out the mandate of the Supreme Court when received. The mandate from \n\n[307 \nU.S. 161, 164]\n\u00a0\n the Supreme Court simply had the effect of directing this court to carry out the mandate of the Circuit Court of Appeals which, in turn, simply, in effect, required this court to execute its original final decree by issuing its execution for a certain sum of money with costs of both courts.' The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed 'for the reasons stated' by the District Court, and 'for the further reason that the term of court at which the decree was entered, when the petition to amend was filed, had long since passed ...'. Obviously, both courts disposed of the petition not as a considered disallowance of attorney's fees and litigation expenses in the circumstances of the particular suit but because they deemed award of such costs beyond the power of the District Court.\n Whether action by the District Court on the merits of the petition was foreclosed by this Court's mandate in Ticonic Bank v. Sprague, supra, and was further limited by restrictions which terms of court may impose, are questions subsidiary to the power of federal courts in equity suits to allow counsel fees and other expenses entailed by the litigation not included in the ordinary taxable costs recognized by statute.\n Allowance of such costs in appropriate situations is part of the historic equity jurisdiction of the federal courts. The suits 'in equity' of which these courts were given 'cognizance' ever since the First Judiciary Act, 1 Stat. 73, constituted that body of remedies, procedures and practices which theretofore had been evolved in the English Court of Chancery,1 subject, of course, to modifications \n\n[307 \nU.S. 161, 165]\n\u00a0\n by Congress, e.g., Michaelson v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 42\n, 45 S.Ct. 18, 35 A.L.R. 451. The sources bearing on eighteenth-century English practice-reports and manuals-uniformly support the power not only to give a fixed allowance for the various steps in a suit, what are known as costs 'between party and party,' but also as much of the entire expenses of the litigation of one of the parties as fair justice to the other party will permit, technically known as costs 'as between solicitor and client.' \n2\n To be sure, \n\n[307 \nU.S. 161, 166]\n\u00a0\n the usual case is one where through the complainant's efforts a fund is recovered in which others share. Sometimes the complainant avowedly sues for the common interest3 while in others his litigation results in a fund for a group though he did not profess to be their representative. \n4\n The present case presents a variant of the latter situation. In her main suit the petitioner neither avowed herself to be the representative of a class nor did she automatically establish a fund in which others could participate. But in view of the consequences of stare decisis, the petitioner by establishing her claim necessarily established the claims of fourteen other trusts pertaining to the same bonds.\n That the party in a situation like the present neither purported to sue for a class nor formally established by litigation a fund available to the class, does not seem to be a differentiating factor so far as it affects the source of the recognized power of equity to grant reimbursements of the kind for which the petitioner in this case appealed to the chancellor's discretion. Plainly the foundation for the historic practice of granting reimbursement for the costs of litigation other than the conventional taxable costs is part of the original authority of the chancellor to do equity in a particular situation. 5 \n\n[307 \nU.S. 161, 167]\n\u00a0\n Whether one professes to sue representatively or formally makes a fund available for others may, of course, be a relevant circumstance in making the fund liable for his costs in producing it. But when such a fund is for all practical purposes created for the benefit of others, the formalities of the litigation-the absence of an avowed class suit or the creation of a fund, as it were, through stare decisis rather than through a decree- hardly touch the power of equity in doing justice as between a party and the beneficiaries of his litigation. As in much else that pertains to equitable jurisdiction, individualization in the exercise of a discretionary power will alone retain equity as a living system and save it from sterility. In the actual exercise of the power to award costs 'as between solicitor and client' all sorts of practical distinctions have been taken in distributing the costs of the burden of the litigation. \n6\n And so, the circumstances under which the petitioner enforced the fiduciary obligation of the Ticonic Bank-the relation of its vindication to beneficiaries similarly situated but not actually before the court, as well as the interest of the common creditors where the funds of the bank are not sufficient to pay them in full, and doubtless other considerations- must enter into the ultimate judgment of the District Court as to the fairness of making an award, or the extent of such award, 'as between solicitor and client' in this case. In any event such allowances are appropriate only in exceptional cases and for dominating reasons of justice. But here we are concerned solely with the power to entertain such a petition.\n Without considering the historic authority of a court of equity in such matters, the District Court deemed itself \n\n[307 \nU.S. 161, 168]\n\u00a0\n powerless because foreclosed by the mandate in Ticonic Bank v. Sprague, supra. The general proposition which moved that Court-that it was bound to carry the mandate of the upper court into execution and could not consider the questions which the mandate laid at rest-is indisputable. Compare Kansas City Southern Ry. v. Guardian Trust Co., \n281 \nU.S. 1\n, 50 S.Ct. 194.7 But that leaves us still to consider whether the immediate issue now in controversy was disposed of in the main litigation and therefore foreclosed by the mandate. While a mandate is controlling as to matters within its compass, on the remand a lower court is free as to other issues. See In re Sanford Fork & Tool Co., \n160 \nU.S. 247\n, 16 S.Ct. 291; Ex parte Century Indemnity Co., \n305 \nU.S. 354\n, 59 S.Ct. 239. Certainly the claim for 'as between solicitor and client' costs was not directly in issue in the original proceedings by Sprague. It was neither before the Circuit Court of Appeals nor before this Court. Its disposition, therefore, by the mandate of either Court could be implied only if a claim for such costs was necessarily implied in the claim in the original suit, and its failure to ask for such costs an implied waiver. These implications are repelled by the basis on which such costs are granted. They are not of a routine character like ordinary taxable costs; they are contingent upon the exigencies of equitable litigation, the final disposition of which in its entire process including appeal place such a claim in much better perspective than it would have at an earlier stage. Such are the considerations which \n\n[307 \nU.S. 161, 169]\n\u00a0\n underlay the decision in Trustees v. Greenough, \n105 \nU.S. 527\n, 531, in holding that an order allowing costs 'as between solicitor and client' was a final judgment for purposes of appeal because 'the inquiry was a collateral one, having a distinct and independent character.' 8 We, therefore, hold that the issue in the instant case is sufficiently different from that presented by the ordinary questions regarding taxable costs that it was impliedly covered neither by the original decree nor by the mandates, and that neither constituted a bar to the disposal of the petition below on its merits.\n Finally, we must notice the separate ground taken by the Circuit Court of Appeals on the basis of what it deemed the requirements of terms of court. The new Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c, have rendered anachronistic the technical niceties pertaining to terms of court as to both law and equity,9 but the ruling of the District Court here \n\n[307 \nU.S. 161, 170]\n\u00a0\n in question was made prior to the operation of the new Rules. Since we view the petition for reimbursement as an independent proceeding supplemental to the original proceeding and not a request for a modification of the original decree, the suggestion of the Circuit Court of Appeals-that it came after the end of the term at which the main decree was entered and therefore too late-falls.\n The decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be reversed so that the District Court may entertain the petition for reimbursement in the light of the appropriate equitable considerations.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice BUTLER concur in the result.\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Robinson v.

See Beames, Costs in Equity (Advertisement to Second Edition). But the current of authority is uniform and unequivocal.\n The power of the federal courts to give costs was recognized by implication in the First Judiciary Act. Act of September 24, 1789, Ch. 20, Sec. 20, 1 Stat. 83, 28 U.S.C.A.  815. The statutory system prior to 1853 required 'party and party' costs to be taxed on the basis of the fees allowed by state practice, but the Act of Feb. 26, 1853, c. 80, 10 Stat. 161, set a uniform scale of fees for 'party and party' costs in the federal courts. See Costs in Civil Cases, 30 Fed.Cas.No.18,284; Street, Federal Equity Practice  1984-1988. As to sts 'as between solicitor and client', the English practice was followed by the Supreme Court and it was held that the allowance of such costs was within the authority of the federal courts.

The Circuit Court of Appeals, while affirming on the merits, passed on these suggestions in a way interpreted by this court to allow only 'party and party' costs. No appeal had been taken on this point. A subsequent application in the District Court for 'solicitor and client' costs was therefore held barred. \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] In Trustees v. Greenough, supra, suit was brought by a holder of certain bonds against the trustees of the state improvement fund alleging mismanagement and waste of the fund which was to secure the bonds and asking that his claim be allowed, that the fund be charged with the payment thereof, and that an accounting be had. This relief was granted, much property was reclaimed to the fund and agents were appointed for the sale of the property of the fund for the purposes of liquidation. During the liquidation, the holder of the bonds who had initiated the proceedings filed his petition for an allowance from the fund of his costs as between solicitor and client. Such costs were allowed without any suggestion that the application for them was not timely. \n[\nFootnote 9\n] Prior to the adoption of the new Rules of Civil Procedure, a final decree in a suit in equity could be revised only during the term of court of its entry.

The same limitation existed on the power of a district court to grant a rehearing of an appealable decree. Equity Rule 88. These time limitations are no longer applicable. Rules 59 and 60 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S. C.A. following section 723c, set forth the time in which these actions may be taken, but under those sections the passage of the term of court is not material. Indeed, Rule 6(c) provides: 'The period of time provided for the doing of any act or the taking of any proceeding is not affected or limited by the expiration of a term of court. The expiration of a term of court in no way affects the power of a court to do any act or take any proceeding in any civil action which has been pending before it.' It was stated in the Notes to the Rules of Civil Procedure, prepared by the Advisory Committee, March 1938, that this section 'eliminates the difficulties caused by the expiration of terms of court.' \n\n\n\n\n","116":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTANDARD BRANDS v. NATIONAL GRAIN YEAST CORP.(1939)\nNo. 10\nArgued: October 12, 1939Decided: November 6, 1939\n\n\n\n Messrs. Leonard A. Watson and Charles P. Bauer, both of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. Stephen H. Philbin, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The order which granted this Writ limits our consideration to the validity of Hayduck patents Nos. 1,449,103, 1,449,105, 1,449,106. \n306 \nU.S. 627\n, 59 S.Ct. 645. They relate to processes for manu- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 34, 35]\n\u00a0\n facturing baker's yeast and are owned by the petitioner. It will be convenient to designate them by the last three figures of their office numbers-103, 105, 106.\n All three patents were declared invalid by the Circuit Court of Appeals below, 3 Cir., 101 F.2d 814. In the District Court for New Jersey, 103 had been adjudged valid; 105 and 106 invalid, D.C., 21 F.Supp. 46.\n The District Court for Maryland in two causes (Soper, J.) held the patents valid, Fleischman Yeast Co. v. Federal Yeast Corporation, D.C., 8 F.2d 186, Standard Brands, Inc. v. Federal Yeast Corporation, D.C., 38 F. 2d 329. The Circuit Court of Appeals, Fourth Circuit, affirmed the judgment sustaining 103, Federal Yeast Corporation v. Fleischmann Co., 13 F.2d 570. The parties arrived at a settlement and no appeal was taken from the second judgment.\n Much has been written relative to these patents in the carefully prepared opinions referred to above. They adequately reveal the facts and points of law incident to the prolonged disputation. Irreconcilable views have been approved and we must now decide which is to be preferred.\n'Yeast is a small cellular micro-organism. In its ordinary significance, it is a conglomerate mass of infinitesimally small cells. It multiplies by self propagation, limited by the means of subsistence, and the quality and yield are greatly affected by the conditions under which propagation is carried on. Yeast has been manufactured for at least 50 years by inoculating a wort; that is, by preparing a clear liquid solution and stocking it with a small amount of seed yeast. Such worts include substances to nourish the yeast cells, and are called yeast nutrient solutions. ... The field for investigation and improvement has been the composition of the nutrient solution, and the character of the process employed during the period of growth.' \n\n[308 \nU.S. 34, 36]\n\u00a0\n Nutrient solutions often contain inorganic salts which are broken down through the growth of the seed yeast. Commonly, this brings about marked acidity. Growth progresses best in a slightly acid wort; over- acidity retards or destroys it; aeration of the wort accelerates growth.\n\n The amount of alcohol consequent upon the growth of yeast cells has direct relation to the concentration of the wort. When intensified the yield of alcohol increases; when lowered there is less.\n Generally: Patent 103 proposes to neutralize any deleterious acidity in a wort which contains inorganic salt by adding an antacid material; patent 105 requires the addition of nutrients during the growth of the yeast 'at a rate such that the yeast may propagate and substantially all of the alcohol which may be formed is assimilated by the yeast'; patent 106 combines the neutralization idea of 103 with the rate of feed proposed by 105.\n Claim No. 1 of patent 103, typical of all, follows, 'The process of manufacturing yeast which comprises preparing a yeast nutrient solution and propagating yeast therein with aeration, said yeast nutrient solution containing essentially sugar material and yeast nourishing inorganic salts from which components are liberated which tend increasingly to acidify the nutrient solution during propagation, and during the period of propagation neutralizing the deleterious excess of such acidity.'\n In respect of this petitioners' counsel maintain 'It covers, rather, the integral coordination of propagating yeast with aeration in a prepared solution containing essentially sugar material and yeast nourishing inorganic salts from which results an increasing acidification tending to become deleterious, and neutralizing the deleterious excess of such acidity in the solution while the yeast propagation is being conducted.' \n\n[308 \nU.S. 34, 37]\n\u00a0\n The Circuit Court of Appeals below declared (101 F.2d 820)-'We think that it cannot be denied that the use of antacid or basic materials as neutralizers for acidity in respect to yeast is old in the art. ... We think that Hayduck has simply set forth a technique which is useful in the manufacture of yeast under modern methods. Hayduck's disclosures do not attain to the dignity of invention. His process is the result of the exercise of the skill of the calling, the application of an old principle to a similar or analogous subject with no change in the manner of application and without any substantially different result.'\n And it accordingly held patent 103 invalid for want of invention over the prior art.\n Considering all the circumstances and notwithstanding the very forceful arguments to the contrary, we think this must be accepted as the better view.\n Claim No. 10, typical of patent 105, follows, 'A process of propagating yeast with a relatively low yield of alcohol which comprises, preparing a wort containing all essential yeast nutrients in solution, initiating propagation of yeast in a highly diluted portion of said wort, aerating the diluted portion, and substantially continuously adding during the period of propagation, the wort of higher concentration at a rate such that the concentration of the dilute wort remains substantially constant, whereby substantially all of the alcohol which may be formed is assimilated.'\n Of this patent counsel for petitioner say, It 'is directed particularly to this procedural or manipulative, rather than chemical, aspect of the operation; i.e., a division of the wort into two parts with propagation begun in a diluted fraction and the gradual feeding in of the concentrated reserve as stated. By adopting this perfected process, the yield of yeast was still further \n\n[308 \nU.S. 34, 38]\n\u00a0\n increased and there were also other accompanying advantages in shortened time from commencement of the yeast propagation to the harvesting of the yeast crop and in enhanced quantity of output from a given sized apparatus.'\n The Circuit Court of Appeals below declared (101 F.2d 821), 'It was well known to the prior art that if the creation of alcohol was not desired the nutrient solution should contain a low concentration of sugar . ... In our opinion the process described by Hayduck may constitute a mechanical improvement over the prior art but it is no more than this. But even if the process disclosed by Hayduck be held to constitute invention, the patent is invalid for indefiniteness as was held by the learned District Judge. Both the times and manner in which the concentrated nutrient solution is to be added may be ascertained as we have stated solely by experimentation. The disclosure of the patent is therefore too vague and indefinite to constitute invention.'\n With this conclusion we agree.\n As to patent 106 counsel have stipulated 'The process of this patent is one combining the process of patent '103, including neutralization, and the process of patent '105, including regulated nutrient feed.'\n Since patent No. 103 is invalid for lack of invention and No. 105 invalid because the disclosure is too vague and indefinite, a claim for patent based upon the mere union of the two processes described therein cannot be sustained where, as here, the proposed combination requires nothing beyond the skill of the art.\n The challenged decree must be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice BUTLER and Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration and decision of this cause. \n\n\n\n","117":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF MINNESOTA v. U.S.(1939)\nNo. 73\nArgued: November 10, 1938Decided: January 3, 1939\n\n\n\n\n[305 \nU.S. 382, 383]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Ordner T. Bundlie and William S. Ervin, both of St. Paul, Minn., for petitioner.\n Mr. Mac Asbill, of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Minnesota brought in a court of the State this proceeding to take by condemnation pursuant to its laws a right of way for a highway over nine allotted parcels of land which form parts of the Grand Portage Indian Reservation, granted for the Band of Chippewa Indians of Lake Superior by Treaty of September 30, 1854, 10 Stat. 1109, and the Act of Congress, January 14, 1889, c. 24, 25 Stat. 642. The parcels had been allotted in severalty to individual Indians by trust patents. The highway was located pursuant to requirements of the Constitution of the State. It was not shown that authority had been obtained from the Secretary of the Interior for the construction of the highway over the Indian lands. The petition named as persons interested the owners under \n\n[305 \nU.S. 382, 384]\n\u00a0\n the Indian allotments, the Superintendent of the Consolidated Chippewa Agency, and the United States, as holder of the fee in trust.\n The United States was named as a party defendant. The United States Attorney, appearing specially for the United States and generally for the other respondents, filed a petition for the removal of the cause to the federal court. He and counsel for the State stipulated that the cause 'may be (so) removed.' The state court ordered removal. In the federal court, the United States, appearing specially, moved to dismiss the action on the ground that it had not consented to be sued and that the state court had no jurisdiction of the action or over the United States. The motion to dismiss was denied on the ground that the United States is not a necessary party, since 'consent ... to bring these proceedings against the Indian allottees has been expressly granted and given by the United States to the State of Minnesota, pursuant to 25 United States Code Annotated, Section 357,' (Act of March 3, 1901, c. 832, Sec. 3, 31 Stat. 1058, 1083, 1084), the second paragraph of which provides: 'Lands allotted in severalty to Indians may 'be condemned' for any public purpose under the laws of the State or Territory where located in the same manner as land owned in fee may be condemned, and the money awarded as damages shall be paid to the allottee.' The petition for condemnation was granted.\n Upon appeal by the United States, the Circuit Court of Appeals held that the State was without power to condemn the Indian lands unless specifically authorized so to do by the Secretary of the Interior, as provided in Section 4 of the Act of 1901, 25 U.S.C.A.  311, which provides: 'The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to grant permission, upon compliance with such requirements as he may deem necessary, to the proper \n\n[305 \nU.S. 382, 385]\n\u00a0\n State or local authorities for the opening and establishment of public highways, in accordance with the laws of the State or Territory in which the lands are situated ... through any lands which have been allotted in severalty to any individual Indian ... but which have not been conveyed to the allottee with full power of alienation.' It held, further, that as such authorization had not been shown, the United States had not consented to the maintenance of the condemnation suit against it; that the court was without jurisdiction to proceed; and that the fact that removal from the state court to the federal court had been obtained by the United States Attorney by stipulation had not effected a general appearance. The Circuit Court of Appeals, therefore, reversed the judgment of the District Court with directions to dismiss. 8 Cir., 95 F.2d 468. Certiorari was granted because of alleged conflict with the established administrative practice under the applicable statutes and the importance of the question presented. \n305 \nU.S. 580\n, 59 S.Ct. 66, 83 L.Ed. --.\n The State contends that it had power, and its courts jurisdiction, to condemn the allotted lands without making the United States a party to the proceedings: (1) Because authorized so to do by the second paragraph of Section 3 of the Act of March 3, 1901, quoted above; (2) because authorized so to do by the Treaty of September 30, 1854, 10 Stat. 1109, 1110, approved by Congress January 14, 1889, which provided in Article 3, 'All necessary roads, highways, and railroads, the lines of which may run through any of the reserve tracts, shall have the right of way through the same, compensation being made therefor as in other cases.' (3) because the State, in its sovereign capacity and in the exercise of its governmental functions in the location and construction of a constitutional state trunk highway \n\n[305 \nU.S. 382, 386]\n\u00a0\n required to be so located and constructed by its constitution and laws, may, without express congressional authority therefor, exercise its inherent power of eminent domain for such purpose over lands so allotted in severalty to individual Indians.\n The Minnesota Chippewa Tribe and the Grand Portage-Grand Marais Band thereof filed by the tribal attorney a brief praying that the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals be reversed and that of the District Court affirmed.\n First. The United States is an indispensable party defendant to the condemnation proceedings. A proceeding against property in which the United States has an interest is a suit against the United States. The Siren, 7 Wall. 152, 154; Carr v. United States, \n98 \nU.S. 433\n, 437; Stanley v. Schwalby, \n162 \nU.S. 255\n, 16 S.Ct. 754. Compare Utah Power & Light Co. v. United States, \n243 \nU.S. 389\n, 37 S.Ct. 387. It is confessedly the owner of the fee of the Indian allotted lands and holds the same in trust for the allottees. As the United States owns the fee of these parcels, the right of way cannot be condemned without making it a party. 1 \n\n[305 \nU.S. 382, 387]\n\u00a0\n The exemption of the United States from being sued without its consent extends to a suit by a state. Compare Kansas v. United States, \n204 \nU.S. 331, 342\n, 27 S.Ct. 388, 391; Arizona v. California, \n298 \nU.S. 558, 568\n, 571 S., 572, 56 S.Ct. 848, 853, 854, 855. Compare Minnesota v. Hitchcock, \n185 \nU.S. 373\n, 382-387, 22 S.Ct. 650, 654, 655; Oregon v. Hitchcock, \n202 \nU.S. 60\n, 26 S.Ct. 568. Hence Minnesota cannot maintain this suit against the United States unless authorized by some act of Congress.\n Minnesota contends that the United States is not an indispensable party. It argues that since the second paragraph of Section 3 of the Act of March 3, 1901, provides that 'the money awarded as damages shall be paid to the allottee', the United States has no interest in the land or its proceeds after the condemnation is begun. \n2\n Under Section 5 of the General Allotment Act, Act of February 8, 1887, c. 119, 24 Stat. 388, 389, U.S.C. Title 25,  348, 25 U.S.C.A.  348, the Indians' interest in these allotted lands was subject to restraints on alienation;3 and by Section 2 of the Indian Reorganization Act, Act of June 18, 1934, c. 576, 48 Stat. 984, U.S.C. Title 25,  462, 25 U.S.C.A.  462, restraints on alienation were extended. The clause quoted may not be interpreted as freeing the allottee's land from the restraint imposed by \n\n[305 \nU.S. 382, 388]\n\u00a0\n other acts of Congress. As the parcels here in question were restricted lands, the interest of the United States continues throughout the condemnation proceedings. In its capacity as trustee for the Indians it is necessarily interested in the outcome of the suit-in the amount to be paid. That it is interested, also, in what shall be done with the proceeds is illustrated by the Act of June 30, 1932, c. 333, 47 Stat. 474, U.S.C. Title 25,  409a, 25 U.S.C.A.  409a, under which the Secretary of the Interior may determine that the proceeds of the condemnation of restricted Indian lands shall be reinvested in other lands subject to the same restrictions. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n Second. Minnesota contends that Congress has authorized suit against the United States. It is true that authorization to condemn confers by implication permission to sue the United States. But Congress has provided generally for suits against the United States in the federal courts. And it rests with Congress to determine not only whether the United States may be sued, but in what courts the suit may be brought. This suit was begun in a state court. The fact that the removal was effected on petition of the United States and the stipulation of its attorney in relation thereto are facts without legal significance. Where jurisdiction has not been con- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 382, 389]\n\u00a0\n ferred by Congress, no officer of the United States has power to give to any court jurisdiction of a suit against the United States. Compare Case v. Terrell, 11 Wall. 199, 202; Carr v. United States, \n98 \nU.S. 433\n, 435-439; Finn v. United States, \n123 \nU.S. 227, 232\n, 233 S., 8 S.Ct. 82, 85; Stanley v. Schwalby, \n162 \nU.S. 255, 270\n, 16 S. Ct. 754, 760; United States v. Garbutt Oil Co., \n302 \nU.S. 528\n, 533-535, 58 S.Ct. 320, 323. If Congress did not grant permission to bring this condemnation proceeding in a state court, the federal court was without jurisdiction upon its removal. For jurisdiction of the federal court on removal is, in a limited sense, a derivative jurisdiction. Where the state court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter or of the parties, the federal court acquires none, although in a like suit originally brought in a federal court it would have had jurisdiction. Lambert Run Coal Co. v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., \n258 \nU.S. 377, 383\n, 42 S.Ct. 349, 351; General Investment Co. v. Lake Shore & M.S. Ry. Co., \n260 \nU.S. 261, 288\n, 43 S.Ct. 106, 117.\n Third. Minnesota contends that Congress authorized suit in a court of the state by providing in the second paragraph of Section 3 of the Act of March 3, 1901, quoted above, for 'condemnation of' lands allotted in severalty to Indians 'in the same manner as land owned in fee.' But the paragraph contains no permission to sue in the court of a state. It merely authorizes condemnation for 'any public purpose under the laws of the State or Territory where located.' There are persuasive reasons why that statute should not be construed as authorizing suit in a state court. It relates to Indian lands under trust allotments-a subject within the exclusive control of the federal government. The judicial determination of controversies concerning such lands has been commonly committed exclusively to federal courts. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n[305 \nU.S. 382, 390]\n\u00a0\n Minnesota asserted in support of its interpretation of the paragraph that by long established administrative practice such condemnation proceedings are brought in the state court and without making the United States a party. \n6\n The assertion was denied by the Government. As the brief of neither counsel furnished adequate data as to the administrative practice, they were requested at the oral argument to furnish the data thereafter. From the report then submitted by the Solicitor General it appears that throughout a long period the Secretary of the Interior has insisted in Minnesota and in other States, that condemnation suits must be brought in a federal court and that the United States must be made a party defendant. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n[305 \nU.S. 382, 391]\n\u00a0\n As the lower court had no jurisdiction of this suit, we have no occasion to consider whether, as a matter of substantive law, the lack of assent by the Secretary of the Interior precluded maintenance of the condemnation proceeding.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The fee of the United States is not a dry legal title divorced from substantial powers and responsibilities with relation to the land. United States v. Rickert, \n188 \nU.S. 432\n, 23 S.Ct. 478; compare Tiger v. Western Investment Co., \n221 \nU.S. 286\n, 31 S.Ct. 578; Brader v. James, \n246 \nU.S. 88\n, 38 S.Ct. 285. In the case of patents in fee with restraints on alienation it is established that an alienation of the Indian's interest in the lands by judicial decision in a suit to which the United States is not a party has no binding effect but that the United States may sue to cancel the judgment and set aside the conveyance made pursuant thereto. Bowling and Miami Investment Co. v. United States, \n233 \nU.S. 528\n, 34 S.Ct. 659; Privett v. United States, \n256 \nU.S. 201\n, 41 S.Ct. 455; Sunderland v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 226\n, 45 S.Ct. 64. In the stronger case of a trust allotment, it would seem clear that no effective relief can be given in a proceeding to which the United States is not a party and that the United States is therefore an indispensable party to any suit to establish or acquire an interest in the lands. Compare McKay v. Kalyton, \n204 \nU.S. 458\n, 27 S.Ct. 346. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The extent of the restraints on alienation contained in Section 5 of the General Allotment Act was clarified and modified to some extent by subsequent legislation. E.g., Act of May 27, 1902, c. 888,  7, 32 Stat. 245, 275; Act of May 8, 1906, c. 2348, 34 Stat. 182; Act of March 1, 1907, c. 2285, 34 Stat. 1015, 1018; Act of May 29, 1908, c. 216, 35 Stat. 444; Act of June 25, 1910, c. 431,  1-5, 36 Stat. 855, 856; Act of May 18, 1916, c. 125, 39 Stat. 123, 127; U.S.C.

Under Section 4 of the Indian Reorganization Act, applicable to all Indian Reservations unless a majority of the adult Indian vote against its application, the transferability of restricted Indiana lands is greatly limited. Act of June 18, 1934, c. 576, 48 Stat. 984, 985, U.S.C. Title 25,  464, 25 U.S.C.A.  464. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Compare the Act of March 1, 1907, c. 2285, 34 Stat. 1018, U.S.C.

Title 25,  403, 406, 25 U.S.C.A.  403, 406. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Whenever any nontaxable land of a restricted Indian of the Five Civilized Tribes or of any other Indian tribe is sold to any State, county, or municipality for public-improvement purposes, or is acquired, under existing law, by any State, county, or municipality by condemnation or other proceedings for such public purposes, or is sold under existing law to any other person or corporation for other purposes, the money received for said land may, in the discretion and with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, be reinvested in other lands selected by said Indian, and such land so selected and purchased shall be restricted as to alienation, lease or incumbrance, and nontaxable in the same quantity and upon the same terms and conditions as the nontaxable lands from which the reinvested funds were derived, and such restrictions shall appear in the conveyance.' See also note 6, infra. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Compare McKay v. Kalyton, \n204 \nU.S. 458\n, 27 S.Ct. 346; 28 Stat. 305, 31 Stat. 760, U.S.C. Title 25,  345, 25 U.S.C.A.  345. The United States argues that a statute granting permission to sue the United States must be construed to apply only to the federal courts unless there is an explicit reference to the state tribunals, citing Stanley v. Schwalby, \n162 \nU.S. 255, 270\n, 16 S.Ct. 754, 760; United States v. Inaba, D.C. 291 F. 416, 418; United States v. Deasy, D.C., 24 F. 2d 108, 110. This is not universally true even as to suits against the United States itself. United States v. Jones, \n109 \nU.S. 513\n, 3 S.Ct. 346. And in many instances the state courts have been held to have jurisdiction of suits against the instrumentalities and officers of the United States which directly affect its property interests without such specific statutory authorization.

Jaques, all of New York City, for Wilks.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This original suit, in the nature of a bill of interpleader, brought to determine the true domicile of decedent as the basis of rival claims of four states for death taxes upon his estate, raises two principal questions: Whether this Court has jurisdiction of the cause and, if so, whether the report of the Special Master, finding that decedent at the time of his death was domiciled in Massachusetts, should be confirmed.\n On March 15, 1937, this Court granted the motion of the State of Texas for leave to file its bill of complaint against the States of Florida and New York and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and against decedent's wife, Mabel Harlow Green, and his sister, Hetty Sylvia Ann \n\n[306 \nU.S. 398, 402]\n\u00a0\n Howland Green Wilks, both alleged to be residents of New York. The bill of complaint alleges that Edward H. R. Green died at Lake Placid, New York, on June 8, 1936, leaving surviving him his wife and sister as his only heir and next of kin; that he left a gross estate of approximately $44,348, 500, and a net estate valued at $42,348,500, comprising real estate and tangible personal property located in Taxas, New York, Florida and Massachusetts, of an aggregate value of approximately $6,500,000, and intangible personal property consisting principally of stocks, bonds and securities, the paper evidences of most of which were located in New York.\n The bill of complaint alleges that decedent, at the time of his death, was domiciled in Texas, but that Florida, New York, and Massachusetts each asserts, through its taxing officials, that decedent was at the time of his death domiciled within it. It alleges in detail that Texas and each of the defendant states maintains and enforces a system of taxation upon the inheritance or succession of the estates of decedents domiciled within the state at death, under which laws real estate and tangible personal property located within the state and all intangibles, regardless of their situs, are subjected to the tax; that each of the four states asserts and proposes to exercise the right to tax the estate of decedent on the assumption that decedent was domiciled within it at the time of his death; and that certain judicial proceedings have been instituted in each of the four states for the administration of decedent's estate or some parts of it. \n1\n It is further alleged that \n\n[306 \nU.S. 398, 403]\n\u00a0\n none of the four states and no officer or representative of any state, except as already noted, has become a party to any of those proceedings, and that no state or its officer or representative will appear or become a party to any such proceedings instituted in any other state to fix or assess death taxes on decedent's estate, and that no judgment in any such proceeding will be binding on any state not a party to it; that each of the four states claims a lien for taxes and the right to collect a tax, based on decedent's alleged domicile within it, upon the tangibles located in the state and upon all decedent's intangibles wherever located, the total of such claims amounting to a sum far greater than the net value of the estate; that the amount of decedent's property located in Texas is negligible in amount and insufficient to pay its tax; and in the event that the states should obtain adjudications in their own or other courts in pending proceedings, or others instituted for the purpose of collecting the tax on the ground that decedent was domiciled elsewhere than in Texas, Texas would be deprived of its lawful tax. The bill prays that the Court determine whether decedent's domicile, \n\n[306 \nU.S. 398, 404]\n\u00a0\n for purposes of taxation, was in either of the defendant states and that particularly it determine and adjudicate that his domicile was in Texas and that it alone has the right to assess and collect death taxes on decedent's intangibles.\n The several defendant states, answering, admit that decedent's estate is insufficient to satisfy the total amount of the taxes claimed. All deny that Green was domiciled in Texas, and by way of counterclaim and cross- bill against the other defendants, each asserts that he was domiciled in it and that it is entitled to collect death taxes upon all of decedent's intangible property and upon all his tangibles within the state. The answer of decedent's wife admitted that he was domiciled in Texas and asserted that by Texas law she owned, as community property, one-half of substantially all of decedent's estate acquired by him after their marriage, free and clear of all death taxes. Pursuant to stipulation showing that she had released all interest in decedent's estate, the suit was dismissed as to her by order of the Court on January 17, 1938. \n302 \nU.S. 662\n, 58 S.Ct. 478. The answer of defendant Wilks, decedent's sister, denies that Green was domiciled in Texas and asks the Court to determine in which of the defendant states he was domiciled for purposes of taxation.\n On June 1, 1937, this Court appointed a Special Master, \n301 \nU.S. 671\n, 57 S.Ct. 935, to take evidence, to make findings of fact and state conclusions of law, and to submit them to this Court, together with his recommendations for a decree. The Special Master has reported his findings, with certain evidentiary facts, and his finding that decedent at the time of his death was domiciled in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, this latter conclusion being supported by elaborate subsidiary findings. The case is now before us on exceptions to the Special Master's conclusions of fact and subsidiary findings that decedent's domicile was in Massachusetts at the time of his death. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 398, 405]\n\u00a0\n Jurisdiction.\n While the exceptions do not challenge the jurisdiction of the Court, the novel character of the questions presented and the duty which rests upon this Court to see to it that the exercise of its powers be confined within the limits prescribed by the Constitution make it incumbent upon us to inquire of our own motion whether the case is one within its jurisdiction. Minnesota v. Hitchcock, \n185 \nU.S. 373, 382\n, 385 S., 22 S.Ct. 650, 654. By the Judiciary Article of the Constitution, the judicial power extends to controversies between states, and this Court is given original jurisdiction of cases in which a state shall be a party. Art. 3,  2, U.S.C.A.Const. The present suit is between states, and the other jurisdictional requirements being satisfied, the individual parties whose presence is necessary or proper for the determination of the case or controversy between the states are properly made parties defendant. Cf. United States v. West Virginia, \n295 \nU.S. 463, 470\n, 55 S.Ct. 789, 791. So that our constitutional authority to hear the case and grant relief turns on the question whether the issue framed by the pleadings constitutes a justiciable 'case' or 'controversy' within the meaning of the Constitutional provision, and whether the facts alleged and found afford an adequate basis for relief according to accepted doctrines of the common law or equity systems of jurisprudence, which are guides to decision of cases within the original jurisdiction of this Court. See Robinson v. Campbell, 3 Wheat. 212, 222, 223; Pennsylvania v. Wheeling & Belmont Bridge Co., 18 How. 460, 462; Irvine v. Marshall, 20\u00f5how. 558, 564, 565; Payne v. Hook, 7 Wall. 425, 430.\n Before the Constitution was adopted a familiar basis for the exercise of the extraordinary powers of courts of equity was the avoidance of the risk of loss ensuing from the demands in separate suits of rival claimants to the same debt or legal duty. Alnete v. Bettam, Cary, 65 (1560); Hackett v. Webb and Willey, Finch 257 (1676); \n\n[306 \nU.S. 398, 406]\n\u00a0\n see 9 Viner Abr., 419-440; 1 Spence, The Equitable Jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery, 659; Maclennan, Law of Interpleader, 5 et seq. Since, without the interposition of equity, each claimant in pursuing his remedy in an independent suit might succeed and thus subject the debtor or the fund pursued to multiple liability, equity gave a remedy by way of bill of interpleader, upon the prosecution of which it required the rival claimants to litigate in a single suit their ownership of the asserted claim. A plaintiff need not await actual institution of independent suits; it is enough if he shows that conflicting claims are asserted and that the consequent risk of loss is substantial. Evans v. Wright, 13 W.R. 468; Michigan Trust Co. v. McNamara, 165 Mich. 200, 130 N.W. 653, 37 L.R.A.,N.S ., 986; Webster v. Hall, 60\u00f5n.H. 7; Thomson v. Ebbets, 1 Hopk. Ch., N.Y., 272; Dorn v. Fox, 61 N.Y. 264; Yarborough v. Thompson, 3 Smedes & M. 291, 11 Miss. 291, 294, 41 Am.Dec. 626; 4 Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence (4th ed .)  1319-1329, 1458-1482; Maclennan, supra, 119.\n The peculiarity of the strict bill of interpleader was that the plaintiff asserted no interest in the debt or fund, the amount of which he placed at the disposal of the court and asked that the rival claimants be required to settle in the equity suit the ownership of the claim among themselves. But as the sole ground for equitable relief is the danger of injury because of the risk of multiple suits when the liability is single, Farley v. Blood, 30 N.H. 354, 361; Bedell v. Hoffman, 2 Paige, N.Y., 199, 200; Mohawk & Hudson R.R. v. Clute, 4 Paige, N.Y., 384, 392; Atkinson v. Manks, 1 Cow., N.Y., 691, 703; Story, Equity Pleadings (10th ed.)  291, 292, and as plaintiffs who are not mere stakeholders may be exposed to that risk, equity extended its jurisdiction to such cases by the bill in the nature of interpleader. The essential of the bill in the nature of interpleader is that it calls upon the court to exercise its jurisdiction to guard against the risks of loss \n\n[306 \nU.S. 398, 407]\n\u00a0\n from the prosecution in independent suits of rival claims where the plaintiff himself claims an interest in the property or fund which is subjected to the risk. The object and ground of the jurisdiction are to guard against the consequent depletion of the fund at the expense of the plaintiff's interest in it and to protect him and the other parties to the suit from the jeopardy resulting from the prosecution of numerous demands, to only one of which the fund is subject. While in point of law or fact only one party is entitled to succeed, there is danger that recovery may be allowed in more than one suit. Equity avoids the danger by requiring the rival claimants to litigate before it the decisive issue, and will not withhold its aid where the plaintiff's interest is either not denied or he does not assert any claim adverse to that of the other parties, other than the single claim, determination of which is decisive of the rights of all.

Shubert Theatrical Co., D.C., 238 F. 225, affirmed, 2 Cir ., 247 F. 256; Illingworth v. Rowe, 52 N.J.Eq. 360, 28 A. 456; Carter v.

See Nashville, C. & St. L.R. v. Wallace, \n288 \nU.S. 249\n, 261 et seq., 53 S.Ct. 345, 347, 87 A.L.R. 1191, and cases cited.\n Here it is conceded by the pleadings and upon brief and argument that the sole legal basis asserted by the four states for the imposition of death taxes on decedent's intangibles is his domicile at death in the taxing state. There is no question presented of a situs of decedent's intangibles differing, for tax purposes, from the place of his domicile, such as was considered in City of New Orleans v. Stempel, \n175 \nU.S. 309\n, 20 S.Ct. 110; Safe Deposit & Trust Co. of Maryland v. Virginia, 280\u00f5u.S. 83, 50 S.Ct. 59, 67 A.L.R. 386; Beidler v. South Carolina Tax Commission, \n282 \nU.S. 1, 8\n, 51 S.Ct. 54, 55; First National Bank v. Maine, \n284 \nU.S. 312, 331\n, 52 S.Ct. 174, 178, 77 A.L.R. 1401; Wheeling Steel Corporation v.

Stokes, 173 Tenn. --, 118 S.W.2d 228, probable jurisdiction noted, Long v. Stokes, 59 S.Ct. 152, 83 L.Ed. --, Nov. 14, 1938; In re Brown's Estate, 274 N.Y. 10, 8 N.E.2d 42, certiorari granted, Graves v. Elliott, \n305 \nU.S. 667\n, 59 S.Ct. 151, 83 L.Ed. --, November 14, 1938. And no determination made here as to domicile can hereafter foreclose the determination of such questions by any court of competent jurisdiction in which they may arise. By the law of each state a decedent can have only a single domicile for purposes of death taxes, and determination of the place of domicile of decedent will determine which of the four states is entitled to impose the tax on intangibles so far as they have no situs different from the place of domicile. No relief is sought to restrain collection of the tax or to interfere with the determination of its amount by appropriate state procedure.\n The Special Master has found that each of the four states in good faith asserts that the decedent was domiciled within it at his death; that prior to the commencement of these proceedings each state in good faith was preparing to enforce a lien on decedent's intangibles \n\n[306 \nU.S. 398, 409]\n\u00a0\n wherever located and would now be taking appropriate action but for these proceedings; and that the net estate is not sufficient to pay the aggregate amount of the taxes claimed by them and by the federal government. \n2\n He has \n\n[306 \nU.S. 398, 410]\n\u00a0\n also found, as averred in the pleadings, that none of the four states has become or will consent to become a party to any proceedings for determining the right to collect the tax in any other state; that the right of Texas to assert its tax lien and to prosecute its claim for taxes with success is in jeopardy and that it is without adequate remedy save in this Court.\n The risk that decedent's estate might constitutionally be subjected to conflicting tax assessments in excess of its total value and that the right of complainant or some other state to collect the tax might thus be defeated was a real one, due both to the jurisdictional peculiarities of our dual federal and state judicial systems and to the special circumstances of this case. That two or more states may each constitutionally assess death taxes on a decedent's intangibles upon a judicial determination that the decedent was domiciled within it in proceedings binding upon the representatives of the estate, but to which the other states are not parties, is an established principle of our federal jurisprudence. Thormann v. Frame, \n176 \nU.S. 350\n, 20 S.Ct. 446; Overby v. Gordon, \n177 \nU.S. 214\n, 20 S.Ct. 603; Burbank v. Ernst, \n232 \nU.S. 162\n, 34 S.Ct. 299; Baker v. Baker, Eccles & Co., \n242 \nU.S. 394\n, 37 S.Ct. 152; Iowa v. Slimmer, \n248 \nU.S. 115, 120\n, 121 S., 39 S.Ct. 33, 34; Worcester County Trust Co. v. Riley, \n302 \nU.S. 292, 299\n, 58 S.Ct. 185, 187. And a judgment thus obtained is binding on the parties to it and constitutionally entitled to full faith and credit in the courts of every other state. Milwaukee County v. M. E. White Co., \n296 \nU.S. 268\n, 56 S.Ct. 229, 80.Ed. 220. The equity jurisdiction being founded on avoidance of the risk of loss resulting from the threatened prosecution of multiple claims, the risk must be appraised in the light of the circumstances as they are in good faith alleged and shown to exist at the time when the suit was brought. Cf. Clark v. Wooster, \n119 \nU.S. 322\n, 7 S.Ct. 217; Rice & Adams v. Lathrop, \n278 \nU.S. 509\n, 49 S.Ct. 220; Maclennan, supra, 132 et seq. In this case, as will presently be noted, the relations of decedent to each of the \n\n[306 \nU.S. 398, 411]\n\u00a0\n demanding states was such as to afford substantial basis for the claim that he was domiciled within it, with fair probability that the claim would be accepted and favorably acted upon if there were no participation by the other states in the litigation. See New Jersey v. Pennsylvania, \n287 \nU.S. 580\n, 53 S.Ct. 313; Hill v. Martin, \n296 \nU.S. 393\n, 56 S. Ct. 278; Dorrance's Estate, 309 Pa. 151, 163 A. 303, certiorari denied, Dorrance v. Pennsylvania, \n287 \nU.S. 660\n, 53 S.Ct. 222; Id., \n288 \nU.S. 617\n, 53 S.Ct. 507; In re Dorrance, 115 N.J.Eq. 268, 170 A. 601; Dorrance v. Thayer-Martin, 116 N.J. L. 362, 184 A. 743, certiorari denied, \n298 \nU.S. 678\n, 56 S.Ct. 949. Cf. Matter of Trowbridge, 266 N.Y. 283, 194 N.E. 756. In addition the facts most essential to establishing that attitude and relationship of person to place which constitute domicile were in this case obscured by numerous self-serving statements of decedent as to his domicile, which, because made for the purpose of avoiding liability for state income and personal property taxes levied on the basis of domicile, tended to conceal rather than reveal the true relationship in this case. Taken as a whole the case is exceptional in its circumstances and in the principles of law applicable to them, all uniting to impose a risk of loss upon the state lawfully entitled to collect the tax.\n We think that the Special Master's finding of jeopardy is sustained; that a justiciable 'case' between the states is presented; and that a cause of action cognizable in equity is alleged and proved. The fact that no relief by way of injunction is sought or is recommended by the Special Master does not militate against this conclusion. While in most causes in equity the principal relief sought is that afforded by injunction, there are others in which the irreparable injury which is the indispensable basis for the exercise of equity powers is prevented by a mere adjudication of rights which is binding on the parties. This has long been the settled practice of this Court in cases of boundary disputes between states. State of Louisiana v. Mis- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 398, 412]\n\u00a0\n sissippi, \n202 \nU.S. 1\n, 26 S.Ct. 408; Arkansas v. Tennessee, \n246 \nU.S. 158\n, 38 S.Ct. 301, L.R.A.1918D, 258; Georgia v. South Carolina, \n257 \nU.S. 516\n, 42 S.Ct. 173; Oklahoma v. Texas, \n272 \nU.S. 21\n, 47 S.Ct. 9; Michigan v. Wisconsin, \n272 \nU.S. 398\n, 47 S.Ct. 114; New Jersey v. Delaware, \n291 \nU.S. 361\n, 54 S.Ct. 407. In the case of bills of peace, bills of interpleader and bills in the nature of interpleader, the gist of the relief sought is the avoidance of the burden of unnecessary litigation or the risk of loss by the establishment of multiple liability when only a single obligation is owing. These risks are avoided by adjudication in a single litigation binding on the parties.\n While courts of equity in such suits may and frequently do give incidental relief by injunction to secure the full benefits of the adjudication and to terminate the litigation in a single suit, they are not bound to do so and their adjudication of the conflicting claims is not any the less effective as res judicata because not supplemented by injunction. We do not doubt that when the equity powers of the Court have been invoked it has power in its discretion to give such incidental relief by way of injunction as will make its determination the effective means of avoiding risk of loss to any of the parties by reason of the asserted multiple tax liability. But the plenary effect of its decision as res judicata, and considerations of convenience in the levying of the tax by the usual state procedure, make it unnecessary and undesirable that the Court should proceed beyond adjudication. The fact that the Court, for reasons of policy or convenience, does not exercise the power which it possesses and which has been traditionally exercised in like cases between private suitors does not deprive the suit of its character as a case or controversy cognizable by the Court in an original suit. See Fidelity National Bank & Trust Co. v. Swope, \n274 \nU.S. 123, 132\n, 133 S., 134, 47 S.Ct. 511; Nashville, C. & St. L.R. v. Wallace, supra. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 398, 413]\n\u00a0\n Domicile.\n The Special Master took voluminous testimony in each of the four states, recording every available fact having any bearing on the issue of decedent's domicile. After an exhaustive study of the evidence the Special Master has prepared elaborate subsidiary findings in which he has stated what he considers to be the essential facts of decedent's life which, taken together, were the controlling factors in his arriving at the conclusion that decedent, at the time of his death, was domiciled in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\n In considering and weighing the evidence the Special Master concluded that there was no local law peculiar to any of the states with respect to the essential fact elements which go to establish domicile, and that the rule in each of the states defining domicile was substantially that of the common law. Texas, since Green in the earlier part of his life lived for a large part of his time in that state and frequently proclaimed it to be his legal residence, places great emphasis on the common law rule that when one has once acquired a domicile in one place he does not lose it by mere residence elsewhere without the intention to make the new place of residence a domicile in the sense of a permanent home. The defendant states, as they were all places in which decedent lived for considerable periods of time during the latter part of his life, and as they were all places with which he then became more intimately associated, place greater emphasis on 'home' as the substantial equivalent of domicile as the term is defined in the American Law Institute's Restatement of Conflict of Laws ,  13, where it is said: 'A home is a dwelling place of a person, distinguished from other dwelling-places of that person by the intimacy of the relation between the person and the place. ... In \n\n[306 \nU.S. 398, 414]\n\u00a0\n determining whether a dwelling-place is a person's home, consideration should be given to:\n'1. Its physical characteristics;\n\n'2. The time he spends therein;\n\n'3. The things he does therein;\n\n'4. The persons and things therein;\n\n'5. His mental attitude towards the place;\n\n'6. His intention when absent to return to the place.\n\n'7. Elements of other dwelling-places of the person concerned.'\n\n The Special Master, while not completely adopting either of the tests proposed, nevertheless finds that both support his conclusion. We accept the Special Master's findings of fact and his conclusion that the decedent at the time of his death was domiciled in Massachusetts. As the Master has found and stated in great detail the circumstances of decedent's life which lead to that conclusion, and has made them available in his report, we find it unnecessary to do more than state the salient facts which are typical of and supported by many others, and which support his ultimate conclusion.\n Edward Green was born in England August 22, 1868 and was in his sixty- eighth year at the time of his death, June 8, 1936, at Lake Placid, New York, where he was temporarily sojourning for reasons of health. He was the son of Hetty Green, a well-known figure in the financial world, who was born in New Bedford, Massachusetts. Her forebears had resided in that vicinity since the seventeenth century, and Green and his sister Mrs. Wilks inherited from her one hundred and thirty acres of land in the town of Dartmouth, which had been the family home and had been property of the family for some two hundred years. The foundation of the family fortune had been laid in the whaling industry, centering at New Bedford. At her death his mother left an estate of $67,000,000 \n\n[306 \nU.S. 398, 415]\n\u00a0\n which, under her will, became the property of decedent and his sister in substantially equal shares.\n His education was in the public schools of Vermont and New York, and for two years he attended Fordham University in New York City. His tastes were not artistic or literary; he had a deep interest in scientific study and experimentation, especially in the fields of astronomy, geology, electricity, photography, radio and aviation. He was fond of the sea and of yachting, and until a serious illness in 1921, followed by permanent impairment of his health, he was interested in athletics and outdoor life. After that time he became especially interested in collecting stamps, coins, currency, and jewels, to which he devoted much attention. He had no interest in fashionable or social life, but preferred, as he stated, associating with the common man or 'the man in the street'.\n In 1892, when he was twenty-four years old, his mother sent him to Texas to foreclose a mortgage on a short line of railroad located there, later known as the Texas Midland Railroad. As the result of the foreclosure she acquired the railroad, and for the larger part of Green's time until 1911 he remained in Texas for the purpose of looking after the management of the road. In that year he returned to live in New York at the urgent request of his mother, who, because of failing health, desired his assistance in the management of her business affairs.\n From 1911 until 1921 Green customarily made two trips a year to Texas, one to attend the annual meeting of the railroad and the other to inspect the road, and in alternate years to vote in Terrell, Texas, in state and municipal elections. From 1922 to 1927 he made but one annual visit, in the spring of each year. After 1923 he spent only two or three days on each visit to Texas, in Terrell and its vicinity. In the years 1924 to 1927 he visited Marlin, Texas, where he remained for about a month each \n\n[306 \nU.S. 398, 416]\n\u00a0\n year for purposes of medical treatment. In 1928 the railroad was sold. After the agreement for sale was made in 1927, he made no other visit to Dallas or Terrell, and his only visit to Texas was in 1935, for treatment at a clinic in Marlin.\n During the period of his residence in Texas, decedent was a bachelor and maintained domestic establishments at various places. He at first lived in a hotel. About 1894 he maintained a bachelor apartment at Terrell. For a time he also kept rooms at a hotel in Dallas and then about 1896 or 1897 leased an apartment in that city. Later he purchased a building there which he remodelled and occupied as a dwelling until 1911, when the building was sold. After that he caused a friend to rent a room for him in Terrell, Texas, admittedly for the purpose of preserving his right to vote in Texas. The room was never occupied by him nor were any of his possessions sent there, except a box containing a pair of trousers and a vest. He also owned a two hundred acre experimental farm near Terrell where there were living quarters which he occasionally used. The farm was afterwards sold, and from 1911 on he had no dwelling place in Texas except his private railroad car, which was sold with the road in 1927-1928. Upon his removal to New York in 1911 all of the best furniture in the Dallas residence was packed and shipped to New York for use in his dwelling there. His library of books on scientific subjects was given to the Dallas Public Library. At the time of his death his only real property in Texas consisted of some unsaleable lots pertaining to the railroad which were appraised at $2,200.\n During the period of his residence in Texas, aside from his active interest in the management of the railroad he became interested in scientific and farm experimentation. He also became active in Texas politics, was a Texas delegate to the Republican National Convention at St. Louis, and became Chairman of the Republican State Executive \n\n[306 \nU.S. 398, 417]\n\u00a0\n Committee, serving in that capacity for four years, and upon re-election until 1900. In 1906 the nomination for Governor of Texas on the Republican ticket was offered him, but he declined the nomination upon the insistence of his mother. He was appointed a colonel upon the Texas Governor's Staff and served in that capacity until January, 1915. Prior to 1911 and until 1920\u00f5he voted in Texas in state and national elections.\n Green frequently expressed himself as being attached to the state and to its people. With few exceptions and in substantially all deeds, papers, and legal documents he described himself as of Terrell, Texas, and instructed his secretary and office manager and his attorneys in New York, Massachusetts, and Florida, to mention in all important legal documents that Terrell was his legal residence. He continued this practice until 1935. In his will, executed in 1908, in his application for a marriage license in 1917, and in the probate proceedings connected with his mother's estate, 1916-1918, he was described as of Terrell, Texas. In 1922 he declined to consider running for Congress in Massachusetts because he claimed to be a resident of Texas. In 1929 he stated he would not be available for appointment as Federal Radio Commissioner from New England because he was a former Republican National Committeeman of Texas and spent only the summer months in New England. In 1935 he testified under oath in Florida that his residence was Texas, with a winter home in Florida and a summer home in New Bedford. In that year he returned to the Texas Centennial Committee a certificate which described him as of Massachusetts, with the statement: 'I have never changed my legal residence from Terrell, Texas'.\n If declarations were alone sufficient to establish domicile, the record would leave no doubt that Green was domiciled in Texas until the time of his death. But in this connection it should be noted that Green never paid \n\n[306 \nU.S. 398, 418]\n\u00a0\n an income tax or a personal property tax on intangibles in any state, and the Special Master was of opinion that the desire to avoid taxation was a controlling motive for Green's repeated declarations that he was a resident of Texas long after he had ceased to have an abiding place or any active connection with affairs in that state.\n In July, 1911, Green removed his household belongings to New York City, where he established his dwelling place in a house at 5 West 90th Street, which was owned by the estate of his grandfather and adjoined a house occupied by his mother. He opened an office in New York City, which remained his business headquarters until his death, and with his mother maintained a joint office in her residence. When Green came to New York his mother settled upon him, as his own, property valued at $500,000. Upon her death in 1916 he became entitled to an interest in the estate of his grandfather aggregating $4,500,000, and under the will of his mother he became entitled to the income of one-half of her estate for a period of ten years, when he received one-half of the principal, aggregating about $ 33,000,000.\n Following his mother's death he was married, on July 10, 1917, to Miss Mabel Harlow. The following winter they removed from the 90th Street house to an apartment in the Waldorf Hotel, where they lived when in New York until the hotel was demolished in 1921. Then they removed to the Sherry Netherlands Hotel, where they rented and used a large suite. He at first took a two year lease on the apartment, but from May 1, 1931, the rental was continued on a monthly basis. The apartments were furnished by the hotels; decedent's furniture, pictures, and personal belongings, much of which he had brought from Texas, remained at 5 West 90th Street until 1921, when most of them were removed to decedent's place at Round Hills, Massachusetts. In 1928 the remainder was sent to Round Hills and the New York house demolished. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 398, 419]\n\u00a0\n During the last ten years of his life his apartment in New York was used only as a temporary stopping place on his trips north and south. At his death the family belongings in the apartment consisted of some of his mother's letters, a portion of his stamp collection, his interest in which had been slight since 1927, some clothing of Mrs. Green's, and a few personal belongings worth less than $1,000. His tangible personal property in New York at the time of his death consisted principally of his collection of jewels, coins, currency and stamps, having an aggregate value of $1,583,221.\n Green never registered or attempted to vote in New York. In 1916 he was assessed there for personal property taxes, but the assessment was cancelled upon his submission of affidavits declaring that his legal residence was in Texas. To the suggestion of a friend made in 1917 that he build a home on Long Island, he replied that he did not want to do so as he did not wish to pay taxes in New York. And later he stated that he desired to build on his mother's place at Round Hills in Massachusetts. During the period from 1911 to 1921 he was active in business affairs in New York. He managed his own fortune, which amounted to approximately $6, 000,000 after his mother's death. He also assisted in managing her extensive business interests and after her death was actively engaged as executor and trustee in looking after her large estate, including several family-owned holding corporations. Decedent became a director of a New York National Bank and a director of two important trust companies and regularly attended their meetings and participated in their affairs until about 1921. He maintained large deposit balances in New York banks; his personal securities were kept in safe deposit vaults there. He did not enjoy New York life and sometimes expressed dislike of its people and business practices. After his illness in November, 1921, all his activities there ceased. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 398, 420]\n\u00a0\n He never thereafter attended trustee's or directors' meetings, or went to his New York office.\n After his marriage in 1917 Green spent a part of the summer near Round Hills, Massachusetts, in the vicinity of Dartmouth, which was the property he had inherited from his mother. On his first visit on a yachting trip in 1917 he determined to develop the property into a large country estate and build there an imposing residence. With that in view and with the consent and approval of his sister he began to develop the property in the fall of that year by clearing the land, constructing breakwaters, wharves, water tanks, pumping plant, greenhouses and workmen's cottages. From then until 1921 development of the property was his principal interest and occupation. While the work was going forward decedent spent much time on his yacht or at a hotel in the vicinity. In July of 1921 the house was ready for occupancy, and from then until shortly before his death he spent more time there almost every year than at any other place, usually coming to Round Hills immediately after July 1st, evidently because taxes were assessed as of that date, and remaining just short of six months each year.\n Between 1917 and 1926 Green expended on the Round Hills estate in excess of $6,688,000. To the land inherited from his mother he added by purchase one hundred and forty adjoining acres. The house was large and imposing-indeed, somewhat 'institutional' in appearance, there having apparently been some thought, which he never carried out, of converting it into an institution as a memorial to the Green and Howland families after his own and his sister's death. Upon the property were some sixty structures, including the usual outbuildings of a large country estate, swimming pools, tennis courts, radio broadcasting stations, an airport, airship hangar and dock. The house was designed as a commodious residence, with \n\n[306 \nU.S. 398, 421]\n\u00a0\n carefully planned accommodations for family, guests, and for a full complement of servants.\n Special furniture was designed for the house, but furnishings from 5 West 90 th Street in New York were also brought to it, including family possessions and heirlooms, two oil portraits of his mother, another of his grandfather, personal collections of prints and engravings of whaling ships and scenes, and framed certificates of his membership in various historical societies. Green assembled there a well chosen library of miscellaneous and scientific books, including many rare volumes on the history of New England and accounts of the whaling industry, on which the family fortune had been founded. In a vault in the basement was assembled a substantial part of his collection of jewelry, coins, and stamps.\n In the social life of the countryside he took no part, but he associated freely with employees and tradesmen and visitors interested in scientific research. He developed on a large scale his interest in various scientific activities, especially photography, radio, and aviation. A number of his buildings and radio facilities were placed at the disposal of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for experimental purposes, and he contributed his own funds to the cost of experiments. On his property he established an airport and a school for aviators. He arranged to have the 'Charles W. Morgan', an old whaling ship, transferred to Whaling Enshrined, Inc., to which he gave a strip of the shore at Round Hills where he established the vessel and maintained it as a museum which he kept open to the public. His grounds and bathing beach were also opened to the public, members of which visited them in large numbers.\n Owing to his failing health most of these activities, though not his interest in them, were curtailed during the last three years of his life, but he continued to spend most \n\n[306 \nU.S. 398, 422]\n\u00a0\n of the summer and the early fall at Round Hills until the year of his death, and all of his personal and intimate belongings remained there. He told a friend that he hoped to be there when he died; and his remains were brought there from Lake Placid for the funeral service. Green never voted in Massachusetts or openly acknowledged Round Hills as his legal residence, invariably giving as his reason that he wished to avoid paying taxes there. When a demand was made upon him by Massachusetts officials for payment of income tax in 1928, he declined to file a return on the ground that his legal residence was Terrell, Texas. No income or personal property tax on intangibles was paid by him in Massachusetts.\n In 1923 he was advised by his physician, following an operation and illness, to go to Florida. He spent the following winter there in hotels or upon boats in the vicinity of Miami and Jacksonville. In April, 1924, he bought land on Star Island, near Miami Beach, and began landscaping work and construction of a dock. In January, 1925, he returned to Miami Beach, living on a houseboat near Star Island for about three and a half months. While there he purchased additional lots and began the construction of a dwelling.\n Part of the following winter was spent on his houseboat near Star Island, and the house was finally completed and occupied as a winter residence in 1927. In the following years, until his death, he spent about four and a half months each winter at Star Island, between January and May. The house, costing over $600,000, was fully equipped as a winter residence, with ample accommodations for family, guests, and servants. His total expenditures there amounted to about $1,500,000. The house was furnished with new specially made furniture, and it contained, with negligible exceptions, no pictures, books, furniture, or mementos of intimate personal or family association. As in his other places of residence, he took \n\n[306 \nU.S. 398, 423]\n\u00a0\n little part in the social life of the community. In Florida he never carried on any of the activities or experiments with which he had occupied himself in Texas or Massachusetts. His life in Florida was typical, on the whole, of a semi-invalid seeking health there during the winter months. He busied himself for the most part with automobile rides, cruising in nearby waters, and in working on his collections, parts of which he had brought with him from Massachusetts.\n Green occasionally spoke to friends of Florida as his home, saying to one: 'This is my home and I expect to live here the rest of my days'. He never voted in Florida or paid intangible property taxes there, although subject to such taxes if a resident; in 1933 he declared to the local tax assessor that his legal residence was in another state. In 1931 and again in 1933 he was advised by a friend to change his legal residence from Texas to Florida because of pending tax legislation in Texas. His attorney suggested that as he had a residence in Florida it would only be necessary to make announcement of his intention. But he took no such action and in March of 1935 testified in a judicial proceeding in Florida that Texas was his legal residence.\n The four persons nearest to decedent in life, his wife, his sister, his office manager, and his secretary, were able to throw little light on his purposes and intention with respect to his domicile. Mrs. Green, who was a party to the present suit, asserted by her answer that Texas was the domicile of herself and her husband. After settlement with Mrs. Wilks, the sister, of her claims upon the estate, the suit was discontinued as to Mrs. Green. There is nothing in the record to indicate that she has since claimed or resumed her domicile in Texas. On the contrary, she remained at Round Hills for six months after Green's death. The Special Master concluded that her position with reference to her husband's domicile was in \n\n[306 \nU.S. 398, 424]\n\u00a0\n fluenced by the advantages which might accrue to her from the community property laws of Texas. The sister, by her answer in this case as well as in the New York proceeding where she claimed under her brother's will, in which he declared Texas to be his legal residence, denied that her brother was a resident of Texas, and in this proceeding she asserts that his domicile at the time of his death was in Massachusetts. Neither his wife nor his sister has given any evidence to explain the inconsistency between Green's declarations and his actions or the conflict between themselves upon the issue of domicile. All decedent's books and papers were made available by his office manager, who testified that from the inception of their business association in New York until decedent's death, he claimed Texas as his legal residence and gave instructions that in all formal documents his permanent residence be stated as Texas. His secretary testified to the same effect. Neither was able to give any intimation of the real intention behind decedent's declarations and actions except what may be inferred from his evident desire and frequently announced purpose to escape or minimize taxes.\n Residence in fact, coupled with the purpose to make the place of residence one's home, are the essential elements of domicile. Mitchell v. United States, 21 Wall. 350; Pannill v. Roanoke Times, D.C., 252 F. 910; Beekman v. Beekman, 53 Fla. 858, 43 So. 923; Babcock v. Slater, 212 Mass. 434, 99 N.E. 173; Matter of Newcomb, 192 N.Y. 238, 84 N.E. 950; Beale, Conflict of Laws,  15.2. We conclude, as the Special Master found, that Green ceased to have a place of residence in Texas after 1911. About 1914 he gave up his nominal place of abode in the room which he had rented in Terrell, Texas, and which in fact he had never occupied. After that he was never identified in fact with any place of residence in Texas, and there was \n\n[306 \nU.S. 398, 425]\n\u00a0\n nothing in his life to connect him with a Texas home other than his frequent statements that his legal residence was in Texas. While one's statements may supply evidence of the intention requisite to establish domicile at a given place of residence, they cannot supply the fact of residence there; Matter of Newcomb, supra, page 250, 84 N.E. 950; Matter of Trowbridge, 266 N.Y. 283, 292, 194 N.E. 756; and they are of slight weight when they conflict with the fact. Feehan v. Tax Com'r, 237 Mass. 169, 171, 129 N.E. 292; Dorrance's Estate, 309 Pa. 151, 163 A. 303. This is the more so where, as here, decedent's declarations are shown to have been inspired by the desire to establish a nominal residence for tax purposes, different from his actual residence in fact. Thayer v. Boston, 124 Mass. 132, 26 Am.Rep. 650; Feehan v. Tax Com'r, supra; Matter of Trowbridge, supra; Beale, supra,  41C. In such circumstances the actual fact as to the place of residence and decedent's real attitude and intention with respect to it as disclosed by his entire course of conduct are the controlling factors in ascertaining his domicile. Thayer v. Boston, supra. When one intends the facts to which the law attaches consequences, he must abide the consequences whether intended or not. National City Bank v. Hotchkiss, \n231 \nU.S. 50, 56\n, 34 S.Ct. 20, 21; Dickinson v. Brookline, 181 Mass. 195, 196, 63 N.E. 331, 92 Am.St.Rep. 407.\n Whatever floating intention Green may have had after 1911 to return to Texas and to make his home there, it is plain that it receded into the background after his mother's death and had completely vanished when he began to build up his extensive estate at Round Hills in Massachusetts. When he had established himself there all the circumstances of his life indicated that his real attitude and intention with respect to his residence there were to make it his principal home or abiding place to the exclusion of others. This is clearly indicated by the fact \n\n[306 \nU.S. 398, 426]\n\u00a0\n that it was the place most associated with his family history, by the scale on which he built, by his assembling there the furnishings and objects closely associated with his earlier homes and with his family life, and by centering there all the activities related to his chief interests- his mechanical and scientific experiments, his development of radio and aviation, and his efforts to preserve records and mementos of the whaling industry with which his mother's family had been associated. He spent more time there than at any other place, evidently curtailing his stays only to avoid the possible danger of being subjected to Massachusetts taxation. His conception of legal residence or domicile as a mental state whereby he could obtain certain political advantages and freedom from taxation does not weigh against this conclusion. He could not elect to make his home in one place in point of interest and attachment and for the general purposes of life, and in another, where he in fact had no residence, for the purpose of taxation. Feehan v. Tax Com'r, supra, page 171, 129 N.E. 292; Matter of Trowbridge, supra.\n There is little to support the contention that Green ever intended to make his permanent home in New York. The exigencies of caring for his mother and her property and of managing her estate after her death demanded his presence there. But apart from these demands life there gave him no opportunity to gratify his special tastes and interests. The nearest semblance to a home there, 5 West 90th Street, was abandoned when he removed its furnishings to Round Hills. After that New York saw little of him, and there was little in his life to suggest that he treated it or in his own mind regarded it as his real home or abiding place. Whatever his purpose may have been before that time, after the occupancy of the Round Hills residence the physical facts of residence united with the major interests of his life to fix upon that as his place \n\n[306 \nU.S. 398, 427]\n\u00a0\n of domicile. gilbert v. David, \n235 \nU.S. 561, 570\n, 35 S.Ct. 164, 167. In point of fact and purpose it became his 'pree minent headquarters', which is the essence of technical domicile. Williamson v. Osenton, \n232 \nU.S. 619, 625\n, 34 S.Ct. 442, 443.\n The retention of his apartment at the Sherry Netherlands Hotel in New York, upon temporary lease, and his occupation of it during the later years of his life for short stays when passing through New York on his way to and from Florida, are without weight to turn the scales against the preponderating evidence that his real home was in Massachusetts. From 1921 on the New York apartment furnished none of the physical aspects of a home, and evidence is wanting that the deceased ever regarded or treated it as such.\n Proof is wanting also that the domicile established in Massachusetts was abandoned in favor of the Florida house which he built there in 1927. Florida argues the superior attractiveness and merits of that state for purposes of a home over the more austere environment of Round Hills, but there is little in the record to suggest that such an appeal was persuasive to decedent or that Round Hills had ceased to be what it became when he established himself there-first in his interest and attachment. In such circumstances Florida carries the burden of showing that the earlier domicile was abandoned in favor of a later one. Mitchell v. United States, supra, 21 Wall. page 352; Anderson v. Watt, \n138 \nU.S. 694, 706\n, 11 S.Ct. 449, 452; Matter of Newcomb, supra, page 250, 84 N.E. 950; Beale, supra,  41A. That burden is not sustained by showing a period of winter residence there in obedience to the demands of health, in the absence there of the activities associated with decedent's chief interests and of the objects of those interests and of intimate family association, with which he had surrounded himself at Round Hills.\n The report of the Special Master is confirmed. The substance of the Special Master's recommendation for a \n\n[306 \nU.S. 398, 428]\n\u00a0\n decree will be adopted and the parties may submit a proposed form of decree. So ordered.\n Report of Special Master confirmed.\n Opinion of Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER.\n The authority which the Constitution has committed to this Court over 'Controversies between two or more States', serves important ends in the working of our federalism. But there are practical limits to the efficacy of the adjudicatory process in the adjustment of interstate controversies. The limitations of litigation-its episodic character, its necessarily restricted scope of inquiry, its confined regard for considerations of policy, its dependence on the contingencies of a particular record, and other circumscribing factors-often denature and even mutilate the actualities of a problem and thereby render the litigious process unsuited for its solution. Considerations such as these have from time to time led this Court or some of its most distinguished members either to deprecate resort to this Court by states for settlement of their controversies (see New York v. New Jersey, \n256 \nU.S. 296, 313\n, 41 S.Ct. 492, 497 ), or to oppose assumption of jurisdiction (see Mr. Chief Justice Taney in Pennsylvania v. Wheeling Bridge Co., 13 How. 518, 579, 592; in connection with the Act of August 31, 1852, 10 Stat. 112, and Pennsylvania v. Wheeling & B. Bridge Co., 18 How. 421; Mr. Justice Brandeis in Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, \n262 \nU.S. 553, 605\n, 43 S. Ct. 658, 668, 32 A.L.R. 300).1\n The presupposition of jurisdiction in this case is the common law doctrine of a single domiciliary status. That \n\n[306 \nU.S. 398, 429]\n\u00a0\n for purposes of legal rights and liabilities a person must have one domicile, and can have only one, is an historic rule of the common law and justified by much good sense. Nevertheless, it often represents a fiction. Certainly in many situations the determination of a man's domicile is by no means the establishment of an event or a fact that exists in nature. Even assuming that there is general agreement as to the elements which in combination constitute domicile, a slight shift of emphasis in applying the formula produces contradictory results. But, on the whole, the doctrine of domicile has adequately served as a practical working rule in the simpler societies out of which it arose. More particularly, its difficulties of application were circumscribed when wealth predominantly consisted of realty and tangibles, and when restricted modes of transportation and communication conditioned fixity of residence. In view of the enormous extent to which intangibles now constitute wealth, and the increasing mobility of men, particularly men of substance, the necessity of a single headquarters for all legal purposes, particularly for purposes of taxation, tends to be a less and less useful fiction. In the setting of modern circumstances, the inflexible doctrine of domicile-one man, one home-is in danger of becoming a social anachronism. Recent applications and modifications of this rule to satisfy the vague contours of the due process clause have hardly mitigated its inadequacies for our day. E.g., Frick v. Pennsylvania, \n268 \nU.S. 473\n, 45 S.Ct. 603, 42 A.L.R. 316; Blodgett v. Silberman, \n277 \nU.S. 1\n, 48 S.Ct. 410; Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. v. Minnesota, \n280 \nU.S. 204\n, 50 S.Ct. 98, 65 A.L.R. 1000; First National Bank v. Maine, \n284 \nU.S. 312\n, 52 S.Ct. 174, 77 A.L.R. 1401\n\n\n The facts in this case doubtless present a bizarre story. But in Green's peregrinations from state to state, in the multiplicity of his residences, and in the conflicting appeals which various states made upon his interests from \n\n[306 \nU.S. 398, 430]\n\u00a0\n time to time, the case is hardly unique nor are analogues to it unlikely to appear in the future. As a result, this Court is asked to determine the conflicting claims of different states of the Union to a share of the estate of individuals who, as a matter of hard fact, at different periods and contemporaneously invoked and enjoyed such benefits as the existence of state governments confer. It is asked to do so by applying an old doctrine of limited validity to modern circumstances whereby, through the elusive search for an often non-existent fact called domicile, only one state to the exclusion of all others would be allowed to levy a tax. The inherent difficulties of this problem have been widely recognized. \n2\n The old formulas are simply inadequate to the new situation. On the other hand, it is not for this Court in these cases of multiple residences to evolve new taxing policies based on more equitable considerations than the all-or- nothing consequence of the old domiciliary rule.\n I am not unaware of the dilemma presented by such a situation as the Dorrance litigation. \n3\n The circumstances attending the Green estate do not preclude like possibilities. But merely because no other means than litigation have as yet been evolved to adjust the conflicting \n\n[306 \nU.S. 398, 431]\n\u00a0\n claims of several states in a single estate is not sufficient reason for utilizing as a basis of our jurisdiction oversimplified formulas of the past that have largely lost their relevance in the contemporary context.\n The controlling assumption in taking jurisdiction in this case is that the ascertainment of a single domicile for Green is merely the determination of a fact. The auxiliary assumption is the existence of solid danger that the highest courts of four states will ascertain this fact in four different ways. Texas has no standing here except on the basis that three state courts will despoil her of her rights by leaving no assets in the estate out of which to satisfy her claim. But the fact that the political officers of four states make claims to an estate so as to safeguard any possible interest, is hardly a substantial reason for assuming that their judiciaries will sanction the claims.\n It is not to be assumed that the state courts will make findings dictated solely by fiscal advantages to their states. The contrary assumption must be made-and the assumption rests on adjudicated experience, e.g., Matter of Trowbridge, 266 N.Y. 283, 194 N.E. 756. To the extent that there is danger that out of the same events four state courts will spell four different domiciles, it is inherent in the search for a domiciliary status. The result is arrived at not through ascertainment of an external fact but by attributions made as a matter of law to satisfy the supposed abstract legal requirement of a single domicile no matter what the actualities of human behavior may be. Even a small change of portions in the admixture of factors which in combination yield the legal concept of domicile, may place the domicile in one state rather than another and, thereby, give estate duties to this state rather than that. But the state treasuries are not alone under powerful motives to exploit the doctrine of domicile. The tax systems of different states have varying degrees of attraction for those in control of an estate, and it is to \n\n[306 \nU.S. 398, 432]\n\u00a0\n their natural interest to seek a single, inclusive disposition of the elusive issue of domicile by having the original jurisdiction of this Court invoked.\n It is hardly an answer that this Court can protect itself against feigned controversies. The difficulty is that in these modern multiple residence situations the issue of domicile is too often an inherently feigned issue. Two state courts can very legitimately find two different domiciles, in that two equally competent tribunals utilizing the same outward facts in the alembic of the same common law concept of domicile may easily distil contradictory conclusions. Merely to avoid such a conflict is not enough to give jurisdiction. \n4\n The variant that this case presents is the allegation that if the claims of all four states prevail the estate would be more than eaten up and Texas would lose her potential right. This added requirement-the absorption of the entire estate by having numerous states stake out claims-is too readily supplied.\n To extend the neat procedural device of interpleader to such a situation is another illustration of transferring a remedy from one legal environment to circumstances qualitatively different. To settle the interests of different claimants to a single res where these interests turn on narrow and relatively few facts and where conflicting claims cannot have equal validity in experience, is one thing; it is a wholly different thing to bring into court \n\n[306 \nU.S. 398, 433]\n\u00a0\n in a single suit all states which even remotely might assert domiciliary claims against a decedent and where one state court might with as much reason as another find domicile within its state. Certainly when the claim of the moving state is so obviously without basis as this Court has now found in the case of Texas, the linchpin of jurisdiction is gone and the other states should be remitted to appropriate remedies outside this Court. Such a disposition would be a real safeguard against the construction of a suit to give this Court jurisdiction over matters which as such, this Court has already held, are not within our province. \n5\n To find that the decedent could not, on self-serving grounds, elect to make his home in Texas 'where he in fact had no residence' and yet to retain the bill and dispose of it on its merits amounts, in effect, to a declaration of rights on behalf of the estate which could not be adjudicated otherwise than through the screen of a controversy between states.\n In this case we do not even have substantial translation into effective legal action of the assertions by the four states of their domiciliary claims. To be sure, the Master has found, as summarized in the Court's opinion, 'that each of the four states in good faith asserts that the decedent was domiciled within it at his death.' This is a natural attitude of prudence on the part of law officers of states in the case of decedents who had scattered their lives as well as their holdings. But to give this Court the extraordinary jurisdiction which is invoked, there ought to be more than these caveats. There should be manifestation of that hard determination to press a state's claim which is implied in setting the tax-collecting machinery of a state in motion. Allegation, affirmative proof, and finding of such attempts by the various states are lacking. And New York denies without contradic- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 398, 434]\n\u00a0\n tion that its procedure for tax levy and collection has been set in operation. \n6\n These circumstances are, therefore, not comparable to the issues in a conventional interpleader suit brought to forestall conflicting actions. Initiation of litigation is, of course, not a prerequisite to an ordinary interpleader. This only serves to emphasize the inappropriateness of utilizing a remedy invented to settle private controversies of limited scope to the resolution of conflicting governmental interests.\n Jurisdictional doubts inevitably lose force once leave has been given to file a bill, a master has been appointed, long hearings have been held, and a weighty report has been submitted. And so, were this the last as well as the first assumption of jurisdiction by this Court of a controversy like the present, even serious doubts about it might well go unexpressed. But if experience is any guide, the present decision will give momentum to kindred litigation and reliance upon it beyond the scope of the special facts of this case. To be sure, the Court's opinion endeavors to circumscribe carefully the bounds of jurisdiction now exercised. But legal doctrines have, in an odd kind of way, the faculty of self-generating extension. Therefore, in pricking out the lines of future development of what is new doctrine, the importance of these issues may make it not inappropriate to indicate difficulties which I have not been able to overcome and \n\n[306 \nU.S. 398, 435]\n\u00a0\n potential abuses to which the doctrine is not unlikely to give rise.\n I am authorized to say that Mr. Justice BLACK concurs in these views and in the conclusion that the bill should be dismissed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The allegations are that on July 28, 1936, decedent's wife was appointed temporary administratrix of decedent's estate in Texas on an allegation that Green had died intestate and was domiciled at death in Texas; that on August 1, 1936, a proceeding was begun by decedent's sister in the Surrogate's Court of Essex County, New York, for the probate of decedent's will and for her confirmation as the executrix named in the will, in which proceeding she alleged that decedent, a non-resident of New York, had died there, leaving personal property located in the state, and in which proceeding a temporary administrator was appointed and decedent's wife and the New York Tax Commissioner entered their appearances; that on August 31, 1936, decedent's wife commenced an action in the United States District Court for northern Texas against decedent's sister to determine the rights of the former in the estate of decedent by reason of an alleged antenuptial agreement which purported to exclude the wife from any interest in decedent's property; that on October 21, 1936, on application of the Massachusetts Commissioner of Corporations and Taxation, a special administrator of the estate of decedent was appointed by a Massachusetts probate court to take possession of and conserve decedent's property in that commonwealth; and that on January 4, 1937, the County Judges' Court of Dade County, Florida, appointed decedent's widow administratrix of the estate of her husband located in Florida. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The Special Master has found as follows: The net estate, after payment of debts and administration expenses other than death taxes, will amount to $36,137,335; and the tangible property taxable in the state of its situs is as follows:\n Texas $ 2,220.00 Florida 222,276.00 New York 1,583,221.00 Massachusetts 2,498,707.00\n Decedent's intangibles at the time of his death had a value of $35, 831,303. The paper evidences of decedent's intangibles were located outside of the states of Texas, Florida, and Massachusetts. 'The aggregate value of the shares of stock in and obligations of corporations and associations organized or having a principal place of business in Texas, Massachusetts and Florida, respectively, and of the obligations of persons residing in said States and of the obligations of said States and political subdivisions thereof, together with the value of the real estate and tangible property in Texas, Massachusetts and Florida, respectively, is less than the amount of the tax claimed by each of said States and the amount of such tax claimed by Texas, Massachusetts, and Florida, respectively, greatly exceeds the value of the property subject to the jurisdiction of their respective Courts and from which the tax might be collected in any proceeding in said Courts.' The Special Master found that the death taxes due to the United States, and due to each state, if its contentions be sustained, are as follows:\n United States $ 17,520,987 Texas 4,685,057 Florida 4,663,857 New York 5,910,301 Massachusetts 4,947,008 Total $37,727,213\n This exceeds the total net estate by the sum of $1,589,877. In addition the State of New York asserts a claim for unpaid personal income taxes of $920,827. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The spirit in which interstate litigation should be approached has been thus expressed by Mr. Chief Justice Fuller in State of Louisiana v. Texas, \n176 \nU.S. 1, 15\n, 20 S.Ct. 251, 256: 'But it is apparent that the jurisdiction is of so delicate and grave a character that it was not contemplated that it would be exercised save when the necessity was absolute and the matter in itself properly justiciable.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Interstate Commission on Conflicting Taxation, Conflicting Taxation ( 1935) 88 et seq.; Compare League of Nations Documents, E.F.S. 16.

The decision of the Court therefore binds the states upon an issue of state law which this Court could not consider upon appeal from the state courts, and on which this Court would be bound to follow state law in all other proceedings instituted in the federal courts. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] See note 4, supra. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] 'As yet, no one of the States has assessed and levied any death tax against the estate, and, if the matter were left to the ordinary procedure for the assessment of such taxes in the various States, it is highly improbable that determinations would be made in all of the States that Green was domiciled therein. In New York State, the only administrative official who has authority to determine whether or not the estate tax is assessable on the theory that Green was a resident of the State is the Surrogate of one of the counties and thus far no Surrogate has acted in this respect.'

VAN COTT(1939)\nNo. 491\nArgued: Decided: March 27, 1939\n\n\n\n Mr. Irwin Arnovitz, of Salt Lake City, Utah, for petitioners. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 511, 512]\n\u00a0\n Mr. W. Q. Van Cott, of Salt Lake City, Utah, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The State of Utah's income tax law, effective in 1935, exempts all 'Amounts received as compensation, salaries or wages from the United States ... for services rendered in connection with the exercise of an essential governmental function.' \n1\n (Italics supplied.) In his return of income taxes to the State for 1935 under this law, respondent claimed 'as deduction' and 'as exempt' \n\n[306 \nU.S. 511, 513]\n\u00a0\n salaries paid him as attorney for the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and the Regional Agricultural Credit Corporation, both Federal agencies. The exemptions were denied by the Tax Commission of Utah, but the Utah Supreme Court reversed. \n2\n Before the Commission and in the Supreme Court of Utah, respondent asserted, first, that his salaries were exempt by the terms of the State statute itself, and, second, that they could not be taxed by the State without violating an immunity granted by the Federal Constitution. In holding respondent's income not taxable, the Supreme Court of Utah said: 'We shall have to be content to follow, as we think we must, the doctrine of the Graves Case (New York ex rel. Rogers v. Graves, \n299 \nU.S. 401\n, 57 S.Ct. 269), until such time as a different rule is laid down by the courts, the Congress, or the people through amendment to the Constitution.' \n3\n The Graves case applied the doctrine that the Federal Constitution prohibits the application of State income taxes to salaries derived from Federal instrumentalities. We granted certiorari, in the present case, because of the importance of the principle of Constitutional immunity from State taxation which the Utah court apparently thought controlled its judgment. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n Respondent contends that the Utah Supreme Court's decision 'was based squarely upon the construction of the Utah taxing statute which was held to omit respondent's salaries as a subject of taxation, and therefore that decision did not and could not reach the Federal question and should not be reviewed.' But that decision cannot be said to rest squarely upon a construction of the State statute. The Utah court stated that the question before it was whether respondent's salaries from the agencies in question were 'taxable income for the purpose of the \n\n[306 \nU.S. 511, 514]\n\u00a0\n state income tax law,' and that the answer depended upon whether these agencies exercised 'essential governmental functions.' But the opinion as a whole shows that the court felt constrained to conclude as it did because of the Federal Constitution and this Court's prior adjudications of Constitutional immunity. Otherwise, it is difficult to explain the court's declaration that respondent could not be taxed under the 'doctrine of the Graves Case, until such time as a different rule is laid down by the courts, the Congress, or the people through amendment to the Constitution.' (Italics supplied.) If the court were only incidentally referring to decisions of this Court in determining the meaning of the State law, and had concluded therefrom that the statute was itself intended to grant exemption to respondent, this Court would have no jurisdiction to review that question. \n5\n But, if the State court did in fact intend alternatively to base its decision upon the State statute and upon an immunity it thought granted by the Constitution as interpreted by this Court, these two grounds are so interwoven that we are unable to conclude that the judgment rests upon an independent interpretation of the State law. \n6\n Whatever exemptions the Supreme Court of Utah may find in the terms of this statute, its opinion in the present case only indicates that 'it thought the federal Constitution (as construed by this Court) required' it to hold respondent not taxable. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n[306 \nU.S. 511, 515]\n\u00a0\n After careful review of this Court's decisions on the question of intergovernmental immunity, the State court concluded that the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and the Regional Agricultural Credit Corporation were 'instrumentalities' performing 'essential governmental duties' and that State taxation of respondent's salaries violated the Federal Constitution as interpreted by the Graves case. Anticipating that this Court might re-examine that interpretation and apply a 'different test', the State court said that 'Until such is done, the states are bound by the decision of the Supreme Court in New York ex rel. Rogers v. Graves, supra.'\n We have now re-examined and overruled the doctrine of New York ex rel. Rogers v. Graves in Graves v. New York ex rel. O'Keefe, \n306 \nU.S. 466\n, 59 S. Ct. 595, 83 L.Ed. --, this day decided. Salaries of employees or officials of the Federal Government or its instrumentalities are no longer immune, under the Federal Constitution, from taxation by the States. Whether the Utah income tax, by its terms, exempts respondent, can now be decided by the State's highest court apart from any question of Constitutional immunity, and without the necessity, so far as the Federal Constitution is concerned, of attempting to divide functions of government into those which are essential and those which are non-essential.\n'We have frequently held that in the exercise of our appellate jurisdiction we have power not only to correct error in the judgment under review but to make such disposition of the case as justice requires. And in determining what justice does require, the Court is bound to consider any change, either in fact or in law, which has supervened since the judgment was entered. We may recognize such a change, which may affect the result, by setting aside the judgment and remanding the case so that the state court may be free to act. We have said that to do this is not to review, in any proper sense of the \n\n[306 \nU.S. 511, 516]\n\u00a0\n term, the decision of the state court upon a non-federal question, but only to deal appropriately with a matter arising since its judgment and having a bearing upon the right disposition of the case.'8\n\n Applying this principle, we vacate the judgment of the Supreme Court of Utah and remand the cause to that court for further proceedings.\n Judgment vacated.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Revised Stat. of Utah, 1933, 80-14-4, (2)(g). \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 79 P.2d 6. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] 79 P.2d 14. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] \n305 \nU.S. 592\n, 59 S.Ct. 358, 83 L.Ed. --. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Miller v.

Semple, of Tulsa, Okl., for respondent debtor corporation.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question presented is whether the District Court abused its discretion in approving the compromise of a claim by a parent against a subsidiary corporation and a \n\n[306 \nU.S. 307, 309]\n\u00a0\n plan of reorganization based upon the compromise, in proceedings under Section 77B of the Bankruptcy Act. \n1\n The Circuit Court of Appeals, by a divided court, approved the District Court's order. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The petitioners are a committee for the protection of preferred stockholders. The respondents are the trustee of the debtor, Deep Rock Oil Corporation (a Delaware corporation whose business was that of producing, refining, and selling gasoline, oil, and other petroleum products, from lands located in Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, and Arkansas), a reorganization committee, representing note-holders and certain holders of preferred stock, and Standard Gas and Electric Company, which owns practically all of the common stock of the debtor, claiming as a creditor.\n The debtor was organized in 1919 to take over the properties then being operated by one C. B. Shaffer. \n3\n Standard Gas & Electric Company, hereinafter called Standard, then had investments in various utility properties but had never been interested in oil. Byllesby & Company, hereinafter called Byllesby, an investment banking corporation which controlled Standard, entered into a contract with Shaffer whereby he was to organize the debtor corporation and to be paid by that corporation for his properties $15,580,000 made up of cash, a note, and preferred and common stock of the company. Byllesby agreed to purchase $11,000,000 par value of first mortgage bonds of an authorized issue of $15,000,000, $5, 000,000 par value of preferred stock, and 120,000 shares of common stock, par $1, for $15,200,000 in cash, to be applied by the company to the cash payments to be made to Shaffer and for working capital. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 307, 310]\n\u00a0\n Shaffer received for the properties turned over by him 80,000 shares of common stock, 50,000 shares of $100ar preferred stock, $9,500,000 in cash and a note of Byllesby and Standard for $1,000,000. In fact $12,000, 000 of the first mortgage bonds were underwritten by a syndicate formed by Byllesby and sold to the public. The result of the above transactions was to leave Deep Rock with approximately $6,700,000 of cash. Shortly thereafter the remaining $3,000,000 of bonds were pledged to secure Deep Rock's notes for $2,000,000. From its organization Deep Rock was, most of the time, 'two jumps ahead of the wolf', as one of Standard's officers testified. The common stock went into a voting trust which gave Standard and Shaffer equal control. Shaffer undertook the management of the properties and business. After two years Standard became dissatisfied with Shaffer's management and he severed his connection with the company selling his common stock to Standard and surrendering to Deep Rock 50,000 shares of preferred stock which was cancelled.\n Thenceforward the debtor was under the complete control and domination of Standard through ownership of the common stock. Standard's officers, directors, and agents always constituted a majority of the Board. The remaining directors were operating officers or employes of Deep Rock who had been employed on behalf of Deep Rock by Standard or the Byllesby Management Corporation, hereafter called Management Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Standard, or were under the complete control of Standard. A majority of Deep Rock's officers were officers or directors of Standard or of the Management Corporation, or of both. The officers of the debtor, who were chosen for their technical or business experience in the oil industry, although allowed some discretion in the matter of development and operation of the oil properties, reported to and were always subject to the direction of officers and directors of Standard. All \n\n[306 \nU.S. 307, 311]\n\u00a0\n of the fiscal affairs of the debtor were wholly controlled by Standard, which was its banker and its only source of financial aid.\n Deep Rock was placed in the hands of a receiver in March 1933 and the present proceeding under Section 77B of the Bankruptcy Act was instituted in June 1934. Standard filed a claim as a creditor in the receivership and in the bankruptcy proceedings, which the receivers and the trustee resisted. The claim was referred to a master, before whom trial lasted many months. All the witnesses were officers, directors or agents of Standard, or its affiliates, and officers of the debtor. All the documentary evidence came from the books and records of Standard and Deep Rock. The basis of claim was an open account which embraced transactions between Standard and Deep Rock from the latter's organization in 1919 to the receivership in 1933. The account consists of thousands of items of debit and credit. The book entries were made under the direction of Standard's auditing department, which supervised the auditing department of Deep Rock, and it is not surprising, therefore, that the books of the two companies agree with respect to all items.\n The account contains debits to Deep Rock in excess of $52,000,000 and credits of approximately $43,000,000 leaving a balance shown to be due Standard of $9,342,642.37, which was the amount of the claim presented. Cash payments by Standard to Deep Rock, or to others for its account, as shown by the books, total $31,804,145.04. Management and supervision fees paid or credited to Management Corporation amount to $1,219,034.83. Interest charges by Standard to Deep Rock on open account balances total $ 4,819,222.07. Rental charges upon a lease to Deep Rock of oil properties owned by a Standard subsidiary but claimed by petitioners to belong, in equity, to Deep Rock, amount to $4,525,000. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 307, 312]\n\u00a0\n Debits by Standard to Deep Rock of the amounts of dividends declared by Deep Rock to Standard, but not paid, reach the sum of $3,502,653. In addition there are hundreds of debits and credits representing other inter- company items.\n Two preferred stockholders were permitted to intervene in the proceedings and they joined in the trustee's objections to the claim. Many transactions entered in the account were attacked as fraudulent and it was asserted that as Standard had made Deep Rock its mere agent or instrumentality it could not transmute itself from the status of the proprietor of Deep Rock's business to that of creditor. The hearings before the master were closed, but before he made any report, and as a result of negotiations initiated by the reorganization committee organized at the instance of Byllesby, representing approximately eighty-two per cent. of the noteholders and sixty per cent. of the preferred stockholders of Deep Rock, Standard proposed a compromise of its claim.\n The court referred the proposal to the master who reported favorably. The trustee and his counsel also recommended the approval of the compromise, which involved the allowance of Standard's claim at $5,000,000. In contemplation of the approval of this compromise a reorganization of Deep Rock was proposed by the reorganization committee. The plan was based upon the trustee's appraisal of the debtor's assets at $16,800,000, of which $7,300,000 represented net current assets, mainly cash, and the remainder comprised fixed assets valued at $9,500,000. It provided that upon approval of the compromise of Standard's claim, the reorganization would be effected by the formation of a new company which would take over the debtor's assets and would issue $10,000,000 par value of fifteen year six per cent. income debentures which were to go to the holders of the debtor's unpaid notes of like amount; 25,000 shares of $7 cumu- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 307, 313]\n\u00a0\n lative preferred stock and 520,000 shares of no par common stock, of which the entire preferred stock and 390,000 shares of common should go to Standard on account of its claim, 80,000 shares of common to the noteholders, and 50,000 shares of common to the preferred stockholders of the old company. Standard's claim to the extent of $3,500,000 was to stand on a parity with the debtor's notes.\n In the District Court the petitioners insisted that as the testimony before the master had been closed he should be required to pass upon the provability of Standard's claim and no reorganization plan should be considered until the validity of the claim had been adjudicated. The court, without passing on this demand, refused to approve the compromise or the plan of reorganization. Referring to the 50,000 shares of preferred stock outstanding, the judge stated that somebody had received the money represented by this stock from the public; that the plan in effect wiped out preferred stockholders and that he could not approve any plan which had this effect. In the course of the hearing he stated: 'The evidence is overwhelming that Standard ran this company; they officered it; they capitalized it; it is just a child in their hands, and if there ever was a case the law is clear on, it is nothing but an instrumentality, according to the admissions.' He indicated, however, that he would approve a plan according Standard a parity with the noteholders for a smaller proportion of its claim allowing the balance on a parity with the preferred stockholders, and suggested that the parties negotiate further in an effort to reach a fair result.\n Months later the reorganization committee presented an amended plan which, as modified by the Court, contemplated the compromise of Standard's claim at $5,000,000, as before, and the organization of a new company which should issue $10,000,000 par value of deben \n\n[306 \nU.S. 307, 314]\n\u00a0\n tures and 520,000 shares of common stock. These securities were to be distributed as follows: The new issue of debentures was to go to the holders of the old notes. In lieu of interest on the old notes accumulated to January 1, 1937, totaling $2,300,000, the noteholders were to receive $ 1,200,000 in cash and 40,000 shares of common stock; interest accruing subsequent to January 1, 1937, was to be paid in cash. The old preferred stockholders were to receive 100,000 shares of common stock and Standard was to receive for its claim 380,000 shares of common stock. Thus there was allocated to Standard approximately seventy-three per cent., to the old preferred stockholders nineteen per cent., and to the noteholders eight per cent. of the common stock. The District Court permitted the petitioners to intervene and, over their objections, approved the compromise and the plan. A majority of the Circuit Court of Appeals examined the record only to the extent of determining that it was possible that Standard might establish its claim in whole or in part, and concluded that the District Court had not exceeded the bounds of reasonable discretion in granting its approval. One judge thought that the instrumentality rule was applicable; that, under the rule, Standard had no provable claim; and that it was an abuse of discretion to approve the compromise and the reorganization plan. We agree with the conclusion of the dissenting judge, but for different reasons.\n The petitioner insist that the appraisal upon which the plan was based was inordinately low and that, for this reason alone, the plan should not have been approved. The appraisal was supported by substantial evidence and the values shown by it were approved and adopted by the District Court and by the Circuit Court of Appeals. We accept the concurrent findings of the two courts that the value of the debtor's assets does not exceed $17,000,000. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 307, 315]\n\u00a0\n As the debentures to be issued to the noteholders, plus the cash they are to get, total $11,200,000, the equity remaining in the property is not over $5,800,000. Standard's share of this equity will be seventy-three per cent., or $4,234,000, and will give it complete control of the new company. The preferred stockholders will receive nineteen per cent. or $1,020,000,- a minority interest without representation on the board of directors. The question is whether, within the bounds of reason and fairness, such a plan can be justified. We think the history of Standard's dealings with Deep Rock requires a negative answer.\n Without going into the minutiae of the transactions between the two companies, enough may be stated to expose the reasons for our decision. As has been stated, Standard came into complete control of Deep Rock in 1921. From the outset Deep Rock was insufficiently capitalized, was topheavy with debt and was in parlous financial condition. Standard so managed its affairs as always to have a stranglehold upon it.\n At organization Deep Rock had cash working capital of only about $6, 600,000 and a mortgage indebtedness of $12,000,000, the interest and sinking fund requirements of which were nearly $2,000,000 a year. Its assets at that time were appraised at about $16,000,000. Shortly thereafter it created a further note issue of $2,000,000. Upon the acquirement of Shaffer's interest, in 1921, Standard caused Deep Rock to issue short term notes of a par of $3,500,000. Deep Rock also, between 1921 and 1924, borrowed substantial sums on promissory notes some of which were discounted or subsequently taken up by Standard. So inadequate was Deep Rock's capitalization that, in the period from organization to 1926, the balance due on open account to Standard grew to more than $14,800,000. Standard determined to place some of this indebtedness of Deep Rock with the public. In order to do so it had to \n\n[306 \nU.S. 307, 316]\n\u00a0\n improve Deep Rock's balance sheet. This it did by purchasing 80,000 shares of preferred stock for which it credited Deep Rock $7,223,333.33. It then bought $7,500,000 face value two year six per cent. notes for $7,273,750, which were sold to the public through a syndicate organized by Byllesby. Deep Rock's requirements of additional capital persisted and, by the spring of 1928, the open account and a note which Deep Rock had given Standard for advances totaled over $11,000,000. As the two year notes held by the public were maturing, Standard found it necessary to make a new offering. There still remained nearly $2,000,000 of first mortgage bonds outstanding which had to be retired to make an unsecured note issue salable. Standard, therefore, determined that Deep Rock's balance sheet must again be put in such shape that notes could be sold. It accordingly purchased common stock from Deep Rock to the amount of the then open balance and commuted 90,000 shares of the preferred stock, which it held, into common. It caused Deep Rock to issue $10,000,000 of six per cent. notes which were sold by a syndicate organized by Byllesby and applied the proceeds to the redemption of the two year notes and the outstanding mortgage bonds. This financing, however, merely changed the character of Deep Rock's funded indebtedness and gave it no new working capital. This $ 10,000,000 note issue is the one now outstanding. As before, Deep Rock's resources were wholly insufficient for its business and the open account began again to build up so that between February 1928 and February 1933, the date of receivership, the account had grown to $9,342,642.37.\n No dividends were paid on preferred stock until 1926. In that and the following year existing arrearages were paid by Standard, for Deep Rock's account, in the amount of $1,435,813. Between 1928 and 1931 Standard advanced Deep Rock, for payment of preferred dividends, $1,106,706. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 307, 317]\n\u00a0\n During the period between 1926 and 1929 Deep Rock declared dividends on its common stock in a total of $3,064,685.50. Of these dividends $1,946, 672 was charged by Standard, as owner of common stock, against Deep Rock in the open account. Standard took new common stock for dividends to the amount of $1,015,437.50 and advanced Deep Rock cash to pay dividends to outside holders of common stock in the sum of $102,576. Against the total of $2,645,095 advanced by Standard to pay Deep Rock's dividends, Standard credited payments received from Deep Rock in the open account in the sum of $927,500.\n These dividends were declared in the face of the fact that Deep Rock had not the cash available to pay them and was, at the time, borrowing in large amounts from or through Standard.\n About 1922 Standard decided that, in view of the unsatisfactory progress of Deep Rock, earnings must be increased by the acquisition of additional oil properties and by the erection of a modern gasoline cracking plant. Upon recommendation of the operating officials, Standard decided that Deep Rock should purchase the so-called Bradstreet properties, the price of which was $650,000. Of this amount $500,000 was advanced by Standard for account of Deep Rock and $150,000 paid by notes of Deep Rock. Title to the property was taken in the name of J. C. Kennedy, an employe of Deep Rock, as trustee. Kennedy never executed any declaration of trust. Deep Rock charged against him not only the original purchase price of the Bradstreet properties but the moneys thereafter expended in their development and in the acquisition of additional leases, amounting, to October 1, 1925, to $1,033,294.32, much of which represented advances by Standard.\n In 1922 Deep Rock conveyed a small portion of its land to R. J. Graf, a Standard official, as trustee. Upon this land Deep Rock erected a new cracking plant at a \n\n[306 \nU.S. 307, 318]\n\u00a0\n total cost of $861,297.79. This expenditure was charged to R. J. Graf, trustee. Again part or all of the sums so expended were advanced by Standard to Deep Rock and charged against the latter.\n In 1922 Standard had caused a company to be formed in Delaware known as Deep Rock Oil and Refining Company, intending that it should take title to the Bradstreet properties and the cracking plant. The purpose, as Standard's officers now state, was to keep these assets from going into direct ownership of Deep Rock and thus coming under the lien of its mortgage, so that they could be used as the basis of additional financing. The records of the Refining Company show that its capital stock was issued against the transfer by Kennedy and Graf as trustees of the Bradstreet and cracking properties but there are no corporate records of Deep Rock or of Standard concerning any actual transfer and no book entries of Deep Rock or Standard were made concerning the supposed transfer until December 1925, as of October 1, 1925. At that time, by direction of one Brahancy, the chief accounting officer of Standard, entries were made in Standard's books and those of Deep Rock to evidence the following transaction: Standard assumed the advances made by Deep Rock for improvement of the Bradstreet properties and the cracking plant totaling $1,894,592.11 by crediting Deep Rock with that sum and Refining Company gave its note to Standard in that amount. Deep Rock also credited Kennedy, Trustee, with the $650,000 paid for the Bradstreet properties and Standard assumed this charge. The entire capital stock of Refining Company, evidencing equity ownership in the Bradstreet properties and the cracking plant, was transferred to Standard. Thus, on the face of things, Standard, through ownership of the capital stock of Refining Company, owned and controlled the Bradstreet properties and the cracking plant and put itself in such a position that, without its continued cooperation, Deep Rock could not function. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 307, 319]\n\u00a0\n As at October 1, 1925, but in fact somewhat later, at the dictation of Standard's officials, a lease was executed by the Refining Company to Deep Rock covering the properties in question whereby Deep Rock should, for the first three months, pay $75,000 per month and, for the ensuing four and three-quarters years, pay $50,000 a month to Refining Company as rental. Such rental as was paid by Deep Rock was at once declared by Refining Company as a dividend to Standard and such as was not paid was debited to Deep Rock by Standard in the open account. Under this lease, which expired October 1, 1930, Deep Rock paid, or became obligated to Standard in the total of, $3,075,000. During the term of the lease the operations of the leased properties showed a net loss of $30,401.40. The lease further provided that Deep Rock, at its own cost, should make all improvements and additions to the leased property, should make good all depreciation and return the property in the same condition as when leased. Additions to the cracking plant cost Deep Rock, during the term, $264,680. 51; and there were charged against Deep Rock in alleged fulfilment of its obligations under the lease, taxes of Refining Company and other items amounting to $192,415.91. Meantime, in two letters written bankers in connection with the sale of notes of Deep Rock, the president of Deep Rock, who was also president of Standard, made statements, and warranted their truth, to the effect that Deep Rock owned these leased properties.\n In spite of the losses entailed upon Deep Rock by the lease arrangement, Standard dictated its renewal for another term of five years commencing October 1, 1930, and from that date to the receivership Deep Rock paid, or was debited by Standard with, $1,450,000, as rental and suffered, in the operation of the properties leased, a total loss of.$1, 584,458.05. During the combined terms of the two leases Deep Rock was charged in the open account \n\n[306 \nU.S. 307, 320]\n\u00a0\n for Standard's subsidiary management corporation in payment of managerial, engineering, and financial advice, $1,020,000.\n Immediately after the last and presently outstanding note issue was sold to the public Standard's annual report, for the first time, disclosed its claim to the ownership of the Refining Company properties. At the date of the receivership Standard claimed it owned the Refining Company's properties through stock ownership, and held its note in the amount of $1, 894,592.11. The trustee in bankruptcy attacked this transaction as fraudulent and asserted Deep Rock's ownership of all the property represented by the Refining Company's stock free of any indebtedness to Standard in respect of it.\n During the whole period from 1919 to the receivership, Standard charged Deep Rock interest at the rate of seven per cent. per annum compounded monthly on the balance shown by the open account. During the entire period the Management Corporation charged Deep Rock with round annual sums for management and supervision of Deep Rock's affairs which totaled $1,219,034.83, all of which Standard assumed and charged into the open account.\n It is impossible within the compass of this opinion to detail the numerous other transactions evidenced by the books of the two companies many of which were to the benefit of Standard and to the detriment of Deep Rock. All of them were accomplished through the complete control and domination of Standard and without the participation of the preferred stockholders who had no voice or vote in the management of Deep Rock's affairs. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n[306 \nU.S. 307, 321]\n\u00a0\n The suggested basis of compromise of Standard's claim needs comment. As has been said, when, in 1928, it became necessary to refinance Deep Rock's note obligations, Standard had to wipe out the enormous and threatening credit balance in its favor on Deep Rock's books. It, therefore, took common stock in payment of the balance. It is said that the compromise figure is reached by disregarding all transactions prior to February 24, 1928, when Standard commuted its then claim, starting fresh from that date, and considering only the items in the account thenceforward to the date of receivership. It is asserted that, during the period in question, Standard paid out, for account of Deep Rock, in cash, $ 6,850,971.50 and credited Deep Rock against these expenditures $4,475,803. 59, leaving a balance of cash advanced of $2,375,167.91, as to which there can be no question; the Bradstreet properties and the cracking plant are to be returned to Deep Rock's ownership by transfer of the stock of the Refining Company and its note now held by Standard. It is asserted that in consideration of this transfer Deep Rock ought to assume the original cost of the Bradstreet properties advanced by Standard ($650,000), plus the amount of the disbursements by Deep Rock upon those properties which Standard had credited to Deep Rock when it took over the Refining Company stock ($1,894,592.11), less rentals charged by the Refining Company to Deep Rock prior to February 24, 1928, which rentals had been absorbed in the settlement by Standard of February 24, 1928 ($1,475,000). This leaves Deep Rock owing on the Bradstreet and cracking plant accounts $1,585,485. 18. Simple interest at five per cent. is to be allowed on each of the two sums so ascertained. This brings the claim to approximately $5,000,000. It is said that this computation of the claim eliminates debits to Deep Rock made since 1928 for the fees of Management Corporation, for dividends on pre- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 307, 322]\n\u00a0\n ferred and common stock held by Standard, and for every other questionable item; and that there can be no just criticism of the recognition of Standard's claim in the amount represented by the compromise offer.\n Petitioners invoke the so-called instrumentality rule,-under which, they say, Deep Rock is to be regarded as a department or agent of Standard,- to preclude the allowance of Standard's claim in any amount. The rule was much discussed in the opinion below. It is not, properly speaking, a rule, but a convenient way of designating the application, in particular circumstances, of the broader equitable principle that the doctrine of corporate entity, recognized generally and for most purposes, will not be regarded when so to do would work fraud or injustice. This principle has been applied in appropriate circumstances to give minority stockholders redress against wrongful injury to their interests by a majority stockholder. \n5\n It must be apparent that the preferred stockholders of Deep Rock assert such injury by Standard as the basis of their attack on the decree below. We need not stop to discuss the remedy which would be available to them if Section 77B of the Bankruptcy Act had not been adopted for we think that, by that section, the court, in approving a plan, was authorized and required, as a court of equity, to recognize the rights and the status of the preferred stockholders arising out of Standard's wrongful and injurious conduct in the mismanagement of Deep Rock's affairs.\n The Section contains a provision new in bankruptcy legislation with respect to the standing of stockholders in corporate reorganization. Subsection (b) provides: 'A plan of reorganization ... (2) may include provisions modifying or altering the rights of stockholders generally, or of any class of them, either through the issuance of new \n\n[306 \nU.S. 307, 323]\n\u00a0\n securities of any character or otherwise; ....' In the present case there remains an equity after satisfaction of the creditors in which only the preferred stockholders and Standard can have an interest. Equity requires the award to preferred stockholders of a superior position in the reorganized company. The District Judge, we think, properly exercised his discretion in refusing to approve the first offer of compromise and concomitant plan because it partly subordinated preferred stockholders to Standard. The same considerations which moved him to reject that plan required the rejection of the new offer and the amended plan.\n Deep Rock finds itself bankrupt not only because of the enormous sums it owes Standard but because of the abuses in management due to the paramount interest of interlocking officers and directors in the preservation of Standard's position, as at once proprietor and creditor of Deep Rock. It is impossible to recast Deep Rock's history and experience so as even to approximate what would be its financial condition at this day had it been adequately capitalized and independently managed and had its fiscal affairs been conducted with an eye single to its own interests. In order to remain in undisturbed possession and to prevent the preferred stockholders having a vote and a voice in the management, Standard has caused Deep Rock to pay preferred dividends in large amounts. Whatever may be the fact as to the legality of such dividends judged by the balance sheets and earnings statements of Deep Rock, it is evident that they would not have been paid over a long course of years by a company on the precipice of bankruptcy and in dire need of cash working capital. This is only one of the aspects in which Standard's management and control has operated to the detriment of Deep Rock's financial condition and ability to function. Others are apparent from what has been said and from a study of the record. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 307, 324]\n\u00a0\n If a reorganization is effected the amount at which Standard's claim is allowed is not important if it is to be represented by stock in the new company, provided the stock to be awarded it is subordinated to that awarded preferred stockholders. No plan ought to be approved which does not accord the preferred stockholders a right of participation in the equity in the Company's assets prior to that of Standard, and at least equal voice with Standard in the management. Anything less would be to remand them to precisely the status which has inflicted serious detriment on them in the past.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] U.S.C.A.

John Lord O'Brian, of Buffalo, N.Y., and James Lawrence Fly, of Knoxville, Tenn., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n[306 \nU.S. 118, 134]\n\u00a0\n The Tennessee Valley Authority Act1 erects a corporation, an instrumentality of the United States, to develop by a series of dams on the Tennessee River and its tributaries a system of navigation and flood control and to sell the power created by the dams. Eighteen corporations which generate and distribute electricity in Tennessee, Kentucky, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, West Virginia, Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina, and one \n\n[306 \nU.S. 118, 135]\n\u00a0\n which transmits electricity in Tennessee and Alabama, filed a bill in equity, in the Chancery Court of Knox County, Tennessee, against the Authority and its three executive officers and directors. The prayers were that the defendants be restrained from generating electricity out of water power created, or to be created, pursuant to the Act and the Authority's plan of construction and operation; from transmitting, distributing, supplying or selling electricity so generated, or to be generated, in competition with any of the complainants; from constructing, or financing the construction of, steam or hydro-electric generating stations, transmission lines or means of distribution, which will duplicate or compete with any of their services; from regulating their retail rates through any contract, scheme or device; and from substituting federal regulation for state regulation of local rates for electric service, more especially by incorporating in contracts for the sale of electricity terms fixing retail rates. The defendants removed the cause to the United States District Court for Eastern Tennessee and there answered the bill. As required by the Act of August 24, 1937,2 a court of three judges was convened which, after a trial, dismissed the bill. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n Fourteen of the complainants are here as appellants. \n4\n They contend that water power cannot constitutionally be created in conformity to the terms of the Tennessee Valley Authority Act, and the United States will, therefore, acquire no title to it, because it will not be produced as an incident of the exercise of the federal power to im- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 118, 136]\n\u00a0\n prove navigation and control floods in the navigable waters of the nation. They affirm that the statutory plan is a plain attempt, in the guise of exerting granted powers, to exercise a power not granted to the United States, namely, the generation and sale of electric energy; that the execution of the plan contravenes the Fifth, Ninth, and Tenth Amendments of the Constitution, U.S.C.A., since the sale of electricity on the scale proposed will deprive the appellants of their property without due process of law, will result in federal regulation of the internal affairs of the states, and will deprive the people of the states of their guaranteed liberty to earn a livelihood and to acquire and use property subject only to state regulation. The appellees contest these contentions. For reasons about to be stated we do not consider or decide the issues thus mooted.\n The Authority's acts, which the appellants claim give rise to a cause of action, comprise (1) the sale of electric energy at wholesale to municipalities empowered by state law to maintain and operate their own distribution systems; (2) the sale of such energy at wholesale to membership corporations organized under state law to purchase and distribute electricity to their members without profit; (3) the sale of firm and secondary power at wholesale to industrial plants.\n The appellants are incorporated for the purpose and with the authority to conduct business as public utilities. Several do so only within the states of their incorporation; those chartered elsewhere have qualified as foreign corporations under the laws of the states in which they manufacture, transmit, or distribute electricity. Most of them have local franchises, licenses, or easements granted by municipalities or governmental subdivisions but it is admitted that none of these franchises confers an exclusive privilege. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 118, 137]\n\u00a0\n While the Authority has not built or authorized any transmission line, has not sold or authorized the sale of electricity, or contracted for, or authorized any contract for, the sale of electricity by others, in territory served by nine of the appellants, it has done some or all of these things in areas served or susceptible of service by five of the companies; and it plans to enter in the same way the territory of other appellants. It is, clear, therefore, that its acts have resulted and will result in the establishment of municipal and cooperative distribution systems competing with those of some or all the appellants in territory which they now serve, or reasonably expect to serve by extension of their existing systems, and in direct competition with the appellants' enterprises through the sale of power to industries in areas now served by them or which they can serve by expansion of their facilities. The appellants assert that this competition will inflict substantial damage upon them. The appellees admit that such damage will result, but contend that it is not the basis of a cause of action since it is damnum absque injuria,-a damage not consequent upon the violation of any right recognized by law.\n The appellants invoke the doctrine that one threatened with direct and special injury by the act of an agent of the government which, but for statutory authority for its performance, would be a violation of his legal rights, may challenge the validity of the statute in a suit against the agent. \n5\n The principle is without application unless the right invaded is a legal right,-one of property, one arising out of contract, one protected against tortious invasion, or one founded on a statute which confers a priv- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 118, 138]\n\u00a0\n ilege. \n6\n The appellants urge that the Tennessee Valley Authority, by competing with them in the sale of electric energy, is destroying their property and rights without warrant, since the claimed authorization of its transactions is an unconstitutional statute. The pith of the complaint is the Authority's competition. But the appellants realize that competition between natural persons is lawful. They seek to stigmatize the Authority's present and proposed competition as 'illegal' by reliance on their franchises which they say are property protected from injury or destruction by competition. They classify the franchises in question as of two sorts,-those involved in the state's grant of incorporation or of domestication and those arising from the grant by the state or its subdivisions of the privilege to use and occupy public property and public places for the service of the public.\n The charters of the companies which operate in the states of their incorporation give them legal existence and power to function as public utilities. The like existence and powers of those chartered in other states have been recognized by the laws of the states in which they do business permitting the domestication of foreign corporations. The appellants say that the franchise to be a public utility corporation and to function as such, with incidental powers, is a species of property which is directly taken or injured by the Authority's competition. They further urge that, though nonexclusive, the local franchises or easements, which grant them the privilege to serve within given municipal subdivisions, and to occupy streets and public places, are also property which the Authority is destroying by its competition. Since \n\n[306 \nU.S. 118, 139]\n\u00a0\n what is being done is justified by reference to the Tennessee Valley Authority Act, they say they have standing to challenge its constitutionality.\n The vice of the position is that neither their charters nor their local franchises involve the grant of a monopoly or render competition illegal. The franchise to exist as a corporation, and to function as a public utility, in the absence of a specific charter contract on the subject, creates no right to be free of competition,7 and affords the corporation no legal cause of complaint by reason of the state's subsequently authorizing another to enter and operate in the same field. \n8\n The local franchises, while having elements of property, confer no contractual or property right to be free of competition either from individuals, other public utility corporations, or the state or municipality granting the franchise. \n9\n The grantor may preclude itself by contract from initiating or permitting such competition,10 but no such contractual obligation is here asserted.\n The appellants further argue that even if invasion of their franchise rights does not give them standing, they may, by suit, challenge the constitutionality of the statutory grant of power the exercise of which results in competition. This is but to say that if the commodity used by a competitor was not lawfully obtained by it the corporation with which it competes may render it liable in \n\n[306 \nU.S. 118, 140]\n\u00a0\n damages or enjoin it from further competition because of the illegal derivation of that which it sells. If the thesis were sound, appellants could enjoin a competing corporation or agency on the ground that its injurious competition is ultra vires, that there is a defect in the grant of powers to it, or that the means of competition were acquired by some violation of the Constitution. The contention is foreclosed by prior decisions that the damage consequent on competition, otherwise lawful, is in such circumstances damnum absque injuria, and will not support a cause of action or a right to sue. \n11\n\u00a0\n\n Certain provisions of state statutes regulating public utilities are claimed to confer on the appellants the right to be free of competition. Each of the states in which any of them operates, save Mississippi,12 has established a commission to supervise and regulate public utilities. While the statutes13 differ in their provisions, all but that of Virginia require a public utility to obtain a certificate of convenience and necessity as a condition of doing business. The appellants commenced business in the various states prior to the adoption of the requirement of such certificates and, so far as appears, they have none covering their entire operations. They have, however, obtained certificates for extensions made since the passage of the statutes; and they claim that, in any event, these \n\n[306 \nU.S. 118, 141]\n\u00a0\n laws afford them protection from the Authority's competition since any utility now seeking to serve in their territory must obtain a certificate, and hence they have standing to maintain this suit against the Authority which has none. The position cannot be maintained. Whether competition between utilities shall be prohibited, regulated or forbidden is a matter of state policy. That policy is subject to alteration at the will of the legislature. \n14\n The declaration of a specific policy creates no vested right to its maintenance in utilities then engaged in the business or thereafter embarking in it.\n Moreover, the states in which the Authority is now functioning have declared their policy in respect of its activities. Alabama has enacted that federal agencies, instrumentalities, or corporations shall not be under the jurisdiction of its Public Service Commission;15 that municipalities and improvement authorities may own and operate electric generating and distributing systems and may contract with a federal agency such as the Authority for the purchase of energy, and stipulate as to the use of the energy, including rates of resale;16 that nonprofit membership corporations may be formed for the distribution among their members of electricity with like power to contract with the Authority for the required energy. \n17\n Tennessee has amended Section 5448 of its Code, which defines public utilities, so as to exclude federal corporations such as the Authority from the jurisdiction of the State Utilities Commission;18 has authorized municipalities to own and operate electric generating transmission and distribution systems and to contract for power \n\n[306 \nU.S. 118, 142]\n\u00a0\n with the Authority on terms deemed appropriate, including the fixing of resale prices;19 has authorized the formation of nonprofit membership electric corporations with like powers to contract. \n20\n Kentucky has authorized municipalities to establish and maintain light, heat, and power plants;21 and has provided for the organization of nonprofit cooperative electric corporations which may contract with the Authority for purchase of energy and stipulate as to resale prices. \n22\n Mississippi, which has no state law for regulation of utilities, has empowered municipal and county governments to establish and maintain electric distribution systems which may buy power from the Authority and contract as to resale prices;23 has created a rural electrical authority and authorized the formation of power districts and nonprofit competitives, all competent to purchase energy from the Authority and distribute it and to contract with the Authority as to resale rates to consumers. \n24\n The Authority's action in these states is consonant with state law, but, as has been shown, if the fact were otherwise, the appellants would have no standing to restrain its continuance.\n As the Authority has not acted in any way in North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia or West Virginia, the appellants' contention that its proposed entry into some or all of them confers a right to sue for an injunction against injury thereby threatened has even less support. \n25\n\u00a0\n\n[306 \nU.S. 118, 143]\n\u00a0\n The appellants may not raise any question of discrimination forbidden by the Fourteenth Amendment, Const.U.S.C.A., involved in state exemption of the Authority from commission regulation. For this reason Frost v. Corporation Commission, \n278 \nU.S. 515\n, 49 S.Ct. 235, on which they rely, is inapplicable. Manifestly there can be no challenge of the validity of state action in this suit.\n A distinct ground upon which standing to maintain the suit is said to rest is that the acts of the Authority cannot be upheld without permitting federal regulation of purely local matters reserved to the states or the people by the Tenth Amendment and sanctioning destruction of the liberty said to be guaranteed by the Ninth Amendment to the people of the states to acquire property and employ it in a lawful business. The proposition can mean only that since the Authority sells electricity at rates lower than those heretofore maintained by the appellants such sale is an indirect regulation of appellants' rates. But the competition of a privately owned company authorized by the state to enter the territory served by one of the appellants would, in the same sense, constitute a regulation of rates. The contention amounts to saying that competition by an individual or a state corporation is not regulation but competition by a federal agency is. In contracting with municipalities and nonprofit corporations the Authority has stipulated respect- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 118, 144]\n\u00a0\n ing the price at which the energy supplied shall be resold by its vendees. That is said to be a regulation of the appellant's business. But it is nothing more than an incident of competition; it is but a method of seeking and assuring a market for the power which the Authority has for sale, and a lawful means to that end. 26 The sale of government property in competition with others is not a violation of the Tenth Amendment. As we have seen there is no objection to the Authority's operations by the states, and, if this were not so, the appellants, absent the states or their officers, have no standing in this suit to raise any question under the amendment. \n27\n These considerations also answer the argument that the appellants have a cause of action for alleged infractions of the Ninth Amendment.\n Finally, it is asserted that the right to maintain this suit is sustained by certain allegations of concerted action by the officials of the Authority and the Public Works Administrator. The bill alleges that having adopted an unlawful plan the defendants have cooperated, and threaten to continue to cooperate in its execution, with Harold L. Ickes, as Administrator of the Federal Administration of Public Works, in a systematic campaign to coerce and intimidate the complainants into selling their existing systems in municipalities or territory in which the Authority desires to seize the market for electricity; that, in order to make this coercion effective, Ickes has, in cooperation with, or on request of, the Authority, announced loans and grants of federal funds to municipalities; that the Authority and Ickes have cooperated, and continue to do so, to force municipalities to purchase the \n\n[306 \nU.S. 118, 145]\n\u00a0\n Authority's power under threats that, unless they do, proposed loans and grants for municipal systems will not be made. The bill states that, though Ickes 'confederated and acted with the defendants in some of its illegal acts and is, therefore, a proper party, he is not a necessary party and is not joined as a defendant because he is beyond the jurisdiction of the court.' There is a prayer that the defendants be restrained from confederating and acting in concert with Ickes for the described ends.\n The District Court finds that the Authority has not indulged in coercion, duress, fraud, or misrepresentation in procuring contracts with municipalities, cooperatives or other purchasers of power; has not acted with any malicious or malevolent motive; and has not conspired with municipalities or other purchasers of power. The record justifies these findings. It is claimed, however, that they are inconclusive since the court erroneously excluded much proffered evidence tending to sustain the charge. An examination of the record discloses that certain of the evidence offered was properly excluded, and that in other instances the rejection of that offered constituted, at most, harmless error.\n Error is assigned to the trial court's refusal to permit the taking of the deposition of the Public Works Administrator. In view of the prior opportunity which the claimants had to take this deposition, the lateness of the application, and other factors, permission to take the deposition was a matter within the court's discretion and it does not appear that the discretion was abused.\n The remaining assignments of error directed to the exclusion of evidence of cooperation between the two federal agencies go to the rejection of evidence consisting largely of correspondence between them and press releases or announcements by officers of one or the other. The record contains all but a few of these rejected docu- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 118, 146]\n\u00a0\n ments, those omitted apparently not being thought of importance. Scrutiny of them compels the conclusion that if the rejected evidence had been admitted, the trial court's holding that a conspiracy had not been proved should not be overruled.\n The only findings on this subject requested by the appellants were to the effect that the Public Works Administration has cooperated with and assisted the Tennessee Valley Authority in the furtherance of the latter's power program and that the former has made contracts and allotments for loans and grants to twenty-three municipalities in the states of Alabama, Mississippi, and Tennessee, amounting to about fourteen million dollars, for the purpose of constructing municipal systems of distribute the Authority's power in competition with the appellants; that the applications for loan and grant in some instances specify that the municipal system will duplicate a privately owned system; in others that a large business will be done by the municipal plants because of the low promotional rates of the Authority; that some of the applications state they were filed to take advantage of the low rates offered by the Authority and that, with few exceptions, they state that the electricity to be distributed in the city will be purchased from the Authority. A further requested finding is that the applications of certain Alabama cities recite that they have secured written contracts from practically all consumers; that these contracts refer to lower rates to be secured, provided the rates charged by the city shall be thus prescribed by the Authority for resale at retail. The court refused to make the requested findings and error is assigned to this refusal. It is apparent that if the court had made the findings no conclusion of confederation or conspiracy, with malicious intent to harm the appellants or to destroy their business, would thereby have been required.\n Cooperation by two federal officials, one acting under a statute whereby funds are provided for the erection of \n\n[306 \nU.S. 118, 147]\n\u00a0\n municipal plants, and the other under a statute authorizing the production of electricity and its sale to such plants, in competition with the appellants, does not spell conspiracy to injure their business. As the court below held, such cooperation does not involve unlawful concert, plan, or design, or cooperation to commit an unlawful act or to commit acts otherwise lawful with the intent to violate a statute.\n In no aspect of the case have the appellants standing to maintain the suit and the bill was properly dismissed.\n The decree is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice REED took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER dissenting.\n The decision just announced goes too far. It excludes from the courts complainants seeking constitutional protection of their property against defendants acting, as it is alleged, under invalid claim of governmental authority in setting up and carrying on a program calculated to destroy complainants' business. The issues joined by the parties, tried below and fully presented to this Court, include the question whether, when construed to authorize the things done and threatened by defendants, the challenged enactment is authorized by the Constitution or repugnant to the Fifth, Ninth, and Tenth Amendments, U.S.C.A. The issues also include the question whether, as being applied, the Act is void because the execution of defendants' program will deprive complainants of their property without due process of law in contravention of the Fifth Amendment. This Court holds complainants have no standing to challenge the validity of the Act and puts aside as immaterial their claim that by defendants' unauthorized acts their properties are being destroyed. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 118, 148]\n\u00a0\n The opinion states: 'The Authority's acts, which the appellants claim give rise to a cause of action, comprise (1) the sale of electric energy at wholesale to municipalities empowered by state law to maintain and operate their own distribution systems; (2) the sale of such energy at wholesale to membership corporations organized under state law to purchase and distribute electricity to their members without profit; (3) the sale of firm and secondary power at wholesale to industrial plants.'\n That the substance of complainants' case may not be so compressed is disclosed by the summary of their bill that follows:\n Complainants are 19 public utilities. Each, authorized by law, is engaged in generating and selling electricity within the political subdivisions of various States. Some have long-term contracts under which they furnish large quantities of electricity. They are more than able to fill the needs of the territories in which they operate and are ready to supply such additional facilities as may be needed in the future. Their properties are modern and economically operated and possess great value as going concerns. Their rates yield no more than a reasonable return and are fully regulated by the States in which they serve.\n Defendants are the Tennessee Valley Authority, a body corporate created by the Act of May 18, 1933, with the right to sue and be sued, and its three directors, charged with the duty of exercising the powers of the Authority. Harold L. Ickes, the Administrator of the Public Works Administration, has confederated with defendants in some acts charged to be illegal; he is not sued because beyond the jurisdiction of the court. From its principal office at Knoxville, Tennessee, the Authority carries on a proprietary business as a public utility for the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in Tennessee, Mississippi, Georgia and Alabama. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 118, 149]\n\u00a0\n On its face, the Act discloses purpose to authorize a large and indeterminate number of great works for the primary purpose of creating a vast supply of electric power, to use this power to establish the United States in the business of producing, transmitting, and selling electric power, and to dispose of this power in a manner inconsistent with the principles of our dual system and so as to govern the concerns reserved to the States. Any references in the Act to navigation or to any other constitutional objective are unsubstantial and mere pretenses or pretexts under which it is sought to achieve an object reserved to the States. Except with respect to power available at Wilson Dam prior to the acts complained of, the program is one of creating an outlet for power deliberately produced as a commercial enterprise to be sold in unlawful and destructive competition with power now available in adequate quantities.\n The program contemplates ultimately the development of all power sites on the Tennessee River and all its tributaries as an integrated electric power system, the construction and operation of hydro-electric plants at these sites, the use of auxiliary steam plants, the interconnection of all plants, and the elimination of existing privately owned utilities.\n In the area of over 40,000 square miles, there are 149 water power sites which, with auxiliary steam plants, will produce 25 billion k.w.h. annually. Present consumption of the area is 56% of that quantity. The electric power to be produced by defendants can only be sold through displacement of the complainants. Execution of the program will necessarily destroy all or a substantial part of the business and property of each of the complainants.\n Defendants have taken over Wilson Dam and the nitrate plant and have commenced, or recommended to Congress, the construction of 10 other dams; their pro \n\n[306 \nU.S. 118, 150]\n\u00a0\n gram calls for 11 completed dams by July 1, 1943. They have prepared plans for the construction of high-tension transmission lines from the dams to at least 14 cities and indeed to the whole area. They have purchased or are attempting to purchase distribution systems in at least 15 cities. They have entered into contracts to sell power to various communities and industries for a 20-year period and have agreed to supply firm power to other and larger cities.\n The avowed purpose of the program is to effect a federal regulation of intrastate electric rates and service by a so-called 'yardstick' method or 'regulation by competition'. The yardstick for wholesale rates is the wholesale rate charged by the Authority. It is unreasonable and confiscatory as a measure of complainants' rates in that it excludes the cost of the major part of the investment necessary to render the service and excludes necessary operating expenses. The yardstick for retail rates is the sum of the wholesale rate and the amount which the Authority allows municipalities to add to the wholesale rate to cover cost of local distribution; it excludes many items of necessary cost of rendering the service.\n Pursuant to a plan promulgated in 1933, defendants are conducting a systematic campaign for the purpose of disrupting the established business relations between complainants and their customers, destroying the good will built up by complainants, seizing their markets and inciting the residents of communities served by them to cooperate with defendants in their scheme to develop an absolute monopoly.\n With full knowledge of the noncompensatory and confiscatory character of the yardstick rates, they have represented to the inhabitants of communities served by complainants that these 'yardsticks' were fair measures of reasonable rates and have thereby attempted to incite the \n\n[306 \nU.S. 118, 151]\n\u00a0\n inhabitants to build publicly owned systems using power furnished by the Authority, to lead them to believe that they are being charged unreasonable rates, to stir up political agitation against privately owned utilities and to bring complainants into disrepute and disfavor.\n The defendants attempt to coerce complainants to sell distribution systems and transmission lines, in territories which defendants intend to appropriate, at prices far below fair value by threatening that, unless complainants accede, they will construct, or cause to be constructed, duplicate facilities subsidized in construction and operation by federal funds and render complainants' properties wholly valueless. The Administrator of the Public Works Administration has cooperated with defendants. Defendants inform the owners that, unless they sell, either the Authority or the municipalities will build duplicate systems with federal funds. At defendants' request, the Administrator authorizes and announces a gift to the municipality of from 30% to 45% of the cost of the duplicate system and agrees to lend the balance, repayable out of earnings, if any, of the duplicate plant, upon condition that the municipality will agree to use power of the Authority and will, as soon as possible, oust the existing utility. If the utility agrees to sell, the allotments are canceled without regard to the will of the municipality. This policy has already been applied in certain cities. The defendants and Administrator also cooperate to force municipalities to agree to purchase power furnished by the Authority by threats that otherwise federal allotments for public works will be canceled or denied.\n Defendants have caused bills, designed to forward their power program, to be submitted to the legislatures of various States in the area and have lobbied for and brought about their passage. They have installed Authority personnel throughout the area to disseminate \n\n[306 \nU.S. 118, 152]\n\u00a0\n propaganda in behalf of the program. The Electric Home and Farm Authority, a corporation set up as a governmental agency of which the individual defendants are directors, finances sale of electrical devices, prints and circulates costly advertising in praise of the Authority program. Defendants have offered to supply electricity to large industrial customers of some of the complainants at noncompensatory and discriminatory rates. They have attempted to persuade complainants' customers to break existing contracts. Complainants cannot meet this competition because of the noncompensatory rates and because they are forbidden by state law to make discriminatory rates.\n The bill prays invalidation of the Act as unconstitutional and injunction and other relief against defendants.\n Unquestionably, the bill shows that complainants are not asserting a right held or complaining of an injury sustained in common with the general public. They allege facts that unmistakably show that each has a valuable right as a public utility, non-exclusive though it is, to serve in territory covered by its franchise, and that, inevitably the value of its business and property used will suffer irreparable diminution by defendants' program and acts complained of. If, because of conflict with the Constitution, the Act does not authorize the enterprise formulated and being executed by defendants, then their conduct is unlawful and inflicts upon complainants direct and special injury of great consequence. Therefore, they are entitled to have this Court decide upon the constitutional questions they have brought here. See Massachusetts v. Mellon, \n262 \nU.S. 447, 488\n, 43 S.Ct. 597, 601; Frost v.

Ohio, \n273 \nU.S. 510, 515\n, 47 S.Ct. 437, 438, 50 A.L.R. 1243. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 282, 285]\n\u00a0\n Petitioner brought the New York suit in December, 1925, alleging that he was the owner of a quarter interest in two hundred and fifty shares of the stock of an Ohio corporation which respondent here, the defendant there, had fraudulently appropriated to his own use. The relief sought was that respondent be directed to deliver to petitioner certificates of stock representing his interest in the corporation and to account for the dividends and earnings on the stock received by respondent. Respondent appeared personally and defended the suit. It was twice tried in the Supreme Court of New York and was five times before the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, 222 App.Div. 17, 225 N.Y.S. 263; 277 App.Div. 789, 237 N.Y.S. 908; 235 App.Div. 662, 255 N.Y.S. 905; 240 App.Div. 818, 266 N. Y.S. 969; 244 App.Div. 789, 280 N.Y.S. 969, and once before the New York Court of Appeals, 260\u00f5n.Y. 519, 184 N.E. 75, which affirmed a judgment establishing the liability of respondent. An accounting, at the end of nine years of litigation, resulted in the final judgment sued upon, which was affirmed by the Appellate Division. 244 App.Div. 789, 280\u00f5n.Y.S. 969.\n The present record discloses that after entry of this judgment London Wallick, a brother of respondent, brought suit in the Supreme Court of New York to recover from petitioner a share of the judgment pursuant to a contract alleged to have been entered into by him with London Wallick on or about November 23, 1925. In resisting a motion made in that suit for an injunction restraining petitioner from disposing of the judgment or its proceeds, petitioner prepared and filed an affidavit reciting that on or before November 23, 1925, he had informed London Wallick that he had already assigned his interest in the claim against respondent to his wife and to Walter Titus, his brother, and asserting that 'it does \n\n[306 \nU.S. 282, 286]\n\u00a0\n not lie within the jurisdiction of this court to enjoin what has already been accomplished'.\n The assignment by petitioner and a later reassignment of the claim to him were introduced in evidence in the present suit. The assignment, dated March 31, 1924, purported to 'sell, assign, transfer and set over unto' Walter Titus 'any and all claims' which petitioner then had against respondent. The reassignment, described by its terms as an 'Agreement', bears date December 1, 1925, prior to the suit brought by petitioner against respondent in New York. It recites that the earlier assignment was made upon an oral agreement that Walter Titus was to 'use any funds that might be derived' from the claim to the two hundred and fifty shares of stock to pay certain indebtedness of petitioner and that petitioner 'wishes to institute an action against' respondent 'to recover said stock.' It states that Walter Titus 'does hereby sell, assign, transfer and set over' to petitioner 'all his right, title and interest' in the claim and appoints petitioner his attorney to collect the claim. It further recites an agreement between the assignor and petitioner that the latter will turn over the proceeds of the claim to the assignor, who agrees, after paying the expenses of collection, to pay over one-half of the net recovery to petitioner's wife, to discharge certain indebtedness of petitioner, and to pay the balance to him.\n The Ohio Court of Appeals disagreed with the conclusion of the trial court that petitioner's affidavit in the London Wallick suit conclusively established that petitioner had no interest in the claim prosecuted against respondent in New York. It held that his interest was to be ascertained by examination of the reassignment from Walter Titus to petitioner. But interpreting that document in the light of the New York law it concluded that the reassignment was no more than a power of attorney authorizing petitioner to collect the claim in behalf \n\n[306 \nU.S. 282, 287]\n\u00a0\n of Walter Titus and did not operate as an assignment to vest any right or interest in petitioner upon which he could maintain suit in the New York Courts. Upon examination of petitioner's affidavit indicating, as the court thought, that petitioner had construed the reassignment correctly as not transferring to him any right or interest in the claim against respondent, it accepted the affidavit as evidence that petitioner had fraudulently prosecuted the New York suit against respondent with knowledge that he was not entitled to maintain it. The court accordingly affirmed the judgment of the trial court denying recovery, on the ground that the New York judgment, impeachable there for the fraud, was to the same extent impeachable in Ohio.\n By R.S.  905, 28 U.S.C.  687, 28 U.S.C.A.  687, enacted under authority of the full faith and credit clause, Article 4,  1 of the Constitution, the duly attested records of the judgments of a state are entitled to 'such faith and credit ... in every court within the United States as they have by law or usage in the courts of the State from which they are taken'. The jurisdiction of the New York court over the subject matter and the person of respondent, established prima facie by the present record and the duly authenticated record of the judgment, is not questioned. But respondent argues, as the state court held, that under the Constitution and Act of Congress the judgment is entitled to no more credit in Ohio than is accorded to it in New York and that in New York the judgment is impeachable for petitioner's fraud in prosecuting the suit, knowing that he had no interest in the cause of action sufficient to enable him to maintain it.\n The right asserted by petitioner to have the New York judgment enforced in the courts of Ohio is one arising under the Constitution and a statute of the United States. And since the existence of the federal right turns upon the legal effect of the proceedings in New York and \n\n[306 \nU.S. 282, 288]\n\u00a0\n the validity of the judgment there, the rulings on those points by the Ohio court are reviewable here. Adam v. Saenger, \n303 \nU.S. 59, 64\n, 58 S.Ct. 454, 457. While they involve questions of local law and are of a character such that this court ordinarily reexamines them with deference after they have been passed upon by a state court, its determination cannot be accepted here as decisive if the constitutional command is to be observed, especially as the decision of the state court rests not on the law of its own state or matters peculiarly within its cognizance, but upon the law of another state which is as readily determinable here as in the courts of Ohio.\n We do not stop to consider the question much discussed in brief and argument how far the full faith and credit clause precludes the defense that the judgment sued upon in one state was procured by fraud in another, for we think it plain that the present judgment is subject to no such infirmity. It is evident that no fraud was perpetrated on respondent or on the New York courts if the assignment of the claim to petitioner before he brought the suit in New York operated to vest him with such ownership or interest in the claim as would enable him to maintain the suit upon it there. If the assignment had that effect, the facts that it was given for the purpose of enabling petitioner to bring the suit, and that he was bound to account to a stranger to the suit for its proceeds, are immaterial, since neither the court nor respondent was prejudiced by petitioner's failure to disclose them.\n Choses in action, with exceptions not now material, are made freely assignable by the New York statute. Personal Property Law, Chapter 41,  41, Consolidated Laws of New York. Section 210\u00f5of the New York Civil Practice Act provides 'Every action must be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest, except that ... a trustee of an express trust ... may sue without joining with him the person \n\n[306 \nU.S. 282, 289]\n\u00a0\n for whose benefit the action is prosecuted.' By repeated decisions of the highest court of the State of New York it has long been settled that under these sections any form of assignment which purports to assign or transfer a chose in action confers upon the transferee such title or ownership as will enable him to sue upon it. This is true even though the assignment is for the purpose of suit only and the transferee is obligated to account for the proceeds of suit to his assignor. Allen v. Brown, 44 N.Y. 228; Meeker v. Claghorn, 44 N.Y. 349; Sheridan v. Mayor, etc., of City of New York, 68 N.Y. 30; McCauley v. Georgia Railroad Bank, 239 N.Y. 514, 147 N.E. 175; Meyers v. Credit Lyonnais, 259 N.Y. 399, 182 N.E. 61, 83 A.L.R. 268; Banca Commerciale Italiana Trust Co. v. Clarkson, 274 N.Y. 69, 74, 8 N.E. 2d 281, 110 A.L.R. 1105; Brown v. Powers, 53 App.Div. 251, 65 N.Y.S. 733; Birdsall v. Read, 188 App.Div. 46, 176 N.Y.S. 369.\n Here the assignment, which in plain terms purported 'to sell, assign, transfer and set over' the chose in action to petitioner, was sufficient under the New York statutes and authorities to give petitioner dominion over the claim for purposes of suit. In that respect its legal effect was not curtailed by the recital that the assignment was for purposes of suit and that its proceeds were to be turned over or accounted for to another. The Ohio court, placing emphasis on the presence of the power of attorney in the assignment, disregarded the words of assignment and gave to the instrument the more restricted effect of a power of attorney. While a power of attorney to sue, standing alone, does not under the New York law operate as an assignment to vest the attorney with such title or interest as will enable him to maintain the suit in his own name, Spencer v. Standard Chemicals & Metals Corporation, 237 N.Y. 479, 143 N.E. 651, the addition of the power to petitioner's assignment did not deprive it of its force and character as an assignment. The use of the power of attorney, once for historical reasons the indispensable \n\n[306 \nU.S. 282, 290]\n\u00a0\n adjunct of every assignment of a chose in action, Ames, Lectures on Legal History, 210 et seq., Williston on Contracts, Rev.Ed.  405, 408, did not render the assignment ineffective merely because, by virtue of the statute, its presence is no longer necessary.\n Even though petitioner was disingenuous in omitting to reveal the reassignment of the claim in his affidavit in the London Wallick suit, and even though there was fraudulent purpose in his failure to disclose that he still had some interest in the proceeds of the judgment to which London Wallick was asserting a claim, those circumstances did not impair the previous assignment of the claim to him or deprive him of the authority, already conferred by the reassignment, to maintain the suit. Whether petitioner's transactions with London Wallick gave the latter any equitable claim to the judgment or its proceeds does not appear, but in any case the existence of such collateral claims does not subject the judgment to impeachment by the judgment debtor. Matter of Holden, 271 N.Y. 212, 217, 2 N.E.2d 631.\n Respondent also urges that the Court of Appeals rested its affirmance of the judgment of the trial court on the ground that petitioner was not the real party in interest entitled to maintain the suit in Ohio, and that this is a non-federal ground adequate to support the judgment and is not reviewable here. While the court intimated that petitioner was not the real party in interest in Ohio, it evidently rested this conclusion upon its opinion that petitioner was not the real party in interest in the suit in New York. Its opinion states that if the assignment 'transferred any such legal or equitable interest or both in his claim to the plaintiff ( petitioner) as would entitle him to maintain an action in his own name in New York, then he was a proper party in interest there and a property party in interest here.' \n\n[306 \nU.S. 282, 291]\n\u00a0\n When a state court refuses credit to the judgment of a sister state because of its opinion of the nature of the cause of action or the judgment in which it is merged, an asserted federal right is denied and the sufficiency of the grounds of denial are for this court to decide. Huntington v. Attrill, \n146 \nU.S. 657, 684\n, 13 S.Ct. 224, 234; Kansas City Southern R. Co. v. Albers Commission Co., \n223 \nU.S. 573, 593\n, 32 S.Ct. 316, 321; Kenney v. Supreme Lodge, \n252 \nU.S. 411, 415\n, 40 S.Ct. 371, 372, 10 A.L.R. 716. So far as the court rested its decision on its view that the New York assignment conferred no right on petitioner to maintain the suit there, it is enough, as we have pointed out, that the petitioner was the real party in interest entitled to maintain the suit in New York. So far as Ohio might apply a different rule if the original cause of action were prosecuted in its courts, that fact is irrelevant to any issue now presented. The suit in Ohio was not upon the assigned cause of action but upon the judgment of which petitioner is the record owner. The suit upon it is upon a different cause of action from that merged in the judgment. Milwaukee County v. White Co., \n296 \nU.S. 268, 275\n, 56 S.Ct. 229, 233. It is the judgment and not the cause of action which gave rise to it for which credit is claimed, and the constitutional mandate requires credit to be given to a money judgment rendered on a civil cause of action in another state, even though the forum would have been under no duty to entertain the suit on which the judgment was founded. Christmas v. Russell, 5 Wall. 290; Fauntleroy v. Lum, \n210 \nU.S. 230\n, 28 S.Ct. 641; Roche v. McDonald, \n275 \nU.S. 449\n, 48 S.Ct. 142, 53 A.L.R. 1141; Milwaukee County v. White Co., supra, 277, 56 S.Ct. 234.\n Even though the Ohio court might have declined to recognize petitioner as the proper party to sue upon the assigned claim, a suit upon a judgment of another state, by virtue of the Constitution, stands upon a different footing. The Ohio court is not free to withhold from petitioner, the record owner of a judgment valid and en- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 282, 292]\n\u00a0\n forceable by him in New York, the full benefit of the constitutional command that the judgment shall receive in the courts of Ohio such faith and credit as it is entitled to receive in New York. A state which may not constitutionally refuse to open its courts to a suit on a judgment of another state because of the nature of the cause of action merged in the judgment, Kenney v. Supreme Lodge, supra, 415, 40 S.Ct. 372, obviously cannot, by the adoption of a particular rule of liability or of procedure, exclude from its courts a suit on the judgment.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","123":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTOLEDO PRESSED STEEL CO. v. STANDARD PARTS, INC.(1939)\nNo. 166\nArgued: March 1, 1939Decided: May 29, 1939\n\n\n\n\n[307 \nU.S. 350, 351]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Samuel E. Darby, Jr., of New York City, and Wilber Owen, of Toledo, Ohio, for Toledo Pressed Steel Co.\n Mr. Carl V. Wisner, Jr., of Chicago, Ill., for Montgomery Ward & Co.\n Mr. W. P. Bair, of Chicago, Ill., for respondents Standard Parts, Inc ., and another.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These are patent infringement suits brought by the Toledo Pressed Steel Company, owner of Withrow and Close Patent No. 1,732,708, issued October 22, 1929, for a burner for use in outdoor warning signals such as construction torches and truck flares. The first two suits were brought in the federal court for the northern district of Ohio. It filed an opinion indicating the facts that it deemed established by the evidence and without formal findings held the patent valid and infringed by the Bolser and Kari-Keen flares respectively sold by the defendants. The circuit court of appeals for the sixth circuit held the \n\n[307 \nU.S. 350, 352]\n\u00a0\n patent invalid for want of invention and reversed. 93 F.2d 336. The other suit was brought in the federal court for the eastern district of New York. It made findings as required by Rule 701\/2, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723, held plaintiff's patent invalid, and dismissed the bill. The circuit court of appeals for the second circuit held the patent valid and infringed by the Anthes flare sold by the defendant, and reversed. 99 F.2d 806.\n In the interest of plaintiff, seeking to uphold the patent prima facie valid, and of the public, liable to exclusion from manufacture, use, or sale in virtue of the right it purports to confer, final adjudication as to validity is of primary importance. The patent in suit relates to torches for guarding street obstructions and to flares, which are large torches, for warning that vehicles are stopped on the road.\n Formerly, red lanterns were much used. But, after general use of automobiles having red tail lights to some extent resembling them, they did not serve so satisfactorily as before. Open-flame torches came to be extensively employed. The motion of the luminescent flame distinguishes them from other signals. But there were complaints that they were sometimes extinguished by wind or rain.\n Open-flame torches in use for some years before patentees' claimed invention, included those which were bomb-shaped, flatbottomed, weighted for stability, and with an opening in the top for a wick. That type was well known, at least after the patent covering it, McCloskey No. 1,610,301, was issued December 14, 1926; in 1929 it was held invalid by the circuit court of appeals for the sixth circuit for lack of invention and because anticipated. McCloskey v. Toledo Pressed Steel Co., 30 F.2d 12. Plaintiff had a large business in the manufacture and sale of torches, including the McCloskey type. It advertised that they would burn in all kinds of weather; \n\n[307 \nU.S. 350, 353]\n\u00a0\n having received many complaints of extinguishment by wind and rain, patentees, respectively plaintiff's president and vice president, set about producing something to make them dependable and to serve as represented. Within a year, but after experiments, trials, and failures, they brought forward the patented device.\n The specification states that the claimed invention particularly relates to devices to increase efficiency and to prevent flame extinguishment. It declares that the objects of the invention are to provide a simple attachment to attain those ends and a burner so constructed that liability of extinguishment by wind or rain will be reduced to a minimum. It further says that with the described construction and arrangement consumption of oil and wick is materially decreased.\n The claims involved are printed in the margin. \n1\n Considered together, unobscured by artificiality in their state- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 350, 354]\n\u00a0\n ment, it fairly may be said that they show that all that the patentees did was to put over the wick of a torch, well known in the art, an inverted metal cuplike cap having holes in its sides, some to let in air for combustion and others to let out flame. The cap was also well known and had been used as a part of other devices for the protection of kerosene and other flames.\n A number of devices patented earlier than plaintiff's included the elements essential to its burner.\n Billingham Patent, No. 191,031, issued August 15, 1876, related to torches for lighting street-lamps. It shows a \n\n[307 \nU.S. 350, 355]\n\u00a0\n wick-type torch with a tube-like cap having holes, some to let in air, and others to let the flame come out. This cap, imperforate at the top, serves to prevent extinguishment of the flame by wind or rain. Almond Patent, No. 193,796, issued August 7, 1877, related to vapor burners for heating. The device, some parts detached, serves as an illuminating lamp consisting of a body, a wick holder, a cap, a flange having a rim supporting a tube closed at the top. Holes are in the rim to admit air; larger ones in the tube are to let the flames out. Rutz Patent, No. 1,101,146, issued June 23, 1914, covers a flash igniter for gas stove burners. It has a cap to guard the flame and adapted to emit flames extending from the igniter to the gas burners to be lighted. This cap, like plaintiff's, has a supporting and heat receiving flange, a means to enclose the space above the flange and a restricted entrance to admit air for combustion. The record shows that the Rutz hood has been used to achieve the identical results attained by plaintiff's device.\n There are other patents, issued before patentees developed the structure in suit, that may be referred to as relevant to the issue of invention in this case. Examples of these are cited in the margin. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The torch body was old in the art to which it belonged. The cap, as part of devices used in other fields, was old and useful to prevent extinguishment of flames by wind or rain and to permit flames to extend through holes to the open air. The problem patentees set for themselves was to prevent extinguishment while preserving usefulness of the flames as warning signals. They solved it by merely bringing together the torch and cap. As before, the torch continued to produce a luminescent, undulating flame, and the cap continued to let in air for combustion, \n\n[307 \nU.S. 350, 356]\n\u00a0\n to protect the flame from wind and rain and to allow it to emerge as a warning signal. They performed no joint function. Each served as separately it had done. The patented device results from mere aggregation of two old devices, and not from invention or discovery. Hailes v. Van Wormer, 20 Wall. 353, 368; Reckendorfer v. Faber, \n92 \nU.S. 347\n, 357; Lincoln Engineering Co. v. Stewart-Warner Corp., \n303 \nU.S. 545, 549\n, 550 S., 58 S.Ct. 662, 664. On the records before us, it is impossible to hold that production of the patented device required more than mechanical skill and originality attributable to those familiar with the art of protecting flames of kerosene and other burners. Altoona Publix Theatres v. Tri-Ergon Corp., \n294 \nU.S. 477, 486\n, 55 S.Ct. 455, 458; Powers-Kennedy Cont. Corp. v. Concrete Co., \n282 \nU.S. 175, 186\n, 51 S.Ct. 95, 99; Concrete Appliances Co. v. Gomery, \n269 \nU.S. 177, 184\n, 185 S., 46 S.Ct. 42, 45; Hollister v. Benedict Manufacturing Co., \n113 \nU.S. 59, 72\n, 73 S., 5 S.Ct. 717, 723.\n As evidence in its favor on the question of invention, plaintiff cites efforts to find something useful to protect open-flame torches from extinguishment by wind or rain put forth by one engaged in operation of a street railway and by another employed by a manufacturer of lanterns. But it does not appear that either was familiar with the relevant prior art. Nor is there any evidence of general or widespread effort to solve the problem here involved. There is nothing that tends to raise what patentees did to the realm of invention. See Paramount Publix Corp. v. Tri-Ergon Corp., \n294 \nU.S. 464, 476\n, 55 S.Ct. 449, 454. Plaintiff also brings forward the fact that some manufacturers, including three substantial ones, have taken licenses under its patent. It does not appear that these licensees have made wide or successful use of the device. Lack of novelty being clearly shown, acceptance of license under the circumstances of this case, is without weight. Thorpp's Sons Co. v. Seiberling, \n264 \nU.S. 320, 330\n, 44 S.Ct. 346, 350; John T. Riddell v. Athletic Shoe Co., 7 Cir., 75 F.2d 93, 95. And similarly without significance on the question of novelty is the fact that, as plaintiff \n\n[307 \nU.S. 350, 357]\n\u00a0\n claims, utility resulted and commercial success followed from what patentees did. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. United States Rubber Co., 6 Cir., 79 F.2d 948, 954.\n It results that the decrees in Nos. 166 and 167 must be affirmed, and that in No. 603 must be reversed.

On account of conflict between the judgments of the respective courts of sister states and the assertion of the failure to give full faith and credit to both in the interpleader action, we granted certiorari.\n The alleged rights of the respective claimants arose as follows: Amelia Pelkes, the wife of John Pelkes, died testate in Spokane, Washington, in 1922, leaving her husband and one child, Katherine Mason, the offspring of a former marriage as the beneficiaries of her will. As a part of her community estate, there were 30,598 shares of Sunshine Mining stock. It was considered valueless and was not inventoried or appraised. The order of distribution assigned a three-fourths undivided interest in these shares to Pelkes and a one-fourth to Mrs. Mason, an omnibus clause covering unknown property. The estate of Mrs. Pelkes was not distributed according to the order of distribution. Instead Pelkes and his stepdaughter, Mrs. Mason, divided the inventoried \n\n[308 \nU.S. 66, 69]\n\u00a0\n property between themselves in accordance with their wishes.\n It is the contention of Pelkes and his assignee that this partition of the property was in consideration of the release by Mrs. Mason to Pelkes of all of her interest in the shares of the stock of the Sunshine Mining Company. On the other hand, Mrs. Mason asserts that Pelkes was to hold one-half of the amount owned, 15,299 shares, in trust for her.\n In August, 1934, Mrs. Mason instituted a suit in the District Court of Idaho for Shoshone County against Pelkes, Evelyn H. Treinies, the Sunshine Mining Company, and others not important here, alleging that she was the owner of 15,299 shares of the stock, that these had been acquired by Miss Treinies from Pelkes with knowledge of Mrs. Mason's rights, and praying that the trust be established and the stock and dividends be awarded to her, Mrs. Mason. It was finally decreed by the District Court on August 18, 1936, after an appeal to the Supreme Court of Idaho,3 that the stock and dividends belonged to Mrs. Mason. Certiorari to the Supreme Court of Idaho was refused by this Court. \n 4\n\u00a0\n\n Before the entry of the first decree of the District Court of Idaho, Katherine Mason filed a petition in the Superior Court of Spokane County, Washington, in the probate proceedings involving Amelia Pelkes' will, to remove the executor, John Pelkes, for failure to file his report of distribution and for dissipation of the Sunshine stock. Pelkes by cross- petition and petition claimed the stock. Thereupon Mrs. Mason applied to the Supreme Court of Washington for a writ of prohibition against further proceedings in the Superior Court on the ground \n\n[308 \nU.S. 66, 70]\n\u00a0\n of lack of jurisdiction in that court to determine the controversy over the stock. The writ was refused. On May 31, 1935, a judgment was entered in the Superior Court upholding in full the ownership of Pelkes.\n After the Supreme Court of Idaho had decided the Idaho suit against Pelkes and Miss Treinies, they filed in August, 1936, a suit in the Superior Court of Washington against Katherine Mason and others alleging that they were the owners of the stock, further alleging that the Idaho decree was invalid for lack of jurisdiction, and asking that their title to the stock be quieted and the Sunshine Mining Company, a party to this and the Idaho suit, be compelled to recognize their ownership. It was at this point in the litigation that the Sunshine Company filed the bill of interpleader now under consideration. Further proceedings in the suit to quiet title were enjoined by the District Court in this action.\n Jurisdiction.-Before considering the questions raised by the petition for certiorari, the jurisdiction of the federal court under the Act of January 20, 1936,5 must be determined. As this issue affects the jurisdiction of this Court, it is raised on its own motion. \n6\n By the Act of January 20, 1936, the district courts have jurisdiction of suits in equity, interpleading two or more adverse claimants, instituted by complainants who have property of the requisite value claimed by citizens of different states. The suit may be maintained 'although the titles or claims of the conflicting claimants do not have a common origin, or are not identical, but are adverse to and independent of one another.' Process may run at least throughout all the states.\n As required by the Act this case was begun by the complainant, a corporation of the State of Washington, im- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 66, 71]\n\u00a0\n pleading one group of claimants who are citizens of that same state and another, the adverse group, who are citizens of Idaho. Under the interpleader act, this identity of citizenship is permissible since diversity only between claimants is required. The Interpleader Act is based upon the clause of Section Two, Article III, of the Constitution, U. S.C.A., which extends the judicial power of the United States to controversies 'between citizens of different States.' Is this grant of jurisdiction broad enough to cover the present situation?\n The Judicial Code, Section 24, 28 U.S.C.A.  41, provides for original jurisdiction of suits of a civil nature between citizens of different states in precisely the language of the Constitution. The present wording is practically the same as that of the Act of March 3, 1875,7 'the circuit courts ... shall have original cognizance ... of all suits ... in which there shall be a controversy between citizens of different States,' and that of the original Judiciary Act of September 24, 1789,8 'the suit is between a citizen of the State where the suit is brought, and a citizen of another State.' Without ruling as to possible limitations of the constitutional grant, it is held by this Court that the statutory language of the respective judiciary acts forbids suits in the federal courts unless all the parties on one side are of citizenship diverse to those on the other side. \n9\n For the determination of the validity of the Interpleader Act we need not decide whether the words of the Constitution, 'Controversies ... between citizens of different States,' have a different meaning from that given by judicial construction to similar words in the Judiciary Act. Even though the constitutional language limits the \n\n[308 \nU.S. 66, 72]\n\u00a0\n judicial power to controversies wholly between citizens of different states, that requirement is satisfied here. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n This is for the reason that there is a real controversy between the adverse claimants. They are brought into the court by the complainant stakeholder who simultaneously deposits the money or property, due and involved in the dispute into the registry of the court. This was done in this case. The act provides that the 'court shall hear and determine the cause and shall discharge the complainant from further liability.' Such deposit and discharge effectually demonstrates the applicant's disinterestedness as between the claimants and as to the property in dispute,11 an essential in interpleaders. \n12\n The complainant is a proper party for the determination of the controversy between the adverse claimants, citizens of different states. Their controversy could have been settled by litigation between them in the federal courts. Under similar circumstances as to parties, this Court ruled that a removal of separable controversies to the federal court was permissible even though a proper defendant was a citizen of the same state as the plaintiff. \n13\n We so held as to a stakeholder in Salem Trust Co. v. Manufacturers' Co.14 There a suit was brought in a state court against the Manufacturers' Company, a Delaware cor- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 66, 73]\n\u00a0\n poration, and against a cocitizen of plaintiff, a Massachusetts corporation, the International Trust Company. The Manufacturers' Company removed and plaintiff sought a remand alleging its cocitizen was a necessary party. The suit was to determine rights to a fund in the cocitizen's hands 'and to have the same paid to' the plaintiff. The right of removal was upheld on the ground that the only obligation of the stakeholder was to pay over the money deposited with it. In Cramer v. Phoenix Mut. Life Ins. Co.15 the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, considering that the claimants were the real contestants, construed the Interpleader Act of May 8th, 1926, 16 to give jurisdiction to the federal court although the interpleader and certain claimants were citizens of the same state. The language as to citizenship is the same as that of the act here involved. \n17\n\u00a0\n\n Application of Interpleader Act.-The inclusion as defendants of the judge of the Superior Court of Washington, the administrator of John Pelkes, and a court receiver of the property in dispute is said to violate the \n\n[308 \nU.S. 66, 74]\n\u00a0\n rule against a citizen suing a state embodied in the Eleventh Amendment. \n18\n\u00a0\n\n Without analyzing all the pleadings, a short answer against the petitioner's contention is the fact that neither the receiver nor the judge is enjoined by the final decree. Pelkes' administrator and Miss Treinies are enjoined from further prosecution of the Washington action to quiet title. They are the parties whose individual rights to the stock are settled in this action. The State of Washington has no interest and no infringement of the Eleventh Amendment occurs.\n Neither are the provisions of Section 265 of the Judicial Code, 28 U. S.C.A.  379, applicable. That section forbids a United States court from staying proceedings in any state court. The Interpleader Act, passed subsequently, however, authorizes the enjoining of parties to the interpleader from further prosecuting any suit in any state or United States court on account of the property involved. Such authority is essential to the protection of the interpleader jurisdiction and is a valid exercise of the judicial power. Section 265 is a mere limitation upon the general equity powers of the United States courts and may be varied by Congress to meet the requirements of federal litigation. \n19\n\u00a0\n\n Res Judicata of the Idaho Decree.-On the merits petitioner's objection to the decree below is that it fails to consider and give effect to the Washington judgment of May 31, 1935, awarding the property in question to Pelkes, petitioner's assignor. It is petitioner's claim that the Washington judgment must be considered as effective in this litigation because the question of the jurisdiction of the Washington court was actually litigated before \n\n[308 \nU.S. 66, 75]\n\u00a0\n the Supreme Court of Washington and determined favorably to petitioner by the refusal to grant a writ of prohibition against the exercise of jurisdiction by the Washington Superior Court in probate. This failure to give effect to the judgment is said to infringe the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution. The decree of the Court of Appeals is based upon the doctrine of res judicata. The applicability of that doctrine arises from a determination of pertinent matters by the Supreme Court of Idaho. Accordingly we turn to a discussion of whether or not the issues tendered below by petitioner were foreclosed by the decision of the Supreme Court of Idaho of July 23, 1936.\n The issues tendered by petitioner in the trial court in this interpleader proceeding were (1) the invalidity of the Idaho decree, and ( 2) the conclusiveness of the Washington decree of May 31, 1935, awarding the property to Pelkes. Both of these issues rest on petitioner's contention that complete jurisdiction of the probate of Mrs. Pelkes' estate was in the Superior Court of Washington, that the stock was at all times a part of that estate, and the therefore that court's jurisdiction over the disposition of the stock was exclusive of all other courts.\n The Idaho decree was pleaded in this proceeding as res judicata of the controversy between petitioner and respondent. The proceedings in Idaho showed a cause of action based on an alleged oral agreement of Pekles, made in Idaho at the time of distribution of Mrs. Pelkes' estate, to hold the Sunshine Mining Company stock in trust for the joint benefit of himself and Mrs. Mason. All parties, including this petitioner, were before the court and a decree was entered sustaining the trust and awarding the stock and dividends, as claimed, to respondent, Mrs. Mason, with directions to the Mining Company to recognize the assignment of the certificates and adjudging a re- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 66, 76]\n\u00a0\n covery for prior dividends against Pelkes and petitioner. The Idaho court was a court of general jurisdiction. \n20\n\u00a0\n\n The Court of Appeals held that the Idaho suit settled that the stock was distributed in 1923 and that therefore the Idaho court had jurisdiction to determine rights under the alleged oral trust. It was further of the view that the Idaho court's invalidation of the Washington judgment and its decree upholding Mrs. Mason's claim to the disputed property were res judicata in this action. Petitioner's only ground for objection to the conclusion that the Idaho decree is res judicata rests on the argument that by such ruling below the 'judgment of the courts of the State of Washington affecting the same subject matter and parties' is ignored.\n In the Idaho proceeding the Washington judgment awarding the stock and dividends to Pelkes was pleaded in bar to Mrs. Mason's suit to recover the stock. The effectiveness of the Washington judgment as a bar depended upon whether the court which rendered it had jurisdiction, after an order of distribution, to deal with settlements of distributees with respect to the assets of an estate. On consideration it was determined in the Idaho proceeding that the Washington court did not have this jurisdiction and that the stock of the Mining Company became the property of Mrs. Mason. In declining to give effect to the Washington decree for lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter the Idaho court determined also the basic question raised by petitioner in the interpleader action. The contention of petitioner in the interpleader proceedings that the Idaho court did not have jurisdiction of the stock controversy because that controversy was in the exclusive jurisdiction of the Washington probate court must fall, because of the Idaho decision that the Washington probate court did not have \n\n[308 \nU.S. 66, 77]\n\u00a0\n exclusive jurisdiction. This is true even though the question of the Washington jurisdiction had been actually litigated and decided in favor of Pelkes in the Washington proceedings. If decided erroneously in the Idaho proceedings, the right to review that error was in those (the Idaho) proceedings. While petitioner sought review from the decree of the Supreme Court of Idaho by petition for certiorari to this Court, which was denied, no review was sought from the final decree of the Idaho District Court of August 18, 1936, on new findings of fact and conclusions of law on remittitur from the Supreme Court of Idaho.21 \n\n[308 \nU.S. 66, 78]\n\u00a0\n The Court of Appeals correctly determined that the issue of jurisdiction vel non of the Washington court could not be relitigated in this interpleader. As the Idaho District Court was a court of general jurisdiction, its conclusions are unassailable collaterally except for fraud or lack of jurisdiction. The holding by the Idaho court of no jurisdiction in Washington necessarily determined the question raised here as to the Idaho jurisdiction against Miss Treinies' contention. She is bound by that judgment.\n The power of the Idaho court to examine into the jurisdiction of the Washington court is beyond question. \n22\n Even where the decision against validity of the original judgment is erroneous, it is a valid exercise of judicial power by the second court. \n23\n\u00a0\n\n One trial of an issue is enough. \n24\n 'The principles of res judicata apply to questions of jurisdiction as well as to other issues,'25 as well to jurisdiction of the subject matter as of the parties. \n26\n\u00a0\n\n Decree affirmed.\n Mr. Justice BUTLER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 99 F.2d 651. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] D.C., 19 F.Supp. 587. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Mason v.

As the procedure by which a state court examines into the question of the jurisdiction of the court of a sister state is a matter within the control of the respective states (Adam v. Saenger, \n303 \nU.S. 59, 63\n, 58 S.Ct. 454, 456), it need only be added that such procedure is subject to question only on direct appeal.\n It was stipulated by all parties to the Idaho cause that the Idaho courts might take judicial notice of the statutes and decisions of Washington. Some constitutional and statutory provisions relating to the jurisdiction of the Superior Court were pleaded and admitted. It has long been the rule in Idaho that its courts do not take judicial notice of the laws of another state and that without allegation and evidence it will be assumed the laws are the same as those of Idaho.

While none of these cases involved a stipulation, the decision of the Supreme Court of Idaho (Mason v. Pelkes, 57 Idaho 10, 59 P.2d 1087) declares the law of that jurisdiction. It follows from the Idaho court's refusal to look into the statutes of Washington that the jurisdiction of the Washington court was presumed to be governed by Idaho law. Under proper proof, the Idaho court would have been compelled to examine the jurisdiction of the Washington court under Washington law. \n\n[\nFootnote 22\n] Old Wayne Mut. Life Ass'n v.

HELVERING(1939)\nNo. 453\nArgued: March 3, 1939Decided: April 17, 1939\n\n\n\n\n[307 \nU.S. 57, 58]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Wilder Goodwin, of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. J. Louis Monarch, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The sole question is whether proceeds of a War Risk Insurance policy payable to a deceased veteran's widow were properly included in his gross estate under a Federal estate tax.\n The Federal estate tax in question1 included in a decedent's gross estate the amount in excess of forty thousand dollars received by 'beneficiaries (other than his estate) as insurance under policies taken out by the decedent upon his own life.' This veteran's total life insurance for beneficiaries other than his estate exceeded at death the statutory exemption of forty thousand dollars, if his War Risk Insurance policy payable to his widow in the sum of ten thousand dollars is included. The Commissioner assessed an estate tax measured by this excess. As decedent's executor, petitioner claimed that proceeds of the War Risk Insurance policy could not be included in the estate because of Section 22 of the World War Veterans' Act, 1924, providing that such 'insurance ... shall be exempt from all taxation.' \n2\n The Board of Tax Appeals upheld the determination of the Commissioner, and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n[307 \nU.S. 57, 59]\n\u00a0\n Congress has manifested a consistent policy in the Revenue Acts from 1918 to 1934, when the veteran died, by impositions of estate taxes upon transfers at death of proceeds of all life insurance (not payable to an insured's estate) in excess of forty thousand dollars. This has been in harmony with a general plan of graduating income and inheritance taxes to accord with the respective sizes of incomes and estates. \n4\n And the Treasury Regulations have stated that 'The statute provides for the inclusion in the gross estate of ... All insurance (not for the benefit of an estate ) ... to the extent that it exceeds ... forty thousand dollars ... The term 'insurance' refers to life insurance of every description, ....' 5\n But petitioner invokes the provision of the World War Veterans' Act, 1924, that insurance thereunder 'shall be exempt from all taxation.' An amendment to that Act of August 12, 19356 provides that 'Payments of benefits due or to become due ... shall be exempt from taxation ....' However, this amendment served only to clarify the original provision for exemption, without more. \n7\n Unless resort is had to enlargement by implication, this exemption means only that the proceeds or benefits of a War Risk policy are exempt from taxation. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 57, 60]\n\u00a0\n Exemptions from taxation do not rest upon implication. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n An estate tax is not levied upon the property of which an estate is composed. It is an excise imposed upon the transfer of or shifting in relationships to property at death. \n9\n The tax here is no less an estate tax because the proceeds of the policy were paid by the Government directly to the beneficiary; the taxing power was nevertheless exercised upon 'the transfer of property procured through expenditures by the decedent with the purpose, effected at his death, of having it pass to another.' \n10\n In an analogous situation, Federal bonds exempt by statute from all taxation have been held subject to a Federal inheritance tax. \n11\n And State inheritance taxes can be measured by the value of Federal bonds exempted by statute from State taxation in any form. \n12\n Similarly, the statutory immunity of War Risk Insurance from taxation does not include an immunity from excises upon the occasion of shifts of economic interests brought about by the death of an insured.\n Petitioner makes the further point that the inclusion of proceeds of the War Risk policy for purposes of an estate tax amounts to an impairment of the Government's contract with the insured veteran, in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, U.S.C.A. But neither the Act of 1924, as amended, nor any of the provisions of the War Risk Insurance Act purported to exempt War Risk Insurance from death duties. Therefore, no statu- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 57, 61]\n\u00a0\n tory exemption which could be considered a provision of the insurance contract has been affected by the imposition of the estate tax in this case. The judgment is\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 302(g) Revenue Act of 1926, as amended 26 U.S.C.A.  411(g). \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 43 Stat. 607, 613, 38 U.S.C.A.  454. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] 2 Cir., 98 F.2d 734.

Case, of Washington, D.C., for respondent in No. 247.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Decision of these cases turns on the question whether certain contracts for the sale of timber on land of the Klamath Indian Reservation in Oregon, executed by the Superintendent of the Klamath Indian School by authority of an Act of Congress, are contracts of the United States upon which suits may be maintained in the Court of Claims.\n Section 7 of the Act of Congress of June 25, 1910, 36 Stat. 855, 857, 25 U.S.C.A.  407, provides that the 'timber on unallotted lands of any Indian reservation may be sold under regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior, and the proceeds from such sales shall be used for the benefit of the Indians of the reservation in such manner as he may direct'. Section 8 of the Act, 25 U.S.C.A.  406, provides that 'The timber on any Indian allotment held under a trust or other patent containing restrictions on alienations, may be sold by the allottee with the consent of the Secretary of the Interior and the proceeds thereof shall be paid to the allottee or disposed of for his benefit under regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior.'\n The present suits were brought in the Court of Claims by respondents against the United States to recover alleged overpayments of amounts due upon contracts for the purchase of timber upon certain unallotted and allotted Indian lands in the Klamath Reservation. The con- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 415, 418]\n\u00a0\n tracts were executed pursuant to  7 and 8 of the Act of 1910 and regulations of the Secretary of the Interior. They provided that the prices fixed for the timber to be cut should be readjusted by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs at intervals of three years, but that permitted increases in price should 'not exceed 50 per cent of the increase in the average mill run wholesale net value of lumber ... during the three years preceding January 1 of the year in which the new prices are fixed.'\n The Court of Claims in each case found that prices fixed by the Indian Commissioner had exceeded the permitted increases and that in consequence there had been an overpayment of the amounts due under the contracts. It held that they were contracts of the United States and in each case gave judgment against the government for the amount of the overpayments. Algoma Lumber Company v. United States, 86 Ct.Cl. 226; Forest Lumber Company v. United States, 86 Ct.Cl. 188; Lamm Lumber Company v. United States, 86 Ct.Cl. 171. We granted certiorari, \n305 \nU.S. 583\n, 59 S. Ct. 88, 83 L.Ed. --, the questions involved being of public importance in the administration by the United States of Indian lands and in defining the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims.\n The petitions for certiorari challenged the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims in terms sufficiently broad to raise the question, not considered below or argued here, whether, assuming the contracts were obligations of the United States, as the court below held, suits to recover the overpayments are upon quasi contracts or contracts 'implied in law' not within the jurisdiction conferred on the Court of Claims by  145( 1) of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  250(1), 28 U.S.C.A.  250(1).1 Merritt v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 338\n, 45 S.Ct. 278; \n\n[305 \nU.S. 415, 419]\n\u00a0\n United States v. Minn. Investment Co., \n271 \nU.S. 212\n, 46 S.Ct. 501; Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. v. United States, \n276 \nU.S. 287\n, 48 S.Ct. 306. But the question chiefly discussed in brief and argument before us is whether the contracts in suit are obligations of the United States, so as to give rise to claims founded upon them within the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims. As determination of this question is decisive of the case, we do not consider whether, even if the contracts were obligations of the United States, the claims are for the recovery of unjust enrichment upon contracts 'implied in law' not within the jurisdiction of the court.\n For purposes of decision the contracts in No. 245, United States v. Algoma Lumber Company, may be taken as typical of those in the other cases. Pursuant to  7 and 8 of the Act of 1910 and regulations of the Secretary of the Interior adopted June 9, 1911, timber upon designated lands within the Klamath Reservation was offered for sale. Bids submitted by respondent, Algoma Company, were accepted, and on July 28, 1917, the contract of sale was executed by the company and by the Superintendent of the Klamath Indian School, pursuant to departmental regulations, and was approved by the Assistant Secretary of the Interior on September 14, 1917\n\n\n The area designated embraced approximately 15,700 acres, all of which were unallotted except 2,240 acres of allotted lands. The contract provided for the sale of the timber on the unallotted lands upon terms and conditions not now material. If required that the purchase money be paid to the Superintendent 'for the use and benefit of the Klamath Tribe', and that the Algoma Company enter into separate contracts with the individual Indian allottees who desired to sell the timber standing on their allotments. In carrying out the provisions of the contract the Algoma Company, with the approval of the Secretary, entered into separate contracts with twenty-one indi- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 415, 420]\n\u00a0\n vidual allottees for purchase of the timber on their allotments upon terms similar to those of the contract for the purchase of timber on the unallotted lands.\n As required by the contracts, the purchase payments by the Algoma Company, including the alleged overpayments, were made to the Superintendent for the benefit of the Indians. Pursuant to the Act of March 3, 1883, 22 Stat. 582, 590, as amended May 17, 1926, 44 Stat. 560, 25 U.S.C.A.  155, all moneys received from the unallotted lands, less expenses, were deposited by the Superintendent in the treasury of the United States in an account designated 'Indian moneys, proceeds of labor.' Payments for timber on the allotted lands, less expenses, were deposited by the Superintendent in private state banks and credited on his own books to the allottees according to their respective interests.

All the proceeds of sale are required to be held and used by the Secretary for the benefit of the Indians.

See United States v. Klamath Tribes, \n304 \nU.S. 119, 121\n, 58 S.Ct. 799, 800. Under the provisions of the treaty and established principles applicable to land reservations created for the benefit of the Indian tribes, the Indians are beneficial owners of the land and the timber standing upon it and of the proceeds of their sale, subject to the plenary power of control by the United States, to be exercised for the benefit and protection of the Indians. United States v. Klamath Tribes, \n304 \nU.S. 119\n, 58 S.Ct. 799; cf. United States v. Candelaria, \n271 \nU.S. 432\n, 46 S.Ct. 561; Mott v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 747\n, 51 S.Ct. 642; Chippewa Indians v. United States, 301 U.S. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 415, 421]\n\u00a0\n 358, 375, 57 S.Ct. 826, 833; United States v. Shoshone Tribe, \n304 \nU.S. 111, 116\n, 58 S.Ct. 794, 797. The United States acquired no beneficial ownership in the tribal lands or their proceeds, and however we may define the nature of the legal interest acquired by the government as the implement of its control, substantial ownership remained with the tribe as it existed before the treaty. United States v. Shoshone Tribe, supra, 116, 58 S.Ct. 797.\n The action of Congress in authorizing the sale of the timber, and the contracts prescribed under its authority by departmental regulations and approved by the Secretary, are to be viewed as the means chosen for the exercise of the power of the government to protect the rights and beneficial ownership of the Indians. The means are adapted to that end. Neither the United States nor any officer purporting to act on its behalf is named a party to the contract. By its terms the contract is declared to be entered into 'between the Superintendent of the Klamath Indian School, for and on behalf of the Klamath Indians, party of the first part' and the Lumber Company, 'party of the second part.' It is thus on its face the contract of the Klamath Indians executed by the Supreintendent, acting as their agent. The form of the contract and the procedure prescribed for its execution and approval conform to the long-established relationship between the government and the Indians, under which the government has plenary power to take appropriate measures to safeguard the disposal of property of which the Indians are the substantial owners. Exercise of that power does not necessarily involve the assumption of contractual obligations by the government. Their assumption is not to be presumed in the absence of any action taken by the government or on its behalf indicating such a purpose. See In re Sanborn, \n148 \nU.S. 222, 227\n, 13 S.Ct. 577, 579; Turner v. United States, \n248 \nU.S. 354, 359\n, 39 S. Ct. 109, 110. In this, as in any other case of a written contract, those who are parties to and bound \n\n[305 \nU.S. 415, 422]\n\u00a0\n by it are to be ascertained by an inspection of the document, and its provisions are controlling in the absence of some positive rule of law or provision of statute requiring them to be disregarded.\n Respondents point only to  7 of the Act of 1910 and the regulations prescribed under it as compelling a different result. They argue that the requirements that the manner of sale be prescribed by the Secretary, that the contracts be executed by the Superintendent and approved by the Secretary, and that the prices of lumber be fixed by the Indian Commissioner, indicate a purpose to make the United States, acting as guardian or trustee of the Indians through the Secretary and Superintendent, the contracting party. But, as we have said, all that was done by the government officials in supervising the execution of the contracts and their performance was consistent with the exercise of its function as protector of the Indians without the assumption by the United States of any obligation to the purchasers of the timber, and no implied obligation on its part arises from the performance of that function.\n Before the Act of 1910, the Act of February 16, 1889, 25 Stat. 673, 25 U.S.C.A.  196, had given the President authority, from year to year, under such regulations as he might prescribe, to authorize the Indians on reservations or allotments to sell dead timber, standing or fallen, on such reservations. The contracts authorized were to be those of the Indians and not of the United States. See Pine River Logging Co. v. United States, \n186 \nU.S. 279\n, 22 S.Ct. 920.2\n The Act of 1910 enlarged the authority conferred by the earlier act so as to permit the sale of living timber on \n\n[305 \nU.S. 415, 423]\n\u00a0\n the reservations under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior. It did not command departure from the earlier practice of selling the timber by contracts entered into between the Indians and the purchasers, and it seems clear that in prescribing that the contracts be entered into with the Indians the Secretary adhered to this practice, but with the added safeguard that the contracts were to be effected for them through the agency of the Superintendent who, for many purposes, acts as the agent of the Indians. See United States v. Sinnott, C.C., 26 F. 84, 86; cf. Parks v. Ross, 11 How. 362, 374.\n We do not stop to inquire whether the government could confer authority upon him to execute contracts binding upon the Indians, or whether the Act of 1910 dispensed with the formalities required of contracts with the Indians by R.S.  2103, 25 U.S.C.  81, 25 U.S.C.A.  81, omitted in the case of the present contracts. See Green v. Menominee Tribe, \n233 \nU.S. 558\n, 34 S.Ct. 706. Infirmities, if any, in respondents' contracts with the Indians could not impose on the United States a liability which the contracts do not purport to undertake in its behalf.\n As the Court of Claims found that the contracts for the sale of timber on allotted lands were entered into by individual allottees as prescribed by  8 of the Act of 1910, they stand on no different footing, as obligations of the United States, from the tribal contract or similar contracts entered into under the Act of 1889.\n Since none of the contracts in suit were contracts or obligations of the United States, it is plain that receipt, by the Treasury of the United States, of payments made under them to the Superintendent for 'the use and benefit' of the Indians, even though made under protest, gave rise to no contract for repayment implied in fact on the part of the United States, and that the cause of action, if any, is not within the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims.

Freund, of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n Mr. Frederick Schwertner, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question is whether the 15 per centum allowed as a deduction for charitable contributions under Section 23(n) of \n\n[305 \nU.S. 357, 358]\n\u00a0\n the Revenue Act of 1932, 26 U.S.C.A.  23, is to be calculated on the taxpayer's net income computed without regard to a capital net loss as to which special provision is made by Section 101(b), 26 U.S.C.A.  101.\n Section 23(n) provides that in computing net income there shall be allowed as a deduction from gross income-'In the case of an individual, contributions or gifts made within the taxable year to or for the use of : ... to an amount which in all the above cases combined does not exceed 15 per centum of the taxpayer's net income as computed without the benefit of this subsection'.\n Respondent in 1932 made charitable contributions to the amount of $3, 496. His net income, irrespective of a capital net loss, was determined by the Commissioner to be $94,963.52. Upon that net income the Commissioner assessed the normal tax and surtax at the rates prescribed by Sections 11 and 12, 26 U.S.C.A.  11, 12.1 Respondent contended that this was his net income as described in Section 23(n) and that as his charitable contributions were less than 15 per centum of that amount they were deductible in full in determining his normal tax and surtax. The Commissioner refused to allow the deduction.\n The taxpayer had sustained a 'capital net loss', as defined in Section 101(c) (6), 26 U.S.C.A.  101, of $154,921.98. The Commissioner ruled that 'Since the capital loss of $154,921.98 is in excess of adjusted ordinary net income of $94,963.52 \n\n[305 \nU.S. 357, 359]\n\u00a0\n (without contributions) there is no net income against which to make a deduction for contributions'.\n Having paid the tax assessed by the Commissioner upon that theory, respondent filed his claim for a refund and on its rejection brought this suit in the Court of Claims. Judgment was rendered in his favor. 22 F.Supp. 964. Because of an asserted conflict with decisions of Circuit Courts of Appeals2 and with our ruling in Helvering v. Bliss, \n293 \nU.S. 144\n, 55 S.Ct. 17, 97 A.L.R. 207, certiorari was granted, October 10, 1938, \n305 \nU.S. 582\n, 59 S.Ct. 78, 83 L.Ed. --.\n'Capital net gains' and 'capital net losses' of individual taxpayers are the subject of special treatment under Section 101. In the case of a 'capital net gain', there is to be levied, at the election of the taxpayer, and in lieu of all other taxes imposed by the income tax title, a tax of 12 1\/2 per centum of the capital net gain, to be added to the tax computed upon the basis of the 'ordinary net income'. Sec. 101(a), 26 U.S.C.A.  101. In the case of a 'capital net loss', Section 101(b), 26 U.S.C.A.  101, provides for a tax to be determined, also in lieu of other income taxes but irrespective of any election by the taxpayer, as follows: 'a partial tax shall first be computed upon the basis of the ordinary net income at the rates and in the manner as if this section had not been enacted, and the total tax shall be this amount minus 12 1\/2 per centum of the capital net loss; but in no case shall the tax of a taxpayer who has sustained a capital net loss be less than the tax computed without regard to the provisions of this section'.\n\n Section 101(c)(6), 26 U.S.C.A.  101, defines 'capital net loss' as 'the excess of the sum of the capital losses plus the capital deductions over the total amount of capital gain'. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 357, 360]\n\u00a0\n Section 101(c)(7), 26 U.S.C.A.  101, defines 'ordinary net income' as 'the net income, computed in accordance with the provisions of this title, after excluding all items of capital gain, capital loss, and capital deductions'.\n There is no doubt as to the purpose of this provision as to capital net losses which was first introduced in the Revenue Act of 1924.3 Prior to that time, and under the Revenue Act of 1921, capital losses were to be deducted from capital gains in the process of determining the 'capital net gain'.4 If capital deductions and capital losses were in excess of the capital gain, or if there were capital losses in the absence of capital gain, such losses were deductible as ordinary losses. We are told that the opportunity to minimize taxes by the practice of taking capital losses to offset ordinary net income constituted a particularly serious problem after the Act of 1921, which reduced the rate of tax on capital net gains. The results to the Treasury of that method of treating capital losses led to the adoption in the Act of 1924 of the plan for subjecting capital net losses to a limited rate in order to protect the revenues,5 a plan which was continued in the Revenue Acts of 1926, 1928 and 1932.6\n It will be observed that the provision for the limitation with respect to a capital net loss under Section 101(b) (unlike the provision in Section 101(a) as to a capital net gain) gives no option to the taxpayer. \n7\n The limitation is explicit and must be followed as written. The limitation applies equally when there is no capital gain and hence nothing to be deducted from capital losses on that score. \n8\n The \n\n[305 \nU.S. 357, 361]\n\u00a0\n limitation is applicable unless, as stated in the last clause of Section 101(b), a greater tax would result from not applying it. \n9\n In the instant case there is no question that the limitation does apply and the Commissioner has applied it.\n In such a case the statute directs that a partial tax shall be first computed upon the basis of the 'ordinary net income' and at the rates and in the manner provided in Sections 11 and 12.10 The total tax is then arrived at by deducting 12 1\/2 per centum of the capital net loss. That loss thus figures in the computation of the total tax only by the allowance of an offset to the specified extent against the tax determined apart from the capital losses. Thus where the limitation is applicable and the offset of 12 1\/2 per centum of the capital net loss is allowed accordingly, capital losses are not deductible in determining the taxpayer's net income for the purpose of the normal tax and surtax. And, as in such case there is no capital gain, the 'ordinary net income' under Section 101(b), that is, the net income computed after excluding capital loss and capital deductions, is the only net income upon which a tax is laid.\n We have noted that the limitation of Section 101(b) is not applicable if the tax, computed without regard to that section, would be greater. The latter method of computation brings out the distinction clearly. For in that method the capital net loss is deducted from the ordinary net income in order to arrive at the total net income for the purpose of applying the normal tax and surtax rates. See illustration in Regulations 77, Article 503. But where the limitation of Section 101(b) governs, because the tax as otherwise computed would not be greater, capital losses are not deducted in determining the net income which is \n\n[305 \nU.S. 357, 362]\n\u00a0\n to be taxed, but are used only for the purpose of determining the specified offset against the tax on that net income. Id.\n We are not impressed with the argument based on the provisions of Sections 21, 22 and 23, 26 U.S.C.A.  21-23. True, Section 21 provides that 'net income' means gross income computed under Section 22 less the deductions allowed by Section 23. Section 22 defines gross income and Section 23 provides for deductions, including deductions for losses. But Sections 21, 22 and 23 are not to be construed so as to derogate from the special and explicit provisions of Section 101(b). Under the limitation of that section, as we have seen, the taxpayer is not permitted to deduct capital losses so as to reduce the net income subject to tax and his capital losses enter into the computation of his ultimate tax only through the deduction of 12 1\/2 per centum of the capital net loss from the tax which is computed upon the net income ascertained irrespective of that loss.\n It is in this light that we must decide the particular question here presented as to the meaning of the words 'the taxpayer's net income' in Section 23(n) providing for a deduction of 15 per centum for charitable contributions. Do these words refer to the taxpayer's net income which under the statutory scheme is actually subject to tax? Or is that net income, although treated as subsisting for the purpose of being taxed, to be regarded as nonexistent for the purpose of admitting deductions for contributions? We think that Congress, in the application of the special provision of Section 101(b) for an offset in case of a capital net loss, intended to make the taxpayer's net income, ascertained irrespective of that loss, the subject of the tax and that the provision in Section 23(n) allowing a deduction for charitable contributions is applicable to that taxable net income.\n There is nothing to the contrary in our decision in Helvering v. Bliss, supra. In that case there was a capi- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 357, 363]\n\u00a0\n tal net gain. The net income of the taxpayer comprehended that net gain as well as his net income otherwise computed. We decided that it was his total net income which was to be regarded as the basis for the allowance under Section 23(n). We found nothing in Section 101, which in that application prescribed 'merely a method for segregating a portion of that net income for taxation at a special rate', that in any wise altered the right of the taxpayer to take the deduction in accordance with Section 23( n). Id., pages 150, 151, 55 S.Ct. page 20. Here, instead of a capital net gain, we have a capital net loss. There is no gain to be added to the taxpayer's net income otherwise computed, and thus that is the only net income taxable under the statute. To that net income, the provision of Section 23(n) appropriately applies. We observed in the Bliss Case that the exemption of income devoted to charity and the reduction of the rate of tax on capital gains 'were liberalizations of the law in the taxpayer's favor, were begotten from motives of public policy, and are not to be narrowly construed'. That observation is equally pertinent here.\n The administrative construction invoked by the Government has not been of a sufficiently consistent character to afford adequate support for its contention. \n11\n\u00a0\n\n We conclude that the Commissioner erred in refusing to permit the deduction sought by respondent for his charitable contributions and that the judgment of the Court of Claims should be affirmed.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] These sections provide:\n's 11.

SPONENBARGER(1939)\nNo. 72\nArgued: Decided: December 4, 1939\n\n\n\n\n[308 \nU.S. 256, 257]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Frank Murphy, Atty. Gen., and Warner W. Gardner, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[308 \nU.S. 256, 259]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Lamar Williamson, of Monticello, Ark., for respondents.\n\n\n\n[308 \nU.S. 256, 260]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent sued the United States under the Tucker Act,1 alleging that the Mississippi Flood Control Act of 19282 and construction contemplated by that Act involved an 'intentional, additional, occasional flooding, damaging and destroying' of her land located in Desha County, Arkansas. She maintained that her property had thus been taken for a public use for which the Government is required to pay just compensation by the Fifth Amendment, U.S.C.A. Const. 3. In addition, she asserted a statutory right of recovery under the Act itself. After full hearing, judgment for the Government was entered in the District Court. \n4\n The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. \n5\n Because of the importance of both the legislation and the principles involved, we granted certiorari. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n A summary of the history behind the Mississippi Flood Control Act of 1928 clarifies the issues here. Respondent's land is in the alluvial valley of the Mississippi River. Alluvial soil, rich in fertility, results from deposits of mud and accumulations produced by floods or flowing water. Thus, floods have generously contributed to the fertility of the valley. However, the floods that have given fertility have with relentless certainty undermined the security of life and property. And occupation of the alluvial valley of the Mississippi has always been subject to this constant hazard. \n\n[308 \nU.S. 256, 261]\n\u00a0\n To enjoy the promise of its fertile soil in safety has, for generations, been the ambition of the valley's occupants. As early as 1717, small levees were erected in the vicinity of New Orleans. Until 1883, piecemeal flood protection for separate areas was attempted through uncoordinated efforts of individuals, communities, counties, districts and States. Experience demonstrated that these disconnected levees were utterly incapable of safeguarding an ever increasing people drawn to the fertile valley. Under what was called the Eads plan, the United States about 1883 undertook to cooperate with, and to coordinate the efforts of the people and authorities of the various river localities in order to effect a continuous line of levees along both banks of the Mississippi for roughly nine hundred and fifty miles-from Cape Girardeau, Missouri, to the Gulf of Mexico.7 Recurrent floods, even after the eventual completion of this tremendous undertaking, led to the conclusion that levees alone, though continuous, would not protect the valley from floods. And in 1927 there occurred the most disastrous of all recorded floods. In congressional discussion of the 1928 Act, it was said-as the evidence here discloses-that 'There were stretches of country (in Arkansas) miles in width and miles in length in which ... every house, every barn, every outbuilding of every nature, even the fences, were swept away. It was as desolate as this earth was when the flood subsided.' \n8\n Respondent's land, under fifteen to twenty feet of water, was left bare of buildings of any kind in this 1927 flood.\n The 1928 Act here involved accepted the conception-underlying the plan of General Jadwin of the Army Engineers-that levees alone would not protect the valley from floods. Upon the assumption that there might be \n\n[308 \nU.S. 256, 262]\n\u00a0\n floods of such proportions as to overtop the river's banks and levees despite all the Government could do, this plan was designed to limit to predetermined points such escapes of floodwaters from the main channel. The height of thelevees at these predetermined points was not to be raised to the general height of the levees along the river. These lower points for possible flood spillways were designated 'fuse plug levees.' Flood waters diverted over these lower 'fuse plug levees' were intended to relieve the main river channel and thereby prevent general flooding over the higher levees along the banks. Additional 'guide levees' were to be constructed to confine the diverted flood waters within limited floodway channels leading from the fuse plugs. The suggested fuse plug which respondent claims would damage her property was to be at Cypress Creek, within two to two and one-half miles of her land, and her land lies in the path of the proposed floodway to stem from this particular fuse plug.\n The 1928 Act provided for a comprehensive ten-year program for the entire valley, embodying a general bank protection scheme, channel stabilization and river regulation, all involving vast expenditures of public funds. However, before any part of this program was actually to be carried out, the Act required extensive surveys 'to ascertain the best method of securing flood relief in addition to levees, before any flood- control works other than levees and revetments are undertaken.' 33 U.S.C.A .  702a. Lands intended for floodways were, pending completion of the floodways, to enjoy the protection already afforded by levees.\n The District Court found-\n'Respondent's land lies in that part of the Boeuf Basin which the plan of the 1928 Act contemplated as a diversion channel or Floodway. This Basin has always been \n\n[308 \nU.S. 256, 263]\n\u00a0\n a natural floodway for waters from the Mississippi,9 and respondent's lands, and other lands similarly situated, have been repeatedly overflowed by deep water despite the presence of strong levees. \n10\n The United States has not caused any excessive flood waters to be diverted from the Mississippi through the proposed Boeuf fuse plug (at Cypress Creek) or floodway, and respondent's property has not been subjected to any servitude from excessive floodwaters, which did not already exist before 1928. She still enjoys the same benefits from the Cypress Creek drainage system as when it was created before 1928, and the government program has not 'in any wise, nor to any extent increased the flood hazard thereto.' No work was ever commenced or done within the area of the proposed Boeuf floodway, and the fuse plug heading into it was never established. This floodway as a whole has been abandoned and the Eudora floodway substituted. However, work done under the 1928 Act has shortened the river by cut-offs and dredging and the river has been lowered five or six feet, with the greatest improvement in the vicinity of the proposed fuse plug. Levee protection to lands such as plaintiff's has not been reduced. In fact, plaintiff's land has been afforded additional protection by virtue of the fact that this government improvement program has materially reduced the crest of the river at all times, including flood crests, and her land has also been protected by the Government's reconstruction of levees on the Arkansas River pursuant to its general program. In 1935, her property would have been flooded but for the work done by the Government which has kept her land free of overflow since 1928. Lands, \n\n[308 \nU.S. 256, 264]\n\u00a0\n such as respondent's, located immediately behind levees along the main stem of the Mississippi, are liable to be inundated and destroyed by the breaking of river front levees and from natural crevassing, regardless of the height and strength of the levee. Loss in market value of respondent's property, since 1927, has not been caused by any action of the Government, but is due to the flood of 1927, the depression and other causes unconnected with the governmental program under the 1928 Act. The United States has in no way molested respondent's possession or interfered with her right of ownership. She has remained in uninterrupted possession of her property operating it as a farm and borrowing money upon it as security.'\n\n From these findings the District Court concluded as a matter of law that-\n\n\n (1)\n Respondent's property had not been taken within the meaning of the constitutional prohibition against taking without compensation;\n\n\n (2)\n Under the facts of this case, respondent had no statutory right of recovery under the 1928 Act itself.\n In reversing the District Court's judgment, the Circuit Court of Appeals decided that the Boeuf floodway had not been abandoned by the Government, but was in operative existence notwithstanding that the proposed guide levees along the floodway had not been built and levees on the Mississippi both immediately above and below the proposed fuse plug had not been raised above the height of what would have been the fuse plug levee. The Circuit Court of Appeals said that (101 F.2d 513) 'By the provisions of this plan of flood control (respondent's land) is subjected to a planned and practically certain overflow in case of the major floods contemplated and described. No one can foretell when such may occur, but that is the only remaining uncertainty .... If, and when, such floods do occur, serious destruction must be conceded.' \n\n[308 \nU.S. 256, 265]\n\u00a0\n Upon these conclusions, the Circuit Court held that there was a taking of respondent's property.\n First. This record amply supports the District Court's finding that the program of improvement under the 1928 Act had not increased the immemorial danger of unpredictable major floods to which respondent's land had always been subject. Therefore, to hold the Government responsible for such floods would be to say that the Fifth Amendment requires the Government to pay a landowner for damages which may result from conjectural major floods, even though the same floods and the same damages would occur had the Government undertaken no work of any kind. So to hold would far exceed even the 'extremest'11 conception of a 'taking' by flooding within the meaning of that Amendment. For the Government would thereby be required to compensate a private property owner for flood damages which it in no way caused.\n An undertaking by the Government to reduce the menace from flood damages which were inevitable but for the Government's work does not constitute the Government a taker of all lands not fully and wholly protected. When undertaking to safeguard a large area from existing flood hazards, the Government does not owe compensation under the Fifth Amendment to every landowner which it fails to or cannot protect. In the very nature of things the degree of flood protection to be afforded must vary. And it is obviously more difficult to protect lands located where natural overflows or spillways have produced natural floodways.\n The extent of swamps and overflowed lands in the Boeuf floodway and the history of recurrent floods that have passed through it, support the District Court's finding that the proposed Boeuf floodway is a naturally created floodway. And the Government's problem was by \n\n[308 \nU.S. 256, 266]\n\u00a0\n channel stabilization, dredging, cut-offs or any effective means, to prevent diversions from the Mississippi at all points if possible. But if all diversions could not be prevented, the Government sought to limit the flooding to the least possible number of natural spillways heading into natural floodways. If major floods may sometime in the future overrun the river's banks despite-not because of-the Government's best efforts, the Government has not taken respondent's property. And this is true, although other property may be the beneficiary of the project. The Government has not subjected respondent's land to any additional flooding, above what would occur if the Government had not acted; and the Fifth Amendment does not make the Government an insurer that the evil of floods be stamped out universally before the evil can be attacked at all.\n The far reaching benefits which respondent's land enjoys from the Government's entire program precludes a holding that her property has been taken because of the bare possibility that some future major flood might cause more water to run over her land at a greater velocity than the 1927 flood which submerged it to a depth of fifteen or twenty feet and swept it clear of buildings. Enforcement of a broad flood control program does not involve a taking merely because it will result in an increase in the volume or velocity of otherwise inevitably destructive floods, where the program measured in its entirety greatly reduces the general flood hazards, and actually is highly beneficial to a particular tract of land.\n The constitutional prohibition against uncompensated taking of private property for public use is grounded upon a conception of the injustice in favoring the public as against an individual property owner. But if governmental activities inflict slight damage upon land in one respect and actually confer great benefits when measured in the whole, to compensate the landowner further would \n\n[308 \nU.S. 256, 267]\n\u00a0\n be to grant him a special bounty. Such activities in substance take nothing from the landowner. While this Court has found a taking when the Government directly subjected land to permanent intermittent floods to an owner's damage,12 it has never held that the Government takes an owner's land by a flood program that does little injury in comparison with far greater benefits conferred. \n13\n And here, the District Court justifiably found that the program of the 1928 Act has greatly reduced the flood menace to respondent's land by improving her protection from floods. Under these circumstances, respondent's land has not been taken within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment.\n Second. Even though the Government has not interfered with respondent's possession and as yet has caused no flooding of her land,14 respondent claims her property was taken when the 1928 Act went into effect and work began on its ten-year program because the Act itself involves an imposition of a servitude for the purpose of intentional future flooding of the proposed Boeuf floodway. But, assuming for purposes of argument that it might be shown that such supposed future flooding would inflict damages greater than all benefits received by respondent, still this contention amounts to no more than the claim that respondent's land was taken when the statutory plan gave rise to an apprehension of future flooding. This apprehended flooding might never occur for many reasons-one of which is that the Boeuf floodway might never be begun or completed. As previously pointed out, the Act directed comprehensive surveys be- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 256, 268]\n\u00a0\n fore utilization of any means of flood control other than levees and revetments. In general language it adopted a program recommended by the Chief of Army Engineers, but Congress did not sweep into the statute every suggestion contained in that recommendation.\n Since it envisaged a vast program, the Act naturally left much to the discretion of its administrators and future decisions of Congress. \n15\n Recognizing the value of experience in flood control, Congress and the sponsors of the Act did not intend it to foreclose the possibility of changing the program's details as trial and error might demand.\n Here, it is clear that those charged with execution of the program of the 1928 Act abandoned the proposed Boeuf floodway and substituted another. Whatever the original general purpose of Congress as to that floodway and its fuse plug at Cypress Creek, congressional hearings, reports and legislation have approved their abandonment. Thus, respondent's contention at most is that the Government should pay for land which might have been in a floodway if that floodway had not been abandoned. We think this contention without merit. \n16\n\u00a0\n\n Third. Respondent's 'right of self defense' against floods through locally built levees has not been taken away. The 1928 Act does not represent a self-executing assumption of complete control over all levees to the exclusion of the States and local authorities. Respondent's argument that it does rests upon Section 9 of the Act, 33 U.S.C.A.  702i, making Section 14 of the Act of March 3, 1899 (33 U.S.C. \n\n[308 \nU.S. 256, 269]\n\u00a0\n s 408, 33 U.S.C.A.  408), which forbids interference with levees, 'applicable to all lands, waters, easements, and other property and rights acquired or constructed under the provisions of this (1928) Act (sections 702a to 702m of this title).' But Section 14 of the 1899 Act relates only to levees and other structures 'built by the United States,' and no local levees on which respondent could rely have as yet been 'built by the United States' or 'acquired ... under the provisions of' the 1928 Act. In fact, a proposal that the Government assume control of local levees appeared in the original draft of the 1928 Act but was stricken out by amendment. \n17\n And the War Department, charged with its administration, has treated the Act as leaving local interests free to raise proposed fuse plug levees if they wish. \n18\n\u00a0\n\n Fourth. It is argued that the 1928 Act itself requires judgment for respondent even though her property was not 'taken' within the Fifth Amendment. The pertinent provisions are-\n'No liability of any kind shall attach to or rest upon the United States for any damage from or by floods or flood waters at any place: Provided, however, That if in carrying out the purposes of this Act ( sections 702a to 702m of this title) it shall be found that upon any stretch of the banks of the Mississippi River it is impracticable to construct levees, either because such construction is not economically justified or because such construction would unreasonably restrict the flood channel, and lands in such stretch of the river are subjected to overflow and damage which are not now overflowed or damaged by reason of the construction of levees on the opposite banks of the river it shall be the duty of the Secretary of War and the Chief of Engineers to institute proceedings on behalf of the United States Government to acquire either the absolute ownership of the lands so \n\n[308 \nU.S. 256, 270]\n\u00a0\n subjected to overflow and damage or floodage rights over such lands.\n\n'... The United States shall provide flowage rights for additional destructive flood waters that will pass by reason of diversions from the main channel of the Mississippi River: ....' 33 U.S.C.A.  702c.\n\n This Court has previously decided that 'the construction of levees on the opposite' bank of the Mississippi River which resulted in permanently flooding property across the river did not amount to a 'taking' of the flooded area within the Fifth Amendment. \n19\n We need not here determine whether the provisions of the 1928 Act would themselves grant a statutory right to recover if respondent's land had been damaged as a result of levees constructed on the river's opposite bank. For Section 4 of the Act, 33 U.S.C.A.  702d, contains the further specific reservation 'That in all cases where the execution of the flood-control plan herein adopted results in benefits to property such benefits shall be taken into consideration by way of reducing the amount of compensation to be paid.' On this record it is clear that respondent's lands were not damaged, but actually benefited.\n We do not find it necessary to discuss other questions presented.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and that of the District Court is affirmed.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 28 U.S.C.  41(20), 28 U.S.C.A.  41(20). \n[\nFootnote 2\n] C. 569, 45 Stat. 534, 33 U.S.C.  702a, 33 U.S.C.A.  702a-702m. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Cf.

This water is essential to the cultivation of respondents' lands allotted more than twenty years ago to members of the tribe and presently held under properly acquired fee simple titles. The prayer of the bill is for a permanent injunction against 'maintaining or using said dams and ditches, as aforesaid, and from diverting by means of said dams and ditches or in any other manner any of the waters from Lodge Grass Creek or Little Big Horn River and their tributaries; ....'\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals dismissing the bill must be affirmed.\n By Treaty of May 7, 1868, 15 Stat. 649, 650, 651, the United States set aside a large tract of arid land now within the State of Montana as a Reservation for the 'absolute and undisturbed used and occupation' of Crow Indians, and they undertook to make their permanent homes thereon. It provides that whenever an individual Indian desires 'to commence farming' he may select land, under stated conditions, which thereupon shall 'cease to be held in common, but the same may be occupied and held in the exclusive possession of the person selecting it, and of his family, so long as he or they may continue to cultivate it.' Also-'The President may at any time order a survey of the reservation, and, when so surveyed, Congress shall pro- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 527, 529]\n\u00a0\n vide for protecting the rights of settlers in their improvements, and may fix the character of the title held by each. ... When the head of a family or lodge shall have selected lands and received his certificate as above directed, and the agent shall be satisfied that he intends in good faith to commence cultivating the soil for a living, he shall be entitled to receive seeds and agricultural implements for the first year in value one hundred dollars, and for each succeeding year he shall continue to farm, for a period of three years more, he shall be entitled to receive seeds and implements as aforesaid in value twenty-five dollars per annum.' Article 6.\n The treaty contains no definite provision concerning approprionment or use of waters. Although the lands are arid a considerable area is susceptible of cultivation under irrigation.\n The Act of Congress approved April 11, 1882, Ch. 74, 22 Stat. 42, 43, refers to 'an agreement for the sale to the United States (by the Crows) of a portion of their said reservation, and for their settlement upon lands in severalty,' etc. In return the United States agreed to survey the remaining lands and divide them among members of the tribe; also 'to issue patents to us respectively, therefor, so soon as the necessary laws are passed by Congress.' Section 2-'That the Secretary of the Interior be, and he is hereby, authorized to cause to be surveyed a sufficient quantity of land on the Crow Reservation to secure the settlement in severalty of said Indians as provided in said agreement, and upon the completion of said survey he shall cause allotments of land to be made to each and all of the Indians of said Crow tribe in quantity and character as mentioned and set forth in the agreement above named, and upon the approval of said allotments by the Secretary of the Interior he shall cause patents to issue to each and every allottee for the lands so allotted, with the same \n\n[305 \nU.S. 527, 530]\n\u00a0\n considerations, restrictions, and limitations mentioned therein as are provided in said agreement.'\n The Act of February 8, 1887, Ch. 119, 24 Stat. 388, 389, 390, provides for allotments in severalty to Indians upon any reservation created for their use whenever in the President's opinion any part is advantageous for agricultural and grazing purposes. And it directs that after allotments are approved the Secretary of the Interior shall issue patents declaring the United States will hold the land for twenty-five years in trust and thereafter 'will convey the same by patent to said Indian, or his heirs as aforesaid, in fee, discharged of said trust and free of all charge or incumbrance whatsoever ....'  25 U.S.C.A.  348. Section 7-'In cases where the use of water for irrigation is necessary to render the lands within any Indian reservation available for agricultural purposes, the Secretary of the Interior is authorized to prescribe such rules and regulations as he may deem necessary to secure a just and equal distribution thereof among the Indians residing upon any such reservations; and no other appropriation or grant of water by any riparian proprietor shall be authorized or permitted to the damage of any other riparian proprietor.' 25 U.S.C.A.  381.\n The Act of March 3, 1891, Ch. 543, 26 Stat. 989, 1040, mentions another conveyance by the Crows to the United States and appropriates $200, 000 to be expended under direction of the Secretary of the Interior for irrigation in the valleys of the Big Horn and Little Big Horn Rivers and on Pryor Creek, within the diminished Reservation.\n The Act of May 8, 1906, Ch. 2348, 34 Stat. 182, 183, authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to issue to Indian allottees patents in fee simple 'and thereafter all restrictions as to sale, incumbrance, or taxation of said land shall be removed ....' 25 U.S.C.A.  349. Also- 'Hereafter when an allotment of land is made to any Indian, and any such Indian dies before the expiration of the trust period, said allotment shall be cancelled and \n\n[305 \nU.S. 527, 531]\n\u00a0\n the land shall revert to the United States, and the Secretary of the Interior shall ascertain the legal heirs of such Indian, and shall cause to be issued to said heirs and in their names, a patent in fee simple for said land, or he may cause the land to be sold as provided by law and issue a patent therefor to the purchaser or purchasers, and pay the net proceeds to the heirs, or their legal representatives, of such deceased Indian. The action of the Secretary of the Interior in determining the legal heirs of any deceased Indian, as provided herein, shall in all respects be conclusive and final.' 25 U.S.C.A.  404 note.\n Commencing in 1901 allotments in severalty of tracts abutting or adjacent to the Little Big Horn River or Lodge Grass Creek were made to respondents' Indian predecessors. These culminated in the issuance of fee simple patents as provided by Act of May 8, 1906.1 Each patent undertook to convey the land 'together with all the rights, privileges, immunities and appurtenances, of whatsoever nature, thereunto belonging,' but contained no express provision concerning water rights. Respondents have succeeded to the interest of the original allottees either by mesne conveyances or by purchase at government sales of deceased allottees' lands.\n The Little Big Horn River and its affluent, Lodge Grass Creek, under normal conditions may afford sufficient water to irrigate twenty thousand acres within the Reservation. Through private ditches respondents and their predecessors have long conveyed water from these streams in order to irrigate their lands and thus render them susceptible of cultivation. It is not suggested that water therefor can be obtained from any other source.\n Petitioners maintain-\n That prior to 1885, the United States commenced construction of irrigation works intended to divert \n\n[305 \nU.S. 527, 532]\n\u00a0\n waters from the streams in question. These gradually developed into a system normally capable of carrying sufficient water to irrigate 20,000 acres. \n2\n None of respondents' lands lie within the ambit of these projects; and neither the original allotments nor the patents specifically granted the use of any water.\n That Congress gave the Secretary of the Interior control of Reservation waters. Irrigation projects initiated under his authority prior to allotments of respondents' lands sufficed to dedicate and reserve sufficient water for full utilization of these projects; rights acquired by the allottees were taken subject to this reservation.\n That because of drought during 1931 to 1934, and respondents' diversion of waters upstream from the projects so initiated, the available water became insufficient properly to irrigate some 8,000 acres lying therein and under cultivation. Accordingly the injunction should be granted; all waters from the two streams had been devoted to those and similarly situated lands so far as necessary for farming operations.\n Respondents maintain that under the Treaty of 1868 waters within the Reservation were reserved for the equal benefit of tribal members (Winters v. United States, \n207 \nU.S. 564\n, 28 S.Ct. 207) and that when allotments of land were duly made for exclusive use and thereafter conveyed in fee, the right to use some portion of tribal waters essential for cultivation passed to the owners.\n The respondents' claim to the extent stated is well founded. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 527, 533]\n\u00a0\n Manifestly the Treaty of 1868 contemplated ultimate settlement by individual Indians upon designated tracts where they could make homes with exclusive right of cultivation for their support and with expectation of ultimate complete ownership. Without water productive cultivation has always been impossible.\n We can find nothing in the statutes after 1868 adequate to show Congressional intent to permit allottees to be denied participation in the use of waters essential to farming and home making. If possible, legislation subsequent to the Treaty must be interpreted in harmony with its plain purposes.\n The Secretary of the Interior had authority (Act 1887) to prescribe rules and regulations deemed necessary to secure just and equal distribution of waters. It does not appear that he ever undertook so to do. Certainly he could not affirmatively authorize unjust and unequal distribution. The statute itself clearly indicates Congressional recognition of equal rights among resident Indians.\n Adoption by the Secretary of plans for irrigation projects to serve certain lands was not enough to indicate a purpose to exclude all other land from participation in essential water and thereby destroy the equal interest guaranteed by the Treaty. Subsequent allotments for farming followed by patents negative any such notion. The patented lands had no value for agriculture without water; they were selected for homes and individual farming.\n The petitioners have shown no right to the injunction asked. We do not consider the extent or precise nature of respondents' rights in the waters. The present proceeding is not properly framed to that end.\n The challenged decree must be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice REED took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Ch. 2348, 34 Stat. 182. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See Act of March 1, 1899, Ch. 324, 30 Stat. 924; Act of May 31, 1900, Ch. 598, 31 Stat. 221; Act of April 27, 1904, Ch. 1624, 33 Stat. 352. \n\n\n\n\n","130":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. v.

Larson, of Minneapolis, Minn., for respondent Jaffray and others.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In each of these causes counsel for the United States maintain the District Court was without jurisdiction to determine the issues. The Circuit Courts of Appeal ruled otherwise and approved judgments for respondents. The collectors who received the excess taxes in question were either dead or out of office when the proceedings to recover were commenced. The question of jurisdiction only is open for our consideration.\n Section 145, Judicial Code1 empowers the Court of Claims to hear and determine claims against the United \n\n[306 \nU.S. 276, 278]\n\u00a0\n States arising out of contract, express or implied. Prior to 1921 section 24(20) Judicial Code gave District Courts concurrent jurisdiction when the claim did not exceed Ten Thousand Dollars. \n 2\n\u00a0\n\n The Acts of 1921, 1924, 1925 and 19263 enlarged the jurisdiction of District Courts by adding the following to section 24(20) Judicial Code: 'Concurrent with the Court of Claims, of any suit or proceeding, commenced after the passage of the Revenue Act of 1921, for the recovery of any internal-revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected, or of any penalty claimed to have been collected without authority or any sum alleged to have been excessive or in any manner wrongfully collected, under the internal-revenue laws, even if the claim exceeds $10,000, if the collector of internal revenue by whom such tax, penalty, or sum was collected is dead or is not in office as collector of internal revenue at the time such suit or proceeding is commenced.'\n Section 3226, Revised Statutes as amended and reenacted by Revenue Act 1926, c. 27, sec. 1113(a), 44 Stat. 9, 116, provides: 'No suit or proceeding shall be maintained in any court for the recovery of any internal-revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or col- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 276, 279]\n\u00a0\n lected, ... until a claim for refund or credit has been duly filed with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, .... No such suit or proceeding shall be begun ... after the expiration of five years from the date of the payment of such tax, penalty, or sum, unless such suit or proceeding is begun within two years after the disallowance of the part of such claim to which such suit or proceeding relates. The Commissioner shall within 90 days after any such disallowance notify the taxpayer thereof by mail.'\n Section 3226 was further amended by Act June 6, 1932, c. 209, sec. 1103(a), 47 Stat. 169, 286, so as to read as shown in the margin. \n4\n\u00a0\n No. 416.\n\n The Commissioner of Internal Revenue undertook to deduct more than Ten Thousand Dollars from an admitted overpayment by respondent upon 1917 taxes and to apply this to a declared deficiency for 1918 taxes then barred by the Statute of Limitations. By this suit respondent seeks a judgment for the amount so deducted.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals properly held 'this action was brought to recover that part of a claim for refund of the 1917 overpayment which had been disallowed by improperly applying it to an invalid assessment of a \n\n[306 \nU.S. 276, 280]\n\u00a0\n deficiency tax for 1918.' (98 F.2d 132, 135.) Also, rightly we think, that timely and proper claim for the overpayment for 1917 had been made as required by section 3226, Revised Statutes as reenacted 1926\n\n\n And we accept the conclusions stated in the following excerpt from its opinion: 'The certificate of overassessment issued by the Commissioner on July 27, 1926, disclosed an overpayment by the taxpayer of the 1917 tax of $91,570.34, of which the Commissioner ordered refunded to the taxpayer approximately $55,000, and on July 27, 1926, credited $34,555.68 to a deficiency tax for 1918. It cannot be said that the certificate of overassessment constituted an account stated between the government and the taxpayer, since the taxpayer refused to assent to the application of any part of the overpayment to a deficiency tax for 1918. To constitute an account stated there must be an agreement as to liability and the amount due. Goodrich, Adm'r v. Coffin, 83 Me. 324, 22 A. 217. That the taxpayer's petition was not based on an allowance of an overpayment for 1917, and an implied promise by the government to refund, is equally clear, since the taxpayer refused to assent to the application of $34,555.68 to a deficiency tax of 1918. The application by the Commissioner on July 27, 1926, of a part of the overpayment for 1917 to a deficiency tax for 1918, against the protest of the taxpayer, constituted a disallowance of so much of the petitioner's original claim for refund. ... The suit was one which could have been brought against a Collector, if living, but who is now dead or out of office.'\n Lowe Bros. Co. v. United States, \n304 \nU.S. 302, 303\n, 58 S.Ct. 896, is not controlling. There the suit was begun in the District Court to recover an overpayment of 1917 taxes the alleged result of a credit made by the Commissioner from an admitted overpayment for 1918. For this no action could have been maintained against the collector-he did not \n\n[306 \nU.S. 276, 281]\n\u00a0\n make or authorize the credit. Therefore, the amendment to section 24(20) Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.A.  41(20) enlarging the jurisdiction of the District Court had no application. Here the collector might have been sued since he wrongly received payment on account of 1917 taxes. The present cause falls within the very words of the amendment.\n No. 437.\n Respondents overpaid internal revenue taxes in sums exceeding Ten Thousand Dollars for 1922, 1923 and 1924; and for 1925, $7,800. The Commissioner issued certificates to that effect August 16, 1933. He refused to repay these sums but undertook to credit them to deficiencies which he assessed against respondents for 1926, 1927, 1928.\n Thereupon his suit was brought to recover the overpayments for 1922 to 1925 under section 24(20), Judicial Code, as amended, U.S.C.A. Title 28 ,  41(20), which gives District Courts jurisdiction in respect of taxes erroneously received by a collector out of office. Respondents maintain that, in fact, there were no deficiencies for 1926, 1927, 1928, and that by attempting to credit overpayments for 1922 to 1925 against non-existing deficiencies the Commissioner in effect denied their claims for refund.\n On the other hand petitioner insists, the Commissioner's action in allowing the overpayments and crediting them against alleged deficiencies amounted to payments on account of taxes assessed for 1926 to 1928. And, as it was the Commissioner and not the collector who caused such credit of overpayments to deficiencies, the District Court was without jurisdiction.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals held the suit was one to recover overpayments admittedly made to the collector and in respect of which timely claims for refund had been filed. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 276, 282]\n\u00a0\n It said: 'The crediting of the overpayments, by the Commissioner, against taxes due from the taxpayer for other years was a matter of defense, a justification for the failure to refund, and not a matter which destroyed the taxpayer's cause of action or ousted the court of jurisdiction.' (97 F.2d 488, 492.)\n This conclusion we think is correct. Other points suggested, so far as presently important, are sufficiently answered by what has been said in No. 416.\n Both of the challenged judgments must be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice REED took no part in the consideration or decision of either of these causes. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Tucker Act March 3, 1887, c. 359, 24 Stat. 505, Acts June 27, 1898, c. 503, 30 Stat. 494, July 1, 1898, c. 546, 30 Stat. 597, 649, February 26, 1900, c. 25, 31 Stat. 33, March 3, 1911, 36 Stat. 1087, 1136, U.S.C.A.

S.C.A.  1. 28 F.Supp. 177. \n\n[308 \nU.S. 188, 191]\n\u00a0\n The trade and commerce alleged to be involved is the transportation to the Chicago market of fluid milk produced on dairy farms in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin and the distribution of the milk in that market. The Government divides the defendants into five groups,-(1) distributors and allied groups which include a number of corporations described as major distributors and their officers and agents, the Associated Milk Dealers, Inc., a trade association of milk distributors, and its officers and agents, and the Milk Dealers Bottle Exchange, a corporation controlled by the major distributors; (2) the Pure Milk Association, a cooperative association of milk producers incorporated in Illinois, and its officers and agents; (3) the Milk Wagon Drivers Union, Local 753, engaged in the distribution of milk in Chicago, and certain labor officials; (4) municipal officials, including the president of the Board of Health of Chicago and certain subordinate officials; (5) two persons who arbitrated a dispute between the major distributors and the Pure Milk Association, fixing the price of milk to be paid to the members of the association.\n The indictment, which was filed in November, 1938, contains four counts. The several defendants challenged it by demurrers and motions to quash on various grounds. The District Court held with respect to counts one, two and four, that the production and marketing of agricultural products, including milk, are removed from the purview of the Sherman Act by the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, 50 Stat. 246, 7 U.S.C. A.  671 et seq.; also with respect to all four counts, according to the formal terms of its judgment, that the Pure Milk Association, as an agricultural cooperative association, its officers and agents, are exempt from prosecution under Section one of the Sherman Act by Section 6 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C.  17, 15 U.S.C.A.  17. Sections one and two of the Capper-Volstead Act, 7 U.S.C.  291, \n\n[308 \nU.S. 188, 192]\n\u00a0\n 292, 7 U.S.C.A.  291, 292, and the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act. With respect to count three, the District Court held that it was duplicitous, in the view that it charged several separate conspiracies and also that it did not definitely charge a restraint of interstate commerce.\n The judgment expressly overruled the demurrers and motions to quash so far as they challenged the constitutionality of the Sherman Act or the sufficiency of the allegations of unlawful conspiracy, and also so far as it was contended that interstate commerce was not involved in counts one, two and four. The court added that it overruled all the defendants' contentions which it had not specifically overruled or sustained. The judgment ends by dismissing the indictment as to all defendants.\n The first question presented concerns our jurisdiction. The exceptional right of appeal given to the Government by the Criminal Appeals Act is strictly limited to the instances specified. \n1\n The provision invoked here is the \n\n[308 \nU.S. 188, 193]\n\u00a0\n one which permits review where a decision quashing or sustaining a demurrer to an indictment or any of its counts is based upon the 'construction of the statute upon which the indictment is founded'. The decision below was not predicated upon invalidity of the statute.\n The established principles governing our review are these: (1) Appeal does not lie from a judgment which rests on the mere deficiencies of the indictment as a pleading, as distinguished from a construction of the statute which underlies the indictment. (2) Nor will an appeal lie in a case where the District Court has considered the construction of the statute but has also rested its decision upon the independent ground of a defect in pleading which is not subject to our examination. In that case we cannot disturb the judgment and the question of construction becomes abstract. (3) This Court must accept the construction given to the indictment by the District Court as that is a matter we are not authorized to review. (4) When the District Court holds that the indictment, not merely because of some deficiency in pleading but with respect to the substance of the charge, does not allege a violation of the statute upon which the indictment is founded, that is necessarily a construction of that statute. (5) When the District Court has rested its decision upon the construction of the underlying statute this Court is not at liberty to go beyond the question of the correctness of that construction and consider other objections to the indictment. The Government's appeal does not open the whole case.\n First. The first two of these principles, as the Government concedes, preclude our review of the decision below as to count three. For that count was held bad upon the independent ground that it is defective as a pleading, being duplicitous and also lacking in definiteness. United States v. Keitel, \n211 \nU.S. 370\n, 397-399, 29 S.Ct. 123, 131-132; United States v. \n\n[308 \nU.S. 188, 194]\n\u00a0\n Carter, \n231 \nU.S. 492, 493\n, 34 S.Ct. 173, 174; United States v. Hastings, \n296 \nU.S. 188\n, 192-194, 56 S.Ct. 218, 219, 220. The appeal as to count three must be dismissed.\n Second. After a general description of the averments of the indictment, which was explicitly founded on Section one of the Sherman Act, the District Court construed counts one, two and four as follows (28 F. Supp. 180):\n'Count 1 charges a conspiracy 'to arbitrarily fix, maintain and control artificial and non-competitive prices to be paid to all producers by all distributors for all fluid milk produced on approved dairy famrs located in the states of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin', and shipped to Chicago.\n\n'Count 2 charges a conspiracy 'to fix and maintain by common and concerted action, uniform, arbitrary and non-competitive prices for the sale by the distributors in the city of Chicago of fluid milk shipped into the said city from the states of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin.'\n\n'Count 4 charges a conspiracy 'to restrict, limit and control and to restrain and obstruct the supply of fluid milk moving in the channels of interstate commerce into the city of Chicago from the states of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin.\"\n\n The District Court further summarized the allegations in these counts as to the methods by which the alleged conspiracies were intended to be effected. 28 F.Supp. at pages 179-181. This construction of the indictment is binding upon this Court on this appeal. United States v. Patten, \n226 \nU.S. 525, 535\n, 540 S., 33 S.Ct. 141, 142, 144, 44 L.R.A.,N.S., 325; United States v. Colgate & Co., \n250 \nU.S. 300, 301\n, 39 S.Ct. 465, 466, 7 A.L.R. 443; United States v. A. Schrader's Son, \n252 \nU.S. 85, 98\n, 40 S.Ct. 251, 253; United States v. Yuginovich, \n256 \nU.S. 450, 461\n, 41 S.Ct. 551, 553; United States v. Hastings, supra, 296 U.S. at page 192, 56 S.Ct. at page 219.\n Third. The District Court, thus construing counts one, two and four, held as a matter of substance that, because \n\n[308 \nU.S. 188, 195]\n\u00a0\n of the effect of the later statutes, these counts did not charge an offense under Section one of the Sherman Act. This was necessarily a construction of the Sherman Act. United States v. Patten, supra; United States v. Birdsall, \n233 \nU.S. 223, 230\n, 34 S.Ct. 512, 514; United States v. Kapp, \n302 \nU.S. 214, 217\n, 58 S.Ct. 182, 184. We are not impressed with the argument that the court simply construed the later statutes. The effect of those statutes was considered in determining whether the Sherman Act has been so modified and limited that it no longer applies to such combinations and conspiracies as are charged in counts one, two and four. Thus the Sherman Act was not the less construed because it was construed in the light of the subsequent legislation.\n We have jurisdiction under the Criminal Appeals Act to determine whether the construction thus placed upon the Sherman Act is correct.\n Fourth. In reaching its conclusion, the District Court referred to Section 6 of the Clayton Act, Sections 1 and 2 of the Capper-Volstead Act, and the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, as amended in 1935, and as reenacted and amended by the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, 7 U.S.C.A.  601 et seq.\n With respect to the Clayton Act,2 the court said in its opinion: 'By that act labor, agricultural or horticultural cooperative organizations were excepted from the \n\n[308 \nU.S. 188, 196]\n\u00a0\n broad and sweeping terms of the Sherman Act. Such cooperative organizations, in and of themselves, were not to be construed as illegal combinations or conspiracies in restraint of trade under the antitrust laws'. 28 F.Supp. 183. But the court did not hold that, by these provisions of the Clayton Act, either the defendants Pure Milk Association and its officers and agents or the defendants Milk Wagon Drivers Union, Local 753, and its officials, (albeit these organizations were not in themselves illegal combinations or conspiracies) were rendered immune from prosecution under the Sherman Act for their alleged participation in the combinations and conspiracies charged in counts one, two and four of the indictment. The Sherman Act was not construed by the District Court as having been limited to that extent by the Clayton Act.\n The court invoked the Capper-Volstead Act,3 as its judgment shows, only in relation to certain defendants, that is, the Pure Milk Association, an agricultural cooperative organization, and its officers and agents. We shall consider later the effect of that statute upon the charge against those defendants.\n The court dismissed the indictment as to all defendants, and we think it manifest that this ruling in its bearing upon counts one, two and four was due to the effect upon the Sherman Act which the court attributed to the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n\n (1)\n. As to that Act, the court said:\n'The Court holds that, by the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act the Congress has committed to the Execu- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 188, 197]\n\u00a0\n tive Department, acting through the Secretary of Agriculture, full, complete and plenary power over the production and marketing, in interstate commerce, of agricultural products, including milk.\n\n'To what extent he should act, the quantum of regulation, is solely one for his judgment and decision. If conditions require, he must act; if they do not require action, then all marketing conditions are deemed satisfactory and the purpose of the act is effectuated. Non-action by the Secretary of Agriculture, in any given marketing area, is equivalent to a declaration that the policy of the act, in that area, is being carried out. If the policy of the act, in any given milk area, is being violated it becomes the duty of the Secretary of Agriculture to intervene and invoke the powers conferred upon him by the act.\n\n'It results, from what has been said, that the power of regulation, supervision and control of the milk industry, in any given milk shed, is, by the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, vested exclusively in the Secretary of Agriculture. It follows further that the Secretary of Agriculture cannot by his own action, or inaction, divest himself of this power so long as the statute remains in force. The marketing of the agricultural products, including milk, covered by the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act, is removed from the purview of the Sherman Act. In other words, so far as the marketing of agricultural commodities, including milk, is concerned, no indictment will lie under section 1 of the Sherman Act'. 28 F.Supp. at page 187.\n\n It will be observed that the District Court attributes this effect to the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act per se, that is, to its operation in the absence, and without regard to the scope and particular effect, of any marketing agreements made by the Secretary of Agriculture or of any orders issued by him pursuant to the Act. In the opinion of the court below, the existence of the au- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 188, 198]\n\u00a0\n thority vested in the Secretary of Agriculture, although unexercised, wholly destroys the operation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act with respect to the marketing of agricultural commodities.\n We are of the opinion that this conclusion is erroneous. No provision of that purport appears in the Agricultural Act. While effect is expressly given, as we shall see, to agreements and orders which may validly be made by the Secretary of Agriculture, there is no suggestion that in their absence, and apart from such qualified authorization and such requirements as they contain, the commerce in agricultural commodities is stripped of the safeguards set up by the Anti-Trust Act and is left open to the restraints, however unreasonable, which conspiring producers, distributors and their allies may see fit to impose. We are unable to find that such a grant of immunity by virtue of the inaction, or limited action, of the Secretary has any place in the statutory plan. We cannot believe that Congress intended to create 'so great a breach in historic remedies and sanctions'.5\n It is a cardinal principle of construction that repeals by implication are not favored. When there are two acts upon the same subject, the rule is to give effect to both if possible. United States v. Tynen, 11 Wall. 88, 92; Henderson's Tobacco, 11 Wall. 652, 657; General Motors Acceptance Corporation v. United States, \n286 \nU.S. 49, 61\n, 62 S., 52 S.Ct. 468, 472, 82 A.L.R. 600. The intention of the legislature to repeal 'must be clear and manifest'. Red Rock v. Henry, \n106 \nU.S. 596, 601\n, 602 S., 1 S.Ct. 434, 439. It is not sufficient as was said by Mr. Justice Story in Wood v. United States, 16 Pet. 342, 362, 363, 'to establish that subsequent laws cover some or even all of the cases provided for by (the prior act); for they may be merely affirmative, or cumulative, or auxiliary'. There \n\n[308 \nU.S. 188, 199]\n\u00a0\n must be 'a positive repugnancy between the provisions of the new law and those of the old; and even then the old law is repealed by implication only, pro tanto, to the extent of the repugnancy'. See, also, Posadas v. National City Bank, \n296 \nU.S. 497, 504\n, 56 S.Ct. 349, 352.\n The Sherman Act is a broad enactment prohibiting unreasonable restraints upon interstate commerce, and monopolization or attempts to monopolize, with penal sanctions. The Agricultural Act is a limited statute with specific reference to particular transactions which may be regulated by official action in a prescribed manner. The Agricultural Act6 declares it to be the policy of Congress 'through the exercise of the powers conferred upon the Secretary of Agriculture under this chapter, to establish and maintain such orderly marketing conditions for agricultural commodities in interstate commerce as will establish prices to farmers at a level that will give agricultural commodities a purchasing power with respect to articles that farmers buy, equivalent to the purchasing power of agricultural commodities in the base period' described. To carry out that policy a particular plan is set forth. Farmers and others are not permitted to resort to their own devices and to make any agreements or arrangements they desire, regardless of the restraints which may be inflicted upon commerce. The statutory program to be followed under the Agricultural Act requires the participation of the Secretary of Agriculture who is to hold hearings and make findings. The obvious intention is to provide for what may be found to be reasonable arrangements in particular instances and in the light of the circumstances disclosed. The methods which the Agricultural Act permits to attain that result are twofold, marketing agreements and orders. To give validity to marketing agreements the Secretary must be an \n\n[308 \nU.S. 188, 200]\n\u00a0\n actual party to the agreements. Section 8b. \n7\n The orders are also to be made by the Secretary for the purpose of regulating the handling of the agricultural commodity to which the particular order relates. Section 8c(3 ) (4).8 That the field covered by the Agricultural Act is not coterminus with that covered by the Sherman Act is manifest from the fact that the former is thus delimited by the prescribed action participated in and directed by an officer of government proceeding under the authority specifically conferred by Congress. As to agreements and arrangements not thus agreed upon or directed by the Secretary, the Agricultural Act in no way impinges upon the prohibitions and penalties of the Sherman Act, and its condemnation of private action in entering into combinations and conspiracies which impose the prohibited restraint upon interstate commerce remains untouched.\n It is not necessary to labor the point, for the Agricultural Act itself expressly defines the extent to which its provisions make the antitrust laws inapplicable. That definition is found in Section 8b9 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act carried into the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act in relation to marketing agreements, and provides as follows:\n'In order to effectuate the declared policy of this chapter, the Secretary of Agriculture shall have the power, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, to enter into marketing agreements with processors, producers, associations of producers, and others engaged in the handling of any agricultural commodity or product thereof, only with respect to such handling as is in the current of interstate or foreign commerce or which directly burdens, obstructs, or affects, interstate or foreign commerce in \n\n[308 \nU.S. 188, 201]\n\u00a0\n such commodity or product thereof. The making of any such agreement shall not be held to be in violation of any of the antitrust laws of the United States, and any such agreement shall be deemed to be lawful: Provided, That no such agreement shall remain in force after the termination of this chapter'.\n\n Another provision is found in Section 3(d)10 of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act, relating to awards or agreements resulting from the arbitration or mediation by the Secretary of Agriculture or by a designated officer or employee of the Department of Agriculture as provided in Section 3(a),11 and meetings for that purpose and awards or agreements resulting therefrom which have been approved by the Secretary of Agriculture as rovided in Section 3(b).12 Section 3(d) provides:\n'No meeting so held and no award or agreement so approved shall be deemed to be in violation of any of the antitrust laws of the United States'.\n\n These explicit provisions requiring official participation and authorizations show beyond question how far Congress intended that the Agricultural Act should operate to render the Sherman Act inapplicable. \n13\n If Congress had desired to grant any further immunity, Congress doubtless would have said so.\n An agreement made with the Secretary as a party, or an order made by him, or an arbitration award or agreement approved by him, pursuant to the authority conferred by the Agricultural Act and within the terms of the described immunity, would of course be a defense to a prosecution under the Sherman Act to the extent that the prosecution sought to penalize what was thus validly \n\n[308 \nU.S. 188, 202]\n\u00a0\n agreed upon or directed by the Secretary. Further than that the Agricultural Act does not go.\n We have no occasion to decide whether in any particularcase an indictment under the Sherman Act by reason of its particular terms would be subject to demurrer, or to a motion to quash, upon the ground that the indictment ran against the provisions of such an agreement or order. We have no such situation here. There is indeed a contention that there was a license (No. 30) issued by the Secretary of Agriculture in 1934, amended in January, 1935, and in force until March 2, 1935, which related to the marketing of milk in the Chicago area, and hence that defendants operating under that license were not subject to the charges of the conspiracies alleged to have begun in January, 1935. But the allegations of the indictment are that the unlawful conspiracies continued throughout all the period mentioned in the indictment, that is, up to the time of its presentment in November, 1938. This clearly imports that the conspiracies were operative after the license came to an end and thus in the absence of any license. A conspiracy thus continued is in effect renewed during each day of its continuance. United States v. Kissel, \n218 \nU.S. 601, 607\n, 608 S., 31 S.Ct. 124, 125, 126; Hyde v. United States, \n225 \nU.S. 347, 369\n, 32 S.Ct. 793, 803, Ann.Cas.1914A, 614; Brown v. Elliott, \n225 \nU.S. 392, 400\n, 32 S.Ct. 812, 815. It is also said that there is a recent marketing order under date of August 29, 1939, 14 which relates to the Chicago marketing area, and hence that this cause is moot. But that order affects a period subsequent to the time covered by the indictment. These contentions are unavailing in relation to the question before us.\n Our conclusion is that the Agricultural Adjustment Act as reenacted and amended by the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act affords no ground for construing \n\n[308 \nU.S. 188, 203]\n\u00a0\n the Sherman Act as inapplicable to the charges contained in counts one, two and four.\n\n\n (2)\n. There remains the question whether the court below rightly held that the Capper-Volstead Act15 had modified the Sherman Act so as to exempt the Pure Milk Association, a cooperative agricultural organization, and its officers and agents, from prosecution under these counts.\n As to the Capper-Volstead Act the Court said:\n'This act legalizes price fixing for those within its purview. To that extent it modifies the Sherman Act. It removes from the Sherman Act those organizations, cooperative in their nature, which come within the purview of the Capper-Volstead Act. Prior to the Capper-Volstead Act farmers were treated no differently than others under the anti-trust laws, so far as price fixing was concerned. ...\n\n'The Capper-Volstead Act does not condemn any kind of monopoly or restraint of trade, or any price fixing, unless such monopoly or price fixing unduly enhances the price of an agricultural product. The Act then, by section 2 thereof, commits to an officer of the executive department, the Secretary of Agriculture, the power of regulation and visitation.\n\n'Under this act farmers are favored under the anti-trust laws in that they are given a qualified right, free from any criminal liability, to combine among themselves to monopolize and restrain interstate trade and commerce in farm products and to fix and enhance the price thereof.\n\n'... The court deduces from the Capper-Volstead Act that the Secretary of Agriculture has exclusive jurisdiction to determine and order, in the first instance, whether or not farmer cooperatives, in their operation, monopolize and restrain interstate trade and commerce \n\n[308 \nU.S. 188, 204]\n\u00a0\n 'to such an extent that the price of any agricultural product is unduly enhanced.' Until the Secretary of Agriculture acts, the judicial power cannot be invoked'. 28 F.Supp. at pages 183, 184.\n\n We are unable to accept that view. We cannot find in the Capper- Volstead Act, any more than in the Agricultural Act, an intention to declare immunity for the combinations and conspiracies charged in the present indictment. Section 6 of the Clayton Act, enacted in 1914,16 had authorized the formation and operation of agricultural organizations provided they did not have capital stock or were conducted for profit, and it was there provided that the antitrust laws should not be construed to forbid members of such organizations 'from lawfully carrying out the legitimate objects thereof'. They were not to be held illegal combinations. The Capper-Volstead Act, enacted in 1922,17 was made applicable as well to cooperatives having capital stock. The persons to whom the Capper-Volstead Act applies are defined in Section one as producers of agricultural products, 'as farmers, planters, ranchmen, dairymen, nut or fruit growers'. They are authorized to act together 'in collectively processing, preparing for market, handling, and marketing in interstate and foreign commerce' their products. They may have 'marketing agencies in common', and they may make 'the necessary contracts and agreements to effect such purposes'.\n The right of these agricultural producers thus to unite in preparing for market and in marketing their products, and to make the contracts which are necessary for that collaboration, cannot be deemed to authorize any combination or conspiracy with other persons in restraint of \n\n[308 \nU.S. 188, 205]\n\u00a0\n trade that these producers may see fit to devise. In this instance, the conspiracy charged is not that of merely forming a collective association of producers to market their products but a conspiracy, or conspiracies, with major distributors and their allied groups, with labor officials, municipal officials, and others, in order to maintain artificial and non- competitive prices to be paid to all producers for all fluid milk produced in Illinois and neighboring States and marketed in the Chicago area, and thus in effect, as the indictment is construed by the court below, 'to compel independent distributors to exact a like price from their customers' and also to control 'the supply of fluid milk permitted to be brought to Chicago'. 28 F.Supp. at pages 180-182. Such a combined attempt of all the defendants, producers, distributors and their allies, to control the market finds no justification in Section one of the Capper- Volstead Act.\n Nor does the court below derive its limitation of the Sherman Act from Section one. The pith of the court's conclusion is that under Section two an exclusive jurisdiction with respect to the described cooperative associations is vested, in the first instance, in the Secretary of Agriculture, and that, until the Secretary acts, the judicial power to entertain a prosecution under the Sherman Act cannot be invoked. Section two of the Capper-Volstead Act does provide a special procedure in a case where the Secretary of Agriculture has reason to believe that any such association 'monopolizes' or restrains interstate trade 'to such an extent that the price of any agricultural product is unduly enhanced'. Thereupon the Secretary is to serve upon the association a complaint, stating his charge with notice of hearing. And if upon such hearing the Secretary is of the opinion that the association 'monopolizes', or does restrain interstate trade to the extent above mentioned, he then is to issue an order directing \n\n[308 \nU.S. 188, 206]\n\u00a0\n the association 'to cease and desist' therefrom. Provision is made for judicial review.\n We find no ground for saying that this limited procedure is a substitute for the provisions of the Sherman Act, or has the result of permitting the sort of combinations and conspiracies here charged unless or until the Secretary of Agriculture takes action. That this provision of the Capper-Volstead Act does not cover the entire field of the Sherman Act is sufficiently clear. The Sherman Act authorizes criminal prosecutions and penalties. The Capper-Volstead Act provides only for a civil proceeding. The Sherman Act hits at attempts to monopolize as well as actual monopolization. And Section two of the Capper-Volstead Act contains no provision giving immunity from the Sherman Act in the absence of a proceeding by the Secretary. We think that the procedure under Section two of the Capper-Volstead Act is auxiliary and was intended merely as a qualification of the authorization given to cooperative agricultural producers by Section one, so that if the collective action of such producers, as there permitted, results in the opinion of the Secretary in monopolization or unduly enhanced prices, he may intervene and seek to control the action thus taken under Section one. But as Section one cannot be regarded as authorizing the sort of conspiracies between producers and others that are charged in this indictment, the qualifying procedure for which Section two provides is not to be deemed to be designed to take the place of, or to postpone or prevent, prosecution under Section one of the Sherman Act for the purpose of punishing such conspiracies.\n Fifth. Having dealt with the construction placed by the court below upon the Sherman Act, our jurisdiction on this appeal is exhausted. We are not at liberty to consider other objections to the indictment or questions which may arise upon the trial with respect to the merits \n\n[308 \nU.S. 188, 207]\n\u00a0\n of the charge. For it is well settled that where the District Court has based its decision on a particular construction of the underlying statute, the review here under the Criminal Appeals Act is confined to the question of the propriety of that construction. United States v. Keitel, supra; United States v. Kissel, supra, 218 U.S. at page 606, 31 S.Ct. 125; United States v. Miller, \n223 \nU.S. 599, 602\n, 32 S.Ct. 323, 324; United States v. Carter, supra; United States v. Colgate & Co., supra; United States v. A. Schrader's Son, supra; United States v. Hastings, supra. The case of United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corporation, \n299 \nU.S. 304\n, 57 S.Ct. 216, is not opposed, as there the decision of the District Court was not based upon a particular construction of the underlying statute, but upon its invalidity, and the jurisdiction of this Court extended to the consideration of the rulings of the District Court which dealt with that question.\n The limitation applicable in the instant case to the question of the District Court's construction of the Sherman Act disposes of the contention urged by some of the defendants that counts two and four do not show such a direct restraint upon interstate commerce as to bring the acts charged within the statute. The District Court said in its opinion that, in view of its rulings (above discussed) as to counts one, two and four, it was unnecessary to decide 'whether or not the allegations of the indictment show that interstate commerce was or was not restrained'. 28 F. Supp., p. 187. In its judgment the court formally overruled all objections to these counts so far as the objections rested on the ground that interstate commerce was not involved. If these rulings be treated as dealing merely with the construction of the indictment, they must be accepted here. United States v. Patten, supra; United States v. Colgate & Co., supra; United States v. Hastings, supra. But, apart from that, the District Court certainly has not construed the Sher- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 188, 208]\n\u00a0\n man Act as inapplicable upon the ground that interstate commerce is not involved, and the question of the bearing upon that commerce of the acts charged is not before us.\n Similarly, the contention of the defendants who are labor officials that the Sherman Act does not apply to labor unions or labor union activities is not open on this appeal. The District Court did not construe the Sherman Act as inapplicable to these defendants and the Government's appeal, under the restriction of the Criminal Appeals Act, does not present that question.\n The appeal as to count three is dismissed. The judgment is reversed as to counts one, two and four, and the cause is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. It is so ordered.\n Appeal dismissed in part and judgment reversed and cause remanded in part. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] This Act, 18 U.S.C. 682, 18 U.S.C.A.  682; Jud.Code, Sec. 238, 28 U.S.C.  345, 28 U.S.C.A.  345, provides:\n'An appeal may be taken by and on behalf of the United States from the district courts direct to the Supreme Court of the United States in all criminal cases, in the following instances, to wit:\n\n'From a decision or judgment quashing, setting aside, or sustaining a demurrer to, any indictment, or any count thereof, where such decision or judgment is based upon the invalidity, or construction of the statute upon which the indictment is founded.\n\n'From a decision arresting a judgment of conviction for insufficiency of the indictment, where such decision is based upon the invalidity or construction of the statute upon which the indictment is founded.\n\n'From the decision or judgment sustaining a special plea in bar, when the defendant has not been put in jeopardy. ...\n\n'Pending the prosecution and determination of the appeal in the foregoing instances, the defendant shall be admitted to bail on his own recognizance: Provided, That no appeal shall be taken by or allowed the United States in any case where there has been a verdict in favor of the defendant'. \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Section 6 of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 730, 15 U.S.C.  17, 15 U.S. C.A.  17, provides:\n'The labor of a human being is not a commodity or article of commerce.

GLENN L. MARTIN CO.(1939)\nNo. 30\nArgued: Decided: November 6, 1939\n\n\n\n Mr. Frank Murphy, Atty. Gen., and Samuel O. Clark, Jr., Asst. Atty. Gen., for petitioner.\n Mr. John T. Koehler, of Baltimore, Md., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n We must determine whether a contract to purchase certain aircraft and aircraft material from respondent required the United States to increase the stipulated \n\n[308 \nU.S. 62, 63]\n\u00a0\n price by the amount of Social Security taxes paid by respondent.\n June 28, 1934, the War Department and respondent, a Maryland manufacturer, made the contract, providing 'It is expressly understood and agreed to by and between the parties hereto that the prices herein stipulated include any Federal Tax heretofore imposed by the Congress which is applicable to the material called for under the terms of this contract. If any sales tax, processing tax, adjustment charge, or other taxes or charges are imposed or changed by the Congress subsequent to the date of this contract and made applicable directly upon production, manufacture, or sale of the supplies called for herein and are paid by the Contractor on the articles or supplies herein contracted for then the price herein stipulated will be increased or decreased accordingly and any amount due the Contractor as result of such change will be charged to the Government and entered on vouchers as separate items.'\n With respect to payrolls of employees alleged to have been engaged in fulfilling this contract during 1936 and 1937, respondent paid $794.03 in Federal Social Security taxes and $6,943.29 under the State of Maryland's Unemployment Compensation Law. Both the Federal tax and Maryland's tax were levied 'subsequent to the date of this contract.' Respondent claims that both the Maryland Unemployment Compensation taxes1 and the Federal Social Security taxes2 were 'imposed ... by ... Congress' and were of the type for which the contract provided extra compensation.\n Rejecting respondent's construction of the contract, the District Court held that no part of the taxes paid by respondent served to increase the liability of the Govern- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 62, 64]\n\u00a0\n ment on its contract. \n3\n The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed4 and we granted certiorari. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n Obviously, the seller fixed its stipulated prices so as to provide a margin of profit over Federal taxes for which it might at the time of the contract be responsible on the particular 'material' sold. This clearly appears from the governing provision's opening declaration that 'the prices herein stipulated include any Federal tax heretofore imposed by Congress which is applicable to the material called for under the terms of this contract.' But, without more, future increases in Federal taxes 'applicable to the material' might have substantially affected the margin of profit which the contract was calculated to insure. Against the contingency of increase in Federal taxes applicable to the 'material' purchased, the Government undertook to compensate the seller for payment of future Federal taxes 'on the articles or supplies contracted for' should Congress levy any sales tax, processing tax or other tax 'applicable directly upon production, manufacture or sale of the articles ... contracted for ....'\n But the Social Security Act6 imposes upon every employer 'an excise tax, with respect to having individuals \n\n[308 \nU.S. 62, 65]\n\u00a0\n in his employ.' And employment in that Act 'means any service, of whatever nature, performed within the United States by an employee for his employer ...' with exceptions not material here. This excise has been represented as one levied 'upon the relation of employment' 7 and upon 'the right to employ'8 and as a payroll tax. \n9\n It is not-as taxes upon the privilege of selling, manufacturing or processing characteristically are- measured by the value of the privilege taxed, or by either quantity or price of what is manufactured, processed or sold. A tax on the processing or sale of an article, while an excise, commonly would be denoted a tax 'on' the article processed or sold. The contract itself speaks of such taxes which may, in the future, be 'paid by the contractor on the articles or supplies contracted for.' (Italics supplied). Thus, this contract was concerned with Federal taxes 'on' the goods to be provided under it, whatever the occasion for the taxes. And a tax 'on' the relationship of employer-employee-characterized as a tax on payrolls-is not of the type treated by the contract as a tax 'on' the goods or articles sold.\n The contract refers only to Federal taxes, existing or future, on 'material', 'articles' or 'supplies.' And additional compensation is provided to offset only Federal taxes of the type of sales taxes and processing taxes, 'applicable directly upon production, manufacture, or sale' and actually paid on supplies delivered to the Government. Since a tax on payrolls, or on the relationship of employment, is not-but in fact is distinct from-the type of tax 'on' articles represented by sales taxes and processing taxes, respondent is not entitled to the additional compensation which it seeks. \n\n[308 \nU.S. 62, 66]\n\u00a0\n In view of our determination that the Federal Social Security tax was not contemplated by the contract, we need not discuss respondent's contention that the tax paid under the Maryland Unemployment Compensation Act was a tax 'imposed ... by ...

Frank Murphy, Atty. Gen., and James C. Wilson, Sp. Asst. to Atty. Gen., for appellants.\n Mr. W. F. Peter, of Chicago, Ill., for appellees.\n\n\n\n[308 \nU.S. 225, 227]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This appeal raises the question whether the Interstate Commerce Commission, in approving and authorizing a lease of a railroad by one railroad company to another, under  5(4)(b) of the Interstate Commerce Act as amended, 48 Stat. 217, 49 U.S.C.  5(4)(b), 49 U.S.C.A.  5(4)(b) enacted in substance as  407(5)(6) of the Transportation Act of 1920, 41 Stat. 481, has authority to prescribe as a condition of its order, that certain employees of the lessor shall receive partial compensation for the loss which they may suffer, by reason of their discharge or transfer as a result of the lease.\n Appellees are trustees of the Chicago, Rock Island & Gulf Company and of the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railway Company, both in bankruptcy for purposes of reorganization under  77 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. A.  205. They applied to the Interstate Commerce Commission for authority under  5(4)(b) to lease the railroad and properties of the Gulf Company to themselves as trustees of the Pacific Company at an annual rental equal to the net operating income of the leased property. On the application, which was twice heard by the Commission, evidence was submitted from which the Commission found that the Gulf Company, whose entire capital stock is owned by the Pacific Company, is owner of six hundred and thirty-two miles of railroad in Texas which it operates separately from the 8,138 miles of railroad of the Pacific Company; that the purpose of the proposed lease was to combine the operation of the two lines in order to effect savings in operating costs through the elimination of the Texas accounting offices of the Gulf Company.\n The Commission found that the lease would not impose upon the public any change in conditions affecting \n\n[308 \nU.S. 225, 228]\n\u00a0\n train operation; that it would have no effect on rates or routes and would result in no change of service to the public. It found that the elimination of the Texas accounting offices would result in an annual saving of $100,000, six or seven thousand dollars of which would accrue to the Gulf Company and the remainder to the Pacific Company, to be effected through the ultimate dismissal of forty-nine of the Gulf accounting employees and the transfer of twenty others to the Chicago offices of the Pacific Company. The Commission also found that the welfare of the employees affected by the elimination of the accounting office is one of the matters of public interest which the Commission must consider in proceedings under  5(4)(b).\n It accordingly authorized the lease upon the conditions which it found to be just and reasonable: that for a period not exceeding five years each retained employee should be compensated for any reduction in salary so long as he is unable, in the exercise of his seniority rights under existing rules and practices to obtain a position with compensation equal to his compensation at the date of the lease; that dismissed employees unable to obtain equivalent employment be paid partial compensation for the loss of their employment in specified amounts and for specified periods depending on the length of their service, and that the transferred employees be paid their traveling and moving expenses including losses incurred through being forced to sell their homes. The maximum cost of compliance with the conditions, it was found, would be $ 290,000 spread over a period of five years, during which the savings effected by the lease would be not less than $500,000. The Commission found that the proposed lease, with the specified conditions 'will be in harmony with and in furtherance of our plan for the consolidation of railroad properties and will promote the public interest.' \n\n[308 \nU.S. 225, 229]\n\u00a0\n In the present suit, brought by appellees, the district court of three judges (Urgent Deficiencies Act of October 22, 1913, 38 Stat. 208, 219, 220, 28 U.S.C.  45, 47a, 28 U.S.C.A.  45, 47a, granted the relief sought, and decreed that the conditions of the Commission's order be set aside and that the Commission be enjoined from enforcing them. The case comes here on appeal under  238 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  345, 28 U.S.C.A.  345.\n Appellees contend, as the district court held, that the Commission was without the authority of any act of Congress to attach the prescribed conditions to its order. Consequently, they argue that the courts may appropriately set them aside as of no effect, leaving the remainder of the order to stand as the Commission's unqualified approval of the lease, although the Commission gave no indication that it would have authorized the lease without the conditions.\n Section 5(4)(a) provides that 'it shall be lawful, with the approval ... of the Commission, as provided in subdivision (b), for two or more carriers to consolidate or merge their properties ... or for any carrier ... to ... lease ... the properties ... of another ...' Subdivision (b) provides that the Commission on application by the carrier or carriers concerned may, after hearing, authorize such a consolidation or lease, and directs that 'if after such hearing the Commission finds that, subject to such terms and conditions and such modifications as it shall find to be just and reasonable, the proposed consolidation ... (or) lease ... will be in harmony with and in furtherance of the plan for the consolidation of railway properties established pursuant to paragraph (3), and will promote the public interest, it may enter an order approving such consolidation ... (or) lease ... upon the terms and conditions and with the modifications so found to be just and reasonable.' 49 U.S.C.A.  5(4)(a, b). \n\n[308 \nU.S. 225, 230]\n\u00a0\n In New York Central Securities Co. v. United States, \n287 \nU.S. 12\n, 53 S.Ct. 45, we pointed out that the phrase 'public interest' in this section does not refer generally to matters of public concern apart from the public interest in the maintenance of an adequate rail transportation system; that it is used in a more restricted sense defined by reference to the purposes of the Transportation Act of 1920, of which the section is a part and which, as had been recognized in earlier opinions of this Court, sought through the exercise of the new authority given to the Commission to secure a more adequate and efficient transportation system. See New England Divisions Case, \n261 \nU.S. 184\n, 43 S. Ct. 270; Dayton-Goose Creek Ry. v. United States, \n263 \nU.S. 456\n, 44 S.Ct. 169, 33 A.L.R. 472; Texas & Pacific Railway Company v. Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company, \n270 \nU.S. 266, 277\n, 46 S.Ct. 263, 266. Thus restricted, the term public interest 'as used in the statute is not a mere general reference to public welfare, but, as shown by the context and purpose of the act, 'has direct relation to adequacy of transportation service, to its essential conditions of economy and efficiency, and to appropriate provision and best use of transportation facilities.\" State of Texas v. United States, \n292 \nU.S. 522, 531\n, 54 S.Ct. 819, 824\n\n\n Appellees do not challenge the Commission's contention that the conditions are germane to the transaction involved in the lease because the purpose of the conditions is to mitigate the direct effect of the lease upon the employees. See United States v. Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific Railroad Company, \n282 \nU.S. 311, 324\n, 339 S., 340, 51 S.Ct. 159, 162. But they insist that the conditions which the Commission is permitted by this section to attach to its order must also conform to the standard of public interest which the statute sets up to guide the Commission's action. From this premise they argue that the prescribed conditions are unauthorized because unrelated to the public interest in its statutory sense. They maintain that a carrier's employees, as such, are \n\n[308 \nU.S. 225, 231]\n\u00a0\n not part of the public whose interest is to be promoted by the lease, and that their interest in keeping their employment without loss of compensation is of private concern and no part of that public interest in the maintenance of an adequate and efficient transportation system which the statute contemplates.\n Accepting the premise, as we may for present purposes, without considering the contention of the Commission that the conditions if just and reasonable, need not be related to the other statutory standards, the issue is narrowed to a single question whether we can say, as matter of law, that the granting or withholding of the protection afforded to the employees by the prescribed conditions can have no influence or effect upon the maintenance of an adequate and efficient transportation system which the statute recognizes as a matter of public concern.\n Appellees do not attack the sufficiency of the evidence on which the Commission's findings are based, and that evidence was not submitted to the district court for review. Hence we are free to disturb the findings only if we can say that there can be no rational basis for them. Mississippi Valley Barge Line Co. v. United States, \n292 \nU.S. 282\n, 54 S.Ct. 692; Swayne & Hoyt, Ltd. v. United States, \n300 \nU.S. 297, 304\n, 57 S.Ct. 478, 481; Rochester Telephone Corp. v. United States, \n307 \nU.S. 125, 146\n, 59 S.Ct. 754. Appellees do not deny that the use of part of the savings resulting from the lease to compensate the employees for the loss which it will occasion, is just and reasonable so far as the interest and relations of employer and employee are concerned; or that the lease will be in harmony with and further the Commission's plan for consolidation of the railroads as the Commission found. They urge only that the conditions imposed can have no relationship to the maintenance of an adequate and efficient transportation system \n\n[308 \nU.S. 225, 232]\n\u00a0\n and in consequence cannot in any circumstances be said to promote the public interest in the statutory sense.\n The proposed lease in its relation to the transfer or dismissal of employees and to an adequate and efficient transportation system, is not to be viewed as an isolated transaction or apart from the Commission's plan for consolidation of the railroads. As a result of the enactment of the Transportation Act in 1920, consolidation of the railroads of the country, in the interest of economy and efficiency, became an established national policy, and the effective consolidation of the railroads in conformity to the provisions of the Act and to the plan of consolidation which the Commission was directed to prepare became a matter of public interest. The policy of consolidation is so intimately related to the maintenance of an adequate and efficient rail transportation system that the 'public interest' in the one cannot be dissociated from that in the other. Hence, in considering whether the public interest under  5(4)(b) will be promoted by the conditions of an order authorizing a consolidation or lease, the Commission is free to consider their effect upon the national policy of consolidation as well as their more immediate effect on the adequacy and efficiency of the transportation system.\n Obedient to the mandate of  5\n\n[308 \nU.S. 225, 2]\n\u00a0\n of the Act the Commission has prepared and published a plan under which it is proposed that the railroads of the country be consolidated into a limited number of large systems. Consolidation of Railroads, 159 I.C.C. 522; 185 I.C.C. 403. By  5 of the Act the ban on consolidation of railway carriers was removed, and acting under it the Commission has granted authority for numerous consolidations and leases in furtherance of the plan. In the preparation and execution of the plan it speedily became apparent that the great savings which would result from consolidation could not be effected without profoundly \n\n[308 \nU.S. 225, 233]\n\u00a0\n affecting the private interests of those immediately concerned in the maintenance of the existing nationwide railway system, the railroad security holders and employee. The security holders are usually, though not always favorably affected by economies resulting from consolidation. \n1\n But the Commission has estimated in its report on unification of the railroads that 75% of the savings will be at the expense of railroad labor. Not only must unification result in wholesale dismissals and extensive transfers, involving expense to transferred employees, but in the loss of seniority rights which, by common practice of the railroads are restricted in their operation to those members of groups who are employed at specified points or divisions. It is thus apparent that the steps involved in carrying out the Congressional policy of railroad consolidation in such manner as to secure the desired economy and efficiency will unavoidably subject railroad labor relations to serious stress and its harsh consequences may so seriously affect employee morale as to require their mitigation both in the interest of the successful prosecution of the Congressional policy of consolidation and of the efficient operation of the industry itself,2 both of which are of public concern within the meaning of the statute. \n\n[308 \nU.S. 225, 234]\n\u00a0\n One must disregard the entire history of railroad labor relations in the United States to be able to say that the just and reasonable treatment of railroad employees in mitigation of the hardship imposed on them in carrying out the national policy of railway consolidation, has no bearing on the successful prosecution of that policy and no relationship to the maintenance of an adequate and efficient transportation system. As was pointed out by Commissioner Eastman in his concurring opinion in this case the protection afforded to employees by the challenged conditions is substantially that provided in event of consolidation by an agreement entered into in May, 1936, between 219, the great majority of the railroad lines of the country, and 21 labor organizations. \n3\n He also directed attention to the fact that the Committee of Six, three of whom were railroad executives, in their report to the President of December 23, 1938, recommended that the federal agency passing upon railroad consolidation 'require as a prerequisite to approval a fair and equitable arrangement to protect the interests of ... employees',4 and that this report had been ap- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 225, 235]\n\u00a0\n proved by the directors of the Association of American Railroads.\n We can hardly suppose that the railroads, in entering into this agreement and endorsing this recommendation left out of account their own interest in the maintenance of transportation service or that their interest in this respect differs or is separable from that of the public interest. In fact, before this action by the railroads the Commission itself had taken the view that the welfare of dismissed employees must be considered in passing upon proposed consolidations,5 and in its sixth annual report in 1892 it declared in recognition of the same principle, that 'relations existing between railway corporations and their employees are always of public interest.' \n6\n The Federal Coordinator of Railroads, in his fourth annual report to Congress in 1936, recommended the enactment of a comprehensive system of dismissal compensation, stating that such a system 'would enhance the safety or efficiency of railroad service.' H.Doc. No. 394, 74th Cong.2nd Sess., p. 56. 7\n The now extensive history of legislation regulating the relations of railroad employees and employers plainly evidences the awareness of Congress that just and reasonable treatment of railroad employees is not only an essential \n\n[308 \nU.S. 225, 236]\n\u00a0\n aid to the maintenance of a service uninterrupted by labor disputes, but that it promotes efficiency, which suffers through loss of employee morale when the demands of justice are ignored. Title 3 of the Transportation Act of 1920, 45 U.S.C.A.  131 et seq. \n8\n which was enacted at the same time as the provisions reenacted in substance in  5(4)(b), set up a 'Labor Board' to decide railroad labor disputes involving grievances, rules and working conditions, and declared in  301 'it shall be the duty of all carriers and their officers, employees, and agents, to exert every reasonable effort and adopt every available means to avoid any interruption to the operation of any carrier growing out of any dispute between the carrier and the employees or subordinate officials.' Congress has passed successive measures for arbitration of railroad disputes between railroad employees and employers, all aimed at the prevention of interruptions of railroad service through such disputes, and culminating in the passage of the Railway Labor Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 577, and in its amendments in 1934, 48 Stat. 1185, 45 U.S.C.,  151-163, 45 U.S.C.A.  151-163; Texas & New Orleans Railroad Co. v. Brotherhood of Railway and Steamship Clerks, \n281 \nU.S. 548\n, 50 S.Ct. 427; Virginian Railway Co. v. System Federation, \n300 \nU.S. 515\n, 57 S.Ct. 592. By the Wagner Labor Relations Act of 1935, 49 Stat. 449, \n\n[308 \nU.S. 225, 237]\n\u00a0\n 29 U.S.C., 151 et seq., 29 U.S.C.A.  151 et seq., it recognized and sought to prevent the interference with interstate commerce which may ensue from labor disputes arising in industry not engaged in transportation. See National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., \n301 \nU.S. 1, 42\n, 57 S.Ct. 615, 626, 108 A.L.R. 1352; National Labor Relations Board v. Fainblatt, \n306 \nU.S. 601, 604\n, 59 S. Ct. 668.\n The Safety Appliance Act of 1893, 27 Stat. 531, 45 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq.; see Southern Railway Co. v. United States, \n222 \nU.S. 20\n, 32 S.Ct. 2; the Hours of Service Act of 1907, 34 Stat. 1415, 45 U.S.C.A.  61 et seq.; see Baltimore & Ohio R.R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n221 \nU.S. 612\n, 31 S.Ct. 621, and the Federal Employers Liability Act of 1908, 35 Stat. 65, 45 U.S.C.A.  51 et seq.; see Second Employers' Liability Cases, \n223 \nU.S. 1, 51\n, 32 S.Ct. 169, 178, 56 S.Ct. 327, 38 L.R.A., N.S., 44, were designed mainly to insure the safety and welfare of railroad employees and the constitutionality of those measures was sustained in part on the ground that they fostered the commerce in which the employees were engaged. In passing the Adamson Act of 1916, 39 Stat. 721, 45 U.S.C.A.  65, 66, fixing the wages of railroad employees, Congress thought that it was safeguarding the railroads of the country from interruption which might result from labor disputes and the constitutionality of the Act was sustained on that ground. Wilson v. New, \n243 \nU.S. 332, 351\n, 37 S.Ct. 298, 303, L.R.A. 1917E, 938, Ann. Cas.1918A, 1024. And in the Act of 1934, as amended in 1937, 48 Stat. 1283; 50 Stat. 307, 45 U.S.C.,  201-214, 228a to 228r, 45 U.S.C.A.  201-214, 228a to 228r, providing for a retirement and pension plan for railroad employees, Congress declared in terms that the plan was adopted for the purpose of 'promoting efficiency and safety in interstate transportation.'\n In the last regular session of Congress, an act to amend the Interstate Commerce Act was passed by the Senate,  2009, 76th Cong., 1st Sess. The House passed a substitute bill embodying extensive changes. H. Rept. 1217, 76th Cong., 1st Sess. Both bills are now in conference. But both as passed contain a provision carrying into effect the recommendation of the Committee of Six, see \n\n[308 \nU.S. 225, 238]\n\u00a0\n S.Rept. 433, 76th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 29, by directing the Commission to require 'as a prerequisite to its approval of any proposed transaction ( consolidation or lease under  5(4)(b)) a fair and equitable arrangement to protect the interests of the employees affected.' Both bills as enacted declare it 'to be the national transportation policy of Congress ... to encourage fair wages and equitable working conditions, all to the end of developing, coordinating and preserving a national transportation system ... by ... rail ... adequate to meet the needs of the commerce of the United States. ...' Congress has thus declared that fair and equitable provision for the compensation of losses thrown upon employees as the result of an authorized consolidation or lease promotes the national transportation policy by developing, coordinating and preserving the railroad transportation system.\n In the light of this record of practical experience and Congressional legislation, we cannot say that the just and reasonable conditions imposed on appellees in this case will not promote the public interest in its statutory meaning by facilitating the national policy of railroad consolidation; that it will not tend to prevent interruption of interstate commerce through labor disputes growing out of labor grievances, or that it will not promote that efficiency of service which common experience teaches is advanced by the just and reasonable treatment of those who serve. In the light of that record too we do not doubt that Congress, by its choice of the broad language of  5(4)(b) intended at least to permit the Commission, in authorizing railroad consolidations and leases, to impose upon carriers conditions related, as these are, to the public policy of the Transportation Act to facilitate railroad consolidation, and to promote the adequacy and efficiency of the railroad transportation system. \n\n[308 \nU.S. 225, 239]\n\u00a0\n The fact that a bill has recently been introduced in Congress and approved by both its houses, requiring as a matter of national railway transportation policy the protection of employees such as the Commission has given here, does not militate against this conclusion. Doubts which the Commission at one time entertained but later resolved in favor of its authority to impose the conditions, were followed by the recommendation of the Committee of Six that fair and equitable arrangements for the protection of employees be 'required'. It was this recommendation which was embodied in the new legislation. Sen.Rep. No. 433, 76th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 29. We think the only effect of this action was to give legislative emphasis to a policy and a practice already recognized by  5( 4)(b) by making the practice mandatory instead of discretionary, as it had been under the earlier act.\n It is said that the statute, as we have construed it, is unconstitutional because not within the Congressional power to regulate interstate commerce and is a denial of due process. It is true that in Railroad Retirement Board v. Alton Railroad Company, \n295 \nU.S. 330\n, 55 S.Ct. 758, in declaring the Railroad Retirement Act of June 27, 1934, 48 Stat. 1283, not to be a valid regulation of interstate commerce, it was said, among other reasons advanced to support that conclusion, that a compulsory retirement system for railroad employees can have no relation to the promotion of efficiency, economy or safety of railroad operation. But notwithstanding what was said there and even if we were doubtful whether the particular provisions made here for the protection of employees could have the effect which we have indicated upon railroad consolidation and upon the adequacy and efficiency of the railroad transportation system, we could not say that the Congressional judgment that those conditions have a relation to \n\n[308 \nU.S. 225, 240]\n\u00a0\n the public interest as defined by the statute is without rational basis. Cf. South Carolina Highway Dept. v. Barnwell Bros., \n303 \nU.S. 177, 189\n, 191 S., 58 S.Ct. 510, 515, 517; United States v. Carolene Products Co., \n304 \nU.S. 144, 147\n, 58 S.Ct. 778, 781; Pittman v. Home Owners' Loan Corp., \n308 \nU.S. 21\n, 60 S.Ct. 15, decided November 6, 1939.\n If we are right in our conclusion that the statute is a permissible regulation of interstate commerce, the exercise of that power to foster, protect and control the commerce with proper regard for the welfare of those who are immediately concerned in it, as well as the public at large, is undoubted. Second Employers' Liability Cases, supra, 223 U.S. page 47, 32 S.Ct. page 173, 38 L.R.A.,N.S., 44; Dayton-Goose Creek Ry. Co. v. United States, \n263 \nU.S. 456, 478\n, 44 S.Ct. 169, 172, 33 A.L.R. 472; United States v. Carolene Products Co., supra, 304 U.S. page 147, 58 S.Ct. page 781; Mulford v. Smith, \n307 \nU.S. 38\n, 59 S.Ct. 648. Nor do we perceive any basis for saying that there is a denial of due process by a regulation otherwise permissible, which extends to the carrier a privilege relieving it of the costs of performance of its carrier duties, on condition that the savings be applied in part to compensate the loss to employees occasioned by the exercise of the privilege. That was decided in principle in Dayton-Goose Creek Railway Company v. United States, supra. There it was held that the Fifth Amendment U.S.C.A.Const. does not forbid the compulsory application of income, attributable to a privilege enjoyed by a railroad as a result of Commission action, to specified purposes 'in the furtherance of the public interest in railway transportation.'  422(10), Transportation Act, 41 Stat. 490, 49 U.S.C.A.  15a. Moreover we cannot say that this limited and special application of the principle, fully recognized in our cases sustaining workmen's compensation acts, that a business may be required to carry the burden of employee wastage incident to its operation, infringes due process.

The Board awarded the employees compensation for loss from depreciation of the value of their homes (cf. Clause 4 in the order here involved). The Board, after extensive hearings, found that such a requirement was reasonable in view of the fact that railroads themselves had on several prior occasions compensated the employees affected. 28 Monthly Labor Review, 1191 (1929).

S.C.A.  45, 47a.\n The application to the special facts of this case of what is colloquially known as 'the grandfather clause' of the Motor Carrier Act is the substantive question at issue. There is a preliminary jurisdictional problem touching those phases of the relations of the Interstate Commerce Commission to the courts which are implied by the claim that the Commission had issued a 'negative order.'\n Section 206 of the Motor Carrier Act, Act of August 9, 1935, 49 Stat. 543, 49 U.S.C.A.  306, forbids common carriers by motor vehicle subject to its provisions from engaging in interstate operations without a certificate of public convenience and necessity to be issued by the Interstate Commerce Commission under Section 207 of the Act, 49 U.S.C.A.  307. 'The grandfather clause' of section 206, however, provides that 'if any such carrier ... was in bona fide operation as a common carrier by motor vehicle on June 1, 1935, over the route or routes or within the territory for which application is made and has so operated since that time, ... the Commission shall issue such certificate without requiring further proof that public convenience and necessity will be served by such operation.'\n On January 24, 1936, the appellee, Maher, filed an application under the 'grandfather clause' for a certificate to engage in the transportation of passengers and baggage over U.S. Highway No. 99 between Portland and Seattle and intermediate points. After a hearing was had before a 'Joint Board' composed of members from the states involved ( 203(a)(4) and 205, 49 U.S.C.A.  303(a)(4), 305) at which competing carriers and the Public Utilities Commission of Oregon appeared in opposition to the application, and after a report was filed by the Joint Board with the Inter \n\n[307 \nU.S. 148, 151]\n\u00a0\n state Commerce Commission recommending that the application be denied, the Interstate Commerce Commission, Division 5, on October 27, 1937, found the facts to be as follows: From 1931 until May 29, 1936, the appellee had engaged in bona fide 'anywhere-for-hire' operations in Oregon with occasional entries into Washington. There were rare trips to Seattle, no service at all to most of the intervening points, and no showing that passengers were transported on return trips to Portland. On May 29, 1936, the appellee began his regular-route service between Portland and Seattle which he conducted regularly since that time. But upon the institution of the regular-route service between Portland and Seattle the appellee discontinued the 'anywhere-for-hire' operations theretofore conducted. Upon this showing Division 5 found that the service conducted by the appellee since May 29, 1936, was a different service from that conducted by him prior to that time, and therefore concluded that he did not come within 'the grandfather clause.' And so, the Commission denied Maher's application and ordered him 'to cease and desist' from 'all operations' as a common carrier in interstate commerce. Thereupon the appellee filed the present suit in the District Court for the District of Oregon against the United States and the Interstate Commerce Commission, praying that the Commission's order be set aside and 'any construction thereunder' enjoined. The suit was disposed of on the pleadings, the answer of the Commission having incorporated its report and orders. A majority of the District Court entertained jurisdiction and held that the appellee was entitled to an 'anywhere-for-hire' permit under 'the grandfather clause' as well as the regular route permit under Section 207. 23 F.Supp. 810 Circuit Judge Haney found jurisdiction to review the cease and desist order, although not the order denying the certificate of convenience and necessity, but sustained the Commission's view of the Act. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 148, 152]\n\u00a0\n The jurisdictional problem presents another instance of the Interstate Commerce Commission having been invested with power to free a complainant of restrictions placed upon his conduct by a statutory scheme and having definitively rejected the claim for dispensation. The applicant before the Commission then came into court to 'set aside' and 'annul' the 'order' of the Interstate Commerce Commission, claiming that the Commission's action was based on a wrong reading of the authority which the Act of Congress gave it. To the hearing of such a claim there is no jurisdictional barrier, as we have held today in Rochester Telephone Corp. v. United States, \n307 \nU.S. 125\n, 59 S.Ct. 754, 83 L.Ed. --.1\n On the merits the case brings into question the validity of the construction placed by the Interstate Commerce Commission upon Section 206( a) of the Motor Carrier Act relieving carriers operating on June 1, 1935, under the circumstances defined by the terms of Section 206(a) from the requirements of Section 207.2 The latter section requires a find- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 148, 153]\n\u00a0\n ing by the Commission that the granting of such a certificate is demanded by public convenience and necessity. But under Section 206(a) the Commission must issue 'such certificate without requiring further proof that public convenience and necessity will be served' by an applicant who 'was in bona fide operation as a common carrier by motor vehicle on June 1, 1935, over the route or routes or within the territory for which application is made and has so operated since that time'. By this legislation Congress responded to the felt need for regulating interstate motor transportation through familiar administrative devices, while at the same time it satisfied the dictates of fairness by affording sanction for enterprises theretofore established. Whether an applicant seeking ex- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 148, 154]\n\u00a0\n emption had in fact been in operation within the immunizing period of the statute was bound to raise controverted matters of fact. Their determination Congress entrusted to the Commission. The legal issues presented by this record are relatively simple once the somewhat confused operations of the appellee's business are clearly defined.\n Invoking the 'grandfather clause' the appellee sought from the Commission a certificate authorizing continuance of his regular service between the fixed termini of Portland and Seattle on U.S. Highway 99. But the Commission found that the regular operation over this route had only been instituted on May 29, 1936. Theretofore, and including the crucial period prior to June 1, 1935, the appellee had been engaged in quite different services from those for which it asked a certificate, namely, 'an \n\n[307 \nU.S. 148, 155]\n\u00a0\n irregular, so-called anywhere-for-hire operation in Oregon with occasional trips to points in Washington' over any route adapted to a particular trip, but using at least for part of the distance U.S. Highway 99 on trips to Washington. These irregular operations were discontinued after the appellee's regular route was established. Applying these findings which are binding here, the Commission ruled that the appellee did not bring himself within the privilege of the 'grandfather clause.' In making this application of the statute, the Commission properly construed it.\n The recognized practices of an industry give life to the dead words of a statute dealing with it. In differentiating between operations over the 'route or routes' for which an application under the 'grandfather clause' is made as against operations 'within the territory', Congress plainly adopted the familiar distinction between 'anywhere-for-hire' bus operations over irregular routes and regular route bus operations between fixed termini. \n3\n Such recognition is implicit also in the provision of Section 208(a), 49 U.S.C.A.  308(a), that 'Any certificate issued under section (306 or 307) 206 or 207 shall specify the service to be rendered and the routes over which, the fixed termini, if any, between which, and the intermediate and off-route points, if any, at which, and in case of operations not over specified routes or between fixed termini, the territory within which, the motor carrier is authorized to operate.' Since the new regular route of appellee was not in existence on June 1935, and the irregular 'anywhere-for-hire' service was not 'so operated', as required by Section 206, when the Commission passed upon the application for a \n\n[307 \nU.S. 148, 156]\n\u00a0\n 'grandfather' certificate, the Commission rightly rejected the application.\n But the District Court set aside the Commission's order on another ground. It held that when the Commission rejected appellee's claim under the 'grandfather clause' another provision of Section 206(a) sprang into relevance, to wit 'Otherwise the application for such certificate shall be decided in accordance with the procedure provided for in section (307(a)) 207(a) of this chapter and such certificate shall be issued or denied accordingly.' We do not read the statute as laying a compulsion upon the Commission to canvass all the questions of public and private interest that are implicit in an application for a certificate based on 'public convenience and necessity' when the applicant himself only seeks the favor of the 'grandfather clause' and makes no claim, either before the Commission or in his bill seeking to enjoin its action, to have the Commission act outside the 'grandfather clause'.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] For reasons on which its legislative history appears to shed no light, the phrase 'negative order' crept into Section 205 of the Motor Carrier Act in a context not covering the present situation. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] '( 306.)

Martin, of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n Mr. Graham K. Betts, of Seattle, Wash., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n We are called upon to determine whether Section 301 or Section 305 of the World War Veterans' Act1 applies to a lapsed policy of War Risk yearly renewable term insurance.\n Section 301 authorizes conversion of such policies and provides (with exceptions not applicable here) that 'All yearly renewable term insurance shall cease on July 2, 1927, except when death or total permanent disability shall have occurred before July 2, 1927: ....'\n Section 305 provides that 'Where any person has heretofore allowed his insurance to lapse, ... while suffering from a compensable disability for which compensation was not collected and dies or has died, or becomes or has become permanently and totally disabled' while 'entitled to compensation remaining uncollected ... his insurance ... shall not be considered as lapsed;' and the Veterans' Administration shall pay him or his beneficiaries 'so much of his insurance as said uncollected compensation ... would purchase if applied as premiums when due ... less the unpaid premiums and interest thereon at 5 per centum compounded annually in installments.'\n John F. McClure, a World War Veteran, allowed his yearly renewable term insurance to lapse by failing to pay the premium due February, 1919, 'while suffering \n\n[305 \nU.S. 472, 474]\n\u00a0\n from a compensable disability for which compensation was not collected.' December 1, 1929, when he became permanently and totally disabled, there remained uncollected compensation due him sufficient to pay all premiums then due on his lapsed policy. The veteran brought suit on his policy alleging total and permanent disability and, at his death, respondent-as administratrix and individually-filed an amended complaint seeking recovery under Section 305. The District Court held that the insurance was not revived under Section 305 and entered judgment for the government. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed,2 believing Section 301 did not limit Section 305 and that respondent was entitled to judgment on the policy, contrary to the result reached by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n Since this veteran's lapsed policy was 'yearly renewable term insurance' and his permanent disability occurred after July 2, 1927, the question is, Did such insurance cease to exist on July 2, 1927 because of the general sweeping provisions of Section 301, or was lapsed yearly renewable term insurance-such as his-saved by the special benefits extended under Section 305? We find the answer in the language of the original War Risk Insurance Act and its amendments.\n That original Act of October 6, 1917,4 provided government insurance without medical examination for persons engaged in war services. Yearly renewable term insurance was granted with provision for conversion into other forms of insurance without medical examination not later than five years after the termination of the war.\n August 9, 1921, Congress amended this Act and added Section 408.5 Section 408 greatly liberalized the rights \n\n[305 \nU.S. 472, 475]\n\u00a0\n of veterans, both to reinstate and to revive lapsed 'yearly renewable term insurance.' First. Veterans suffering from disability contracted in active war service were permitted to reinstate their policies despite such disability. Second. Veterans' insurance which had lapsed while the veterans were suffering from service connected disabilities for which compensation had not been paid-as here, was revived in the amount which such uncollected compensation-at death or date of total disability-would purchase. This first provision of Section 408 was the original predecessor of Section 304; the second provision-relied upon on to enforce McClure's policy-became Section 305.\n By the Act of March 4, 1923,6 Congress broadened both beneficial provisions of Section 408 and left it as a single Section. But in 1924, when Congress revised the War Risk Insurance Act,7 these twin provisions of Section 408 were severed and thereafter appeared as two separate and distinct paragraphs, Sections 304 and 305. Section 304 incorporated that portion of Section 408 which had provided for reinstatement of lapsed term insurance despite physical disability. Section 305 reenacted the second provision of Section 408 which had authorized utilization of uncollected compensation for revival of such lapsed insurance. It is of vital significance that Congress in creating these two new Sections was careful to limit reinstatement of lapsed term insurance by concluding Section 304 with the pointed proviso 'That no term insurance shall be reinstated after July 2, 1926.' But Congress placed no such limitation of the right of revival under Section 305, on which this suit is brought.\n The action of Congress in restricting the benefits only under one of the two Sections must be considered together with Section 301 of the same 1924 Act which provided that 'All term insurance shall cease on July 2, 1926, except when death or total permanent disability shall have occurred \n\n[305 \nU.S. 472, 476]\n\u00a0\n before July 2, 1926.' Congress in this 1924 Act, clearly evidenced its purpose to prohibit reinstatement of yearly renewable term policies under Section 304 after July 2, 1926, in order to make Section 304 conform to Section 301 which authorized conversion of such policies prior to that date. Reinstatement under 304, however, required action by the veteran. He was required to submit application, to comply with statutory and administrative regulations, and to pay back premiums. But action by the veteran was not required to revive a lapsed policy under Section 305. His rights did not depend upon application, proof, compliance with regulations or payment. Because his policy had lapsed while the government owed him money for service connected disability which had become total and permanent, his lapsed policy was automatically revived. To have required action on his part would have been inconsistent with the manifest purpose of Congress to permit revival and continuation of insurance solely because the government had in its possession funds due the veteran and sufficient to pay for his insurance.\n June, 1926,8 Section 301 was amended extending the date for conversion of yearly renewable term insurance to July 2, 1927, and the following month the proviso of Section 304 was specifically amended to conform to the June amendment to 301, by prohibiting reinstatement of such insurance after July 2, 1927.9 Although the right of reinstatement under Section 304 thus was again specifically restricted, Congress in no way indicated any intention to add the same restriction to the right of revival under Section 305 on which the present suit is based. Instead, the benefits under Section 305 were extended by the July amendment so as to permit beneficiaries to apply uncollected bonuses to the lapsed policies of deceased veterans. Congress again gave special \n\n[305 \nU.S. 472, 477]\n\u00a0\n attention to Section 305 in 192810 and authorized the revival of lapsed policies by utilization of compensation otherwise uncollectible because barred by limitations. Continuing the separate consideration and treatment of Sections 304 and 305, Congress in 1930 once more applied the restrictive proviso to Section 304 but not to Section 305.11\n The deliberate intention of Congress to apply different restrictions to the right of reinstating lapsed policies under Section 304 and that of reviving such policies under Section 305 was also made manifest by other changes in the Act of July 2, 1926.12 While reinstatement of yearly renewable term insurance under 304, but not revival under 305, was therein prohibited after July 2, 1927, a new proviso was added to 305 under which the 'insurance hereafter revived under this section (305) ... shall be paid only to the insured, his widow, child or children, dependent mother or father, ....' On the other hand, there is no such limitation as to beneficiaries of policies reinstated under the provisions of Section 304. This studied limitation of the government's liability on policies revived under Section 305, by restriction of beneficiaries, indicates a distinctive legislative consideration and treatment of that Section.\n To hold that a lapsed yearly renewable term insurance policy cannot be revived under Section 305 would be to apply to that Section, by construction, the proviso which Congress attached only to 304. Sections 304 and 305 are distinct parts of the statute which contains them. While both Sections emanated from a single prior Section, Congress evidently separated them to provide for the individual treatment that has been given reinstatement as distinguished from revival of lapased policies. A deliberate separation of the two parts of the old Section-ap \n\n[305 \nU.S. 472, 478]\n\u00a0\n plying a restriction to one and not the other-indicates that a change was intended. \n13\n This is in accord with the presumption that a proviso 'refers only to the provision to which it is attached.' \n14\n\u00a0\n\n In the light of the statutory development of the War Risk Insurance Act. there is no conflict between the general provisions of Section 301 requiring conversion of yearly renewable term insurance by July 2, 1927, and the special benefits granted by Section 305 to that particular group of veterans to whom the government had not paid disability compensation which was justly their due. The benefits of the special provisions of Section 305 are extended to every veteran who has 'heretofore allowed his insurance to lapse, ....' The meaning of the words of the statute is apparent and we need not look beyond the language and statutory development of the War Risk Insurance Act. \n15\n A lapsed policy, whether yearly renewable term or in converted form, comes within the provisions of Section 305.\n Since the veteran in this case was due compensation for service connected disabilities at the time his policy lapsed and at the time he became totally and permanently disabled the amount of his uncollected compensation was sufficient to pay all premiums then due, his insurance was revived under Section 305. The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is therefore affirmed.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 38 U.S.C., Sections 512 and 516, 44 Stat. 686, 790, 799, 38 U.S.C.A .  512, 516. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 9 Cir., 95 F.2d 744. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Skelton v.

United States, \n304 \nU.S. 1\n, 58 S.Ct. 773, 999, without consideration of the merits, for failure of the Secretary to follow the procedure prescribed by the statute.\n On June 14, 1933, the Secretary of Agriculture promulgated an order under the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921, 42 Stat. 159, 7 U.S.C.  181- 229, 7 U.S.C.A.  181-229, setting aside a schedule of maximum rates to be charged for stockyard services, filed by market agencies at the Kansas City stockyards, and prescribing a new and lower rate schedule for the future. In a suit brought in the District Court for Western Missouri by appellees, 24 F.Supp. 214, conducting market agencies at the Kansas City stockyards, to set aside the \n\n[307 \nU.S. 183, 186]\n\u00a0\n order as confiscatory and as having been rendered without procedural due process, the court on July 22, 1933, entered a temporary restraining order enjoining enforcement of the Secretary's order upon condition that appellees should 'deposit with the Clerk of this Court on Monday of each and every week thereafter while this order, or any extension thereof, may remain in force and effect and pending final disposition of this cause, the full amount by which the charges collected under the Schedule of Rates in effect exceeds the amount which would have been collected under the rates prescribed in the Order of the Secretary, together with a verified statement of the names and addresses of all persons upon whose behalf such amounts are collected by petitioner.' After two appeals we reversed the final decree of the district court, which had sustained the order of the Secretary. This Court held that he had not accorded to appellees the 'full hearing' which  310 of the Act, 7 U.S.C.A.  211, requires, and, without considering the merits, it remanded the cause for further proceedings. Morgan v. United States, \n298 \nU.S. 468\n, 56 S.Ct. 906; Id., \n304 \nU.S. 1\n, 58 S.Ct. 773, 999. A petition for rehearing, in part on the ground that the mandate of this Court had made no provision for the distribution of the fund paid into the district court pursuant to its restraining order, was denied in a memorandum opinion stating that the questions raised were appropriately for the district court, to which the cause had been remanded for further proceedings. The opinion added: 'We remand the case to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with our opinion. What further proceedings the Secretary may see fit to take in the light of our decision, or what determinations may be made by the District Court in relation to any such pro- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 183, 187]\n\u00a0\n ceedings, are not matters which we should attempt to forecast or hypothetically to decide.' 304 U.S. pages 23, 26, 58 S.Ct. page 1001. By this remand the Secretary was left free to take such further proceedings as the statute permits. Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n162 \nU.S. 197, 238\n, 239 S., 16 S.Ct. 666, 682; Southern Railway Co. v. St. Louis Hay & Grain Co., \n214 \nU.S. 297, 302\n, 29 S.Ct. 678, 680; State of Florida v. United States, \n292 \nU.S. 1, 9\n, 54 S.Ct. 603, 606\n\n\n The Secretary thereupon, by order of June 2, 1938, reopened the original proceedings which had resulted in the challenged order of June 14, 1933. He directed that the 'Proceedings, Findings of Fact, Conclusion, and Order' of June 14, 1933, be served upon the appellee market agencies as his tentative findings and order, with an opportunity for appellees to file exceptions to them and to make oral argument upon the exceptions This action was followed, June 11, 1938, by the present proceeding, begun by motion of appellants in the district court to stay further proceedings there and to direct the clerk of the court to retain the impounded funds until such time as the Secretary, proceeding with due expedition, should have entered a final order in the proceedings reopened by him. This motion was denied, and from the order of the district court granting a counter- motion by appellees to distribute the fund among them, the case comes here on appeal. \n1\n  316 of the Packers and Stock \n\n[307 \nU.S. 183, 188]\n\u00a0\n yards Act, 42 Stat. 168, 7 U.S.C.  217, 7 U.S.C.A.  217; 38 Stat. 220, 28 U.S.C.  47, 47a, 28 U.S.C.A.  47, 47a;  238(5) of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  345(5), 28 U.S.C.A.  345(5). This Court has stayed and superseded the order of the district court pending appeal. \n305 \nU.S. 562\n, 59 S.Ct. 85, 83 L.Ed. --. October 10, 1938.\n The district court held that the fund should presently be distributed to appellees, both because the Secretary is without authority under the Act to make any order prescribing rates and charges which will be effective as of June 14, 1933, the date of his original order, and because it construed the terms of its own restraining order as requiring distribution of the fund to appellees on the final determination by this Court that the Secretary's order of June 14, 1933, was invalid. Thus, as a result of the litigation, the district court has twice sustained the determination of the Secretary that the rates prescribed by him, on the basis of voluminous evidence, were reasonable; but because of this Court's decision that the Secretary had failed to observe the statutory requirement of a full hearing, we have never reviewed that determination. The question now arises whether upon a redetermination of that issue by the Secretary the district court will have, and should exercise, the power to order distribution of the impounded fund in conformity to his determination by directing that so much, if any, of the amounts paid into court as exceeds the rates ultimately determined upon appropriate review of the Secretary's findings to be just and reasonable be returned to those who have paid them. This issue must be decided now, for unless the court will have such power there is no occasion to retain the fund pending further proceedings before the Secretary, and distribution of it must be made as the district court has directed.\n Decision turns on the meaning and application of the provisions of the Packers and Stockyards Act, construed in the light of its dominant purpose to secure to patrons \n\n[307 \nU.S. 183, 189]\n\u00a0\n of the stockyards prescribed stockyard services at just and reasonable rates, and upon the authority and duty of the district court to effectuate that purpose in making disposition of the fund. Section 304 of the Act requires every stockyard owner and market agency to furnish non- discriminatory and reasonable stockyard services, and  305 declares that 'All rates or charges made for any stockyard services furnished at a stockyard by a stockyard owner or market agency shall be just, reasonable, and non-discriminatory, and any unjust, unreasonable, or discriminatory rate or charge is prohibited and declared to be unlawful'. Section 307 makes a like requirement as to regulations and practices in respect to furnishing stockyard services. Section 306 makes it the duty of stockyard owners and market agencies to file with the Secretary a schedule of rates for stockyard services and to charge and collect such rates, unless they are set aside by appropriate action of the Secretary or changed by the filing of new rates as authorized by the section. Section 308(a) provides that any stockyard owner or market agency violating any of the previously mentioned sections shall be liable to the persons injured to the full extent of the damage sustained. Section 308(b) provides for enforcement of such liability either by complaint to the Secretary or by suit in any district court, and concludes with the declaration that 'this section shall not in any way abridge or alter the remedies now existing at common law or by statute, but the provisions of this (chapter) act are in addition to such remedies.' Section 310 authorizes the Secretary 'after full hearing' on complaint, or on his own initiative, to prescribe just and reasonable rates for the future.\n Appellees insist that notwithstanding the command of  305 that all rates shall be 'just, reasonable, and non-discriminatory', its mandate is effective only so far as implemented by the other sections of the Act; that except \n\n[307 \nU.S. 183, 190]\n\u00a0\n in a reparation case the statute forbids the Secretary to make orders affecting completed transactions, and that acting on his own initiative, as he does here, he can fix rates for the future only. They point out that under  309(a) and (e) and  310, any person aggrieved may, on petition to the Secretary, seek damages for the exaction of an unreasonable rate in the past, the naming of a new rate for the future, or both, but that when the Secretary institutes such proceedings on his own motion he is precluded by  309(c) from making any order for the payment of money. As the original proceeding here and the action of the Secretary in reopening it were taken on his own motion, the conclusion is drawn that there can be no legal warrant for restitution of the impounded moneys to the patrons of the market agencies, even though the Secretary shall now determine, on evidence and by proper procedure, that the scheduled rates exceeded the reasonable rate prescribed by  305.\n Even though the premises be accepted as in all respects sound, the conclusion does not follow. There is here no question of the Secretary's making an order for the payment of money. The fund having been taken into custody of the court, in consequence of its order restraining the operation of the rate schedule prescribed by the Secretary, the questions for our decision are whether the district court, in the discharge of the duty which it has thus assumed as a court of equity, can rightly dispose of the fund without regard to the command of  305 if the Secretary shall determine that the rates exacted by aid of the court, and paid into its registry, are excessive; and whether, in the exercise of its discretion, the court should retain the fund until such time as the Secretary, proceeding with due expedition, shall make his final determination and order.\n In answering these questions there are two cardinal principles which must guide us to our conclusion. The \n\n[307 \nU.S. 183, 191]\n\u00a0\n one is that in construing a statute setting up an administrative agency and providing for judicial review of its action, court and agency are not to be regarded as wholly independent and unrelated instrumentalities of justice, each acting in the performance of its prescribed statutory duty without regard to the appropriate function of the other in securing the plainly indicated objects of the statute. Court and agency are the means adopted to attain the prescribed end, and so far as their duties are defined by the words of the statute, those words should be construed so as to attain that end through co-ordinated action. Neither body should repeat in this day the mistake made by the courts of law when equity was struggling for recognition as an ameliorating system of justice;2 neither can rightly be regarded by the other as an alien intruder, to be tolerated if must be, but never to be encouraged or aided by the other in the attainment of the common aim. The other guiding principle is that in reviewing the action of the Secretary and in similarly reviewing the action of the Interstate Commerce Commission in conformity with the provisions of the Urgent Deficiencies Act, the district court sits as a court of equity, see Ford Motor Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, \n305 \nU.S. 364, 373\n, 59 S.Ct. 301; Inland Steel Co. v. United States, \n306 \nU.S. 153\n, 59 S.Ct. 415; and in exerting its extraordinary powers to stay execution of a rate order, and in directing payment into court of so much of the rate as has been found administratively to be excessive, it assumes the duty of making disposition of the fund in conformity to equitable principles.\n Assuming, as appellees contend, that after the Secretary's order of June, 1933, was set aside he could, in the reopened proceeding, neither promulgate a rate order as of that date nor make an order for the payment of \n\n[307 \nU.S. 183, 192]\n\u00a0\n money, he was still not without authority in the premises under the statute and the mandate of this Court. He was free to make an order fixing rates for the future, and for that purpose or any other within the purview of the Act he is now free to determine a reasonable rate for the period antedating any order he may now make. See Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Florida, \n295 \nU.S. 301, 312\n, 55 S.Ct. 713, 717. No prior decision of the Secretary stands in the way of his making the determination now. Cf. Arizona Grocery Co. v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Co., \n284 \nU.S. 370\n, 52 S.Ct. 183. The sole limitation upon his power, prescribed by  309(c), is that upon an inquiry instituted by him he may not order the payment of money. In other respects his power to investigate and decide is unaffected. \n3\n He may make inquiry 'as to any matter or thing concerning which a complaint is authorized to be made' to him, 'or concerning which any question may arise under any of the provisions' of the Act, 'or relating to the enforcement of any' provision. He is given 'the same power and authority to proceed with any inquiry instituted upon his own motion as though he had been appealed to by petition, including the power to make and enforce any order or orders in the case or relating to the matter or thing concerning which the inquiry is had, except orders for the payment of money.'  309(c). \n\n[307 \nU.S. 183, 193]\n\u00a0\n That the Secretary, acting under  309(a), could now entertain a complaint by the patrons of appellees who have contributed to the fund in court charging that the rates exacted were in violation of  305, seems to be conceded and is, we think, plain. Section 309(a) specifically provides: 'If ... there appears to be any reasonable ground for investigating the complaint, it shall be the duty of the Secretary to investigate the matters complained of in such manner and by such means as he deems proper'. It seems equally plain that under  309(c) the Secretary, in the exercise of his discretion, may conduct such an investigation on his own motion. Ordinarily, it is true, there would be no occasion for such an investigation if, as a result of it, the Secretary could make no reparation order. But, as we shall presently point out, when the alleged excessive rates are in custodia legis, the court has authority and is under an equitable duty to dispose of them according to law and justice. Thus the Secretary has the best of reasons to exercise his power to determine whether the rates were reasonable and may rightly do so, if his determination can afford a proper basis for the action of the district court in making disposition of the fund.\n The district court, in staying the Secretary's order and at the same time arresting the excess payments to appellees under the scheduled rates, assumed the duty of making the proper disposition of the fund upon the termination of the litigation. The duty was the more imperative here because the court's injunction order not only deprived the public of the benefit of the lower rates but obstructed any effective reparation order by the Secretary. Its action presupposed that the ownership of the excess payments was in doubt and could be finally determined only by an adjudication on the merits of the reasonableness of the filed rates. In taking the payments into custody it acted as a court of equity, charged both \n\n[307 \nU.S. 183, 194]\n\u00a0\n with the responsibility of protecting the fund and of disposing of it according to law, and free in the discharge of that duty to use broad discretion in the exercise of its powers in such manner as to avoid an unjust or unlawful result. It entered into no contract or understanding with the litigants; it entered into no undertaking as to the manner of disposing of the fund; its duty with respect to it is that prescribed by the applicable principles of law and equity for the protection of the litigants and the public, whose interests the injunction and the final disposition of the fund affect. Inland Steel Co. v. United States, supra.\n It is familiar doctrine that the extent to which a court of equity may grant or withhold its aid, and the manner of moulding its remedies, may be affected by the public interest involved. Central Kentucky Gas Co. v. Railroad Commission, \n290 \nU.S. 264, 271\n, 54 S.Ct. 154, 157; Pennsylvania v. Williams, \n294 \nU.S. 176, 185\n, 55 S.Ct. 380, 385, 96 A.L.R. 1166; Virginia Railway Co. v. Federation, \n300 \nU.S. 515\n, 552 et seq., 57 S.Ct. 592, 601. Congress having by the Packers and Stockyards Act established the public policy of maintaining reasonable rates for stockyard services, and having prohibited and declared unlawful any unjust or unreasonable rate, a court of equity should be astute to avoid the use of its process to effectuate the collection of unlawful rates, and equally so to direct it to the restitution of rates which it has taken into its own custody, once they are shown to have been unlawful. If such a determination had already been made by the Secretary in the proceeding before him, after full hearing, and if it were found by the district court to be supported by evidence, the duty of the court to make restitution forthwith would seem evident, notwithstanding the absence of any order of the Secretary directing the payment. Inland Steel Co. v. United States, supra. \n4\n The Secretary, as we \n\n[307 \nU.S. 183, 195]\n\u00a0\n have seen, is authorized to make the determination. Section 305 denounces unreasonable rates as unlawful. The statute, as declared by  308(b), saves to the court authority to give any remedy which in the present circumstances it might otherwise afford.\n This Court went much further in Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Florida, supra, in denying, on equitable grounds, restitution to shippers of the excess of an intrastate rate, prescribed by order of the Interstate Commerce Commission to avoid discrimination against interstate commerce, over that prescribed by the state commission, where the order of the former was later set aside by this Court for want of proper findings by the Commission. Upon further proceedings before the Commission it made a second order, upon proper findings of discrimination, establishing the rate as before. The final result of the litigation was that the railroads were permitted to collect and retain the higher rates for a period during which there was no lawful order of the Commission superseding the state commission rates. There, as here, the administrative \n\n[307 \nU.S. 183, 196]\n\u00a0\n agency could prescribe rates only for the future, and the higher rates exacted between the date of the first order and the second were without the sanction of a valid order. But there, as here, the first administrative order was not a nullity. Ewell v. Daggs, \n108 \nU.S. 143, 148\n, 149 S., 2 S.Ct. 408, 411, 412; Weeks v. Bridgman, \n159 \nU.S. 541, 547\n, 16 S.Ct. 72, 74; Toy Toy v. Hopkins, \n212 \nU.S. 542, 548\n, 29 S.Ct. 416. Though voidable, it could not be ignored without incurring the penalties r disobedience inflicted by the applicable provisions of the statute. The rates did not lose their unjust and unreasonable quality in the one case, or cease to be unjustly discriminatory in the other, merely because the administrative orders in each were voidable for procedural defects or because a second order could operate only for the future. In each case the administrative agency was not without power to inquire whether injustice had been done by the earlier rate, and the court, called on to ascertain, according to equitable principles, the rights of the parties with respect to payments made under the voidable order, could take into account the subsequent determination of the administrative agency as the basis of its action. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Florida, supra, 295 U.S. pages 312, 313, 317, 55 S.Ct. pages 717, 719; New York Edison Co. v. Maltbie, 244 App.Div. 436, 279 N.Y.S. 949; Brooklyn Union Gas Co. v. Maltbie, 245 App.Div. 74, 281 N.Y.S. 233.\n It is said that the distinction between this and the Atlantic Coast Line case is the distinction between judicial inaction and judicial action; that there the court, upon settled equitable principles, was free to refrain from compelling restitution if satisfied that no injustice had been done, see Tiffany v. Boatman's Institution, 18 Wall. 375, 385; Mississippi & M.R. Co. v. Cromwell, \n91 \nU.S. 643\n, 645; Deweese v. Reinhard, \n165 \nU.S. 386, 390\n, 17 S.Ct. 340, 341, but that here the court is called on by appellants to act by withholding from ap- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 183, 197]\n\u00a0\n pellees rates which are still lawfully in force because the filed schedule has not been set aside by a valid order of the Secretary. While at the moment appellants are content with inaction, and it is appellees who are demanding action-the payment to them of rates whose lawfulness is challenged and not yet determined-the actual posture of the case is such that the court is under a self-imposed duty to act by virtue of having taken the fund into its possession, and in acting to dispose of the fund it must conform to controlling legal principles. Reasonableness of the rates was not established by the filed schedules. Had the rates collected been paid to appellees instead of to the clerk of the court, the Secretary could have ordered reparation upon proper findings that they were unreasonable. And the question is whether the court must now, in the face of a proceeding by the Secretary to determine the reasonableness of the challenged rates, use its power to complete their collection at the risk of obstructing reparation, or whether it should itself remain inactive until their lawfulness is determined and then act accordingly.\n It is a power 'inherent in every court of justice so long as it retains control of the subject-matter and of the parties, to correct that which has been wrongfully done by virtue of its process'. Arkadelphia Milling Co. v. St. Louis Railway Co., \n249 \nU.S. 134, 146\n, 39 S.Ct. 237, 242. See Northwestern Fuel Co. v. Brock, \n139 \nU.S. 216, 219\n, 11 S. Ct. 523, 524. What has been given or paid under the compulsion of a judgment the court will restore when its judgment has been set aside and justice requires restitution. Northwestern Fuel Co. v. Brock, supra; Ex parte Lincoln Gas & Electric Light Co., \n257 \nU.S. 6\n, 42 S.Ct. 2; Baltimore & Ohio Railway Co. v. United States, \n279 \nU.S. 781\n, 49 S.Ct. 492. And where by its injunction a court has compelled payment into its registry of amounts which may in pending proceedings be found not to have been due \n\n[307 \nU.S. 183, 198]\n\u00a0\n from those who paid them, we think justice equally requires the court to await the outcome of the proceedings in order that it may discharge the duty which it owes to the litigants and the public by avoiding unlawful disposition of the fund in the meantime, and ultimately distributing it to those found to be entitled to it. See New York Edison Co. v. Maltbie, supra; Brooklyn Union Gas Co. v. Maltbie, supra; cf. United States v. Klein, \n303 \nU.S. 276\n, 58 S.Ct. 536.\n A proceeding is now pending before the Secretary in which, as we have seen, he is free to determine the reasonableness of the rates. His determination, if supported by evidence and made in a proceeding conducted in conformity with the statute and due process, will afford the appropriate basis for action in the district court in making distribution of the fund in its custody. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Florida, supra, 295 U.S. pages 312, 313, 317, 55 S.Ct. pages 717, 719. Due regard for the discharge of the court's own responsibility to the litigants and to the public and the appropriate exercise of its discretion in such manner as to effectuate the policy of the Act and facilitate administration of the system which it has set up, require retention of the fund by the district court until such time as the Secretary, proceeding with due expedition, shall have entered a final order in the proceedings pending before him. Cf. Mahler v. Eby, \n264 \nU.S. 32\n, 44 S.Ct. 283; Tod v. Waldman, \n266 \nU.S. 113\n, 45 S.Ct. 85. The district court will thus avoid the risk of using its process as an instrument of injustice and, with the full record of the Secretary's proceedings before it, including findings supported by evidence, the court will have the appropriate basis for its action and will be able to make its order of distribution accordingly.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice REED took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 183, 199]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER, dissenting.\n In proceedings instituted on complaint of shippers in 1922, the Secretary, July 27, 1923, approved a 15 per cent reduction of market agencies' charges. In May, 1932, the agencies filed tariffs, which were not challenged by shippers or suspended by the Secretary, making additional reductions of about 10 per cent. These rates remained in force until November 1, 1937. Then there became effective a new schedule established by agreement between the agencies and the Secretary. There being no question as to reasonableness of charges made since that date, the appellees were not required to continue making deposits to secure their compliance with the Secretary's order of June 14, 1933 challenged in this suit, and so impounding ceased.\n The money on deposit in the district court is made up of amounts taken from charges as low as, or lower than, those so put and kept in force and applied until November 1, 1937. In the proceedings pending before him, the Secretary may not order reparation (See  309. Also Arizona Grocery v. Atchison Ry., \n284 \nU.S. 370, 389\n, 52 S.Ct. 183, 186) and is without jurisdiction to do more than prescribe charges to be applied after the effective date of that order if one shall be made. The challenged order having been adjudged invalid because made in violation of the Act (Morgan v. United States, \n304 \nU.S. 1\n, 58 S.Ct. 773, 999), the appellees immediately became entitled to the money that, in pursuance of the restraining order, was deposited in court by them to secure their compliance with the Secretary's order if found valid. The record contains nothing to support the idea that the pledge was for any other purpose, or to justify or excuse withholding it for another use. For the reasons stated in its opinion, 24 F.Supp. 214, the district court rightly held appellees entitled \n\n[307 \nU.S. 183, 200]\n\u00a0\n to have their money returned to them. Its decree should be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice ROBERTS join in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] On the same date the district court entered a decree on the mandate of this Court setting aside the Secretary's order of June 14, 1933, and permanently enjoining its enforcement. In that decree the district court retained jurisdiction and decreed that 'such other proceedings be had herein in conformity to the opinion of said Supreme Court with reference to the distribution or restitution of funds deposited by plaintiffs in the Registry of this Court with the Clerk thereof pursuant to the provisions of the temporary restraining order entered on the 22nd day of July 1933 as to law and justice may appertain'. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See Y.B. 22 Ed. IV Mich. pl. 21; Heath v. Rydley, (1614) Cro.Jac. 335; 1 Holdsworth, History of English Law, 459-465. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n]  309(c): 'The Secretary may at any time institute an inquiry on his own motion, in any case and as to any matter or thing concerning which a complaint is authorized to be made to or before the Secretary, by any provision of (sections 201 to 217 inclusive of this chapter) this title, or concerning which any question may arise under any of the provisions of ( sections 201 to 217 inclusive of this chapter) this title, or relating to the enforcement of any of the provisions of (sections 201 to 217 inclusive of this chapter) this title. The Secretary shall have the same power and authority to proceed with any inquiry instituted upon his own motion as though he had been appealed to by petition, including the power to make and enforce any order or orders in the case or relating to the matter or thing concerning which the inquiry is had, except orders for the payment of money.' \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] In Inland Steel Co. v. United States, \n306 \nU.S. 153\n, 59 S.Ct. 415, the Interstate Commerce Commission had ordered certain railroads to cease the payment to shippers, in conformity to a filed tariff, of switching charges which the Commission had found to be unlawful. On review of the action of the Commission the district court stayed the Commission's order and directed the railroads, pending final disposition of the cause, to place further payments due under the tariff in a special fund to be held subject to the order of the court. The Commission's order was ultimately sustained, but meanwhile the Commission, pending review in the courts, had postponed the effective date of its order, so that during the litigation there was no operative Commission order forbidding the unlawful payments. This Court rejected the contention of the shippers that the fund must be paid over to them because it was accumulated in the absence of a controlling order of the Commission. We held that it was the duty of the district court, resulting from its injunction and its control over the fund, to make equitable disposition of it, and we sustained the district court's order that the fund should be turned over to the railroads in conformity to the Commission's determination, confirmed on judicial review, that the switching allowances were unlawful. \n\n\n\n\n","137":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. v.

Heaton, both of New York City, for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In each of these causes the District Court, proceeding under the 'Liquor Law Repeal and Enforcement Act' \n\n[307 \nU.S. 219, 221]\n\u00a0\n of August 27, 1935, c. 740, 49 Stat. 872, 878, 27 U.S.C.A.  40a, mitigated the forfeiture of an automobile seized for unlawful transportation of distilled spirits upon which the federal tax had not been paid. (One was seized December 3, 1936; the other, March 15, 1937.) The forfeiture was decreed in a proceeding based upon section 3450 R.S., 26 U.S.C.A.  1441. The Circuit Courts of Appeals rightly approved and their judgments must be affirmed.\n The facts, undisputed, are essentially alike in both causes. The points of law are the same. A statement based on Record No. 10 will suffice.\n The Repeal Enforcement Act provides-\n'Sec. 204 ( 40a). (a) Whenever, in any proceeding in court for the forfeiture, under the internal-revenue laws, of any vehicle or aircraft seized for a violation of the internal-revenue laws relating to liquors, such forfeiture is decreed, the court shall have exclusive jurisdiction to remit or mitigate the forfeiture.\n\n'(b) In any such proceeding the court shall not allow the claim of any claimant for remission or mitigation unless and until he proves (1) that he has an interest in such vehicle or aircraft, as owner or otherwise, which he acquired in good faith, (2) that he had at no time any knowledge or reason to believe that it was being or would be used in the violation of laws of the United States or of any State relating to liquor, and (3) if it appears that the interest asserted by the claimant arises out of or is in any way subject to any contract or agreement under which any person having a record or reputation for violating laws of the United States or of any State relating to liquor has a right with respect to such vehicle or aircraft, that, before such claimant acquired his interest, or such other person acquired his right under such contract or agreement, whichever occurred later, the claimant, his officer or agent, was informed in answer to his inquiry, at the \n\n[307 \nU.S. 219, 222]\n\u00a0\n headquarters of the sheriff, chief of police, principal Federal internal- revenue officer engaged in the enforcement of the liquor laws, or other principal local or Federal law-enforcement officer of the locality in which such other person acquired his right under such contract or agreement, of the locality in which such other person then resided, and of each locality in which the claimant has made any other inquiry as to the character or financial standing of such other person, that such other person had no such record or reputation.'\n\n The following findings by the District Court, it is agreed, correctly set out 'the facts in this case.'-\n The Ford automobile in question was sold by the Greenville Auto Sales, Incorporated the dealer) October 3, 1936, through its agent, Elrod, to Guy Walker, who in part payment exchanged an old car paid for by him, but registered in his wife's name. He was given terms for payment under a conditional sales contract, drawn by an agent of the dealer, in the name of his brother, Paul Walker, who formally executed the agreement. Guy Walker had the conditional sales contract drawn and executed in the name of his brother in order to place the title 'where his wife could not reach it'. Paul Walker had no interest in the transaction except to comply with his brother's request. Guy Walker made the transaction with the dealer. He selected the car, made the agreement and handled the transaction himself. Paul Walker drove the car from the dealer's place of business. Guy Walker at the time, and for two or three weeks after the purchase, was living at his brother's house. Only one payment was made on the conditional sales contract before the seizure, and that by Guy Walker to the dealer.\n It was admitted that Guy Walker had a previous record and reputation for violating both state and federal laws relating to liquor. Paul Walker was convicted of violating the National Prohibition Act, 41 Stat. 305, in 1929, and was duly \n\n[307 \nU.S. 219, 223]\n\u00a0\n sentenced therefor, but his record and reputation since serving the sentence were good.\n On the date when the sale was consummated the dealer submitted the contract to the Commercial Credit Company, the claimant here, who accepted by telephone, and subsequently on October 5th, in the usual course of business the dealer assigned the contract to the claimant and received a check therefor.\n The claimant before accepting assignment of the sales contract made an investigation of Paul Walker by inquiring at the headquarters of the Sheriff of Greenville County, and at the headquarters of the Chief of Police of Greenville, the County and City where the interest was acquired and the locality where Paul Walker resided, as to his record and reputation for violation of the liquor law. Information was received from these offices that had no such record or reputation. Information was given, however, from the Sheriff's office that Guy Walker had both record and reputation as violator of state and federal laws$relating to liquor. No inquiry or investigation was made at the headquarters of the principal Federal internal-revenue officer engaged in the enforcement of the liquor laws in that locality, or at the headquarters of any other principal local or federal law enforcement officer of the locality as to Paul Walker, and no inquiry or investigation whatsoever was made of Guy Walker, the admitted real owner and purchaser of the automobile.\n The claimant had Paul Walker investigated in August, 1936, by the Business Service Bureau of Greenville, South Carolina, in connection with the purchase of a refrigerator. No investigation at that time was made as to his reputation or record for violating the liquor laws; the investigation did disclose that he had a good reputation in the community where he lived, and this was the reputation given him by his employer at that time.\n The claimant purchased the conditional sales contract in good faith believing that Paul Walker was the pur- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 219, 224]\n\u00a0\n chaser and owner of the automobile. It had no knowledge, information or suspicion of the true facts until after the automobile had been seized by federal officers.\n Petitioner challenges the judgment below because of claimant's failure to establish compliance with the conditions imposed by subsection ( b) section 204. Especially because claimant failed to show that it had no reason to believe the automobile was being used or would be used to violate the liquor laws; also because it made no adequate inquiry concerning the record and reputation of the real purchaser-Guy Walker.\n Respondent's interest in the automobile is not questioned. It 'purchased the conditional sales contract in good faith, believing that Paul Walker was the purchaser and owner of the automobile. It had no knowledge, information or suspicion of the true facts until after the automobile had been seized.' This is enough to show compliance with subsection (b)(1). There was an interest acquired in good faith.\n After investigation of the record and reputation of Paul Walker, followed by favorable reports, and believing him to be purchaser and owner of the automobile, claimant in good faith acquired the sales contract. It had no knowledge, information or suspicion that Paul Walker was only a 'straw' purchaser. This is enough to show compliance with subsection b)(2). The suggestion that since respondent knew automobiles were frequently used for violation of liquor laws it therefore had reason to believe that the one in question would be so used is not well founded. The findings positively affirm that it entertained no such belief or suspicion.\n The difficult phrasing of subsection (b)(3) has produced divergent views concerning its meaning.\n In Federal Motor Finance v. United States, 88 F.2d 90, 93, the Circuit Courts of Appeals Eighth Circuit said-\n'We think the fair intendment of the language of subsection (3) concerning remission of forfeiture is that the \n\n[307 \nU.S. 219, 225]\n\u00a0\n appellant could not rely entirely upon a course of business whereby it acquired an interest in the car so nearly approximating the total value thereof without taking care to ascertain who the real owner was in possession of and using the car.'\n\n In the causes now before us (4 Cir., 93 F.2d 771, 773; 5 Cir., 99 F. 2d 498, 0), the Circuit Court of Appeals accepted the view that-\n'The involved language of subsection (b)(3) of the act does permit the possible interpretation that the lienor is charged with the duty of making inquiry as to every one bearing a bad reputation or record, who may have a right under the contract of sale, whether or not it appears on the face of the instrument. See Federal Motor Finance v. United States, 8 Cir., 88 F.2d 90. But in our view Congress did not intend to impose upon the lienor the obligation to ascertain at his peril the identity of every person having an interest in the property and to make inquiry of the law enforcement officers as to the previous record and reputation of every such person, unless from the documents themselves or other surrounding circumstances the lienor possesses information which would lead a reasonably prudent and law-abiding person to make a further investigation.'\n\n See also C.I.T. Corporation v. United States, 4 Cir., 86 F.2d 311, and United States v. C.I.T. Corporation, 2 Cir., 93 F.2d 469.\n Counsel for petitioner now maintain: 'That under the language of the statute ((b)(3)) the claimant is required to investigate the real purchaser at its peril and that if it fails to do so, as between it and the Government, the claimant assumes the risk of fraud perpetrated upon it by the dealer and the bootlegger. In any event, the claimant should have been required to show that it at least made a reasonable effort to ascertain who the real \n\n[307 \nU.S. 219, 226]\n\u00a0\n purchaser and user of the car was so that he could be investigated as required by the statute.'\n Manifestly, section 204 is a remedial measure. It empowers the courts, exercising sound discretion, to afford relief to innocent parties having interests in condemned property where the claim is reasonable and just. Its primary purpose is not to protect the revenues; but this is proper matter for consideration whenever remission is sought. The section must be liberally construed to carry out the objective. The point to be sought is the intent of the law-making powers. Forfeitures are not favored; they should be enforced only when within both letter and spirit of the law. Farmers' & M. National Bank v. Dearing, \n91 \nU.S. 29\n, 33-35. If any claimant has been negligent or in good conscience ought not be relieved, the court should deny his application.\n Consideration of the statutory provisions relative to remissions prior to section 204 and the circumstances of its adoption will enlighten the purpose entertained by Congress.\n Sections 3450 and 3453 Revised Statutes, 26 U.S.C.A.  1441, 1620 a), 1621-derived from Acts June 30, 1864 and July 13, 1866-provide that whenever any commodity in respect of which a tax is imposed, is removed with intent to defraud the United States, it shall be forfeited and 'Every vessel, boat, cart, carriage, or other conveyance whatsoever, and all horses or other animals, and all things used in the removal or for the deposit or concealment thereof, respectively, shall be forfeited.' 'The proceedings to enforce such forfeiture shall be in the nature of a proceeding in rem in the circuit court or district court of the United States for the district where such seizure is made.' \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[307 \nU.S. 219, 227]\n\u00a0\n Sections 3460 and 3461, 26 U.S.C.A.  1624-derived from Acts July 13, 1866 and June 6, 1872-provide that when goods, wares, or merchandise seized as subjects of forfeiture, do not exceed $500 in value, they may be restored to the claimant upon the execution of a bond and this shall be delivered to the District Attor- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 219, 228]\n\u00a0\n ney for proper proceedings; if no bond, the articles shall be sold and the proceeds paid into the Treasury. Within a year any claimant may apply to the Secretary for remission which may be granted 'upon satisfactory proof, to be furnished in such manner as he shall prescribe: Provided, That it shall be satisfactorily shown ... That the said forfeiture was incurred without willful negligence or any intention of fraud on the part of the owner of said property.' \n2\n\u00a0\n\n Where the value exceeds $500 or bond is given, forfeiture must be sought in court through a libel in rem. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 219, 229]\n\u00a0\n United States v.

One Bay Horse, D.C., 270 F. 590.\n Section 3229 Revised Statutes, Act July 20, 1868, c. 186, sec. 102, 15 Stat. 125, 166, 26 U.S.C.A.  1661, provides-\n'The Commissioner of Internal Revenue, with the advice and consent of the Secretary of the Treasury, may \n\n[307 \nU.S. 219, 230]\n\u00a0\n compromise any civil or criminal case arising under the internal-revenue laws instead of commencing suit thereon; and, with the advice and consent of the said Secretary and the recommendation of the Attorney-General, he may compromise any such case after a suit thereon has been commenced. Whenever a compromise is made in any case there shall be placed on file in the office of the Commissioner the opinion of the Solicitor of Internal Revenue, or of the officer acting as such, with his reasons therefor, with a statement of the amount of tax assessed, the amount of additional tax or penalty imposed by law in consequence of the neglect or delinquency of the person against whom the tax is assessed, and the amount actually paid in accordance with the terms of the compromise.' (Amended, Acts February 26, 1926, c. 27,  1201, 44 Stat. 9, 126; May 10, 1934, c. 277, sec. 512(b), 48 Stat. 680, 759; May 28, 1938, c. 289,  815, 52 Stat. 447, 578, 26 U.S. C.A.  1661.)\n\n Wilson Motor Co. v. United States, 9 Cir., 84 F.2d 630, 632, states- 'The government's brief advises that prior to the Act of August 27, 1935, the procedure of the government to afford relief to these innocent owners was under the provisions of compromise powers given the Attorney General and the Treasury under section 1661, 26 U.S.C.A.'\n In connection with the sections referred to above the United States Code Annotated points to their origin and history.\n The National Prohibition Act, October 28, 1919, c. 85, Title II, sec. 26, 41 Stat. 305, 315, Title 27 U.S.C.A.  40, provided that 'whenever intoxicating liquors transported or possessed illegally shall be seized by an officer he shall take possession of the vehicle and team or automobile, boat, air or water craft, or any other conveyance, and shall arrest any person in charge thereof.' The person \n\n[307 \nU.S. 219, 231]\n\u00a0\n arrested shall be proceeded against but the vehicle or conveyance shall be returned upon execution of a bond. Upon his conviction the court shall order the liquor destroyed 'and unless good cause to the contrary is shown by the owner, shall order a sale by public auction of the property seized.' 3 See Richbourg Motor Co. v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 528\n, 50 S.Ct. 385, 73 A.L.R. 1081. This was repealed by The Repeal and Enforcement Act, supra. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 219, 232]\n\u00a0\n The Act of September 21, 1922, c. 356, sec. 618, 42 Stat. 858, 987 provides-\n'Whenever any person interested in any vessel, vehicle, merchandise, or baggage seized under the provisions of this Act, or who has incurred, or is alleged to have incurred, any fine or penalty thereunder, files with the Secretary of the Treasury if under the customs laws, and with the Secretary of Commerce if under the navigation laws, before the sale of such vessel, vehicle, merchandise, or baggage a petition for the remission or mitigation of such fine, penalty, or forfeiture, the Secretary of the Treasury, or the Secretary of Commerce, if he finds that such fine, penalty, or forfeiture was incurred without willful negligence or without any intention on the part of the petitioner to defraud the revenue or to violate the law, or finds the existence of such mitigating circumstances as to justify the remission or mitigation of such fine, penalty, or forfeiture, may remit or mitigate the same upon such terms and conditions as he deems reasonable and just, or order discontinuance of any prosecution relating thereto.' (Reenacted by Act July 17, 1930, c. 497, sec. 618, 46 Stat. 590, 757, 19 U.S.C.A.  1618.)\n\n The Act May 29, 1928, c. 852, sec. 709, 45 Stat. 791, 882, 26 U.S.C.A .  1626, extended 'The provisions of law applicable to the remission or mitigation by the Secretary of the Treasury of forfeitures under the customs laws ... to forfeitures incurred or alleged to have been incurred, before or after the enactment of this Act, under the internal- revenue laws.'\n In the situation disclosed by the foregoing summary, Congress came to consider the Act of August 27, 1935. The Judiciary Committees of Senate and House made reports (Senate Report No. 1330, House Report No. 1601, \n\n[307 \nU.S. 219, 233]\n\u00a0\n 74th Cong., 1st Session). In each the paragraphs relative to section 204(a) and (b) are the same in substance. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n[307 \nU.S. 219, 234]\n\u00a0\n A representative of the Treasury Department made a statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee. An extract from this appears in the margin. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n A rearrangement of the words of subsection (b)(3) will enlighten its meaning-\n The court shall not allow the (request)-claim-of any claimant for remission or mitigation, if it appears that \n\n[307 \nU.S. 219, 235]\n\u00a0\n the interest asserted by (him)-the claimant-arises out of or is in any way subject to any contract or agreement under which any person having a record or reputation for violating laws of the United States or of any State relating to liquor has a right with respect to such vehicle or aircraft, unless and until he (the claimant) proves that before (he)-such claimant-acquired his interest, or such other person acquired his right under such contract or agreement, whichever occurred later, (he)-the claimant-his officer or agent, was informed in answer to his inquiry, at ( certain headquarters specified in the alternative) as to the character or financial standing of such other person, that such other person had no such record or reputation.\n If the words of section 204(b)(3) be taken literally, without regard to history or purpose of the enactment, they inhibit remission by the court unless one who claims an interest made actual inquiry concerning every person with record or reputation for violating the liquor laws who in fact (although wholly unsuspected) had acquired some right to the vehicle. There would be absolute forfeiture although the claimant acquired his interest in the utmost good faith and without suspicion of any undisclosed interest; although indeed, he had diligently but unsuccessfully sought information concerning all the facts from every person connected with the transaction. Thus construed the provision would require absolute forfeiture notwithstanding the claimant could not by the utmost diligence ascertain the true situation. No greater reason exists for saying a claimant should be relieved if he made unsuccessful inquiry of the seller concerning undisclosed matters than there is for relief when he had no cause to suspect the existence of an undisclosed interest-no cause to question appearances. A measure requiring absolute forfeiture under such circumstances probably would be expressed in language sufficiently plain to admit no reasonable doubt. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 219, 236]\n\u00a0\n During many years innocent claimants had a clear remedy either by appeal to the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury or by application for compromise addressed to the Attorney General and Treasury officials (Wilson Motor Co. v. United States, supra); or under the Prohibition Act, to the court (Richbourg Motor Co. v. United States, supra ). This situation was called to the attention of the Senate Committee by the representative of the Treasury. also pointed out that before restoring a car the Secretary required that the claimant 'must prove that he made an investigation as to whether or not the purchaser had a bootlegger record and found that he had none.' The Secretary 'considers that the bootleg hazard is an element involved in the credit risk, and is just as much a part of the investigation by the finance company of a person as a credit risk as is his financial standing in the community.' The Committee reported in respect of 204(b)(3)-'This last requirement is predicated upon the recognition of the 'bootleg hazard' as an element to be considered in investigating a person as a credit risk.'\n These facts indicate that Congress intended a reasonable inquiry concerning the bootleg risk should be made in connection with the investigation of financial responsibility. They negative the notion that wholly innocent claimant at his peril must show inquiry concerning something unknown and of which he had no suspicion. Dealers do not investigate what they have no cause to suspect.\n The forfeiture acts are exceedingly drastic. They were intended for protection of the revenues, not to punish without fault. It would require unclouded language to compel the conclusion that Congress abandoned the equitable policy, observed for a very long time, of relieving those who act in good faith and without negligence, and adopted an oppressive amendment not demanded by \n\n[307 \nU.S. 219, 237]\n\u00a0\n the tax officials or pointed out in the reports of its committees.\n Subsection [b]\n\n[307 \nU.S. 219, 3]\n\u00a0\n was intended to prevent remission to a claimant who had failed to inquire when he should have done so, to one chargeable with willful negligence or purpose of fraud. It would be excessively harsh, unreasonable indeed, to say that one dealing in entire good faith must, at his peril, first discover and then make inquiry concerning somebody of whose existence he has no knowledge or suspicion. We cannot think Congress intended thus to burden dealing in all vehicles capable of transporting liquor.\n It should be observed that the following things are possible subjects of seizure and forfeiture because of liquor law violations: 'Every vessel, boat, cart, carriage, or other conveyance whatsoever, and all horses or other animals, and all things used in the removal or for the deposit or concealment, etc.' 'Vehicle' is thus defined-'That in or on which a person or thing is or may be carried from one place to another.' A wheelbarrow, a covered wagon, a 'Rolls-Royce', the patient mule, a 'Man of War', and possibly a Pullman car or Ocean Liner is a vehicle. Goldsmith, Jr.-Grant Co. v. United States, \n254 \nU.S. 505\n, 41 S.Ct. 189; United States v. Two Bay Mules, supra; United States v. One Bay Horse, supra.\n Subsection [b]\n\n[307 \nU.S. 219, 3]\n\u00a0\n applies not only to transactions by financial concerns like respondent but to those of individuals and corporations great or small. It contemplates an investigation and this presupposes some reason at least to suspect the existence of the subject of investigation. Congress took away from executive officers the power to mitigate forfeitures where the property exceeds $500 in value, and gave this to the court familiar with the circumstances; but it left with the Secretary of the Treasury discretion to remit when the value was below $500 The intent was to require the courts to exact \n\n[307 \nU.S. 219, 238]\n\u00a0\n proof of inquiries like those demanded by the Treasury Department practice, and disclosed by its representative before the Senate Committee. The petitioner's view, if adopted, would sanction one standard of remission for a vehicle worth $500, another when appraised at a dollar more.\n The challenged decrees must be affirmed.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice BUTLER and Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of these causes.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS (dissenting).\n Mr. Justice BLACK, Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER and I think that the judgments below should be reversed.\n The problem here involved raises the question of the duty of automobile finance companies to investigate those who purchase cars from dealers, financed by those companies, in order to determine whether the ostensible purchasers are in reality straw men for bootleggers. Here the dealers knew that the named purchasers were only nominal purchasers; and they also knew the identity of the real purchasers. But the finance companies made no inquiry whatsoever of the dealers to ascertain if those purchasers were straw men. They made no inquiry in spite of the fact that the use of straw men by bootleggers was not novel. They made no inquiry in spite of the intimate business relations which exist between them and the dealers and the presumption of availability of such information which that relationship creates. And they now seek the benefit of an Act which the Congress passed to ameliorate some of the risks of confiscation and forfeiture. We do not think they have satisfied the burden which the Congress has placed upon them.\n Sec. 204(a), 27 U.S.C.A.  40(a), gives the District Court 'exclusive jurisdiction to remit or mitigate' forfeitures. Sec. 204(b) \n\n[307 \nU.S. 219, 239]\n\u00a0\n sets forth three conditions precedent which the claimant must satisfy before the court may remit or mitigate a forfeiture. To satisfy the third of these conditions claimant must prove under certain circumstances that he made inquiry of designated law enforcement agencies concerning any person for whom a straw man purchaser was acting and that he was informed on such inquiry that such person had no record or reputation for violating the liquor laws. The circumstances under which claimant must make that inquiry exist 'if it appears that the interest asserted by the claimant arises out of or is in any way subject to any contract or agreement under which any person having a record or reputation for violating laws of the United States or of any State relating to liquor has a right with respect to such vehicle or aircraft, ....'\n To be sure the phrasing of Sec. 204(b)(3) is difficult. But it means to us that a claimant must prove, in order to satisfy that condition, that he made a reasonable investigation to ascertain if the purchaser was a mere straw man acting for another or was a legitimate purchaser in his own right. The words 'if it appears' carry that connotation. A contrary construction defeats the purpose of the Congress by placing an enormous premium on lack of diligence. That construction opens wide the doors to defraud the revenue, for finance companies need lift no finger nor make any effort to ascertain the existence of a straw man purchaser. Ignorance now is surely bliss. By failure to make inquiry they can effectively insulate themselves even from the knowledge which their business intimates- the dealers-have. Unless informed by disclosures, in the written contract or otherwise, they can contentedly assume that the purchaser is not a straw man for a bootlegger. That they will thus be voluntarily informed by the parties or by others seems unlikely. Since the function of the straw \n\n[307 \nU.S. 219, 240]\n\u00a0\n man is to conceal the bootlegger, neither the straw man nor the bootlegger can be expected to step forward with the information. And the automobile salesman is not likely to volunteer the information for his desire is to sell automobiles not to defeat sales. On the other hand, the interpretation which we urge would give the statute real meaning and significance in terms of this specific bootleg hazard which concerned the Congress on its enactment. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Furthermore, the requirement for reasonable investigation cannot possibly place such a burden on finance companies as to force us to resolve an ambiguity in statutory language against forfeiture. In the cases before us a single question put the dealer or the purchaser might alone have disclosed the existence of a straw man. But no such simple inquiry was made. An investigation in each case was made to ascertain whether the named purchaser had a reputation or record for liquor violations. But the existence of a straw man was never probed. Certainly on such a matter investigational techniques are not novel, involved or unique. The responsibility for a \n\n[307 \nU.S. 219, 241]\n\u00a0\n reasonable investigation would add but imperceptibly if at all to the cost of doing business. In this field such investigation entails a burden which any legitimate enterprise should be prepared to carry.

Within one year after the sale of any goods, wares, or merchandise, as provided in the preceding section, any person claiming to be interested in the property sold may apply to the Secretary of the Treasury for a remission of the forfeiture thereof, or of any part thereof, and a restoration of the proceeds of the sale; and the said Secretary may grant the same upon satisfactory proof, to be furnished in such manner as he shall prescribe: Provided, That it shall be satisfactorily shown that the applicant, at the time of the seizure and sale of the said property, and during the intervening time, was absent, out of the United States, or in such circumstances as prevented him from knowing of the seizure, and that he did not know of the same; and also that the said forfeiture was incurred without willful negligence or any intention of fraud on the part of the owner of said property. If no application for such restoration is made within one year, as hereinbefore prescribed, the Secretary of the Treasury shall, at the expiration of the said time, cause the proceeds of the sale of the said property to be distributed according to law, as in the case of goods, wares, or merchandise condemned and sold pursuant to the decree of a competent court.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] 'When the commissioner, his assistants, inspectors, or any officer of the law shall discover any person in the act of transporting in violation of the law, intoxicating liquors in any wagon, buggy, automobile, water or air craft, or other vehicle, it shall be his duty to seize any and all intoxicating liquors found therein being transported contrary to law.

All liens against property sold under the provisions of this section shall be transferred from the property to the proceeds of the sale of the property.' \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] House Reports, Vol. 4, 74th Congress, 1st Session, 1935, Report No. 1601, p. 6-\n Section 204(a) of section 204 provides that in any court proceeding for the forfeiture under the internal-revenue laws of any vehicle or aircraft seized for a violation of the internal-revenue laws relating to liquor, the court shall, upon decree of forfeiture, have exclusive jurisdiction to remit or mitigate the forfeiture. At the present time, the court has authority only to decree the forfeiture, and remission or mitigation is dependent upon administrative action. Section 204 extends to the court which determines whether the vehicle or aircraft shall be forfeited by reason of having been used in the violation of internal- revenue laws relating to liquor, the power to determine whether the claim of any person having an interest in the vehicle or aircraft should be allowed after forfeiture. Thus, in all cases where the value of the seized property exceeds $500, and in all cases where the value is $500 or less, but a bond is posted in order to bring the forfeiture proceeding into court, the court will have exclusive jurisdiction to remit or mitigate the forfeiture. In the event that a bond is not filed in cases where the property is of the value of $500 or less, the power to remit or mitigate will remain in the Secretary of the Treasury.\n Certain standards are given to the court to guide it in this determination. Thus, under subsection (b), the claimant must prove that he acquired his interest in good faith, that he had no knowledge or reason to believe that the vehicle or aircraft was being or would be used in violating Federal or State liquor laws, and that, if his interest arises out of, or is subject to, any agreement under which any person having a record or reputation for violating Federal or State liquor laws has a right with respect to the vehicle or aircraft, the claimant, before he acquired his interest, or before the other person acquired his right, which ever of these events occurred later, inquired of the law enforcement officers in the locality where such other person acquired his right, of the locality in which such other person then resided, and of each locality where the claimant made inquiry as to the character or credit standing of such other person, whether the other person had such a record or reputation, and was informed he had not. This last requirement is predicated upon the recognition of the 'bootleg hazard' as an element to be considered in investigation a person as a credit risk. As a matter of sound business practice, automobile dealers, finance companies, and prospective lienholders on automobiles examine records, and make inquiry of references and credit rating agencies as to the owner's or prospective purchaser's reputation for paying his debts and his ability to do so. This subsection merely requires that in the making of such inquiry, the 'bootleg hazard' also be examined as one aspect of the credit risk. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Senate Committee Hearings, 1935, Vol. 495, No. 4, p. 13-\n'Section 204 ... relates to proceedings in court for the forfeiture of vehicles or aircraft seized for violations of internal-revenue laws. At the present time, claimants of interests in vehicles or aircraft that have been seized and forfeited for violation of internal-revenue laws, petition the Secretary of the Treasury for the remission or mitigation of the forfeiture, and the Secretary, under the law, requires the person claiming to have an innocent interest to show that he had no knowledge of the unlawful use of the vehicle or aircraft. What this section will do, in the case of any court proceeding for the forfeiture of vehicles or aircraft, is to give the court jurisdiction to determine whether or not the person claiming to have an innocent interest actually had such an interest. Under the present practice the Secretary of the Treasury requires such a showing . ... This section is of particular importance in connection with the discounting by a finance company of an automobile dealer's paper.\n\n'At the present time, the Secretary of the Treasury considers that the bootleg hazard is an element involved in the credit risk, and is just as much a part of the investigation by the finance company of a person as a credit risk as is his financial standing in the community. He requires that before a car be returned to the person claiming an innocent interest, the latter must prove that he made an investigation as to whether or not the purchaser had a bootlegger record, and found that he had none.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Precisely the investigation here urged seems to have been intended, for the Report of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary said as respects Sec. 204(b) (3): 'This last requirement is predicated upon the recognition of the 'bootleg hazard' as an element to be considered in investigating a person as a credit risk. As a matter of sound business practice, automobile dealers, finance companies, and prospective lienholders on automobiles examine records, and make inquiry of references and credit rating agencies as to the owner's or prospective purchaser's reputation for paying his debts and his ability to do so. This subsection merely requires that in the making of such inquiry, the 'bootleg hazard' also be examined as one aspect of the credit risk.' Sen.Rep.No. 1330, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 6. To investigate the 'bootleg hazard' as 'one aspect of the credit risk' when inquiry is made of the 'prospective purchaser's reputation for paying his debts' seems clearly to entail inquiry as to whether or not the prospective purchaser is a straw man for a bootlegger. \n\n\n\n\n","138":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. v. POWERS(1939)\nNo. 687\nArgued: April 21, 1939Decided: May 15, 1939\n\n\n\n Mr. Charles A. Horsky, of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n Mr. John D. Cofer, of Austin, Tex., for appellees. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 214, 215]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal, under the Criminal Appeals Act of March 2, 1907, 18 U.S.C.  682, 18 U.S.C.A.  682, and Sec. 238 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  345, 28 U.S.C.A.  345, from a judgment of a district court sustaining demurrers and motions of the appellees to quash an indictment.\n The indictment, filed September 17, 1938, charges appellees with violations of the Connally (Hot Oil) Act of February 22, 1935, as amended, 15 U.S.C.  715 et seq., 15 U.S.C.A.  715 et seq., and with conspiracy to violate such Act, 18 U.S.C.  88, 18 U.S.C.A.  88. The various substantive counts charge that appellees, in violation of the Act, as amended, transported in interstate commerce from the Conroe Oil Field in Montgomery County, State of Texas, to Marcus Hook, Pa., certain petroleum products in excess of the amounts permitted to be produced, transported, and withdrawn from storage under the laws of Texas and the regulations and orders prescribed by the Railroad Commission of Texas. These transportations are alleged to have been made on various dates from November 4, 1935, to March 20, 1936. The conspiracy count charges a conspiracy by appellees to violate the Act, as amended, by producing, transporting, and withdrawing from storage petroleum in excess of the amounts permitted to be produced, transported, and withdrawn from storage under the laws of Texas and the regulations and orders promulgated thereunder. These transportations are alleged to have been made between the same places alleged in the substantive counts, on various dates from on or about September 4, 1935, to on or about March 15, 1937\n\n\n Sec. 13 of the Act of February 22, 1935, 49 Stat. 33, 15 U.S.C.A.  715l provided that 'This Act shall cease to be in effect on June 16, 1937.' This section was amended by the Act of June 14, 1937, \n\n[307 \nU.S. 214, 216]\n\u00a0\n 'by striking out 'June 16, 1937' and inserting in lieu thereof 'June 30, 1939\". 50 Stat. 257, 15 U.S.C.A.  715l. No other amendments to the Act were made.\n The single question before us is whether violations of this Act alleged to have been committed prior to June 16, 1937, may be prosecuted under an indictment returned subsequent thereto. The district court by sustaining the demurrers and motions to quash answered that question in the negative. We think it erred.\n The Congress alone may declare whether those who, before June 16, 1937, violated the Act may be prosecuted thereafter. The question is one of the purpose of Congress. Explicit provisions in the amendment preserving the right of prosecution after the date originally set for expiry of the Act would have made that purpose clear beyond question. But the surrounding circumstances here make this purpose as clear and as unequivocal as an explicit provision. This is an Act designed to protect interstate and foreign commerce from the diversion and obstruction of, and the burden and harmful effect upon, such commerce caused by contraband oil , (as defined in the Act) and to encourage the conservation of deposits of crude oil within the United States. Administrative machinery is provided for the control of shipment or transportation of contraband oil in interstate commerce. Secs. 4, 5 and 9. Such shipment or transportation is prohibited, unless on appropriate findings the President, by proclamation, lifts the prohibition. Secs. 3 and 4. Penalties are provided for violations of the Act or any regulations prescribed thereunder. Secs. 6 and 7. And section 10 implements the Act with civil and criminal procedures to enforce its sanctions. The Act is thus a self-sustained and organic whole, equipped to effectuate a declared policy of the Congress. By its original terms it would have expired June 16, 1937. But it never expired, for on June 14, 1937, \n\n[307 \nU.S. 214, 217]\n\u00a0\n the whole Act was continued in effect until June 30, 1939. Its substantive phases were not altered one whit or tittle; its sanctions were neither reduced nor increased. Precisely the same acts continue to be prohibited after the amendment as before. The amendment merely perpetuated the entire Act for another term.\n In view of these circumstances, it seems clear beyond question that it was the purpose of Congress, expressed in the amendment of June 14, 1937, to treat this Act precisely in the same way as if by its original terms it was to expire on June 30, 1939. Due to the amendment, the Act has never ceased to be in effect. No new law was created; no old one was repealed. Without hiatus of any kind, the original Act was given extended life. There was no First Connally Act followed by a Second Connally Act. During the periods in question there was but one Act. No evidence has been brought to our attention, and we have found none, that Congress proposed to waive or to pardon violations which occurred prior to June 16, 1937, but which were not prosecuted until subsequent thereto.\n There is a secondary consideration which points to the same conclusion. If the appellees are right in their contention, a temporary act such as this one would lose, as a practical matter, some of its sanctions. Violations could occur with impunity months before its expiry, for in practice there frequently is an unavoidably substantial lag between violation and prosecution. The statute should not be so construed if another interpretation will make it effective. As this Court said in Bird v. United States, \n187 \nU.S. 118, 124\n, 23 S.Ct. 42, 44. 'There is a presumption against a construction which would render a statute ineffective or inefficient, or which would cause grave public injury or even inconvenience.' We are unwilling to conclude that although the same acts continue to be prohib- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 214, 218]\n\u00a0\n ited after June 16, 1937, as before, violations committed prior to that date are not punishable thereafter.\n In view of this conclusion, we do not reach the nub of appellees' argument based on Chief Justice Marshall's statement in The Irresistible, 7 Wheat. 551, 552, 'that an offense against a temporary act cannot be punished after the expiration of the act, unless a particular provision be made by law for the purpose.' For in this case, as we have said, the Act of February 22, 1935, did not expire on June 16, 1937.\n But even if we assume the validity of that statement, it seems to us clear that though the Act be treated as having expired or terminated on June 16, 1937, the result is the same. For in this case 'particular provision' has been made 'by law for the purpose' of extending the enforcement machinery with reference to prior criminal violations. The 'particular provision' was the amendment of June 14, 1937, extending the effective period of the Act. That amendment was passed prior to the original expiration date. When read in light of the title of the amendatory statute, viz. 'An Act To continue in effect until June 30, 1939, the Act ... approved February 22, 1935', 50 Stat. 257, the statement of purpose becomes plain and unambiguous. If the amendment of June 14, 1937, had merely 'extended' the duration, or postponed the expiration, of section 10 of the Act dealing with criminal penalties, 'particular provision' for subsequent prosecutions would have been indubitably clear. The fact that all sections, including section 10, were extended makes it nonetheless plain. The whole, though larger than any of its parts, does not necessarily obscure their separate identities.\n In view of these various considerations, we hold that this prosecution does not offend the prohibition in Article I  9, cl. 3 of the Constitution, U.S.C.A., against ex post facto laws.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","139":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. v. TOWERY(1939)\nNo. 360\nArgued: January 31, 1939Decided: February 27, 1939\n\n\n\n\n[306 \nU.S. 324, 325]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Wilbur C. Pickett, of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n\n\n\n[306 \nU.S. 324, 326]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Edward H. S. Martin, of Chicago, Ill., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case turns upon the proper construction of the limitations provision of Section 19 of the World War Veterans Act of 1924, as amended. \n 1\n\u00a0\n\n The respondent brought an action in the District Court for Northern Illinois in his own right and as administrator of Robert C. Towery, deceased, upon claims on two war risk insurance term policies issued to the decedent while in the military service of the United States. The claim of respondent as administrator was for total permanent disability benefits alleged to have accrued to the insured in his lifetime, and the claim as beneficiary designated in the policies was based upon the death of the insured. The complaint alleged that the premiums were deducted from the insured's pay during his military service, from which he was discharged June 18, 1919; that he became totally and permanently disabled, while the policies were in force, on June 18, 1919; that he died April 22, 1927; that, on May 2, 1927, respondent was appointed administrator; that on February 11, 1932, respondent made claim for disability and death benefits \n\n[306 \nU.S. 324, 327]\n\u00a0\n under the policies; that the claim was denied by the Veterans Administration August 8, 1935. Suit was instituted June 29, 1936. The government moved to dismiss on the ground that the action was barred by limitation. The District Court granted the motion and gave judgment for the government. On appeal the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. \n2\n We granted certiorari, \n305 \nU.S. 588\n, 59 S.Ct. 106, 83 L.Ed. --, because of alleged conflict of decision. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n Section 19 provides that, in the event of a disagreement between the veteran and the Bureau as to a claim under a policy, the claimant may bring an action in the District Court to obtain a decision of the controversy. The statute then proceeds:\n'No suit on yearly renewable term insurance shall be allowed under this section unless the same shall have been brought within six years after the right accrued for which the claim is made or within one year after the date of approval of this amendatory Act (July 3, 1930), whichever is the later date, ... Provided, That for the purposes of this section it shall be deemed that the right accrued on the happening of the contingency on which the claim is founded: Provided further, That this limitation is suspended for the period elapsing between the filing in the bureau of the claim sued upon and the denial of said claim by the director.'\n\n The Circuit Court of Appeals held that the 'contingency', on the happening of which 'the right accrued for which the claim is made', is not defined by the statute and must be ascertained from the policy provisions. In the light of these provisions the court held that, in the case of a claim for benefits payable to the insured, the contingency is the accrual of an installment and, in the case of a claim by a beneficiary, the contingency is the death of the insured. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 324, 328]\n\u00a0\n The policy, while for a stated amount, calls for payment in monthly installments, two hundred and forty of which (interest being calculated at three and one-half per cent.) would equal the principal sum. Contrary to the view of the court below, disability benefits to the insured do not cease at the expiration of two hundred and forty months but are continued for life if the disability so long lasts. \n4\n Should the insured die, however, prior to the payment of two hundred and forty installments, further installments up to the limit of two hundred and forty are payable to his beneficiary. Should the beneficiary die before the receipt of all the remaining installments up to two hundred and forty, the commuted value of the unpaid installments is payable to the estate of the insured in one sum. 5 The court below reached its conclusion as to the meaning of the Act, first, by examination of the phrase 'within six years after the right accrued for which the claim is made.' In the view that, in case of the death of the insured, the beneficiary has a 'right' for which a claim may be made and that, prior to the death of the insured, the latter also has a 'right', namely, to receive each monthly benefit installment, the court concluded that there were two rights. If this be the correct view there is still a third 'right',-that of the administrator of the insured to claim a lump sum commuted value for installments unpaid to the beneficiary at the date of the latter's death. The court then addressed itself to the meaning of the word 'contingency' in the first proviso of the section: 'it shall be deemed that the right accrued on the happening of the \n\n[306 \nU.S. 324, 329]\n\u00a0\n contingency on which the claim is founded.' The court held that, in the case of a disabled veteran, at least two contingencies must occur before the right to any monthly benefit accrued,-namely, the occurrence of permanent disability while the policy was in force and the existence of the disability at the date for which a particular monthly payment is claimed. In the case of a beneficiary, the court was of opinion that another contingency must be added, namely, the death of the insured. It made the choice from these possible alternatives by holding that the right accrued in the case of a living insured on the date when each monthly benefit payment became due and, in the case of a beneficiary, when the insured died. This construction is said to comport with the liberal policy of Congress towards veterans and to be supported by the fact that an alternative period of one year from the date of the passage of the statute was accorded by Congress. The court viewed the six year period as a liberalizing alternative to the one year period, and, therefore, held the claim of the respondent, as beneficiary, was timely because suit had been instituted within the six year period as enlarged by the duration of the Veterans Administration's consideration. The claim, as administrator, for installments accruing in the life of the insured, was held maintainable for such installments as accrued due within six years (plus the additional time allowed for administrative consideration) prior to the institution of suit. We are unable to adopt this construction of the statute.\n Section 19 plainly intends to put a time limitation upon the institution of suit, whereas, the decision of the court below would provide no such limitation upon suits by veterans for total permanent disability benefits, but simply a limitation on the number of installments recoverable; and, in application to disability cases, would \n\n[306 \nU.S. 324, 330]\n\u00a0\n preclude only a recovery of certain installments whereas new suits might be brought thereafter by veterans, if living, in cases in which prior suits had been held barred.\n We think the legislation and the policy do not confer two rights. The beneficiary's interest in the policy is derivative from that of the veteran. It may be taken away by legislation, even after the death of the insured. \n6\n There are different events upon the happening of which the payment of benefits to the veteran or to his beneficiaries or to his estate depend. We think it highly unlikely that Congress intended to accord each of the claimants of possible benefits under the policy six years from the time any installment or lump sum payment fell due within which to bring suit.\n Millions of veterans allowed their yearly convertible term insurance to lapse when they left the Service. \n7\n Congress provided that if, at the time of the lapse, the veteran was totally and permanently disabled he might recover notwithstanding he had not made immediate and timely claim. Section 19 of the Act of 1930 was an amendment of an earlier act. The statute was undoubtedly intended as one of repose. The purpose of its adoption, as shown by the Committee Reports,8 was to substitute a uniform rule of limitation for suits on contracts of insurance in lieu of the state statutes, which, pursuant to the Conformity Act, had theretofore been applied. These varied as respects the period prescribed from three to twenty years. As the reports show, the additional year from the date of the passage of the Act was granted to prevent the hardship of cutting off claims which would have been barred by the six year limitation \n\n[306 \nU.S. 324, 331]\n\u00a0\n at the date of the Act. A reading of the section as a whole is persuasive that what Congress intended by 'the contingency on which the claim is founded' was the contingency on which liability under the policy was bottomed, namely,-permanent disability or death while the policy remained in force.\n The construction adopted by the court below would permit the bringing of suits even twenty years after the disability occurred. It is obvious that each year ascertainment of the essential facts which conditioned liability would become more difficult. We think then that, reasonably construed, the section provides that there shall be but one right,-that is, the right to benefit payments, and but one critical contingency which conditions that right, namely, the occurrence of permanent total disability or death while the policy remains in force.\n All the other contingencies referred to by the court below, which condition actual payment of the benefits to one person or another, are of minor importance. They are not matters with respect to which disagreement with the Veterans Administration is likely.\n Two objections are raised by the respondent to this construction of the section. First, it is said that if suit is brought on a policy and judgment recovered that judgment is only for the installments which have theretofore fallen due and that if the government should fail to pay subsequently accruing installments these might, under our ruling, be barred by the six year limitation. We have said:9 'Undoubtedly, when one's right to recover is established by judgment, the Veterans Bureau will pay him installments maturing in his favor after the commencement of the action.' This has been the consistent administrative practice. Indeed the Bureau has treated a judgment for installments due the veteran as requiring, \n\n[306 \nU.S. 324, 332]\n\u00a0\n without further claim, the payment of remaining installments due the beneficiary after his death. \n10\n The other objection is that, as benefit payments cease on the cessation of the disability, the Veterans Administration may refuse further payments on that ground and, if the insured disagrees with the Bureau's ruling, a suit to test its validity may be barred. The answer is that, under the policy's terms and the administrative rulings, the policy is automatically reinstated for a reduced sum after taking account of the prior payment of benefits and may be continued in force by the insured by the payment of future premiums. \n11\n If he contends that when the policy is thus reinstated he is still permanently and totally disabled, he has the full six years granted by the statute in which to litigate the claim since, if he can establish his contention, he would have been totally and permanently disabled at a time when the policy was in force.\n The judgment is reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act of June 7, 1924, c. 320, Section ,19, 43 Stat. 612, as amended by Act of July 3, 1930, c. 849, 46 Stat. 992, U.S.C.

Frederick H. Wood, of New York City, and Bryce L. Hamilton, and Guy A. Gladson, both of Chicago, Ill., for appellant.\n Messrs. Frank Murphy, Atty. Gen., and Daniel W.

Quasey, of Chicago, Ill., for appellee National Live Stock Marketing Ass'n.\n Mr. Douglas F. Smith, of Chicago, Ill., for appellees Railroad Companies.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The principal question for decision upon this appeal is whether, in the services performed by appellant in loading and unloading livestock at its stockyards in Chicago, and specified by its tariffs filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission, it is a common carrier subject \n\n[308 \nU.S. 213, 215]\n\u00a0\n to the Interstate Commerce Act, 24 Stat. 379, as amended in 1920, 41 Stat. 474, 49 U.S.C.,  1-27, 49 U.S.C.A.  1-27.\n The case comes here on appeal from the final decree of a district court of three judges,1 dismissing appellant's suit to set aside an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission, which directed the cancellation of appellant's supplemental schedule proposing cancellation of its rate schedules previously filed with the Commission. Cancellation of Livestock Services, 227 I.C.C. 716. Appellant here, as below, assails the Commission's order on the ground that in performing the scheduled services appellant is not within the jurisdiction of the Commission as defined by the Interstate Commerce Act.\n As appears in the Commission's report, appellant was incorporated in 1865 with authority to build and operate a railroad and a stockyard, and with power of eminent domain. Acting under its charter it constructed a stockyard in Chicago and approximately three hundred miles of railroad tracks, consisting of a main line connecting with the trunk lines entering Chicago and switches to various industries located adjacent to its tracks.\n Prior to 1912 it had tried various methods of operating its tracks and stockyards. At that time it did not control any of its railroad properties other than platforms and facilities for loading and unloading at its yard. The Chicago Junction Railway Co., which, with appellant, was controlled by a single holding company, operated the railroad under a fifty-year lease, paying to appellant as rental two-thirds of its net profits. In that year the United States brought suit to restrain appellant and the Junction Company from further operations in interstate commerce until they filed tariffs as required by  6 of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C.A.  6. The litigation resulted \n\n[308 \nU.S. 213, 216]\n\u00a0\n in the decision of this Court that both were common carriers subject to the Act. United States v. Union Stock Yards & Transit Co., \n226 \nU.S. 286\n, 33 S.Ct. 83. Appellant then filed a rate schedule with the Commission specifying its charges for loading and unloading all rail-borne livestock, and continued its practice of performing services in loading and unloading from and to its livestock pens for the trunk line railroads, charging them the scheduled rates for the service.\n In the following year the Junction Company lease was cancelled and a new one executed, under which appellant leased in perpetuity all of its railroad facilities, except those used for loading and unloading livestock, at an annual rental of $600,000 in lieu of a share of the profits. This was followed in 1917 by an attempt by the stockyard to charge shippers an additional amount for the loading and unloading service which resulted in a reparation award by the Commission, sustained in Adams v. Mills, \n286 \nU.S. 397\n, 52 S.Ct. 589. In the same year appellant sought to cancel its tariffs on the ground that by reason of the change in the lease it was no longer a common carrier. This contention was rejected by the Commission. Livestock Loading and Unloading Charges, 52 I.C.C. 209; 58 I.C. C. 164.\n In 1922 the Junction Company, with the approval of the Commission, Chicago Junction Case, 71 I.C.C. 631, 150 I.C.C. 32, sublet the road for ninety-nine years, with a renewal option, to the Chicago River & Indiana Railroad Co., whose capital stock was acquired by the New York Central Railroad Company. A renewed attempt by the stockyard to cancel its tariffs failed in 1935. Livestock Loaded and Unloaded, 213 I.C.C. 330, and its 1937 repetition resulted in the like order of the Commission, which is the subject of the present suit.\n By ceasing to operate or control its railroad directly or indirectly appellant has restricted its transportation serv- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 213, 217]\n\u00a0\n ice to the loading or unloading of livestock as specified in its tariff. It owns the platforms and chutes which are the necessary and only means of loading and unloading at its yard to and from which the livestock is shipped interstate by rail. For this service it charges the railroads the scheduled rates. Loading and unloading are included in the transportation service rendered by the railroads to shippers, the charge for it to shippers being covered by the line-haul tariffs. The Commission found that appellant's yard is the principal railroad terminal in Chicago for the receipt of livestock in carload lots, and that appellant holds itself out to the public as performing the loading and unloading service and permits it to be performed by no other.\n Appellant contends that having divested itself of all control and participation in the operation of its railroad it is no longer within the jurisdiction of the Commission over 'common carriers by railroad', conferred by the Interstate Commerce Act, but is subject to regulation by the Secretary of Agriculture, under the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921, 42 Stat. 159, 7 U.S.C.,  181-229, 7 U.S.C.A.  181-229.\n By  305 of that Act rates and charges for stockyard services furnished at a stockyard or by a stockyard owner are required to be just and reasonable. And by  309, 310, the Secretary is given authority to regulate such rates. By  301 stockyard services are defined as 'services or facilities furnished at a stockyard in connection with the receiving, buying and selling ... marketing, feeding, watering, holding, delivery, shipment, weighing, or handling in commerce, of livestock'. It will be noted that the loading and unloading of livestock are not specifically included in the definition of stockyard services. Further, an important exception to the broad authority of the Secretary is made by  406, 7 U.S. C.A.  226, which provides: 'Nothing in this chapter shall affect the power or jurisdiction of \n\n[308 \nU.S. 213, 218]\n\u00a0\n the Interstate Commerce Commission, nor confer upon the Secretary concurrent power or jurisdiction over any matter within the power or jurisdiction of such Commission'. We accordingly turn to the provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act to determine the extent of the exception.\n Section 6(1) of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C.A.  6(1), provides that a common carrier subject to the provisions of the sections presently to be mentioned, where no joint rate is involved, shall file schedules of rates showing 'the separately established rates ... applied to the through transportation' and requires that the rate schedules shall 'state separately all terminal charges ... and all other charges which the commission may require, all privileges or facilities granted or allowed and any rules or regulations which in any wise change, affect, or determine any part or the aggregate of such aforesaid rates ... or the value of the service rendered to the passenger, shipper, or consignee.'\n Section 1(1) of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C.A.  1(1), declares: 'The provisions of this part (chapter) shall apply to common carriers engaged in-(a) the transportation of passengers or property wholly by railroad ....' Section 1(3), 49 U.S.C.A.  1(3), provides that the term railroad shall include '... all the road in use by any common carrier operating a railroad ... all switches, spurs, tracks, terminals, and terminal facilities of every kind used or necessary in the transportation ... of ... persons or property ... including all freight depots, yards, and grounds, used or necessary in the transportation or delivery of any such property.' It defines the term 'transportation' as including 'locomotives, cars, ... and all instrumentalities and facilities of shipment or carriage, irrespective of ownership or of any contract, express or implied, for the use thereof, and all services in connection with the receipt, delivery, elevation, and transfer in transit ... and handling of property transported'. \n\n[308 \nU.S. 213, 219]\n\u00a0\n Section 15(5), 49 U.S.C.A.  15(5), provides, 'Transportation wholly by railroad of ordinary livestock in carload lots destined to or received at public stockyards shall include all necessary service of unloading and reloading en route, delivery at public stockyards of inbound shipments into suitable pens, and receipt and loading at such yards of outbound shipments, without extra charge therefor to the shipper, consignee or owner ....'\n Without the aid of these statutes the transportation of livestock by rail was held to begin with its delivery to the carrier for loading onto its cars, and to end only after unloading for delivery or tender to the consignee at the place of destination. Covington Stock-Yards Co. v. Keith, \n139 \nU.S. 128, 136\n, 11 S.Ct. 461, 463. The same rule has been repeatedly applied since the statute was adopted. Erie R. Co. v. Shuart, \n250 \nU.S. 465, 468\n, 39 S.Ct. 519, 520; Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. United States, \n295 \nU.S. 193, 198\n, 55 S.Ct. 748, 751 and cases cited; Denver Stock Yards Company v. United States, \n304 \nU.S. 470\n, 58 S.Ct. 990; 2 Hutchison Carriers, 3d ed.  510. Appellant is thus engaged in the performance of a railroad transportation service and provides railroad 'terminal facilities' and services. It is a 'carrier' engaged in 'transportation of property wholly by railroad' as those terms are defined by the words of the statute.\n That appellant's stockyard is a terminal of the line-haul carriers, and that it performs their railroad terminal services within the meaning of the Act was recognized in Adams v. Mills, supra, \n286 \nU.S. 409\n, 52 S.Ct. 592, and also in Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. United States, supra. There the Commission's order directing the discontinuance of appellant's yardage charge to consignees was set aside on the sole ground that the Commission's findings failed to show that the service for which the charge was made was any part of the loading or unloading services, or otherwise a service which the rail carrier was bound to furnish. \n\n[308 \nU.S. 213, 220]\n\u00a0\n The statute, it is true, does not purport to say when one who is a railroad carrier because engaged in furnishing railroad terminal facilities and services, is to be deemed a 'common carrier'. But that question was put at rest in United States v. Brooklyn Eastern District Terminal, \n249 \nU.S. 296\n, 39 S.Ct. 283, 6 A.L.R. 527. There a local terminal company rendering terminal services as the agent of numerous rail carriers, was held to be engaged in a public or common calling, and hence to be a common carrier within the meaning of the Hours of Service Act, 34 Stat. 1415, 45 U.S.C.A.  61 et seq., which is applicable to any common carrier by railroad engaged in interstate commerce. Cf. Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n219 \nU.S. 498\n, 31 S.Ct. 279; United States v. California, \n297 \nU.S. 175, 181\n, 56 S.Ct. 421, 422; United States v. Sioux City Stock Yards Co., C.C., 162 F. 556.\n It is not important, as appellant seems to think, that, as an incident to the service it renders to shippers and to the line-haul carriers, it acts as agent of the latter. The character of the service, in its relation to the public, determines whether the calling is a public one, and a common carrier does not cease to be such merely because in rendering service to the public it acts as the agent of another. United States v. Brooklyn Eastern District Terminal, supra, \n249 \nU.S. 307\n, 39 S.Ct. 286, 6 A.L.R. 527. Connecting common carriers frequently act in that capacity for each other without losing their status as such.\n Nor is it of weight that the terminal service includes no rail-haul. See Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n219 \nU.S. 498\n, 31 S.Ct. 279, or that operation and control of the terminal facilities are wholly separate from those of any railroad. United States v. Brooklyn Eastern District Terminal, supra, \n249 \nU.S. 305\n, 39 S.Ct. 285, 6 A.L.R. 527. It is enough that the loading and unloading are rail transportation services performed at a railroad terminal as a common or public calling by one who, in rendering it, engages in the trans- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 213, 221]\n\u00a0\n portation of property by railroad within the meaning of the Act.\n Ellis v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n237 \nU.S. 434\n, 35 S.Ct. 645, on which appellant relies, does not hold otherwise. There the Commission sought a district court order to compel the examination of witnesses in a proceeding, instituted by the Commission of its own motion, for the investigation of a corporation which leased refrigerator cars to shippers and railroads and maintained icing plants at which it iced the cars, the railroad paying for the icing service. There was no allegation or proof that the corporation was engaged in a common calling or held itself out as ready or willing to supply cars or services on reasonable request. In holding that the case was not an appropriate one for the relief sought because the company was not within the jurisdiction of the Commission, the Court said, 237 U.S. at page 443, 35 S.Ct. at page 646: 'It is true that the definition of transportation in  1 of the act (49 U.S.C.A  1) includes such instrumentalities as the Armour Car Lines lets to the railroads. But the definition is a preliminary to a requirement that the carriers shall furnish them upon reasonable request, not that the owners and builders shall be regarded as carriers, contrary to the truth.'\n This Court has since recognized that loading and unloading services such as are here involved are common carrier services placed under the authority of the Commission by the Interstate Commerce Act. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. United States, supra; Denver Stock Yards Company v. United States, supra, 304 U.S. at page 477, 58 S.Ct. 995. And unless the restriction of  406 of the Packers and Stockyards Act upon the authority of the Secretary of Agriculture in favor of that of the Commission refers to such services, the purpose of the section is not apparent. None other is suggested. See Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Company v. United States, supra, 295 U.S. at page 199, 55 S. Ct. 751. As we think the statute plainly places \n\n[308 \nU.S. 213, 222]\n\u00a0\n appellant's loading and unloading facilities and services under the authority of the Commission, they are withdrawn from the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Agriculture by the terms of  406 of the Packers and Stockyards Act, 7 U.S.C.A.  226, 227,2 and we find it unnecessary to consider the question, much argued at the Bar, whether the services could be more conveniently and advantageously regulated by the one administrative agency than by the other.\n Appellant asks that the order be set aside for want of the 'full hearing' by the Commission, required by  15(7) of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C.A.  15(7). In the course of the hearings before the Commission appellant offered in a variety of ways to prove the conditions prevailing at stockyards other than appellant's, and that the Commission had not asserted jurisdiction over loading and \n\n[308 \nU.S. 213, 223]\n\u00a0\n unloading services performed at those yards. Appellant states that the evidence would have shown that there are one hundred and thirty-five other stockyards in the United States under regulation by the Secretary of Agriculture,3 which perform loading and unloading services, for which the railroads pay, under conditions similar to those in the Chicago yard; that although, to the knowledge of the Commission, this has been the case for many years, it has not asserted its jurisdiction over any of these yards. This, it is argued, would have established a practical construction of the statute by the Commission, relevant and material to the inquiry because of the rule that a settled or uniform administrative construction of a doubtful statute is of weight in determining its meaning. Boston & Maine Railroad v. Hooker, \n233 \nU.S. 97\n, 34 S.Ct. 526, L.R.A.1915B, 450, Ann.Cas.1915D, 593; Pocket Veto Case, \n279 \nU.S. 655, 688\n, 689 S., 49 S.Ct. 463, 469, 64 A.L.R. 1434; Louisville & Nashville R. Company v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 740\n, 51 S.Ct. 297, 75 L.Ed 672. The exclusion of the proffered evidence by the Commission and its alleged failure to make a proper record of the offer, it is urged, have deprived the appellant of a full hearing.\n We think the record adequately shows that the Commission excluded the offered proof as appellant has characterized it here, but we concluded that the Commission was free to reject it. The issue to be resolved in the present proceeding is whether the service rendered by appellant at its Chicago stockyard brought it within the jurisdiction of the Commission. To this issue the practices by others at other yards is irrelevant and their bearing on the administrative construction of the statute \n\n[308 \nU.S. 213, 224]\n\u00a0\n in the present circumstances is, we think, too remote and indecisive to compel a burdensome inquiry into collateral issues.\n The Commission has consistently ruled that appellant's loading and unloading services are within its jurisdiction under conditions which appear of record to have remained unchanged since 1922. Appellant is free, as it has been throughout, to show any ruling or action taken by the Commission involving an administrative construction of the statute, although it is plain that in the face of the present record such rulings could not establish a consistent acceptance by the Commission of the construction for which appellant contends. See United States v. Chicago, North Shore & Milwaukee R. R. Co., \n288 \nU.S. 1\n, 53 S.Ct. 245; cf. Sanford's Estate v. Helvering, \n308 \nU.S. 39\n, 60 S.Ct. 51, decided November 6, 1939. But mere inaction, through failure of the Commission to institute proceedings under  15(7), is not an administrative ruling and does not imply decision as to the Commission's jurisdiction. If the failure to act in the case of yards other than the present one is to be taken as an administrative construction of the statute persuasive here, we would be forced to conclude that a jurisdiction which the statute has plainly conferred either on the Secretary or the Commission, has been lost, although, with respect to this appellant, jurisdiction has been consistently asserted by the Commission, while the Secretary has as consistently remained passive. There is a practical limit to which inquiry into collateral issues may be extended in pursuit of the trivial. We think that limit was reached here.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n]  210 and  238(4) of the Judicial Code as amended by the Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat. 938, 28 U.S.C.,  47a, 345, 28 U.S.C.

S. 3944, 66th Congress, in providing a Federal Livestock Commission to regulate packers and stockyards did not contain such a saving clause.

H. Rept. 1297, 66th Cong., 3rd Sess., p. 9.\n In the 67th Congress the House Committee on Agriculture proposed the bill substantially in the form finally adopted as the Packers and Stockyards Act, containing the saving clause in favor of the Commerce Commission. The Chairman in introducing the bill in the House said: 'It is proposed to give the Secretary of Agriculture jurisdiction over the packer, stockyards, commission men, traders, buyers, and sellers, and all activities connected with the slaughtering and marketing of livestock and live-stock products in interstate commerce; that is the Secretary shall have jurisdiction from the time the livestock is unloaded at the terminal yards and after it is out of the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission. Up to the time of unloading the livestock the Interstate Commerce Commission has jurisdiction over the shipment, distribution, and ownership of stock, refrigerator cars, and other equipment, and transportation rates, including belt lines and terminal roads.'

Louis Monarch, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Herbert Pope, of Chicago, Ill., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n May 6, 1932, petitioner sued respondents in the federal court for the northern district of Illinois to enforce a claim for part of income and profits taxes for 1920 assessed against an Illinois corporation dissolved in December, 1921. The question for decision is whether the suit is barred by lapse of time. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 398, 400]\n\u00a0\n The pertinent substance of the complaint, as amended February 14, 1937, follows:\n In 1919 and 1920, James Duggan, hereafter called the testator, was the principal stockholder of the Johnson City & Big Muddy Coal & Mining Company, which owned a subsidiary corporation. May 16, 1921, these corporations made consolidated income and profits tax returns for 1920, showing a tax of $5,269.21, which was paid. During 1920 and 1921 the mining company was being dissolved; it converted its assets into cash and securities and transferred $295,331.64 to testator; he appropriated it to his own use. Having determined deficiency of $316,620.61 against the company, the commissioner of internal revenue December 6, 1924 sent notice to it by 60-day letter. The taxpayer having failed to petition the board of tax appeals for redetermination, assessment was made against it for that amount.\n April 15, 1926, the commissioner notified testator that there was proposed for assessment against him the amount of $295,331.64, constituting his liability, as transferee of taxpayer's assets, on account of the unpaid balance of its 1920 taxes. June 11, 1926, testator filed with the board of tax appeals his petition for redetermination. In March, 1929, he died. January 27, 1931, the board made an order of redetermination in the amount proposed by the commissioner, with interest from December 6, 1924. The order was not reviewed. February 14, 1931, the commissioner made a jeopardy assessment against the deceased in the amount fixed by the board as his liability as transferee.\n His will was admitted to probate; a trust company it named was appointed executor; and, the executor having been dismissed, one Robinson was, on September 15, 1930, appointed administrator. Before settlement of the estate, plaintiff, April 24, 1931, filed its claim with the \n\n[305 \nU.S. 398, 401]\n\u00a0\n administrator. But he paid nothing on account of it and, making distribution in accordance with the will, transferred to defendant Henry Duggan $50,000 and to defendant trustee the rest of the estate, about $1, 500,000. Plaintiff alleged that the assets so distributed had become impressed with a trust for the payment of its claim against testator and prayed decree enforcing it against trustee and beneficiaries under the will to the extent of assets transferred by the taxpayer to testator with interest.\n Defendants, June 6, 1933, moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the suit was barred by  277, 278, 280, Revenue Act 1926, 44 Stat. 58, 59, 61, as amended, and  311(b), Revenue Act 1928, 45 Stat. 860, 26 U.S.C.A.  311(b). Plaintiff, January 11, 1937, confessed defendants' motion to dismiss. Then, applying for leave to amend the complaint, it represented to the court that amendment was necessary because the allegation that an assessment was made against testator was omitted from the original bill and was an important fact in determining whether the present action was timely brought. Leave having been granted, it immediately amended by adding the allegation that, February 14, 1931, the commissioner made against testator the jeopardy assessment above referred to. The complaint was not otherwise changed. March 22, 1937, the court sustained defendants' motion and entered decree dismissing the amended bill of complaint. The circuit court of appeals affirmed. 7 Cir., 94 F.2d 81. This Court granted a writ of certiorari. \n304 \nU.S. 554\n, 58 S.Ct. 1039\n\n\n The question is whether the suit is barred by the statutory provisions on which the motion to dismiss was based. First to be considered are  277, 278 and 280, read in connection with applicable provisions of  274 and 279 of the Revenue Act of 1926.1 \n\n[305 \nU.S. 398, 402]\n\u00a0\n The pertinent substance of these follows:\n Within 60 days after notice of the commissioner's determination of deficiency, the taxpayer may file petition with the board of tax appeals for redetermination; no assessment or proceeding in court for collection shall be made or begun until the board's decision has become final.  274( a).2 The amount redetermined by decision that has become final shall be assessed and upon his demand shall be paid to the collector.  274(b).\n Assessment shall be made within five years after the return; 'no proceedings in court without assessment for the collection of such taxes shall be begun after the expiration of such period.'  277(a). The running of the statute of limitations on assessment or proceeding in court for collection of deficiency shall be suspended for the period during which the commissioner is prohibited from making assessment or bringing suit and for 60 days thereafter.  277(b). Where the assessment has been made within the period properly applicable thereto, the tax may be collected by distraint or proceeding in court 'but only if begun ... within six years after assessment of the tax.'  278(d). If the commissioner believes that assessment or collection of deficiency will be jeopardized by delay he shall immediately assess the deficiency and 'notice and demand shall be made by the collector for the payment thereof.'  279(a). Jeopardy assessment may be made whether or not the taxpayer has filed petition with the board.  279(c). If it is made after the board's decision it may be only for the deficiency determined by the decision.  279(d). The taxpayer may obtain stay of collection of the jeopardy assessment.  279(f)-(h). \n\n[305 \nU.S. 398, 403]\n\u00a0\n The liability at law or in equity of 'a transferee of property of a taxpayer, in respect of the tax' shall be assessed, collected, and paid in the same manner and subject to the same provisions and limitations as in case of a deficiency in a tax.  280(a). Transferee liability must be assessed within one year from expiration of the period of limitation for assessment against the taxpayer.  280(b)(1). The running of the period of limitation on transferee liability shall, after notice to transferee under  274(a), be suspended for the period during which the commissioner is prohibited from making assessment of that liability and for 60 days thereafter.  280(d).\n This is not a suit upon assessment of deficiency against the taxpayer on account of the commissioner's determination as shown in his letter of December 6, 1924. The time for such a suit, six years after assessment, expired long before the commencement of this suit.  278(d). United States v. Updike, \n281 \nU.S. 489, 494\n, 50 S.Ct. 367, 368.\n Nor is it a suit authorized to be brought, in absence of assessment, to enforce liability of a transferee of the taxpayer's property. The time for bringing such a suit is six years, made up of five years after return allowed for assessment against taxpayer,  277(a), and one year thereafter for assessment against transferee.  280(b)(1). The taxpayer having made its return on May 16, 1921, the six years expired May 16, 1927.\n This suit is against transferees under the will of a transferee of the property of the taxpayer; it is based on the jeopardy assessment made against testator.\n Plaintiff asserts that it had six years after that assessment, or until February 14, 1937, within which to bring this suit. Its reasoning is that  280, specifying no period of limitation for collection of liability of a transferee after it has been assessed, and providing that it shall be collected subject to the same limitations as in the case of \n\n[305 \nU.S. 398, 404]\n\u00a0\n definiency in a tax, makes applicable the period of limitation upon collection defined in  278(d).\n But no assessment was made against any of the defendants. None of them is a transferee of the property of the taxpayer; all are testamentary transferees of the estate of testator. It is clear that  278(d) and 280 upon which plaintiff relies are not broad enough to impose on defendants any liability on account of the assessment against the testator. \n3\n And, as already shown, suit \n\n[305 \nU.S. 398, 405]\n\u00a0\n on assessment against the taxpayer, or suit in absence of assessment of transferee liability, was by the applicable statutes of limitations barred long before this suit was brought.\n Moreover, the assessment sued on was out of time. Plaintiff cites  280(d) and seeks to apply to the facts of this case the rule that assessment against transferee is required to be made within 6 years after return,  277(a), 280(b)(1), as follows: The taxpayer made its return May 16, 1921. When, on April 15, 1926, the commissioner notified testator that he proposed to assess transferee liability against him, there remained 13 months and a day of the period allowed for making that assessment; the commissioner was prohibited from making the proposed assessment for the 60- day period within which testator was permitted to petition for redetermination by the board and until its decision, January 27, 1931, became final, June 27, 1931, and for 60 days thereafter, September 25, 1931.  278(d), 280(d). Taking in the 13 months and a day, plaintiff had until October 25, 1932 within which to assess testator.\n But that calculation is defective for it fails to take into account any part of the period after appeal to the board that elapsed between the death of petitioner in March, 1929, and the assessment, more than 23 months later, February 14, 1931. Redetermination is granted to safeguard against erroneous exactions by the commissioner, Suspension of his authority to assess or collect is protection against compulsory payment pending final decision \n\n[305 \nU.S. 398, 406]\n\u00a0\n upon objections interposed by petitioner. The proceeding is an adversary one in which the party praying relief by redetermination is petitioner and the commissioner is respondent. The controvery is brought to issue by petition, answer, and reply that are by the board required to be definite and certain. Rules 6, 14, 15. 4 Before its decision either party, for cause shown, may have the proceeding dismissed. \n5\n Rule 31. And in case of petitioner's death, the board may order substitution of proper parties. Rule 37.\n No personal representative of testator nor any other person applied for substitution of a party to carry on the proceeding in the place of the deceased testator, and none was ordered. The commissioner failed to obtain or seek dismissal for lack of a necessary party or want of prosecution. Cf. Rusk v. Commissioner, 7 Cir., 53 F.2d 428, 430. Plaintiff does not contend that, no substitution having been applied for or made, the commissioner was not entitled to an order of dismissal. Nor does it suggest anything to support the assumption, made in its calculation of time and throughout its argument, that suspension of commissioner's authority to assess continued through the period of more than 23 months between testator's death and the assessment. There is no ground on which it may be held that Congress intended in case of death of petitioner, where no application for or order of substitution is made, indefinitely to continue suspension \n\n[305 \nU.S. 398, 407]\n\u00a0\n of the commissioner's authority to assess. Equally unreasonable would it be to hold that suspension of the commissioner's authority to assess the asserted transferee liability continued after testator's death for more than a reasonable time within which, no substitution having been applied for or made, to obtain dismissal. Unquestionably that time and more had expired long before the assessment was made.\n As the suit is barred by provisions of the Revenue Act of 1926, we need not consider  311(b) of the Revenue Act of 1928, upon which defendants also relied.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice STONE.\n I think the judgment should be reversed.\n The first transferee was a 'taxpayer' within the meaning of  280(a)( 1), Revenue Act 1926, since he was liable under the provisions of the revenue law to pay the tax and, like other taxpayers, was subject to assessment and distraint as well as to a suit for recovery of the tax. United States v. Updike, \n281 \nU.S. 489, 494\n, 50 S.Ct. 367, 368. Respondent, the second transferee, was therefore, in the words of  280(a)(1), 'a transferee of property of a taxpayer', and its tax liability was by that section to 'be assessed, collected, and paid in the same manner and subject to the same provisions and limitations as in the case of a deficiency in a tax imposed by this title (including the provisions ) ... authorizing distraint and proceedings in court for collection .... '\n Under  278(d) the statute of limitations for collection of the tax from the first transferee did not expire until January, 1931, six years after assessment of the tax against the original taxpayer and first transferor. United States v. Updike, supra. By  277(b) the running of the six year statute is suspended, after the beginning of deficiency proceedings under  274(a), 'for the period during which \n\n[305 \nU.S. 398, 408]\n\u00a0\n the Commissioner is prohibited from making the assessment or beginning distraint or a proceeding in court'. And by  274(a) it is provided that during the pendency of deficiency proceedings 'no assessment of a deficiency in respect of the tax imposed by this title and no distraint or proceeding in court for its collection shall be made, begun, or prosecuted ....' It follows that the running of the statute of limitations in favor of the first transferee was suspended during the pendency of the deficiency proceedings initiated with respect to him April 15, 1926, at least, as the opinion of the Court states, until the death of the first transferee in March, 1929, or for a period of nearly three years. The period of limitations for the collection of the tax from the first transferee was thus extended at least until 1933, within which time the present suit was brought against respondent. By virtue of the transfer, the transferee, to the extent of the property received, becomes subject to the tax liability of the transferor. Phillips v. Commissioner, \n283 \nU.S. 589, 592\n, 593 S., 51 S.Ct. 608, 609, and cases cited in footnote 1. Since the period of limitations and the provisions for its suspension under  274(a) and 277(b), applicable to the first transferee and taxpayer, are by  280(a)(1) likewise applicable to his transferee, who is also a taxpayer, United States v. Updike, supra, 494, 50 S.Ct. page 368, it follows that the statute of limitations applicable to respondent, the second transferee, had not expired when the present suit was brought in May, 1932.\n No distinction was made by the revenue laws between the liability and the period of limitations applicable to a first transferee and those applicable to a second until the enactment of  311 of the Revenue Act of 1928, 45 Stat. 860, 26 U.S.C.A.  311, which provided in subsection (b)(2) that the liability of a second transferee of the property of the taxpayer should not extend beyond three years after the expiration of the period of limitation for assessment against the original \n\n[305 \nU.S. 398, 409]\n\u00a0\n taxpayer, except that provision was made for an extension of the time if within that period 'a court proceeding for the collection of the tax or liability' had been begun against the original taxpayer or the last preceding transferee. In recommending these changes the report of the Senate Finance Committee, No. 960, 70th Congress, 1st Sess., p. 32, prepared before our decision in the Updike Case, pointed out that  280 of the 1926 Act did not specifically provide any limitation period in the case of a transferee of a transferee, and it stated that the purpose of the new provisions in  311(b)(2) was to shorten the period during which proceedings might be had against a second transferee. This legislative history is persuasive that under  280 of the 1926 Act, as its language indicates, the second transferee is the transferee of a taxpayer and subject to the same period of limitations and provisions for its extension as is his transferor.\n As a transferee is subject to the tax liability of his transferor, the second transferee under the 1926 Act is either subject to the same period of limitations as his transferor, or there is no statute of limitations applicable to him. But if the first transferee is a taxpayer, so as to avail himself of the benefit of the six year statute of limitations for collection of the tax, as held in the Updike Case, his transferee is likewise a taxpayer, as well as the transferee of a taxpayer, so as to be subject to the burden of the provisions extending the period of limitation for collection of the tax.  280(a)(1).\n Mr. Justice BLACK concurs. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 44 Stat. 55 et seq. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The board's decision becomes final upon expiration of the time (six months after it renders decision) allowed for filing petition for review by a circuit court of appeals or the court of appeals of the District of Columbia.  1001, 1005 (26 U.S.C.A.  640). \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Cf.  311, Revenue Act of 1928, 45 Stat. 860, 26 U.S.C.A.  311.

(1) The liability, at law or in equity, of a transferee of property of a taxpayer, in respect of the tax ... imposed upon the taxpayer by this title ( chapter). ...\n\n'(b) The period of limitation for assessment of any such liability of a transferee ... shall be as follows: (1) In the case of the liability of an initial transferee of the property of the taxpayer,-within one year after the expiration of the period of limitation for assessment against the taxpayer; (2) In the case of the liability of a transferee of a transferee of the property of the taxpayer,-within one year after the expiration of the period of limitation for assessment against the preceding transferee, but only if within three years after the expiration of the period of limitation for assessment against the taxpayer;-\n\n'Except that if before the expiration of the period of limitation for the assessment of the liability of the transferee, a court proceeding for the collection of the tax or liability in respect thereof has been begun against the taxpayer or last preceding transferee, respectively,-then the period of limitation for assessment of the liability of the transferee shall expire one year after the return of execution in the court proceeding.'\n\n The report of the Senate Committee on Finance states: Section 280 of the revenue act of 1926 does not specifically provide any limitation period in the case of a trasferee of a transferee of the taxpayer. Section 311(b)(2) of the House bill provides, with specific exceptions, that the period for assessment in such case shall be one year after the expiration of the period of limitation for assessment against the preceding transferee. It seemed to the committee that this would unduly prolong litigation and that there should be a time when the transferee may know that he is no longer liable to be proceeded against. A committee amendment therefore provides that in all cases the tax must be assessed within three years after the expiration of the period of limitation for assessment against the taxpayer.'

Title 49,  41) on August 17, 1932. A motion to quash this was sustained, February 2, 1937, during the January, 1937 term. Later in the same term-April 9, 1937- the Grand Jury returned a second indictment against appellee based on the same facts and containing the same charges as those specified in the 1934 indictment.\n To the second indictment appellee interposed what it designated a plea in bar. This alleged (1) that as the offense charged was committed more than three years preceding the return of the pending indictment prosecution was barred by the statute of limitations; (2) that the new indictment was not returned in conformity with the Act May 10, 1934 (note 2, supra), since it was reported at the term during which the first indictment was found defective-not at the succeeding one. This plea was sustained and the cause is here by direct appeal.\n Counsel for appellants submit-\n The Act May 10, 1934 prevented the bar of the statute of limitations from becoming effective until the end of the term next succeeding that during which the first indictment was quashed. The ruling of the trial court (1) is contrary to the purpose of the Act and not required by its language; (2) is contrary to the policy and frustrates the general object of the statute of limitations 'to encourage promptitude in the prosecution of remedies'; \n\n[306 \nU.S. 68, 71]\n\u00a0\n (3) creates unnecessary inconsistency between the two sections of the Act, and results in an illogical and unreasonable break within the period of limitation.\n The Act of 1934 was passed upon recommendation of the Senate Judiciary Committee whose report stated that the purpose of the bill was set out in a letter from the Attorney General which it quoted. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n Inspection of this letter shows quite plainly that the bill as finally enacted undertook to do exactly what the Attorney General asked.

In other cases defendants are not apprehended for some time or removal proceedings are instituted and appeals taken from habeas corpus orders refusing to release the defendant on removal order, and in still other cases dilatory motions are made with the hope that, if ultimately sustained, the statute of limitations will meanwhile have run against another prosecution. To safeguard the interests of the Government in such cases, legislation is recommended providing that in any case in which an indictment is found defective or insufficient for any cause, after the period prescribed by the statute of limitations has run, or where said period of limitations has not run but will expire before the end of the next regular session of court, a new indictment may be returned at any time during the first succeeding term of court at which a grand jury is in session.

Sec. 239, Jud.Code, 28 U.S.C.  346, 28 U.S.C.A.  346. The following facts are stated: On August 10, 1934, the Federal Housing Administrator issued a policy of insurance, under the provisions of the National Housing Act, Title 1, Sec. 2, 1 to the California Bank, a banking corporation. On January 2, 1936, the California Bank, under the protection of this policy, made a loan to the Monterey Brewing Company. The company paid part of the indebtedness but defaulted on the balance on February 2, 1937. On April 5, 1937, it filed a petition in bankruptcy and was adjudicated a bankrupt. Under the insurance contract the bank had to wait until 60 days after default before making claim upon the Administrator. The 60 days expired two days before bankruptcy of the company. The bank, however, did not present its claim to the Administrator until July 3, 1937; the latter paid August 4, 1937, by draft drawn on the \n\n[307 \nU.S. 200, 202]\n\u00a0\n Treasury of the United States; the bank assigned the note to the 'United States of America.' Later the Administrator filed a claim upon the note in the name of the United States of America.\n The referee allowed it as a general claim only. The district court approved. In re Monterey Brewing Co., D.C., 24 F.Supp. 463. On the appeal to the circuit court of appeals the following question, decisive of the controversy,2 was certified:\n'Where, prior to the filing of a petition for and adjudication in bankruptcy of the maker of a promissory note payable to a bank, the Federal Housing Administrator, under the provisions of the National Housing Act, insured the payee bank against the nonpayment of the note by its maker, upon which note the maker became in default more than sixty days prior to said filing and adjudication, and upon demand of the insured bank made after the adjudication, the Federal Housing Administrator paid to the bank its claim arising from such default, and procured an assignment to the United States of the claim of the insured bank against the bankrupt, which claim had not been presented or proved in bankruptcy by the insured bank, and presented such claim in the name of the United States to the trustee in bankruptcy having before him other allowed aims against the bankrupt, is such claim entitled to priority over such other claims under sec. 3466 of the Revised Statutes (31 U.S.C.A.  191) by reason of the provisions of sec. 64(b)(7) (11 U.S.C.A.  104(b)(7)).'\n\n Section 64(b)(7) conferred priority upon 'debts owing to any person who by the laws of ... the United States is entitled to priority: Provided, That the term \n\n[307 \nU.S. 200, 203]\n\u00a0\n 'person' ... shall include ... the United States ....'3 Section 3466 of the Revised Statutes, the basis for the claimed priority, provides that 'Whenever any person indebted to the United States is insolvent ... the debts due to the United States shall be first satisfied; and the priority hereby established shall extend ... to cases in which an act of bankruptcy is committed.'\n Although an amendment of the National Housing Act authorized the Administrator to sue and be sued in any court of competent jurisdiction, State or Federal, 4 it is not necessary in answering the present certificate to determine whether by this addition the Congress intended to give the Administrator the status of a corporation or other entity distinct from the United States and by such status, to confer on or withhold from claims of the Federal Housing Administration against bankrupts the advantages of section 3466.5 We can deal only with a claim of the Federal Housing Administration assigned to the United States after the adjudication in bankruptcy of the obligor. It is assumed that such a claim belongs to and is made by the United States. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n[307 \nU.S. 200, 204]\n\u00a0\n Before considering the applicability of Section 3466 to claims of the United States acquired after the bankruptcy of the obligor, we must examine the contention of the Government that it possessed a provable claim at the time the petition in bankruptcy was filed. This assertion predicates an agreement, express or implied, by the obligor to indemnify the Government for any loss it may sustain by reason of its insurance of the bank. The question certified contains nothing as to the contract of insurance except that it was under the provisions of the National Housing Act and 'insured the payee bank against the nonpayment of the note by its maker.' The section of that act, quoted above, does not indicate any privity between the bankrupt maker and the Government based upon the insurance contract. Even if we accept as accurate the statement in the certificate that the Administration insured against the non-payment of this note,7 there is nothing in the record to connect the maker with the insurance. The Government attempts to fill in the facts lacking in the certification by printing in its brief a regulation of the Federal Housing Administration, Number 10 of July 15, 1935,8 and the form of credit statement from the note maker to the bank in use, presumably, at \n\n[307 \nU.S. 200, 205]\n\u00a0\n the time of the loan. The form contains this sentence, as well as information as to the applicant's employment or business, his income and the property to be improved: 'The following information is given for the purpose of inducing you to grant credit under the provisions of Title I of the National Housing Act.'\n The regulation and the credit statement certainly do not supply the facts necessary to the conclusion that this particular form of credit statement was used. As the certificate does not show the State in which the note was executed, payable or enforceable, we are left to speculate as to the applicable law of indemnity. It is not clear that a voluntary guarantor can recover in every jurisdiction from the involuntary principal who has not requested the service. \n9\n But even if we assume that such a guarantor may recover upon an implied promise of reimbursement, the rule is not effective here. The statement of the case and the question certified show that the claim in bankruptcy of the Government is based upon the note, duly assigned to it after bankruptcy. As no proof was made of any claim for reimbursement, such a claim is not involved. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n The claim on the note, assigned to the United States subsequently to the maker's bankruptcy, has priority, if at all, by virtue of the general provisions of Section 3466, as recognized by Section 64(b)(7) of the Bankruptcy t. \n11\n\u00a0\n\n[307 \nU.S. 200, 206]\n\u00a0\n That subdivision granted priority ahead of dividends to creditors, to claims entitled to priority under the laws of the United States. Priority has been secured to the United States in varying language throughout its history. 12 The tendency has been to interpret these provisions liberally to secure the advantage sought by the Congress. \n13\n 'As this statute has reference to the public good, it ought to be liberally construed.' \n14\n It has been said that 'nothing else appearing' even claims under the railroad Federal Control Act, 40 Stat. 451, would be entitled to priority. \n15\n But this principle of construction is subject to the limitation that the generality of the language of the section is restricted by the purpose to grant priority to the United States, only, and by legislative intention, as shown by other statutes. Consequently priority was refused to corporations wholly owned by the United States16 and to the Director General of Railroads because \n\n[307 \nU.S. 200, 207]\n\u00a0\n section 10 of the Federal Control Act manifested an intention that the carriers under federal control should be treated as before their transfer to federal operation. \n17\n The United States itself when it sought priority for its loans under the Transportation Act was denied the benefits of Section 3466 because the intention to build up the credit standing of the railroads was inconsistent with the claimed priority. \n18\n\u00a0\n\n We are of the view that Section 3466 is inapplicable to general claims in bankruptcy transferred to the United States, or to which it has become subrogated on payment, after the filing of the petition for the reason that the rights of creditors are fixed by the Bankruptcy Act as of the filing of the petition in bankruptcy. This is true both as to the bankrupt and among themselves. \n19\n The assets at that time are segregated for the benefit of creditors. \n20\n The transfer of the assets to someone for application to 'the debts of the insolvent, as the rights \n\n[307 \nU.S. 200, 208]\n\u00a0\n and priorities of creditors may be made to appear,'21 takes place as of that time.\n The question certified should therefore be answered in the negative.\n It is so ordered.\n Question answered.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice DOUGLAS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Sec. 2.

MIDSTATE HORTICULTURAL CO., INC.(1939)\nNo. 286\nArgued: Decided: January 30, 1939\n\n\n\n Appeals from the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 161, 162]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Wendell Berge, of Washington, D.C., for appellant.\n Mr. Francis Biddle, of Philadelphia, Pa., for appellee Pennsylvania R. Co.\n Messrs. Henry Silverman, of New York City, and Samuel L. Einhorn, of Philadelphia, Pa. (Messrs. Samuel Hassen and David Siskind, all of New York City, on the brief), for appellees Midstate Horticultural Co.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These two appeals present for review a single question. As stated by appellant the sole question in each appeal is 'whether or not the indictment charges the commission of an offense against the United States in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, as it must, if appellees are to be prosecuted therein. Constitution, Article 3, Section 2, Clause 3; Amendment VI.' \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[306 \nU.S. 161, 163]\n\u00a0\n The defendant in No. 287 was indicted in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania charged with making unlawful rebates on interstate shipments. Defendants in No. 286 were charged, by indictment in the same District, with receiving the unlawful rebates. The District Court sustained demurrers to both indictments. The government appealed directly to this Court. Appellees moved here to dismiss the appeals on identical grounds. The motions to dismiss are denied in both cases. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The record requires that we treat the indictments to which demurrers were sustained as charging that rebates or concessions were paid and received in New York in 1935 in connection with the transportation of goods in 1932 from California through the Eastern District of \n\n[306 \nU.S. 161, 164]\n\u00a0\n Pennsylvania to New Jersey; that the full lawful rate in accordance with published tariffs was paid when the transportation took place; and that prior to the time of the payment and receipt of the alleged rebates in New York in 1935 the carrier and shippers had neither agreed nor intended that any rebate or concession should be made. The government concedes that the jurisdictional provisions of the Elkins Act,3 on which the prosecutions are based, require trial in the District in which a violation of the Act is committed, but contends that the record discloses violations actually committed in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. This contention rests upon the argument that the Elkins Act aims primarily to prevent the result of obtaining transportation at less than the lawful rate; that payment and receipt of rebates in 1935 served to accomplish such forbidden results- namely, transportation in 1932 at less than the lawful rate; and, since the transportation in 1932 passed through the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, the offenses were committed and are punishable there.\n The statute defines offenses under it as follows: '... it shall be unlawful for any person, persons, or corporation to offer, grant, or give, or to solicit, accept, or receive any rebate, concession, or discrimination in respect to the transportation of any property in interstate ... commerce by any common carrier ... whereby any such property shall be any device whatever be transported at a less rate than that named in the tariffs published and filed by such carrier, ....' As to venue the statute provides: 'Every violation of this section shall be prosecuted in any court of the United States having jurisdiction of crimes within the district in which such violation was committed, or through which the transportation may have been conducted; and whenever the offense is be \n\n[306 \nU.S. 161, 165]\n\u00a0\n gun in one jurisdiction and completed in another it may be dealt with, inquired of, tried, determined, and punished in either jurisdiction in the same manner as if the offense had been actually and wholly committed therein.'\n We need not determine whether Congress intended-by providing for the trial of crimes 'within the district ... through which the transportation may have been conducted'-to confer jurisdiction in any District wherein a violation was not committed. The Government only insists that the indictments here disclose offenses committed in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and urges that the provision for trial in any District through which illegal transportation is conducted is without meaning unless applicable to these prosecutions.\n But there are many offenses in the Act of which this provision is a part to which the provision is clearly applicable. An illustration is that provided in the case of Armour Packing Co. v. United States, \n209 \nU.S. 56\n, 28 S.Ct. 428. There an unlawful concession was given in the State of Kansas before interstate shipment was made. Transportation passed through the State of Missouri. The recipient of the concession was tried in Missouri. It was decided that the transaction constituted a continuing offense beginning in Kansas, and that the defendant could be tried in any District through which the unlawful transportation took place. The Court said (at page 76, 28 S.Ct. at page 433): 'We think the doctrine (of continuing offenses) ... applies in the present case, for transportation is an essential element of the offense, and, as we have said, transportation equally takes place over any and all of the traveled route, and during transportation the crime is being constantly committed.' ( Italics supplied.)\n The Section of the Elkins Act under which the present indictments were drawn describes other offenses and, in addition, makes it a misdemeanor for a carrier to violate any of the numerous criminal provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 161, 166]\n\u00a0\n Congress evidently intended to make it clear that as to any of the many offenses in which 'during transportation the crime is being constantly committed' prosecution could be had in any District through which the unlawful transportation moves.\n We do not believe Congress intended that subsequent conduct or events should stamp criminality upon an act that was lawful, and wholly unrelated to any unlawful plan or purpose, when done. Here, the full lawful rate was paid for the transportation involved. The lawful transportation through the Eastern District of Pennsylvania was not infected by relation to any unlawful agreement, purpose or intent at the time it occurred. The record shows no offense that began in 1932 and continued until 1935. As was clearly set forth by the Circuit Court of Appeals in the Armour Packing Co. Case:4 'A continuing offense is a continuous, unlawful act or series of acts set on foot by a single impulse and operated by an unintermittent force, however long a time it may occupy. Where such an act or series of acts runs through several jurisdictions, the offense is committed and cognizable in each. ... The transportation of the goods in this case into and through the Western district of Missouri, at the illegal through rate, was the continuing operation and effect in that district of its primary cause, the receipt of the concession and the delivery of the oil by the shipper to the carrier thereunder for transportation in foreign commerce, and even if the shipper's offense was complete in Kansas, it may have been committed in Missouri also, where its operation continued and took effect.' (Italics supplied.)\n The legal transportation of goods at a lawful rate through the Eastern District of Pennsylvania without intent, purpose, or agreement to commit any part of a crime \n\n[306 \nU.S. 161, 167]\n\u00a0\n did not give the District Court of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania jurisdiction to try these defendants under the Elkins Act. On this record no violation of the Elkins Act was begun, continued or brought about5 in that District. The demurrers were properly sustained and the judgments are\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Article 3, Section 2, Clause 3 of the Constitution, U.S.C.A. provides: 'The Trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury; and such Trial shall be held in the State where the said Crime shall have been committed; but when not committed within any State, the Trial shall be at such Place or Places as the Congress may by Law have directed.' Amendment 6 of the Constitution, U.S.C.A. so far as pertinent provides: 'In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, ....' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The first ground of the motions to dismiss is that appeal was not taken 'within thirty days after the decision or judgment' as required by 18 U.S.C., Section 682, 18 U.S.C.A.  682. The court below wrote an opinion in which it stated 'the demurrers are sustained,' and filed the opinion June 16, 1938. But in accordance with the court's practice, final order was not entered until July 2, 1938. In that order the court sustained the demurrers and ordered defendants discharged. The government petitioned for appeal July 20, 1938, within eighteen days after the final order was entered, but more than thirty days after the written opinion had been filed. The appeals were from the judgments and orders of July 2, and not the previous written opinion. The second ground of the motions to dismiss is that the government did not have a right of direct appeal to this Court granted by 18 U.S.C., Section 682, 18 U.S.C.A.  682, which authorizes such an appeal where judgment sustaining a demurrer 'is based upon the invalidity, or construction of the statute upon which the indictment is founded.' The statute under which the indictments were returned provides expressly for the jurisdiction over offenses created by it, and the record clearly discloses that the rulings on demurrers involved a construction of the statute. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] 49 U.S.C., Sec. 41(1), 34 Stat. 587, 49 U.S.C.A.  41(1). \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] 8 Cir., 153 F. 1, 5, 6, 14 L.R.A.,N.S., 400; Cf., United States v.

Also, it offends the inhibition of the Second Amendment to the Constitution, U.S.C.A.-'A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.' \n\n[307 \nU.S. 174, 177]\n\u00a0\n The District Court held that section 11 of the Act violates the Second Amendment. It accordingly sustained the demurrer and quashed the indictment.\n The cause is here by direct appeal.\n Considering Sonzinsky v. United States, 1937, \n300 \nU.S. 506, 513\n, 57 S. Ct. 554, and what was ruled in sundry causes aris- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 174, 178]\n\u00a0\n ing under the Harrison Narcotic Act2-United States v.

United States, 1928, \n276 \nU.S. 332\n, 48 S.Ct. 388-the objection that the Act usurps police power reserved to the States is plainly untenable.\n In the absence of any evidence tending to show that possession or use of a 'shotgun having a barrel of less than eighteen inches in length' at this time has some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia, we cannot say that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument. Certainly it is not within judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense. Aymette v. State of Tennessee, 2 Humph., Tenn., 154, 158.\n The Constitution as originally adopted granted to the Congress power- 'To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions; To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress.' U.S.C.A.Const. art. 1,  8. With obvious purpose to assure the continuation and render possible the effectiveness of such forces the declaration and guarantee of the Second Amendment were made. It must be interpreted and applied with that end in view.\n The Militia which the States were expected to maintain and train is set in contrast with Troops which they \n\n[307 \nU.S. 174, 179]\n\u00a0\n were forbidden to keep without the consent of Congress. The sentiment of the time strongly disfavored standing armies; the common view was that adequate defense of country and laws could be secured through the Militia- civilians primarily, soldiers on occasion.\n The signification attributed to the term Militia appears from the debates in the Convention, the history and legislation of Colonies and States, and the writings of approved commentators. These show plainly enough that the Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. 'A body of citizens enrolled for military discipline.' And further, that ordinarily when called for service these men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of the kind in common use at the time.\n Blackstone's Commentaries, Vol. 2, Ch. 13, p. 409 points out 'that king Alfred first settled a national militia in this kingdom' and traces the subsequent development and use of such forces.\n Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations, Book V. Ch. 1, contains an extended account of the Militia. It is there said: 'Men of republican principles have been jealous of a standing army as dangerous to liberty.' 'In a militia, the character of the labourer, artificer, or tradesman, predominates over that of the soldier: in a standing army, that of the soldier predominates over every other character; and in this distinction seems to consist the essential difference between those two different species of military force.'\n'The American Colonies In The 17th Century', Osgood, Vol. 1, ch. XIII, affirms in reference to the early system of defense in New England-\n\n'In all the colonies, as in England, the militia system was based on the principle of the assize of arms. This implied the general obligation of all adult male inhabitants to possess arms, and, with certain exceptions, to \n\n[307 \nU.S. 174, 180]\n\u00a0\n cooperate in the work of defence.' 'The possession of arms also implied the possession of ammunition, and the authorities paid quite as much attention to the latter as to the former.' 'A year later (1632) it was ordered that any single man who had not furnished himself with arms might be put out to service, and this became a permanent part of the legislation of the colony (Massachusetts).'\n\n Also 'Clauses intended to insure the possession of arms and ammunition by all who were subject to military service appear in all the important enactments concerning military affairs. Fines were the penalty for delinquency, whether of towns or individuals. According to the usage of the times, the infantry of Massachusetts consisted of pikemen and musketeers. The law, as enacted in 1649 and thereafter, provided that each of the former should be armed with a pike, corselet, head-piece, sword, and knapsack. The musketeer should carry a 'good fixed musket,' not under bastard musket bore, not less than three feet, nine inches, nor more than four feet three inches in length, a priming wire, scourer, and mould, a sword, rest, bandoleers, one pound of powder, twenty bullets, and two fathoms of match. The law also required that two-thirds of each company should be musketeers.'\n The General Court of Massachusetts, January Session 1784 (Laws and Resolves 1784, c. 55, pp. 140, 142), provided for the organization and government of the Militia. It directed that the Train Band should 'contain all able bodied men, from sixteen to forty years of age, and the Alarm List, all other men under sixty years of age, ....' Also, 'That every non-commissioned officer and private soldier of the said militia not under the controul of parents, masters or guardians, and being of sufficient ability therefor in the judgment of the Selectmen of the town in which he shall dwell, shall equip himself, and be constantly provided with a good fire arm, &c.'\n By an Act passed April 4, 1786 (Laws 1786, c. 25), the New York Legislature directed: 'That every able-bodied Male Person, be- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 174, 181]\n\u00a0\n ing a Citizen of this State, or of any of the United States, and residing in this State, (except such Persons as are herein after excepted) and who are of the Age of Sixteen, and under the Age of Forty-five Years, shall, by the Captain or commanding Officer of the Beat in which such Citizens shall reside, within four Months after the passing of this Act, be enrolled in the Company of such Beat. ... That every Citizen so enrolled and notified, shall, within three Months thereafter, provide himself, at his own Expense, with a good Musket or Firelock, a sufficient Bayonet and Belt, a Pouch with a Box therein to contain not less than Twenty-four Cartridges suited to the Bore of his Musket or Firelock, each Cartridge containing a proper Quantity of Powder and Ball, two spare Flints, a Blanket and Knapsack; ....'\n The General Assembly of Virginia, October, 1785 (12 Hening's Statutes c. 1, p. 9 et seq.), declared: 'The defense and safety of the commonwealth depend upon having its citizens properly armed and taught the knowledge of military duty.'\n It further provided for organization and control of the Militia and directed that 'All free male persons between the ages of eighteen and fifty years,' with certain exceptions, 'shall be inrolled or formed into companies.' 'There shall be a private muster of every company once in two months.'\n Also that 'Every officer and soldier shall appear at his respective muster-field on the day appointed, by eleven o'clock in the forenoon, armed, equipped, and accoutred, as follows: ... every non-commissioned officer and private with a good, clean musket carrying an ounce ball, and three feet eight inches long in the barrel, with a good bayonet and iron ramrod well fitted thereto, a cartridge box properly made, to contain and secure twenty cartridges fitted to his musket, a good knapsack and canteen, and moreover, each non-commissioned officer and private shall have at every muster one pound of good \n\n[307 \nU.S. 174, 182]\n\u00a0\n powder, and four pounds of lead, including twenty blind cartridges; and each serjeant shall have a pair of moulds fit to cast balls for their respective companies, to be purchased by the commanding officer out of the monies arising on delinquencies. Provided, That the militia of the counties westward of the Blue Ridge, and the counties below adjoining thereto, shall not be obliged to be armed with muskets, but may have good rifles with proper accoutrements, in lieu thereof. And every of the said officers, non-commissioned officers, and privates, shall constantly keep the aforesaid arms, accoutrements, and ammunition, ready to be produced whenever called for by his commanding officer. If any private shall make it appear to the satisfaction of the court hereafter to be appointed for trying delinquencies under this act that he is so poor that he cannot purchase the arms herein required, such court shall cause them to be purchased out of the money arising from delinquents.'\n Most if not all of the States have adopted provisions touching the right to keep and bear arms. Differences in the language employed in these have naturally led to somewhat variant conclusions concerning the scope of the right guaranteed. But none of them seem to afford any material support for the challenged ruling of the court below.\n In the margin some of the more important opinions and comments by writers are cited. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n[307 \nU.S. 174, 183]\n\u00a0\n We are unable to accept the conclusion of the court below and the challenged judgment must be reversed. The cause will be remanded for further proceedings.\n Reversed and remanded.\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS took no part in the consideration or decision of this cause. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act of June 26, 1934, c. 757, 48 Stat. 1236-1240, 26 U.S.C.A.  1132 et seq.:\n'That for the purposes of (sections 1132 to 1132q) this Act-\n\n'Sec. 1 (Section 1132).

On November 26, 1938, a similar action was filed in the same court against the Jetter Dairy Company, Inc. On December 2 these causes were consolidated. The original proceedings had sought relief not only for violations of the Order of the Secretary of Agriculture but also, if the court should find that the defendants or any of them were not subject to that Order, for violation of Official Order No. 126 issued by the Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets of the State of New York. The two orders are in pari materia, one covering milk moving in or directly burdening, obstructing or affecting interstate commerce and the other2 covering milk in intrastate commerce. Each defendant is a dealer handling milk moving in interstate commerce. On December 15, Holton V. Noyes, as Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets of the State of New York, was permitted to intervene as a party plaintiff in the consolidated action. He sought an injunction commanding the defendants and their representatives to comply with Order No. 126 or, should it be determined that their milk was not subject to this Order, to comply with the Order of the Secretary of Agriculture.\n In their answers, the defendants pleaded certain affirmative defenses, setting up the invalidity of Order No. 27 because of improper efforts to secure its adoption. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 533, 541]\n\u00a0\n Broadly speaking, these defenses were based upon erroneous representations alleged to have been made by officials and by certain private organizations to bring about the approval of the Order and upon an alleged conspiracy of the same private organizations to create a monopoly by means of the Order. The motion to strike these defenses having been overruled, the Dairymen's League Cooperative Association, hereinafter called the League, and the Metropolitan Cooperative Milk Producers Bargaining Agency, Inc., hereinafter called the Agency, were permitted to intervene to combat them.\n The answers also challenged the two orders and the Act as contrary to the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution, U.S.C.A., and the Act as involving improper delegation of legislative power. The Central New York Cooperative Association denied the power of the Congress to enact the legislation under the Commerce Clause and set up as a further defense that it was not subject to either order.\n After a hearing upon the merits, the District Court dismissed the complaints. The state order was eliminated from consideration on the understanding, not questioned here, that the milk of all four defendants is covered by the Federal Order, if valid. It was further held that Sections 8c(5)(B)(ii) and 8c(5)(F) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.A.  608c(5)(B)(ii ), (F), violate the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, that the Order is discriminatory and takes property without compensation, that approval of the producers was secured by unlawful misrepresentation and coercion and that important provisions of the Order, authorizing payments to cooperative and proprietary handlers, have no basis in the Act. United States v. Rock Royal Co-operative, D.C., 26 F.Supp. 534, 544, 545, 548, 550, 553. As the unconstitutionality of certain sections of an Act of Congress was one ground of the decision an appeal was allowed directly to this Court. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n[307 \nU.S. 533, 542]\n\u00a0\n The Statute. \n4\n The controversy revolves almost entirely around Order No. 27. Back of the Order is the statute under which it was issued, the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 which reenacted and amended certain provisions of the Agricultural Adjustment Act. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n[307 \nU.S. 533, 543]\n\u00a0\n As its name implies, it was aimed at assisting in the marketing of agricultural commodities.\n By Section 1, 7 U.S.C.A.  601, it is declared that 'the disruption of the orderly exchange of commodities in interstate commerce impairs\n_________ for fixing, minimum prices for each such use classification which all handlers shall pay, and the time when payments shall be made, for milk purchased from producers or associations of producers. Such prices shall be uniform as to all handlers, subject only to adjustments for (1) volume, market, and production differentials customarily applied by the handlers subject to such order, (2) the grade or quality of the milk purchased, and ( 3) the locations at which delivery of such milk, or any use classification thereof, is made to such handlers.\n'(B) Providing:\n\n'(ii) for the payment to all producers and associations of producers delivering milk to all handlers of uniform prices for all milk so delivered, irrespective of the uses made of such milk by the individual handler to whom it is delivered;\n\n subject, in either case, only to adjustments for (a) volume, market, and production differentials customarily applied by the handlers subject to such order, (b) the grade or quality of the milk delivered, (c) the locations at which delivery of such milk is made, and (d) a further adjustment, equitably to apportion the total value of the milk purchased by any handler, or by all handlers, among producers and associations of producers, on the basis of their marketings of milk during a representative period of time.\n'(C) In order to accomplish the purposes set forth in paragraphs (A) and (B) of this subsection (5), providing a method for making adjustments in payments, as among handlers (including producers who are also handlers), to the end that the total sums paid by each handler shall equal the value of the milk purchased by him at the prices fixed in accordance with paragraph (A) hereof.\n\n'(F) Nothing contained in this subsection (5) is intended or shall be construed to prevent a cooperative marketing association qualified under the provisions of the Act of Congress of February 18, 1922, as amended ( sections 451 to 457 of this title), known as the 'Capper-Volstead Act', engaged in making collective sales or marketing of milk or its products for the producers thereof, from blending the net proceeds of all of its sales in \n\n[307 \nU.S. 533, 544]\n\u00a0\n the purchasing power of farmers' thus destroying the value of agricultural assets to the detriment of the national public interest. This interference is declared to 'burden and obstruct the normal channels of interstate commerce.'\n\n__________ all markets in all use classifications, and making distribution thereof to its producers in accordance with the contract between the association and its producers: Provided, That it shall not sell milk or its products to any handler for use or consumption in any market at prices less than the prices fixed pursuant to paragraph (A) of this subsection (5) for such milk.\n'(G) No marketing agreement or order applicable to milk and its products in any marketing area shall prohibit or in any manner limit, in the case of the products of milk, the marketing in that area of any milk or product thereof produced in any production area in the United States.'\n\n (N.B. (6) relates to products other than milk.)\n\n\n (7)\n 'In the case of the agricultural commodities and the products thereof specified in subsection (2) orders shall contain one or more of the following terms and conditions:\n'(A) Prohibiting unfair methods of competition and unfair trade practices in the handling thereof.\n\n'(B) Providing that (except for milk and cream to be sold for consumption in fluid form) such commodity or product thereof, or any grade, size, or quality thereof shall be sold by the handlers thereof only at prices filed by such handlers in the manner provided in such order.\n\n'(C) Providing for the selection by the Secretary of Agriculture, or a method for the selection, of an agency or agencies and defining their powers and duties, which shall include only the powers:\n\n'(i) To administer such order in accordance with its terms and provisions;\n\n'(ii) To make rules and regulations to effectuate the terms and provisions of such order;\n\n'(iii) To receive, investigate, and report to the Secretary of Agriculture complaints of violations of such order; and\n\n'(iv) To recommend to the Secretary of Agriculture amendments to such order.\n\n No person acting as a member of an agency established pursuant to this paragraph (C) shall be deemed to be acting in an official \n\n[307 \nU.S. 533, 545]\n\u00a0\n By Section 2, 7 U.S.C.A.  602, it is declared to be the policy of Congress, through the exercise of the powers conferred upon the Secretary of Agriculture, 'to establish and maintain such orderly marketing conditions for agricultural commodities in interstate commerce as will establish prices to farmers at a level that will give agricultural commodities\n__________ capacity, within the meaning of section 10(g) of this title, unless such person receives compensation for his personal services from funds of the United States.\n'(D) Incidental to, and not inconsistent with, the terms and conditions specified in subsections (5), (6), and (7) and necessary to effectuate the other provisions of such order.'\n\n (18) 'The Secretary of Agriculture, prior to prescribing any term in any marketing agreement or order, or amendment thereto, relating to milk or its products, if such term is to fix minimum prices to be paid to producers or associations of producers, or prior to modifying the price fixed in any such term, shall ascertain, in accordance with section 2(602) and section 8e (608e of this title), the prices that will give such commodities a purchasing power equivalent to their purchasing power during the base period. The level of prices which it is declared to be the policy of Congress to establish in section 2(602) and section 8e (608e of this title) shall, for the purposes of such agreement, order, or amendment, be such level as will reflect the price of feeds, the available supplies of feeds, and other economic conditions which affect market supply and demand, for milk or its products in the marketing area to which the contemplated marketing agreement, order, or amendment relates. Whenever the Secretary finds, upon the basis of the evidence adduced at the hearing required by section 8b or 8c (608b of this title or this section), as the case may be, that the prices that will give such commodities a purchasing power equivalent to their purchasing power during the base period as determined pursuant to section 2(602) and section 8e (608e of this title) are not reasonable in view of the price of feeds, the available supplies of feeds, and other economic conditions which affect market supply and demand for milk and its products in the marketing area to which the contemplated agreement, order, or amendment relates, he shall fix such prices as he finds will reflect such factors, insure a sufficient quantity of pure and wholesome milk, and be in the public interest. Thereafter, as the Secretary finds necessary on account of changed circumstances, he shall, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, make adjustments in such prices.' 7 U.S.C.A.  608c (1-5, 7, 18). \n\n[307 \nU.S. 533, 546]\n\u00a0\n a purchasing power with respect to articles that farmers buy, equivalent to the purchasing power of agricultural commodities in the base period . ...'\n Under Section 2 of the Act, the base period for agricultural commodities, except tobacco and potatoes, is fixed at the pre-war period of August, 1909, to July, 1914. Where the purchasing power during the base period cannot be satisfactorily determined from available statistics within the Department of Agriculture, the Secretary is authorized to take as the base period from August, 1919, to July, 1929, or a portion thereof. Section 8e. In prescribing minimum prices for milk the statute authorizes the Secretary to fix minimum prices without restriction to the purchasing power during the base period so as to reflect the prices of available supplies of feed and other economic conditions, if he finds after a hearing that minimum prices with a base period purchasing power are unreasonable. Section 8c(18).\n Section 8a(6) gives jurisdiction to the district courts of the United States to enforce and to prevent and restrain any person from violating any of the orders, regulations or agreements under its provisions.\n Section 8b authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to enter into marketing agreements with the producers and others engaged in the handling of agricultural commodities in or affecting interstate commerce. These agreements may be for all agricultural commodities and their products, are entirely voluntary and may cover the handling of the commodity by any person engaged in the various operations of processing or distribution. Agreements are involved only incidentally in this proceeding.\n Section 8c provides for a use of orders, instead of agreements, in certain situations. These orders apply only to specified commodities, including milk. 6 They are to be entered only when the Secretary of Agriculture has rea- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 533, 547]\n\u00a0\n son to believe that the issuance of an order will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act with respect to any commodity or product thereof, and after notice and an opportunity for hearing. It is necessary also for the Secretary of Agriculture to set forth in such order a finding upon the evidence introduced at the hearing that the issuance of the Order and of the terms and conditions thereof will tend to effectuate the declared policy. \n7\n When, as here, the commodity is milk, the Act requires8 that the Order contain one or more of terms specified in Section 8c(5) and no others, except certain terms common to all orders and set out in Section 8c(7). These terms, as used in the Order under examination, will be referred to later. Orders may only be issued9 after hearing upon a marketing agreement which regulates the handling of the commodity in the same manner as the order. Without special determination of the Secretary of Agriculture and approval of the President, orders are not to become effective unless approved by handlers as required by the Act. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n Notwithstanding the refusal or failure of handlers to sign a marketing agreement relating to such commodity, the Secretary of Agriculture, with the approval of the President, may issue an order without the adoption of an agreement if he determines that the refusal or failure of the handlers to sign a marketing agreement tends to prevent the effectuation of the declared policy with respect to the commodity and that the issuance of the order is the only practical means of advancing the interest of the producers. In such a case the order must be approved or favored by two-thirds of the producers in number or volume who have been engaged, during a representative period, in the production for market of the \n\n[307 \nU.S. 533, 548]\n\u00a0\n commodity within the production area or two-thirds of those engaged in the production of the commodity for sale in the marketing area specified in the marketing agreement or order. Section 8c(9). Section 8c(19) authorizes a referendum to determine whether the issuance of the order is approved by the producers. Section 8c(12) provides that the Secretary shall consider the approval or disapproval by any cooperative association as the approval or disapproval of the producers who are members, stockholders or patrons of the cooperative association.\n Section 8c(15) provides for administrative review by the Secretary on petition of a handler objecting to any provision as not in accordance with law and seeking a modification or exemption therefrom. By (15)(B) the district courts have jurisdiction to review such ruling.\n The Problem.-In accordance with the provisions of the Act the Secretary of Agriculture, before promulgating Order No. 27, conducted public hearings attended by handlers, producers and consumers of milk and their representatives throughout the milkshed. No defendant, however, was represented. These hearings followed the presentation by the Agency to the Secretary and to the Commissioner of a proposed marketing agreement and order regulating the handling of milk in the New York marketing area with a request for action under the Federal and New York statutes. The hearings were jointly held by the Federal and state governments. The cooperation of the two governments was the culmination of a course of investigation and legislation which had continued over many years. The problem from the standpoint of New York was fully considered and the results set out in the Report of 1933 of the Joint Legislative Committee to Investigate the Milk Industry. This investigation was followed by the creation of the Milk Control Board with broad powers to regulate the dairy business of the state. This board had power to fix prices to \n\n[307 \nU.S. 533, 549]\n\u00a0\n be paid to purchasers and to be charged to consumers. \n11\n A later New York act, the Rogers-Allen Act,12 authorized the state commissioner to cooperate with the Federal authorities acting under the present Marketing Agreement Act, and to issue orders supplementary to those of the Federal Government to be carried out under joint administration.\n The problems concerned with the maintenance and distribution of an adequate supply of milk in metropolitan centers are well understood by producers and handlers. In the milkshed and marketing area of metropolitan New York these problems are peculiarly acute. \n13\n It is generally recognized that the chief cause of fluctuating prices and supplies is the existence of a normal surplus which is necessary to furnish an adequate amount for peak periods of consumption. This results in an excess of production during the troughs of demand. As milk is highly perishable, a fertile field for the growth of bacteria, and yet an essential item of diet, it is most desirable to have an equate production under close sanitary supervision to meet the constantly varying needs. The sale of milk in metropolitan New York is ringed around with requirements of the health departments to assure the purity of the supply. Only farms with equipment approved by the health authorities of the marketing area and operated in accordance with their requirements are permitted to market their milk. More than sixty thousand dairies located in the states of New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Vermont hold certificates \n\n[307 \nU.S. 533, 550]\n\u00a0\n of inspection and approval from the Department of Health of the City of New York. More than five hundred receiving plants similarly scattered have been approved for the receiving and shipping of grades A and B milk. Since all milk produced cannot find a ready market as fluid milk in flush periods, the surplus must move into cream, butter, cheese, milk powder and other more or less nonperishable products. Since these manufactures are in competition with all similar dairy products, the prices for the milk absorbed into manufacturing processes must necessarily meet the competition of low-cost production areas far removed from the metropolitan centers. The market for fluid milk for use as a food beverage is the most profitable to the producer. Consequently, all producers strive for the fluid milk market. It is obvious that the marketing of fluid milk in New York has contacts at least with the entire national dairy industry. The approval of dairies by the Department of Health of New York City, as a condition for the sale of their fluid milk in the metropolitan area, isolates from this general competition a well recognized segment of the entire industry. Since these producers are numerous enough to keep up a volume of fluid milk for New York distribution beyond ordinary requirements, cut-throat competition even among them would threaten the quality and in the end the quantity of fluid milk deemed suitable for New York consumption. Students of the problem generally have apparently recognized a fair division among producers of the fluid milk market and utilization of the rest of the available supply in other dairy staples as an appropriate method of attack for its solution. Order No. 27 was an attempt to make effective such as arrangement under the authority of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 533, 551]\n\u00a0\n Order No. 27.14 The Secretary of Agriculture found that two-thirds of the milk produced for the New York marketing area actually moves in interstate commerce and that the remaining one-third produced within the \n\n[307 \nU.S. 533, 552]\n\u00a0\n State of New York was 'physically and inextricably intermingled' with the interstate milk; that all was handled either in the current of interstate commerce or so as to affect, burden and obstruct such interstate commerce in\n__________\n'2. Subtract the total of payments required to be made for such month by section 5 of article VII and the total of payments claimed pursuant to section 6 of article VII;\n\n'3. Add the amount of cash in the producer settlement fund;\n\n'4. Divide the result by the total quantity of milk represented in the sum obtained pursuant to paragraph 1 of this section; and\n\n'5. Subtract not less than 4 cents nor more than 5 cents to provide against the contingency of errors in reports and payments or of delinquencies in payments by handlers. This result shall be known as the uniform price for such month for milk containing 3.5 percent butterfat received from producers at plants in the 201-210 mile zone.'\n\n Article VII, Section 1. 'Time of Payment.-On or before the 25th day of each month each handler which is not a co-operative association of producers shall make payment to each producer for all milk delivered by such producer at any plant during the preceding month at not less than the uniform price, subject to differentials set forth in sections 2 and 3 of this article.'\n Article VII, Sec. 2. 'Transportation and Location Differentials.-The uniform ice shall be plus or minus the differential shown in column B of the schedule contained in section 3 of article IV for the zone of the plant as established for the purposes of section 3 of article IV, plus 25 cents in the case of plants located in the counties listed in paragraph 8 of section 1 of article VI.'\n Article VII, Sec. 5. 'Payments to Cooperative Associations.-Any cooperative association of producers may apply to the Secretary for a determination of its qualifications to receive payments pursuant to this section by reason of its having and exercising full authority in the sale of the milk of its members, using its best efforts to supply, in times of short supply, Class I milk to the marketing area and to secure utilization of milk, in times of long supply, in a manner to assure the greatest possible returns to all producers, and having its entire activities under the control of its members. ... Such payments shall be made to each cooperative association of producers under the following conditions and at the following rates:\n'1. One cent per hundredweight of net pooled milk at any handler's plant which was caused to be delivered from its members \n\n[307 \nU.S. 533, 553]\n\u00a0\n milk and its products. An exception was made as to milk regulated by the order of the Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets of the State of New York. The Secretary further found that prices calculated in accordance with the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937\n\n\n\n __________ by such association and on which such handler has made the reports and payments required by this order.\n'2. Except as set forth in paragraph 3 of this section, 2 1\/2 cents per hundredweight of net pooled milk at plants of other handlers which was reported and collected for by such association.\n\n'3. Five cents per hundredweight of net pooled milk at plants operated by such association and, if, in addition to the other qualifications, such association has been determined by the Secretary to have sufficient plant capacity to receive all the milk of producers who are members and to be willing and able to receive milk from producers not members, 5 cents per hundredweight of any net pooled milk which was caused by it to be delivered to any other handler and which is reported and collected for by such association.\n\n'Sec. 6. Market Service Payment.-The market administrator shall pay out of the producer settlement fund to any handler immediately after audit of claim for such payment made on forms supplied by the market administrator:\n\n'1. With respect to milk received from producers at a plant operated by such handler equipped only for the receiving and shipping of milk to the marketing area, which was, during any month except November or December, moved to a plant where it was utilized in Classes II-A, II-B, III-A, III-B, III-C, III-D, or, during the month of October, IV-A, and from which, if operated by such handler, no Class I milk was shipped to the marketing area during such month, 23 cents per hundredweight of milk so moved, plus 4 cents per hundredweight for the first five miles or fraction thereof, plus 1\/4 cent per hundredweight per mile for the next 20 miles, and plus 1\/10th of 1 cent per hundredweight per additional mile, of the shortest highway distance between the two plants; and\n\n'2. Thirty cents per hundredweight of Class I milk sold during the months of November and December in the marketing area which was received from producers at a plant which is equipped for condensing or drying milk and from which, during the months of May and June preceding, in terms of equivalent of milk received at such plant, no milk in excess of 10 percent and no cream in excess of 50 percent was shipped to the marketing area.' \n\n[307 \nU.S. 533, 554]\n\u00a0\n to give this milk a purchasing power equivalent to the parities mentioned in Sections 2 and 8e of that Act were not reasonable in view of the supplies and prices of feeds and other economic conditions which affect the supply and demand for milk. He then fixed a minimum price for milk to be determined from time to time by formula.\n\n By the Order the marketing area is defined as the City of New York and the counties of Nassau, Suffolk and Westchester. A producer is any person producing milk delivered to a handler at a plant approved by a health authority for the receiving of milk for sale in the marketing area. A handler is a person engaged in the handling of milk or cream received at an approved plant for similar sale. 'Handler' includes cooperative associations. The administrative sections of the Order setting up a milk administrator and defining his duties are not attacked. Nor are those which classify milk.\n Article IV is important since it establishes minimum prices for milk. There are various differentials based upon use, butter fat content, and distances between the points of production and consumption which it is unnecessary to analyze. For the purposes of this opinion it is sufficient to say, as an example, that the minimum price each handler should pay for milk is fixed by a formula which varies with the butter-price range for 92- score butter at wholesale in the New York market during the 60 days preceding the 25th day of the preceding month. The handlers are required to file reports as to their receipts and utilization of milk of the various classes. It should be understood, however, that this minimum price is not the amount which the producer receives but the price level or so- called 'value' from which is calculated the actual amount in dollars and cents which he is to receive.\n By Article VI a uniform price is computed and it is this uniform price which the producer is actually paid by \n\n[307 \nU.S. 533, 555]\n\u00a0\n the proprietary (noncooperative) handlers. The uniform price is determined by a computation which in substance multiplies the amount of milk ( classified according to its use) received by all handlers, less certain quantities of milk permitted to be deducted, by the minimum prices fixed by Article IV for the different classes of milk. From the result various payments and reservations are deducted and the remainder is divided by the total quantity of milk received. To equalize, handlers pay into the producer settlement fund. While much over-simplified the operation will be made clear by summarizing the provisions of Article VII to require that handlers shall pay to the producer settlement fund the amount by which their purchased milk multiplied by the minimum prices for the various classes is greater than their purchased milk multiplied by the uniform price. When the handlers' purchased milk multiplied by the minimum prices is less than when it is multiplied by the uniform price, the producer settlement fund pays them the difference for distribution to their producers. These provisions give uniform prices to all producers, with exceptions to be herein stated, in accordance with the general use of milk for the preceding period.\n Other provisions of the Order upon which an attack is made will be pointed out in the discussion of the particular objections.\n Suspension of Order. It developed at the argument of the causes in this Court that the Secretary of Agriculture on March 18, 1939,15 had suspended Order No. 27 on account of the effect of the decree below on its administration and enforcement. Section 8c(16)(A). Since this suspension is authorized by the statute and the Order preserves accrued rights, we are of the opinion this step does not make these proceedings moot. Reports \n\n[307 \nU.S. 533, 556]\n\u00a0\n of their receipts and classified sales of milk, accounting of their pool obligations in the determination of the uniform price and settlement with their producers on the basis of the Order, as well as the payment of money, are sought from the defendants. The controversy over the validity of the Order and the power to enforce its provisions remains.\n Adoption of the Order. Before considering the validity of the Marketing Act and the provisions of the Order under attack, we shall examine the contention of the defendants that the Order was adopted under circumstances which require a court of equity to refuse to enforce it. After dealers had refused or failed to sign the proposed marketing agreement, the Secretary conducted a referendum under Section 8c(19) to ascertain whether the issuance of Order No. 27 was approved by two-thirds of the producers, as required by Section 8c(9). Vigorous campaigns were waged by both proponents and opponents of the Order. Among the proponents were the League and the Agency. After the vote, the Secretary on August 24, 1938, with the approval of the President, determined that the issuance of the Order was favored by at least two-thirds of the producers, and declared it effective as of September 1, 1938.16\n The defendants base their appeal to the conscience of the chancellor upon matters connected with the referendum which they claim amount to fraud in its adoption. The alleged fraud is said to consist of widespread public misrepresentations to the effect that all producers would receive the same price for their milk and a conspiracy between the League and others to convert the state and national acts into instruments for the creation of a monopoly in large handlers in the sale of fluid milk in the marketing area. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 533, 557]\n\u00a0\n The findings supporting the charges of misrepresentation and conspiracy may be summarized as determining that the intervening plaintiffs, the League and the Agency, participated actively in proposing, adopting and inducing both producers and handlers to accept the Order. In greater detail, the findings show that the League was instrumental in the organization of the Agency; that it has representatives upon the Agency's Board of Directors; that the Agency has acted as an organization for promoting action under both federal and state acts; that both League and Agency published papers which gave vigorous support to the campaign for approval of the order. At the time of the hearings the Agency issued an explanatory booklet stating that an equal purchasing price would be paid by all dealers for milk of the same use and that each producer would share equally the benefits of the fluid milk market. Both Agency and League announced repeatedly that handlers would be required to pay a uniform price and that no handler would receive a competitive advantage over the others. The Agency expended over $63,000 between December 1, 1937, and June 1, 1938, and over $45,000 between the latter date and September 1, 1938, the date the order went into effect, as it actively supported the Federal-state order program. Voting on the Order took place August 18, 19 and 20. Of 38,627 votes counted as valid in the referendum, 33,663 or 87.1 percent were in favor of the issuance of the Order, and 4,964 or 12.9 percent were opposed. Of the favorable votes, the League cast 22,287.\n Supporting evidence beyond the coordinated activities of the Agency, the League and other cooperatives for the charge of conspiracy to monopolize by securing the adoption of the Order was found by the District Court in the provisions of the Order. Competitive advantages to cooperatives in the Order were thought by it to indicate an improper influence by them in its drafting. These will \n\n[307 \nU.S. 533, 558]\n\u00a0\n be discussed later from the point of view of their legality under permissible classification. The court found that the conspiracy to obtain a monopoly was carried out by coercive tactics on the part of producers, under the leadership of the League and the Agency. These tactics consisted of threats to handlers that if they did not comply with the Order, the producers would withhold delivery of milk. These schemes, the lower court determined, were so successful in securing the drafting, adoption and acceptance of the Order that a conspiracy to monopolize interstate commerce contrary to the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, 15 U.S.C.A.  1-7, 15 note, was established. It held that the occurrence of the incidents just detailed compelled refusal of the injunction. We do not agree.\n While considering the manner of the adoption of the Order, the validity of the Act and the provisions of the Order must be assumed. The Order was submitted to the producers for approval after the hearings specified in the statute. The full text of the Order with explanatory pamphlets was mailed each prospective voter. In the face of this fact, erroneous statements cannot be permitted to render the submission futile. There is no evidence that any producer misunderstood. A casual sentence in one of the pamphlets of the Department of Agriculture and a number of other statements in publications of the League and Agency were to the effect that dealers would pay all producers the uniform price for milk. Such assertions need the qualifications given in the Order that they are not applicable to milk sold outside the marketing area or to milk handled by cooperatives. The variation from the facts is not immaterial in view of the value or volume of milk involved. But the Order, Article VII, plainly stated that cooperatives were not covered by the payment requirements and it appeared, also, that milk sold outside the marketing area was not \n\n[307 \nU.S. 533, 559]\n\u00a0\n within its terms. A study of the official form of the Order would have cleared up any misconception created by the language. The Secretary of Agriculture declared that three-fourths of the producers affected by the Order approved its terms. The litigants do not deny that three-fourths of the voters voted for the institution of the Order. There is no authority in the courts to go behind this conclusion of the Secretary to inquire into the influences which caused the producers to favor the resolution.\n The coercion by the League and the Agency, exercised upon the handlers after the adoption of the Order to force or induce them to acquiesce in its operation, is of the same indirect character as the alleged misrepresentation. It is the partisan coercion of the producer seeking to compel dealer support of the plan by the threat of the use of his economic power over his own milk. The coercion was ineffective upon these defendants. Producers' organizations urged in their papers and meetings diversion of milk from handlers to influence them to agree to the Order. Such efforts could not have had an effect on the prior vote of the producers. It is quite true that the League which itself cast two-thirds of the favorable votes was in a position to cast more than one-third of the total qualified vote against the Order. This arises from the provision of the Act, authorizing cooperatives to express the approval or disapproval for l of their members or patrons. \n17\n This is not an unreasonable provision, as the cooperative is the marketing agency of those for whom it votes. If the power is in the Congress to put the order in effect, the manner of the demonstration of further approval is likewise under its control. These associations of producers of milk have a vital interest in the establishment of an efficient marketing system. This ade- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 533, 560]\n\u00a0\n quately explains their interest in securing the adoption of an order believed by them to be favorable for this purpose. If ulterior motives of corporate aggrandizement stimulated their activities, their efforts were not thereby rendered unlawful. \n18\n If the Act and Order are otherwise valid, the fact that their effect would be to give cooperatives a monopoly of the market would not violate the Sherman Act or justify the refusal of the injunction.\n Correlation of Order and Act. There is another phase of the argument against the Order which is not affected by the validity of the Act or its application in the Order and therefore is ready for disposition before the constitutional questions need be reached. Defendants contend there is no statutory basis for the sections of the Order exempting cooperatives from the payment of the uniform price19 and authorizing payments to them and certain handlers from the producer settlement fund. \n20\n\u00a0\n\n The Government makes the point that none of the defendants, all handlers, can object to these terms of the Order because only producers delivering milk to cooperatives are affected by the exemption of cooperative handlers from the requirement to pay at not less than the uniform price and only producers are affected by the use of the pooled money for Sections 5 and 6 payments to cooperative and other handlers. Although three of the defendants cannot complain of the benefits conferred upon cooperatives, for they are cooperatives, the defendant Jetter Dairy Company has standing to raise the issue of want of statutory authority to except cooperative handlers from the payment of the uniform price. It is a proprietary corporation, a handler of milk, required by the Order \n\n[307 \nU.S. 533, 561]\n\u00a0\n to pay uniform prices for the milk it purchases. 21 This requirement to pay uniform prices arises from the provisions of Article IV that it shall pay minimum prices. The two are the same except for the deduction of certain service payments. The cooperatives are excepted from the payment. The burden of payment is laid directly upon Jetter while others are excepted. None of the defendants, on the other hand, is in a position to raise the issue of lack of statutory authority for the payments authorized by Article VII, Sections 5 and 6. Whether cooperative or not, the defendant corporations have no financial interest in the producer settlement fund. All defendants pay into, or draw out of, that fund in accordance with their utilization of the milk delivered to them by their patrons. The defendants' profit or loss depends upon the spread each receives between the class price and sale price. If the deductions from the fund are small or nothing, the patron receives a higher uniform price but the handler is not affected. \n22\n\u00a0\n\n We now consider whether the Act authorizes the exception of the cooperatives from the uniform payment provisions of Article VII, Section 1. This authority, if it exists, is in Section 8c(5)(F) of the Act. The earlier paragraphs provide for minimum prices to be paid by handlers to producers and associations of producers, subject to usual quality and location differentials not important here. These would require minimum prices to be paid by cooperatives when, as here, they were handlers under the definition of the Order,23 were it not for the exception of \n\n[307 \nU.S. 533, 562]\n\u00a0\n these same cooperatives under subsection (F): 'Nothing ... shall ... prevent a cooperative ... from ... making distribution thereof (net proceeds) ... in accordance with the contract between the association and its producers.' This language specifically permits, indeed requires, the Order to except cooperatives from the requirement of paying minimum prices to producers. As the minimum price is paid to the producer through the payment of the uniform price, after equalization in the pool, there is authority in the Act to except the cooperative from the payment of the uniform price.\n I. Terms of the Order.\n Certain provisions of the Order were found by the District Court to show unconstitutional discrimination against one or more of the defendants. The discriminations of which complaint is made arise from the application to the New York problem of Section 8c(5) of the Act relating to milk.\n A. Uniform Price. The Jetter Dairy Company, a proprietary handler, urges that as milk cooperatives need not pay producers a uniform price, it is unreasonably discriminatory and violative of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment to require it to pay this uniform price. In Section 8c( 5)(F) there is a definition of the type of cooperative permitted to settle with its members in accordance with the membership contract. The general characteristics of cooperatives are well understood. The Capper-Volstead Act defines such cooperatives as associations of producers, corporate or otherwise, with or without capital stock, marketing their product for the mutual benefit of the members as producers with equal voting privileges, restricted dividends on capital employed and dealings limited to 50 percent non-member products. 24 Different \n\n[307 \nU.S. 533, 563]\n\u00a0\n treatment has been accorded marketing cooperatives by state and Federal legislation alike. \n25\n Indeed the Secretary is charged by this Act to 'accord such recognition and encouragement to producer-owned and producer- controlled cooperative associations as will be in harmony with the policy toward cooperative associations set forth in existing Acts of Congress, and as will tend to promote efficient methods of marketing and distribution.' \n26\n These agricultural cooperatives are the means by which farmers and stockmen enter to the processing and distribution of their crops and livestock. The distinctions between such cooperatives and business organizations have repeatedly been held to justify different treatment. \n27\n Frost \n\n[307 \nU.S. 533, 564]\n\u00a0\n v. Corporation Commission28 in fact recognized the validity of such classification. The Commission was enjoined from issuing a license for the operation of a cooperative cotton gin, under a proviso directing it to do so on petition of 100 citizens and taxpayers without the showing of public necessity required for other ginners. The applicant was organized for profit, though dividends were limited, and its membership was not confined to producers. The court thought the distinctions had no reasonable relation to the subject of the legislation, special opportunities for cooperatives. It was said the Court had 'no reason to doubt' that the classification was valid as applied to true cooperatives. \n29\n\u00a0\n\n The producer cooperative seeks to return to its members the largest possible portion of the dollar necessarily spent by the consumer for the product with deductions only for modest distribution costs, without profit to the membership cooperative and with limited profit to the stock cooperative. It is organized by producers for their mutual benefit. \n30\n For that reason, it may be assumed that it will seek to distribute the largest amounts to its patrons. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 533, 565]\n\u00a0\n The commodity handled by a cooperative corresponds for some purposes to the capital of a business corporation. Either may cut sale prices below cost, one as long as its members will deliver, the other as long as its assets permit. When proprietary corporations lower sales prices, they naturally seek to lower purchase prices. Their profit depends on spread. On the other hand, the cooperative cannot pass the reduction. All the selling price less expense is available for distribution to its patrons. As its own members bear the burden of price cutting, it was reasonable to exempt it from the payment of the fixed price. The cooperative member measures his return by the market or uniform price the business handler pays. In commodities with the wide market of staple dairy products, quotations are readily available. If distributions do not equal open prices, the cooperators' reactions would parallel those of stockholders of losing businesses. Neither the Act nor the Order protects anyone from lawful competition, nor is it essential that they should do so. 31 We do not find an unreasonable discrimination in excepting producers' cooperatives from the requirement to pay a uniform price.\n B. Unpriced Milk. Another discrimination is said to reside in that part of the Order which limits minimum prices to milk 'sold in the marketing area or which passes through a plant in the marketing area.' Other milk, though from the same production area, is 'unpriced milk' and does not figure in the computation of the uniform price. Where both priced and unpriced milk are dealt in by a handler, he must furnish a statement to the producer showing the percentage of his milk paid for at the uniform price. \n32\n The defendants handle only milk which is sold in the marketing area. They assert that an un- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 533, 566]\n\u00a0\n reasonable discrimination results in favor of handlers, such as the League, which market milk both in and outside the marketing area.\n The basis of the complaint is that large dealers and cooperative handlers with extensive gathering and distributing facilities are permitted to purchase milk throughout the milk shed at any price they please, if the milk does not pass through a plant in the marketing area, and sell it at any price they please, provided the sale is outside the limited New York marketing area. By reason of the fact that milk sells for more in New Jersey than in New York, a greater profit is made by the handler. If he so desires, the handler can use this profit to replace losses on New York area sales and still be in a position to pay the uniform price to producers on pool milk. This is said to create a discrimination against the defendants.\n It is possible for the handlers with unpriced milk to use their profits from the profitable extra area trade in the way suggested. It was equally possible for them to do so before the Order. It is a competitive situation which the Order did not create and with which it does not deal. We are of the view that there is no discrimination by reason of this situation.\n The District Court, 26 F.Supp. 534, found that handlers of unpriced milk 'are permitted to blend prices paid or purported to have been paid for such milk sold in other markets, with the uniform price announced by the Administrator for milk sold in the area, thereby reducing the actual price paid by such handlers, for milk sold in the Metropolitan Area, in competition with milk sold by the defendants.' 'If the price figured by the handler for unpriced milk, is lower than its actual market value, the handler, by blending, is thereby permitted to pay producers for all milk at less than the Order price, and less than the actual value thereof.' It is erroneous to suppose that by buying some milk at less than the minimum, the \n\n[307 \nU.S. 533, 567]\n\u00a0\n 'actual price' paid for milk sold in the marketing area is reduced. The price paid for all milk sold by proprietary handlers in that area is the uniform price. Unpriced milk from the same producer may be bought for less. The average paid the producer may be below the minimum but for the part sold in the marketing area or passing through plants there located the minimum is paid. This is all that justifies the language of the finding that 'the handler, by blending, is thereby permitted to pay producers for all milk at less than the Order price. ...'\n c. Nearby Differentials. Provision is made by the Order for special differentials of 20 cents on milk from certain counties located most favorably to the marketing area. \n33\n This is to enable handlers to pay the producers at these plants. \n34\n The five cent difference is absorbed by the handlers. The Act authorizes such an arrangement. 8c(5)(A). This was found discriminatory as between producers by the District Court but there was no finding or conclusion of law as to any discrimination against defendants. The District Court was of the opinion this was unfair to these defendants who have no patrons in these counties. Here the defendants urge further advantages from this arrangement to their competitors who have patrons in these counties because near locations, freight differentials considered, have lower transportation costs. The differential increases milk prices to the producers. This payment tends to stimulate production. Larger production means more benefit from the freight advantage to competitors. The discrimination seems fanciful and remote. It would not justify a court in overturning the Secretary's determination of the propriety of the differentials on evidence found by the lower court to be substantial. Such an administrative determination carries a presumption of the existence of a state \n\n[307 \nU.S. 533, 568]\n\u00a0\n of facts justifying the action far too strong to be overturned by such suggestions as are made here. \n35\n\u00a0\n\n II. Constitutionality of the Act.\n A. Minimum Prices. The Act authorizes and the Order undertakes the fixing of minimum prices for the purchase of milk 'in the current of interstate or foreign commerce, or which directly burdens, obstructs, or affects, interstate or foreign commerce' in milk. \n36\n There is no challenge to the fact that the milk of all four defendants reaches the marketing area through the channels of interstate commerce. Nor is any question raised as to the power of the Congress to regulate the distribution in the area of the wholly intrastate milk. It is recognized that the Federal authority covers the sales of this milk, as its marketing is inextricably intermingled with and directly affects the marketing in the area of the milk which moves across state lines. \n37\n\u00a0\n\n The challenge is to the regulation 'of the price to be paid upon the sale by a dairy farmer who delivers his milk to some country plant.' It is urged that the sale, a local transaction, is fully completed before any interstate commerce begins and that the attempt to fix the price or other elements of that incident violates the Tenth Amendment, U.S.C.A.Const. But where commodities are bought for use beyond state lines, the sale is a part of interstate com- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 533, 569]\n\u00a0\n merce. \n38\n We have likewise held that where sales for interstate transportation were commingled with intrastate transactions, the existence of the local activity did not interfere with the Federal power to regulate inspection of the whole. \n39\n Activities conducted within state lines do not by this fact alone escape the sweep of the Commerce Clause. Interstate commerce may be dependent upon them. \n40\n Power to establish quotas for interstate marketing gives power to name quotas for that which is to be left within the state of production. \n41\n Where local and foreign milk alike are drawn into a general plan for protecting the interstate commerce in the commodity from the interferences, burdens and obstructions, arising from excessive surplus and the social and sanitary evils of low values, the power of the Congress extends also to the local sales.\n This power over commerce when it exists is complete and perfect. \n42\n It has been exercised to fix a wage scale for a limited period,43 railroad tariffs44 and fees and charges for live-stock exchanges. \n45\n\u00a0\n\n The authority of the Federal government over interstate commerce does not differ in extent or character from that retained by the states over intrastate com- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 533, 570]\n\u00a0\n merce. Since Munn v. Illinois, this Court has had occasion repeatedly to give consideration to the action of states in regulating prices. \n46\n Recently, upon a reexamination of the grounds of state power over prices, that power was phrased by this Court to mean that 'upon proper occasion and by appropriate measures the state may regulate a business in any of its aspects, including the prices to be charged for the products or commodities it sells.' \n 47\n\u00a0\n\n The power of a state to fix the price of milk has been adjudicated by this Court. \n48\n The people of great cities depend largely upon an adequate supply of pure fresh milk. So essential is it for health that the consumer has been willing to forego unrestricted competition from low cost territory to be assured of the producer's compliance with sanitary requirements, as enforced by the municipal health authorities. It belongs to that category of commodities that for many years has been subjected to the regulatory power of the state. A thorough exposition of the milk situation in the New York shed was made in the Nebbia case. There is nothing to add to what was there said, save to point out that since that decision, we have held that a state cannot prohibit the sale of imported milk where the extra-state purchase price was below the prescribed minimum 49 and that a Pennsylvania regulatory \n\n[307 \nU.S. 533, 571]\n\u00a0\n law, including minimum prices, plied in the absence of Federal legislation to milk purchased in Pennsylvania for shipment into the New York marketing area.50. In Hegeman Farms Corp. v. Baldwin,51 this Court sustained again the New York Milk Control Statute against the complaint that the price limits were arbitrary. A variation in prices to be charged the consumer between dealers who had and dealers who had not well advertised trade names was upheld. \n52\n The power enjoyed by the states to regulate the prices for handling and selling commodities within their internal commerce53 rests with the Congress in the commerce between the states.\n B. Equalization Pool. In order to equalize the prices received by producers, handlers are required to clear their purchases through the producer settlement fund. Payments into and withdrawals from this fund depend upon the 'value' of the milk received which is fixed by the Order at different prices governed by the use made by the handler of the purchased milk and upon whether his obligations to producers are greater or less than the uniform price due the producers under the scheme. The result of the use of the device of an equalization pool is that each producer, dealing with a proprietary handler, gets a uniform or weighted average price for his milk, with differentials for quality, location or other usual market variations, irrespective of the manner of its use. The Act, Section 8c(5)(B)(ii) and (C), and the Order, Articles IV, VI and VII, authorize such an adjustment.\n The defendants' objection to the equalization pool, here considered, is not to the disbursements from the fund for expenses of standby or marketing services \n\n[307 \nU.S. 533, 572]\n\u00a0\n authorized by Article VII, Sections 5 and 6, concerning which we hold the handler has no standing to complain. It is to the alleged deprivation of liberty and property accomplished by the pooling requirement in taking away from the defendants their right to acquire milk from their patrons at the minimum class price, according to its use, and forcing the handlers to pay their surplus, over the uniform price, to the equalization pool instead of to their patrons. This argument assumes the validity of price regulation, as such, but denies the constitutionality of the pooling arrangement because handlers are not at liberty to pay the producer in accordance with the use of the producer's milk but must distribute the surplus to others whose milk was resold less advantageously. It is urged that to carry this principle of contribution to its logical conclusion would mean that the wages of the employed should be shared with the unemployed; the highly paid, with the underpaid and the receipts of the able, the fortunate and the diligent, with the incompetent, the unlucky and the drone.\n No such exaggerated equalization of wealth and opportunity is proposed. The pool is only a device reasonably adapted to allow regulation of the interstate market upon terms which minimize the results of the restrictions. It is ancillary to the price regulation, designed, as is the price provision, to foster, protect and encourage interstate commerce by smoothing out the difficulties of the surplus and cut-throat competition which burdened this marketing. In Mulford v. Smith,54 we made it clear that volume of commodity movement might be controlled or discouraged. As the Congress would have, clearly, the right to permit only limited amounts of milk to move in interstate commerce, we are of the opinion it might permit the movement on terms of pool settlement here provided. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 533, 573]\n\u00a0\n Common funds for equalizing risks are not unknown and have not been considered violative of due process. The pooling principle was upheld in workmen's compensation,55 bank deposit insurance,56 and distribution of benefits in the Transportation Act. \n57\n\u00a0\n\n The defendants rely particularly upon Thompson v. Consolidated Gas Utilities Corp.,58 and Railroad Retirement Board v. Alton. \n59\n In the Thompson case, the Texas Railroad Commission ordered proration of gas production in the Panhandle. It was assumed that proration to prevent waste and protect correlative rights in a pool was valid but it was held that the proration order in issue was for none of these purposes. It was for the 'sole purpose ... to compel those (with market outlets) ... to purchase gas from potential producers' who have no market. This was not deemed to be reasonably related to the conservation of gas or the protection of correlative rights. In the Retirement Board case, the pooling principle was involved but was found to be invalid because the burdens on the roads were not equalized with the benefits. Entry on service was made at different age levels for different roads. Employees seventy or older were required to retire. Some roads had none. Solvent and insolvent roads were liable alike. All carriers were treated as a single employer. It was these provisions, deemed unequal, which led to the conclusion that the manner of pooling of funds denied due process. In this case, the pooling has differentials to cover the variations of quality and location. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 533, 574]\n\u00a0\n C. Delegation. There are three issues of delegation presented: (1) the delegation of authority to the Secretary of Agriculture to establish marketing areas; (2) the delegation of authority to producers to approve a marketing order without an agreement of handlers; and (3) the delegation of authority to cooperatives to cast the votes of producer patrons.\n From the earliest days the Congress has been compelled to leave to the administrative officers of the Government authority to determine facts which were to put legislation into effect and the details of regulations which would implement the more general enactments. It is well settled, therefore, that it is no argument against the constitutionality of an act to say that it delegates broad powers to executives to determine the details of any legislative scheme. This necessary authority has never been denied. \n60\n In dealing with legislation involving questions of economic adjustment, each enactment must be considered to determine whether it states the purpose which the Congress seeks to accomplish and the standards by which that purpose is to be worked out with sufficient exactness to enable those affected to understand these limits. Within these tests the Congress needs specify only so far as is reasonably practicable. \n61\n The present Act, we believe, satisfies these tests.\n\n 1. \nDelegation to the Secretary of Agriculture. The purpose of the Act is 'to establish and maintain such orderly marketing conditions for agricultural commodities in interstate commerce as will establish prices to \n\n[307 \nU.S. 533, 575]\n\u00a0\n farmers at a level that will give agricultural commodities a purchasing power with respect to articles that farmers buy, equivalent to the purchasing power of agricultural commodities in the base period.' To accomplish this, the Secretary of Agriculture is directed to issue orders, whenever he has reason to believe the issuance of an order will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the act. Unlike the language of the National Industrial Recovery Act condemned in the Schechter case, 295 U.S. page 538, 55 S.Ct. page 846, 97 A.L.R. 947, the tests here to determine the purpose and the powers dependent upon that conclusion are defined. In the Recovery Act the Declaration of Policy was couched in most general terms. \n62\n In this Act it is to restore parity prices, Section 2. Under the Recovery Act, general welfare might be sought through codes of any industry, formulated to express standards of fair competition for the businesses covered. Here the terms of orders are limited to the specific provisions, minutely set out in 8c(5) and (7). While considerable flexibility is provided by 8c(7)(D), \n\n[307 \nU.S. 533, 576]\n\u00a0\n it gives opportunity only to include provisions auxiliary to those definitely specified.\n The Secretary is not permitted freedom of choice as to the commodities which he may attempt to aid by an order. The Act, Section 8c(2 ), limits him to milk, fresh fruits except apples, tobacco, fresh vegetables, soybeans and naval stores. The Act authorizes a marketing agreement and order to be issued for such production or marketing regions or areas as are practicable. A city milkshed seems homogeneous. This standard of practicality is a limit on the power to issue orders. It determines when an order may be promulgated.\n It is further to be observed that the Order could not be and was not issued until after the hearing and findings as required by Section 8c(4). Public hearings were held at Albany, Malone, Syracuse, Elmira, and New York from May 16 to June 7, 1938, with four days' recess. Nearly three thousand pages of testimony were introduced, eighty-eight documentary exhibits and some twenty briefs by interested parties were filed. On July 23, 1938, the Secretary, in the Federal Register, notified the public of his findings and the terms of the Order and again invited comment. Numerous parties again filed briefs. A right by statute is given handlers to object to the Secretary to any provision of an order as not 'in accordance with law,' with the privilege of appeal to the courts. Section 8c(15)(A) and (B). Even though procedural safeguards cannot validate an unconstitutional delegation, they do furnish protection against an arbitrary use of properly delegated authority. \n63\n\u00a0\n\n A further provision of the Act is to be noted as it was employed as a standard to determine the minimum price. This is Section 8c(18). Acting under this section, the Secretary fixed a fluctuating minimum price based upon wholesale butter prices in New York. While it is true that the \n\n[307 \nU.S. 533, 577]\n\u00a0\n determination of price under this section has a less definite standard than the parity tests of Sections 2 and 8e, we cannot say that it is beyond the power of the Congress to leave this determination to a designated administrator, with the standards named. The Secretary must have first determined the prices in accordance with Section 2 and Section 8e, that is, the prices that will give the commodity a purchasing power equivalent to that of the base period, considering the price and supply of feed and other pertinent economic conditions affecting the milk market in the area. If he finds the price so determined unreasonable, it is to be fixed at a level which will reflect such factors, provide adequate quantities of wholesome milk and be in the public interest. This price cannot be determined by mathematical formula but the standards give ample indications of the various factors to be considered by the Secretary.\n\n 2. \nDelegation to Producers. Under Section 8c\n\n[307 \nU.S. 533, 9]\n\u00a0\n[B] of the Act it is provided that any order shall become effective notwithstanding the failure of 50 percent the handlers to approve a similar agreement, if the Secretary of Agriculture with the approval of the President determines, among other things, that the issuance of the order is approved by two- thirds of the producers interested or by interested producers of two- thirds of the volume produced for the market of the specified production area. By subsection (19) it is provided that for the purpose of ascertaining whether the issuance of such order is approved 'the Secretary may conduct a referendum among producers.' The objection is made that this is an unlawful delegation to producers of the legislative power to put an order into effect in a market. In considering this question, we must assume that the Congress had the power to put this Order into effect without the approval of anyone. Whether producer approval by election is \n\n[307 \nU.S. 533, 578]\n\u00a0\n necessary or not, a question we reserve, a requirement of such approval would not be an invalid delegation. \n64\n\u00a0\n\n\n 3. \nAuthorization of Cooperatives to Cast the Votes of Producer Patrons. This objection, too, falls before the answering argument that inasmuch as Congress could place the Order in effect without any vote, it is permissible for it to provide for approval or disapproval in such way or manner as it may choose.\n Cooperatives in the Equalization Fund. The defendant, Central New York Cooperative Association, denies liability under Articles VI, VII and VIII of the Order on the ground that it is not liable to pay its net pool obligation into the administrative fund or to meet the expenses of administration. The asserted reason for its freedom from liability is that it is a cooperative composed of milk producers and distributes the milk of its members and others as agent.\n The cooperative owns no farms. Its members are dairy farmers. By their contract they agree 'to deliver ... all ... milk produced ... which said milk is to be marketed and distributed by the (cooperative ) ....' The latter 'agrees to pay ... for the milk ... a price ... based upon the amount received ... less the expenses ....' Non- members' milk is marketed under the same contract. The cooperative leases receiving and distributing facilities from a business corporation. The milk is received by the cooperative at receiving plants and shipped to the city depot. It distributes through other business corporations which are wholly owned subsidiaries of the cooperative. These distributing subsidiaries use the leased physical facilities under verbal contracts with the cooperative. The cooperative receives the net amount from the sales and distributes to its patrons under license from the Director of the Division of \n\n[307 \nU.S. 533, 579]\n\u00a0\n Milk Control of New York permitting the marketing in the manner described.\n Section 8c(5)(A) authorizes an order to classify milk and fix minimum prices which all handlers shall pay for milk purchased from producers. Section 8c(5) (C) authorizes the equalization pool and the handlers' payment to this settlement fund. It is urged that cooperatives which merely act as agents for their members are not included in handlers purchasing from producers. This is said to be definitely shown by the provisions of 8c(5)(F) providing that nothing contained in the subsection shall be construed to prevent a Capper-Volstead cooperative from making distribution to its 'producers in accordance with the contract.' The Order defines a handler as including a cooperative association 'with respect to any milk received from producers at any plant operated by such association or with respect to any milk which it causes to be delivered' to other handlers. Under the provisions of the Order, Article VII, Sections 8 and 9, cooperative handlers as other handlers equalize their purchases by payment into the producer settlement fund, even though they are not required to pay the uniform price to their producers by reason of the exception of Article VII, Section 1, and the provisions of 8c(5)(F), as explained, 59 S. Ct. 1007, 83 L.Ed. --.\n Cooperative contracts are of two general types, sale and agency. \n65\n The Central New York Cooperative operates under the agency type.\n It is obvious that the use of the word 'purchased' in the Act, Section 8c(5) (A) and (C), would not exclude the 'sale' type of cooperative. When 8c(5)(F) was drawn, however, it was made to apply to both the 'sale' and 'agency' type without distinction. This would indicate there had been no intention to distinguish between the two types by (A) and (C). The section which au- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 533, 580]\n\u00a0\n thorizes all orders, Section 8c(1), makes no distinction. The orders are to be applicable to 'processors, associations of producers, and others engaged in the handling of commodities. The reports on the bill show no effort to differentiate. \n66\n Neither do the debates in Congress. The statutory provisions for equalization of the burdens of surplus would be rendered nugatory by the exception of 'agency' cooperatives. The administrative construction has been to include such organizations as handlers. \n67\n With this we agree. As here used the word 'purchased' means 'acquired for marketing.' Subsection (A) cannot be construed as freeing agents, cooperative or proprietary, from the requirement to account at the minimum prices for milk handled.\n As a corollary the contention is made also by Central Cooperative that no cooperative may be required to pay its surplus receipts over uniform prices into the equalization fund. This, too, is based upon a construction of Section 8c(5)(F) as permitting a cooperative to make settlement with its members in accordance with the terms of its own contract with them. If the cooperative members were freed of the burden of carrying their proportion of milk going to manufacturing use, the discrimination in their favor would be most strongly marked. Such a construction is not required. Cooperatives are covered by Section 8c(1) and (5)(A) and (B), and by the provisions of the Order, except as to the payment of the uniform price. Any payments below the uniform price fall on their members. We are of the view that the administrative construction is correct and that the 'net proceeds' of (F) refer to the result of the cooperative sales in the marketing area after complying with the equalization requirements. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 533, 581]\n\u00a0\n The defendant, Central New York Cooperative Association, raises for itself a final point. In determining the net pool obligation of any handler for milk received from producers,68 the handler is authorized to subtract pro rata t of each class from the milk involved in the pool 'the quantity of milk received from the handler's own farm.' We have determined that this cooperative, though marketing milk under an agency contract with its members, is a handler subject to the Act and Order. The cooperative argues that as its members, farmers, would not need to account to the pool for their personal sales to consumers, the cooperative, being utilized as an agent to market the farmers' milk, is under no obligation to contribute to equalization. As the cooperative does not have its own farm but is itself a handler under the Act, it must pay into the producer settlement fund.\n Inasmuch as all the defendants in these appeals are handling milk in interstate commerce, the petition for the enforcement of Official Order No. 126, issued under c. 383 of the Laws of 1937 of the State of New York, concerning milk not covered by Order No. 27 of the Secretary of Agriculture, should be dismissed.\n The order of the District Court in Nos. 771, 827 and 828 is reversed and the causes are remanded to that Court with instructions to enter an order specifically enforcing up to the time of suspension the provisions of Order No. 27, issued by the Secretary of Agriculture August 15, 1938, regulating the handling of milk in the New York marketing area, as to all the defendants and enjoining defendants, their officers, agents and servants, from further violation of the Order.\n The order of the District Court in dismissing the petition of Holton v. Noyes, as Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets of the State of New York, is affirmed.\n It is so ordered.\n Reversed and remanded in part, affirmed in part. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 533, 582]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Justice BLACK and Mr. Justice DOUGLAS concur in the judgment and opinion of the Court except insofar as the opinion appears to imply that power of Congress to enact the marketing law depends upon the use and nature of milk. They do not believe that we are called upon in this case to indicate, as they think we do, that there is such a constitutional limitation on the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice BUTLER, dissenting.\n We are of opinion that the decree below should be affirmed.\n In our view the challenged order of the Secretary must succumb to two manifest objections. It is unnecessary for us to dissect the record in search of other impediments.\n First. Congress possesses the powers delegated by the Constitution-no others. The opinion of this Court in Schechter Poultry Corporation v. United States, 1935, \n295 \nU.S. 495\n, 55 S.Ct. 837, 97 A.L.R. 947-noteworthy because of modernity and reaffirmation of ancient doctrine- sufficiently demonstrates the absence of Congressional authority to manage private business affairs under the transparent guise of regulating interstate commerce. True, production and distribution of milk are most important enterprises, not easy of wise execution; but so is breeding the cows, authors of the commodity; also, sowing and reaping the fodder which inspires them.\n Second. If perchance Congress possesses power to manage the milk business within the various states, authority so to do cannot be committed to another. A cursory examination of the statute shows clearly enough the design to allow a secretary to prescribe according to his own errant will and then to execute. This is not government by law but by caprice. Whimseys may displace deliber- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 533, 583]\n\u00a0\n ate action by chosen representatives and become rules of conduct. To us the outcome seems wholly incompatible with the system under which we are supposed to live.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS.\n In Nos. 772, 809 and 865 I have expressed my views as to the unconstitutionality of the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, 7 U.S.C.A.  601 et seq., here involved, in view of their attempted delegation of legislative powers. That matter is not pressed in the present cases and I need not here advert to the subject. I am of opinion, nevertheless, that Order No. 27 is not, in the respects to be discussed, authorized by the Act, but if it is authorized, deprives the appellees of their property without due process of law in violation of the Fifth Amendment, U.S.C.A.Const.\n This conclusion is based upon findings of fact of the District Court. While the findings in question are the subject of assignments of error, the appellants failed, either in brief or in oral argument, to point out that they lack substantial support in the evidence. Examination of the record discloses that these findings are based on uncontradicted testimony, authentic documentary evidence, and a stipulation of the parties. They should, therefore be accepted here. They may briefly be recapitulated.\n Under the terms of the Act and the order, all of the appellees are handlers and the Dairymen's League Cooperative Association, the appellant in No. 827, is likewise a handler. By Art. VII, Sec. 1, of the order, on or before the 25th day of each month, each handler which is not a cooperative association of producers is required to pay to each producer the uniform price fixed by the order for all milk delivered by the producer during the preceding month which was sold in the marketing area. The cooperative associations which are handlers are not required \n\n[307 \nU.S. 533, 584]\n\u00a0\n to make payment for similar milk at the uniform price or at any stated price. Art. VII, Sec. 8, requires all handlers, on or before the 18th day of each month, to pay to the market administrator for the Producer Settlement Fund 'the amount by which his net pool obligation for the preceding month is greater than the amount obtained by multiplying the net pool milk of such handler, by the uniform price.' Thus each handler is required to pay into the fund for all milk used in the marketing area the difference between $2.45 per cwt. and the uniform price for all Class I milk. Handlers selling milk received from producers in the production area, but marketed outside the marketing area, (denominated 'unpriced milk') are not required to pay a uniform price for such milk or to pay into the fund the difference between the uniform price and the actual market value of such milk, or any fixed amount in respect thereof. They are permitted to blend prices paid or purported to have been paid for unpriced milk with the uniform price announced by the Administrator for milk sold in the marketing area, thereby reducing the actual price paid by them for milk sold in the marketing area in competition with other handlers who sell milk only in that area. In a pamphlet issued by the Secretary, the provisions of the order are so construed and the method of accounting is described as follows:\n'Thus, the handler may multiply the total pounds of milk sold by it in the area by the uniform price; multiply the total pounds of milk sold in other markets and which is called 'unpriced milk' by 'such prices as it sees fit;' add the totals, and divide by the total pounds of milk, to obtain the average of 'blended' price paid producers for all milk. If the price figured by the handler for unpriced milk, is lower than its actual market value, the handler, by blending, is thereby permitted to pay producers for all milk at less than the Order price, and less than the actual value thereof.' \n\n[307 \nU.S. 533, 585]\n\u00a0\n The appellees' receiving stations in the production area supply the marketing area defined by the order. The appellee, Jetter Dairy Company, sells milk in competition with dealers operating milk receiving stations in the production area in New York, who ship milk received at their stations to the marketing area. Other appellees buy milk which is sold to independent dealers in competition with milk received at the other stations in the producing area. Several of the appellees' largest competitors, including the Dairymen's League Cooperative, sell large proportions of their milk outside the marketing area in northern New Jersey. The Milk Control Board of New Jersey fixed a base price of $2.76 per cwt. to producers for 3.5 milk f.o.b. country milk plants, which price was in effect during the period covered by the order. The same Board fixed wholesale prices from dealers to stores at eleven cents per quart, bottled in glass, in two rural districts, and twelve cents per quart, in glass, in three heavily populated districts, and fixed a minimum price to consumers out of stores in the two rural districts of twelve cents per quart and, in the more heavily populated districts, of thirteen cents per quart. No resale prices are fixed in the marketing area either from dealers to stores or from stores to consumers. The fair market value of 'unpriced' Class I milk produced in the production area, and sold by handlers in New Jersey, during the period the order was in force, was $2.76 per cwt.\n\n Whereas the uniform price for 3.5 milk fixed by the Administrator was, for September, $1.87, October, $1.91, and November, $2.10 per cwt., the Dairymen's League paid its producers a base price for the same milk, in the same zone, for September, $1.75, for October, $1.81, and, for November , $2.01 per cwt. Thus the difference between the value of Class I milk sold by the Dairymen's League in New Jersey, and the prices paid for the same to producers per cwt. was, in September $1.01, in Oc- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 533, 586]\n\u00a0\n tober, .95, and, in November, .75. $1.01 per cwt. on 10,208,500 pounds of milk sold in New Jersey by the Dairymen's League amounts to $103,105.85.\n Sheffield Farms Company, a competitor of the appellees, utilized, in September, 1938, 40,083,075 pounds of Class I milk in New York State and 6, 426,443 pounds of milk in New Jersey, as well as milk in other markets. For out of market or unpriced milk the company negotiated with its producers to pay the uniform order price for such out of market milk. The base price paid was, therefore, $1.87, or eighty-nine cents per cwt. less than the price fixed by the New Jersey Control Board. The difference amounted to $57,194.96, or 14.27 cents per cwt. on such milk and the price paid for Class I milk was reduced by that amount. Similar spreads are shown in the company's purchases for October, 1938.\n Based upon these facts, the court further finds that prices paid to producers delivering to handlers, whether cooperative or proprietary, which sell fluid milk in the marketing area, and also in the State of New Jersey and other markets, are less than the actual value of the milk delivered, due to the process of blending prices for milk sold outside of the marketing area, which bear no true relation to the actual value thereof, with prices charged for milk sold in the area.\n It is evident from the terms of the order, and the Secretary's construction of it, that handlers who use 'unpriced' milk may fix any price they choose to fix for it. Thus, contrary to the requirement of Section 8c(5)(A), of the statute, all producers do not receive a uniform price for milk. This is a necessary effect of the provision permitting the blending of the price paid producers for milk sold in the mar- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 533, 587]\n\u00a0\n keting area and an arbitrary price fixed for 'unpriced' milk. The effect upon a handler whose trade is solely in the marketing area is disastrous. The lower price paid by those who are permitted to blend makes it possible for them to resell the milk in the marketing area, in which no resale price is fixed, at a cut rate which is destructive of their competitors' business. And there is evidence that handlers, cooperative and proprietary, have taken advantage of the terms of the order to cut the price of milk to consumers in the marketing area to the disadvantage of their competitors.\n The appellants make no answer to the appellees' attack on this feature of the order. The opinion of this court states that the detriment to the smaller handlers who sell milk for use only in the marketing area is the result of competitive conditions which the order does not affect. But it is evident that the order freezes the minimum price which is to be paid by many handlers and leaves the price of other handlers who compete with them open to reduction by the device of blending.\n There is nothing in the Act which authorizes the discrimination worked by the order permitting handlers, whether proprietary or cooperative, to blend the prices of unpriced milk with that of milk, sold in the marketing area. Section 8c(5)(F), as I read it, prohibits such a practice by cooperatives. If the order had provided that milk sold in New Jersey should be accounted for to the pool at its actual value and had the milk so sold been accounted into the pool, competitors could not have obtained the advantage which so seriously injures the business of appellees. As the order is drawn and administered it inevitably tends to destroy the business of smaller handlers by placing them at the mercy of their larger competitors. I think no such arrangement was contemplated by the Act, but that, if it was, it operates to deny the appellees due process of law.\n I think that the decree should be affirmed.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE joins in this opinion so far as it relates to the invalidity of the order on the ground stated; Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice BUTLER also join in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act of June 3, 1937, 50 Stat. 246, 7 U.S.C.A.  601 et seq. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] As authorized by N.Y.Laws 1937, c. 383.

'Net Pool Obligation of Handlers.-The net pool obligation of any handler for milk received from producers during each month shall be a sum of money computed for such month as follows:\n'1. Determine the total quantity of milk in each class at each plant;\n\n'2. Subtract from the quantity of milk in each class the quantity of such milk received from other plants or from other handlers;\n\n'3. Subtract pro rata out of each class the quantity of milk received from the handler's own farm;\n\n'4. Subtract from the remaining quantity of milk in each class, the quantity of each to which the prices in section 1 of Article IV do not apply, which result shall be known as the 'net pooled milk' in each class;\n\n'5. Multiply the total quantity of net pooled milk in each class, at all plants of the handler combined, by the respective class prices set forth in section 1 of article IV and add together the resulting sums;\n\n'8. Deduct 20 cents per hundredweight for all net pooled milk received from producers at plants in the counties or portions of counties listed below in this section. The result thus obtained shall be known as the 'handler's net pool obligation.\"\n\n'Counties-New Jersey: Hunterdon, Somerset, Essex, Union, Morris, Warren, Sussex, Passaic.

NATIONAL BITUMINOUS COAL COMMISSION(1939)\nNo. 528\nArgued: January 3, 1939Decided: January 30, 1939\n\n\n\n\n[306 \nU.S. 56, 57]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. J. V. Norman and Robert E. Quirk, both of Washington, D.C., for petitioners.\n Robert H. Jackson, Sol. Gen., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioners are producers-engaged in the business of mining coal, and members of the 'Bituminous Coal Code',-that is 'producers accepting membership in the Code.' The National Bituminous Coal Commission, created by Act April 26, 1937, Ch. 127, 50 Stat. 72, 15 U.S.C.A.  828 et seq., purporting to proceed under section 10(a), 15 U.S.C.A.  840(a), on July 15, 1937 issued Order No. 15 which directed each producer of bituminous coal to file within fifteen days complete report showing for each mine detailed cost of tonnage produced and realization prices derived from sale, during 1936. This notice concluded-\n'The Commission directs specific attention to the provisions of Section 10 of said Act relating to the confidential nature of the reports required under this order and further gives notice that the penalties provided for \n\n[306 \nU.S. 56, 58]\n\u00a0\n non-compliance with this order by the producer will be strictly enforced.'\n\n Approved forms were distributed to producers for returns to the order. They contained the following in bold type-'This report is required under the provisions of the Bituminous Coal Act of 1937 and is therefore confidential.' Petitioners made returns upon these forms.\n March 30, 1938, the Commission announced that thereafter it would give public notice of a hearing to determine the weighted average of total cost of the tonnage of coal in the calendar year 1936 adjusted, etc. Further, that upon such hearing the information obtained from individual coal producers through Order 15 would be made available for inspection and introduction in evidence; that section 10(a) of the Act was construed to authorize such disclosure.\n Petitioners made formal objection to the March 30 action but the Commission after consideration announced adherence and ordered-\n'That the Secretary of the Commission be and he is hereby directed to cause the individual cost returns of the producers, as above described, to be made available for inspection by interested parties in the final hearing in the establishment of minimum prices and marketing rules and regulations, so that the same will be available for introduction in evidence if and when required.'\n\n Deeming this proposed action unauthorized and relying upon section 6( b) of the Act, 15 U.S.C.A.  836(b), one of the present petitioners with others asked review in the Court of Appeals, District of Columbia. That court held the challenged action was not reviewable by it and dismissed the petition August 1, 1938. Mallory Coal Co. v. National Bituminous Coal Commission, 69 App.D.C. 166, 99 F.2d 399. August 31, 1938, the Commission ordered its secretary to make available for inspection to 'interested parties who have \n\n[306 \nU.S. 56, 59]\n\u00a0\n filed appearances in this proceeding,' petitioners' cost, etc., reports returned under Order 15.\n September 7, 1938 petitioners by bill filed in the District Court, District of Columbia, sought an injunction against the threatened disclosure. This set out the foregoing facts, stated that no adequate relief could be had elsewhere, and that petitioners would sustain immediate and irreparable damage if their reports were publicized. It further averred that the Commission's proposed action was unauthorized, arbitrary, unreasonable, and in flagrant violation of the statute also the promise of privacy inferable from Order 15 and the forms used for returns thereto.\n The trial court held 'the bill of complaint fails to state a cause of action in that the acts of the defendants sought to be enjoined are authorized by and not in violation of the Bituminous Coal Act,' and dismissed it upon motion. The Court of Appeals concluded the District Court had no jurisdiction over the controversy and upon that ground approved the dismissal. The matter is here by certiorari.\n We are unable to accept the view of the Court of Appeals. The District Court correctly ruled that the bill fails to state a cause of action and for that reason properly directed the bill dismissed.\n A question cognate to the one here presented was before us in Shields v. Utah Idaho Central Railroad Co., \n305 \nU.S. 177\n, 59 S.Ct. 160, decided December 5, 1938, the date of the Court of Appeals' decision herein. We there declared, although determination by the Interstate Commerce Commission that a railroad was not 'interurban' did not constitute an 'order' reviewable under the Urgent Deficiencies Act of October, 1913,1 nevertheless, in the circumstances disclosed, it could be subjected to judicial review by bill in equity. 'Equity jurisdiction may be invoked when it is \n\n[306 \nU.S. 56, 60]\n\u00a0\n essential to the protection of the rights asserted, even though the complainant seeks to enjoin the bringing of criminal actions.' (Page 164.)\n Considering the circumstances here alleged, the great and obvious damage which might be suffered, the importance of the rights asserted, and the lack of any other remedy, we think complainants could properly ask relief in equity. The jurisdiction of a District Court is to be 'determined by the allegations of the bill, and usually if the bill or declaration makes a claim that if well founded is within the jurisdiction of the Court it is within that jurisdiction whether well founded or not.' Hart v. B. F. Keith Vaudeville Exchange et al., \n262 \nU.S. 271, 273\n, 43 S.Ct. 540, 541; also Binderup v. Pathe Exchange, Inc., et al., \n263 \nU.S. 291, 305\n, 44 S.Ct. 96, 98; United States v. Archibald McNeil & Sons, \n267 \nU.S. 302, 307\n, 45 S.Ct. 258, 259.\n By admission, Congress could have authorized the Commission to disclose the details of reports concerning costs, etc. But petitioners insist that the Bituminous Coal Act conferred no such power; on the contrary definitely denies it.\n The Act contains twenty-one sections and a schedule of districts. Section 4-'The provisions of this section shall be promulgated by the Commission as the 'Bituminous Coal Code', and are herein referred to as the code.' 'Part II-Marketing' of this declares-\n'The Commission shall have power to prescribe for code members minimum and maximum prices, and marketing rules and regulations, as follows:\n\n'(a) All code members shall report all spot orders to such statistical bureau hereinafter provided for as may be designated by the Commission and shall file with it copies of all contracts for the sale of coal, copies of all invoices, copies of all credit memoranda, and such other information concerning the preparation, cost, sale, and distribution of coal as the Commission may authorize or require. All such records shall be held by the statistical \n\n[306 \nU.S. 56, 61]\n\u00a0\n bureau as the confidential records of the code member filing such information.\n\n'For each district there shall be established by the Commission a statistical bureau which shall be operated and maintained as an agency of the Commission. ...' 15 U.S.C.A.  831, 833.\n\n Section 10(a)-\n'The Commission may require reports from producers and may use such other sources of information available as it deems advisable, and may require producers to maintain a uniform system of accounting of costs, wages, operations, sales, profits, losses, and such other matters as may be required in the administration of this Act (subchapter). No information obtained from a producer disclosing costs of production or sales realization shall be made public without the consent of the producer from whom the same shall have been obtained, except where such disclosure is made in evidence in any hearing before the Commission or any court and except that such information may be complied in composite form in such manner as shall not be injurious to the interests of any producer and, as so compiled, may be published by the Commission.' 15 U.S.C.A.  840(a).\n\n Counsel submit an ingenious argument to show that as petitioners are code members their returns to Order 15 are not within the ambit of section 10 and must be treated as if presented under Section 4, Part II(a) and therefore confidential. Also, that the challenged action of the Board conflicts with the words, spirit and general purposes of the enactment.\n We have examined the argument but cannot conclude that the reasons advanced are adequate to support the point taken.\n The language of section 10(a) applies to all producers and we think allows what the Board proposes. It harmonizes rather than conflicts with the general purposes of the statute to permit action by the Board only upon full information. Obviously publication may be harmful to \n\n[306 \nU.S. 56, 62]\n\u00a0\n petitioners but as Congress had adequate power to authorize it and has used language adequate thereto we can find here no sufficient basis for an injunction.\n Upon the ground and for the reasons herein stated the decree of the District Court is affirmed.\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK, concurring.\n I concur in the affirmance of the decree of the District Court. For reasons stated in the opinion of the Court of Appeals, 101 F.2d 426, I believe that Court properly found the District Court without jurisdiction. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 38 Stat. 208, 28 U.S.C.  41, 28 U.S.C.A.  41. \n\n\n\n\n","148":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nVALVOLINE OIL CO. v. U. S.(1939)\nNo. 25\nArgued: October 19, 1939Decided: November 13, 1939\n\n\n\n Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the Western District of Pennsylvania. \n\n[308 \nU.S. 141, 142]\n\u00a0\n Mr. J. Campbell Brandon, of Butler, Pa., for appellant.\n Mr. Hugh B. Cox, of Washington, D.C., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Valvoline Oil Company appeals1 from the final decree of a three- judge district court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, under the Urgent Deficiencies Act,2 dismissing a petition to enjoin and annul an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission. 25 F.Supp. 460. The order, requiring appellant to file with the Commission certain maps, charts and schedules of its pipe-line properties for use in valuing the properties under Section 19a of the Interstate \n\n[308 \nU.S. 141, 143]\n\u00a0\n Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C.A.  19a, was made after a determination by the Commission that appellant was 'engaged in the transportation of oil by pipe line in interstate commerce and that it is a common carrier subject to the provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act.'\n Through 1,426 miles of pipe line, running to 9,020 wells in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio, Valvoline gathers some 75,000 barrels of oil per month for its two refineries in Pennsylvania which manufacture the products distributed by Valvoline to the trade. All of this all is purchased from producers at the well, 50 per cent originating in Pennsylvania, 38 per cent in West Virginia, and 12 per cent in Ohio. At the time of the final order of the Commission which it challenges here, Valvoline was selling surplus oil, not needed in its own operations, to a refinery in Pennsylvania and to another in West Virginia, but none of this came from out of the state of the refinery. Because, thus, it does not transport interstate other oil than that which it purchases at the well for its own use, Valvoline claims that it is not a common carrier of oil subject to the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq., or, should it be held to come within the terms of the statute, that the statute is unconstitutional as to it in that the provisions violate due process by taking the carrier's property for public use without compensation. U.S.C.A.Const. Amend. 5.\n Appellant urges as reasons why it is not a common carrier within the provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act that its pipe lines are used primarily to transport oil to its own refineries, that it is not clothed with a public interest, that the oil flowing through its lines is not in commerce until after preparation for market, and that, since the purpose of Section 19a(a) and (e) of the Interstate Commerce Act in requiring valuation data is to furnish a basis for the establishment of traffic and rates, the report required is the first step in general regulation to \n\n[308 \nU.S. 141, 144]\n\u00a0\n which it is not subject. The pertinent provisions of the Act are set out in the margin. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n There is no controversy over whether appellant is an interstate pipe line company. Obviously it is. The contentions above are advanced to show it is not subject to the Act. Section 1(3) defines common carrier to include 'all pipe-line companies.' If this definition is not limited by the subsequent clause 'engaged ... as common carriers for hire,' extended consideration of these characteristics of a private carrier is unnecessary as the language of the definition is decisive.\n The practice of compelling producers to sell at the well before admitting their oil to the lines was widely used as a means of monopolizing the product before the Hepburn Amendment in 1906.4 Whether the oil so owned \n\n[308 \nU.S. 141, 145]\n\u00a0\n and transported was ultimately used by the carrier in its own operations or sold to others was in this connection immaterial. Certainly one would find a public interest in the sole means of transporting this commodity from thousands of wells for thousands of producers. This was covered by the Pipe Line decision. There it was stated that commerce is not dependent of title, 'and the fact that the oils transported belonged to the owner of the pipe line is not conclusive against the transportation being such commerce.' The applicable section of the Interstate Commerce Act at the time of the Pipe Line Cases read: 'That the provisions of this Act shall apply to any ... person or persons engaged in the transportation of oil or other commodity, except water and except natural or artificial gas, by means of pipe lines, ... or partly by pipe lines and partly by water, who shall be considered and held to be common carriers within the meaning and purpose of this Act.' This Court construed that section to cover those who were common carriers in substance even if not in technical form and read it that those 'engaged in the transportation of oil ... by means of pipe lines' shall be treated as common carriers under the Act. The last clause was held not 'to cut down the generality' of the Act.\n In the present Act there is a change of language but we perceive none in meaning. Speaking of the amendments of the Transportation Act of 1920, ( 41 Stat. 456) which recast the Hepburn Amendment into the present form, the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce reported that the section here under consideration 'amends the first five paragraphs of section 1 of the Commerce Act, making minor corrections and classifying language in several respects, but making no important changes in policy.' \n5\n As now written the section brings railroads \n\n[308 \nU.S. 141, 146]\n\u00a0\n under the Act by means of the last clause of subsection (3) only. \n6\n This clause is a conjunctive not a modifier. It does not affect the generality of the first clause as to pipe-line companies.\n The appellant relies upon the Pipe Line Cases to show that the present act does not cover a pipe line transporting oil for its own refining purposes only. The discussion referred to is that concerning the Uncle Sam Oil Company. But that company's pipe line was used for the 'sole purpose of conducting oil from its own wells to its own refinery.' This was held not to be transportation under the Act. Here, however, it is the purchase from many sources and subsequent carriage that determine the applicability of the statute to Valvoline.\n Appellant presses its argument beyond the question whether it comes under the Act. If it does, it urges, the Act is in violation of the due process clause in that by the involuntary change of status from private to common carrier its property is taken. It looks upon the various regulatory provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act as inseparable from the valuation provisions of Section 19a (a) and (e). The losses feared, from present or future legislation other than the valuation provisions, may never occur. The data required by the present order may never be used to fix rates. No such information as to other pipe lines has been so used. Publicity alone may give effective remedy to abuses, if any there be. \n7\n This legislation was intended to free interstate commerce in oil from practices believed to be detrimental, and in that connection accessibility of valuation information to the Congress is essential. Its separate significance being apparent, we confine ourselves to Section 19a (a) and ( e). The \n\n[308 \nU.S. 141, 147]\n\u00a0\n constitutionality of such requirements was settled by the Pipe Line Cases and we see nothing that excepts appellant from their effect. The smallness of the operation is immaterial. \n8\n\u00a0\n\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice BUTLER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Judicial Code  238, 28 U.S.C.  345, 28 U.S.C.A.  345. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 38 Stat. 220, 28 U.S.C.  47, 47a, 28 U.S.C.A.  47, 47a. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Sec. 1.

That in the case of each entry the person recorded as the claimant of the copyright shall be entitled to a certificate of registration under seal of the copyright office, to contain the name and address. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 30, 35]\n\u00a0\n In August, 1932, Liveright, Inc., published and offered for general sale a book written by two of the respondents and printed by another, which contained material substantially identical with an article contained in The Washingtonian of December, 1931. The usual notice claimed copyright of this book. August 26, 1932, copies were deposited in the Copyright Office and certivicate of registration issued.\n\n Respondents concede that petitioner secured upon publication a valid copyright of The Washingtonian. But they insist that although prompt deposit of copies is not prerequisite to copyright, no action can be maintained\n_________ . . . Said certificate shall be admitted in any court as prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. In addition to such certificate the register of copyrights shall furnish, upon request, without additional fee, a receipt for the copies of the work deposited to complete the registration.\n'Sec. 59. That of the articles deposited in the copyright office under the provisions of the copyright laws of the United States or of this Act, the Librarian of Congress shall determine what books and other articles shall be transferred to the permanent collections of the Library of Congress, including the law library, and what other books or articles shall be placed in the reserve collections of the Library of Congress for sale or exchange, or be transferred to other governmental libraries in the District of Columbia for use therein.\n\n'Sec. 60. That of any articles undisposed of as above provided, together with all titles and correspondence relating thereto, the Librarian of Congress and the register of copyrights jointly shall, at suitable intervals, determine what of these received during any period of years it is desirable or useful to preserve in the permanent files of the copyright office, and, after due notice as hereinafter provided, may within their discretion cause the remaining articles and other things to be destroyed. ...\n\n'Sec. 62. That in the interpretation and construction of this Act ( title) 'the date of publication' shall in the case of a work of which copies are reproduced for sale or distribution be held to be the earliest date when copies of the first authorized edition were placed on sale, sold, or publicly distributed by the proprietor of the copyright or under his authority, and the word 'author' shall include an employer in the case of works made for hire.' \n\n[306 \nU.S. 30, 36]\n\u00a0\n because of infringement prior in date to a tardy deposit. Counsel assert- 'The very foundation of the right to maintain an action for infringement is deposit of copies and registration of the work. Neither of these has the slightest bearing upon the creation of the copyright itself under section nine. That is obtained merely by publication with notice as required by the Act.' Also, 'If copies were not deposited promptly after publication the opportunity to comply with the requirement of promptness was gone forever as to that particular work.'\n\n Petitioner submits that under the statute prompt deposit of copies is not prerequisite to an action for infringement; and that under the facts here disclosed deposit before suit was enough.\n The Act of 1909 is a complete revision of the copyright laws, different from the earlier Act both in scheme and language. It introduced many changes and was intended definitely to grant valuable, enforceable rights to authors, publishers, etc., without burdensome requirements; 'to afford greater encouragement to the production of literary works of lasting benefit to the world.' \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[306 \nU.S. 30, 37]\n\u00a0\n Under the old Act deposit of the work was essential to the existence of copyright. This requirement caused serious difficulties and unfortunate losses. (See H.R. Report note 2). The present statute (sec. 9) declares- 'Any person entitled thereto by this Act (title) may secure copyright for his work by publication thereof with the notice of copyright required by this Act (title ( 18)) ....' 17 U.S.C.A.  9. And respondents rightly say 'It is no longer necessary to deposit anything to secure a copyright of a published work, but only to publish with the notice of copyright.'\n Section 10 declares-\n'That such person may obtain registration of his claim to copyright by complying with the provisions of this \n\n[306 \nU.S. 30, 38]\n\u00a0\n Act (title), including the deposit of copies, and upon such compliance the register of copyrights shall issue to him the certificate provided for in section 55 of this Act (title).' 17 U.S.C.A.  10.\n\n Section 12-\n'That after copyright has been secured by publication of the work with the notice of copyright as provided in section 9 of this Act (title), there shall be promptly deposited in the copyright office or in the mail addressed to the register of copyrights, Washington, District of Columbia, two complete copies of the best edition thereof then published. ... No action or proceeding shall be maintained for infringement of copyright in any work until the provisions of this Act (title) with respect to the deposit of copies and registration of such work shall have been complied with.' 17 U.S.C.A.  12.\n\n Section 13-\n'That should the copies called for by section 12 of this Act (title) not be promptly deposited as herein provided (in this title), the register of copyrights may at any time after the publication of the work, upon actual notice, require the proprietor of the copyright to deposit them, and after the said demand shall have been made, in default of the deposit of copies of the work within three months from any part of the United States, ... the proprietor of the copyright shall be liable to a fine of $ 100 and to pay to the Library of Congress twice the amount of the retail price of the best edition of the work, and the copyright shall become void.' 17 U.S.C.A.  13.\n\n Sections fifty-nine and sixty were new legislation. They show clearly enough that deposit of copies is not required primarily in order to insure a complete, permanent collection of all copyrighted works open to the public. Deposited copies may be distributed or destroyed under the direction of the Librarian3 and this is incompatible with \n\n[306 \nU.S. 30, 39]\n\u00a0\n the notion that copies are now required in order that the subject matter of protected works may always be available for information and to prevent unconscious infringement.\n Although immediately upon publication of The Washingtonian for December, 1931, petitioner secured copyright of the articles therein, respondents maintain that through failure promptly to deposit copies in the Copyright Office the right to sue for infringement was lost. In effect, that the provision in section twelve relative to suits should be treated as though it contained the words 'promptly' also 'unless' instead of 'until', and read-No action or proceeding shall be maintained for infringement of copyright in any work unless the provisions of this Act with respect to the deposit of copies promptly and registration of such work shall have been complied with.\n Plausible arguments in support of this view were advanced by the Court of Appeals. We think, however, its adoption would not square with the words actually used in the statute, would cause conflict with its general purpose, and in practice produce unfortunate consequences. We cannot accept it.\n Petitioner's claim of copyright came to fruition immediately upon publication. Without further notice it was good against all the world. Its value depended upon the possibility of enforcement.\n The use of the word 'until' in section twelve rather than 'unless' indicates that mere delay in making deposit of copies was not enough to cause forfeiture of the right theretofore distinctly granted.\n Section twelve provides 'That after copyright has been secured by publication of the work with the notice of \n\n[306 \nU.S. 30, 40]\n\u00a0\n copyright as provided in section 9 of this Act (title), there shall be promptly deposited in the copyright office' two copies, etc. The Act nowhere defines 'promptly' and to make the continued existence of copyright depend upon promptness would lead to unfortunate uncertainty and confusion. The great number of copyrights annually obtained is indicated by note 3, supra. The difficulties consequent upon the former requirement of deposit before publication is pointed out in the Committee Report. These would be enlarged if whenever effort is made to vindicate a copyright it would become necessary to show deposits were made promptly after publication especially since there is no definition of 'promptly'.\n Section thirteen authorizes the register of copyrights to give notice if he finds undue delay and to require deposit of copies. Upon failure to comply within three months the proprietor shall be subject to a fine and the copyright shall become void. Evidently mere delay does not necessarily invalidate the copyright; its existence for three months after actual notice is recognized. Without right of vindication a copyright is valueless. It would be going too far to infer that tardiness alone destroys something valuable both to proprietor and the public.\n Section twenty saves the copyright notwithstanding omission of notice; section twenty-three declares 'That the copyright secured by this Act ( title) shall endure for twenty-eight years from the date of first publication, whether the copyrighted work bears the author's true name or is published anonymously or under an assumed name: ....' Furthermore, proper publication gives notice to all the world that immediate copyright exists. One charged with such notice is not injured by mere failure to deposit copies. The duty not to infringe is unaffected thereby. A certificate of registration provided for by section fifty-five apparently may be ob- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 30, 41]\n\u00a0\n tained at any time and becomes evidence of the facts stated therein.\n Sections 23 and 24, which permit renewal of a copyright by application and registration within its last year although the deposited copyrighted publication may have been disposed of under Sections 59-60, give clear indication that the requirement for deposit is not for the purpose of a permanent record of copyrighted publications and that such record is not indispensable to the existence of the copyright. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n The penalty for delay clearly specified in section thirteen is adequate for punishment of delinquents and to enforce contributions of desirable books to the Library. To give section twelve a more drastic effect would tend to defeat the broad purpose of the enactment. The Report of the Congressional Committee points out that forfeiture after notice \n\n[306 \nU.S. 30, 42]\n\u00a0\n and three months' further delay was thought too severe by some. Nowhere does it suggest approval of the much more drastic result now insisted upon by respondents.\n Read together as the Committee which reported the bill said they should be, sections twelve and thirteen show, we think, the Congress intended that prompt deposit when deemed necessary should be enforced through actual notice by the register; also that while no action can be maintained before copies are actually deposited, mere delay will not destroy the right to sue. Such forfeitures are never to be inferred from doubtful language.\n This view is in accord with the interpretation of somewhat similar provisions of the English Copyright Act. Goubaud v. Wallace and Cate v. Devon & Exeter Constitutional Newspaper Co., supra. Also with the conclusions reached in Lumiere v. Pathe Exchange and Mittenthal v. Berlin, supra.\n The challenged decree must be reversed. The cause will be remanded to the District Court.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK dissenting.\n The opening words of the 1909 copyright law,1 under which petitioner here claims, grant the privilege of copyright only to those who have complied 'with the provisions of this Act.' The provisions of that 1909 Act, of the first copyright Act of 1790,2 and of every copyright Act passed since 1790, have required that copies of a copyrighted article be delivered to a designated governmental depository. Until today, this Court has never permitted recovery for infringement of a copyright unless the statutory requirement for deposit had been complied with in the manner and within the time required by the govern- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 30, 43]\n\u00a0\n ing copyright statute. The 1909 Act-governing the present case-requires that 'after copyright has been secured by publication of the work with the notice of copyright as provided in section 9 of this Act (title), there shall be promptly deposited in the copyright office or in the mail addressed to the register of copyrights, ... two complete copies of the best edition thereof then published, ....' (Italics supplied.) 17 U.S.C. A.  12.\n It is admitted that petitioner did not comply with the statute by prompt deposit of two copies of its work. Fourteen months elapsed between the date of publication and the date of deposit. Petitioner's asserted monopoly rights rest solely on the statute3 and petitioner disobeyed the statute's requirements. Notwithstanding this disobedience, petitioner is here permitted to collect damages under the statute, even for alleged infringement committed in the fourteen month period during which the statute's express command was continuously disregarded by petitioner. This century and a half old statutory requirement for public deposit of a copyrighted article provided a public record for the public's benefit. It imposes a simple and easily performed duty-not burdensome in any respect- in return for a twenty-eight year monopoly, with right of renewal for twenty-eight more years. To permit recovery here protects the copyright owner's statutory privilege of monopoly, but emasculates the statutory provisions designed-for over a century and a half-to protect the public.\n The judgment here rests upon the conclusions: (1) that the statute grants a copyright from the date of first publication with notice; (2) that after deposits are made the statute permits a retroactive recovery for public use \n\n[306 \nU.S. 30, 44]\n\u00a0\n of an article of which copies were never promptly deposited as required by the statute; (3) that Section 13 provides an exclusive penalty for failure to make the deposit; and (4) that-according to administrative interpretation of the Act-deposits are not essential. These conclusions are not in harmony with the historic policy of the copyright law.\n First. There is no novelty in the requirement of the Act of 1909 that deposit of copies shall be made after the copyright has already been secured. Every copyright Act, including the original Act of 1790, provided for a copyright interest which (as in the 1909 Act) vested prior to the time by which the last deposit was required. True, the 1909 Act grants a copyright upon first publication, that is, before the date on which deposit is required. But all of the previous Acts granted a copyright interest 'from the (time of) recording the title' of an article, and recording always took place before the date by which the last deposits were required. \n4\n And while a copyright interest under the Acts prior to that of 1909-as in that Act-thus vested before the last deposits were required, \n\n[306 \nU.S. 30, 45]\n\u00a0\n this Court uniformly held that under these Acts 'conditions subsequent' providing for deposits were actually 'conditions precedent' to the perfection of the copyright. Construing the requirement of deposits in the Acts of 1790 and 1802, this Court said: 'The answer is, that this is not a technical grant on precedent and subsequent conditions. All the conditions are important; the law requires them to be performed; and, consequently, their performance is essential to a perfect title. On the performance of a part of them, the right vests; and this was essential to its protection under the statute; but other acts are to be done, unless congress have legislated in vain, to render the right perfect.' (Italics supplied.) 5\n The 1831 Act was also construed by this Court as follows: 'Although, under section 6 of the ... act, the exclusive right to the copyright vests upon the recording of the title to the book, and runs for the prescribed period from that date, and although the right of action for infringement, under section 6, also accrues at that time, yet it is quite clear that, under section 4, in respect, at least, to suits brought after three months from the publication of the book, (within which the 1831 Act required deposit) it must be shown, as a condition precedent to the right to maintain the suit, that a copy of the book was delivered to the clerk of the district court within three months from the publication. ... Undoubtedly the three conditions prescribed by the statute, namely, the deposit before publication of the printed copy of the title of the book, the giving of information of the copyright by the insertion of the notice on the title-page or the next page, and the depositing of a copy of the book within three months after the publication, are conditions prece- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 30, 46]\n\u00a0\n dent to the perfection of the copyright.' (Italics supplied.)6\n Second. All copyright laws before 1891 had required deposit within some designated period after publication. The Act of 1891, however, required deposit 'not later than the date of (first) publication.' The Joint Committee on the bill which became the 1909 Act considered this requirement too drastic because 'the delay of a single day' (after publication) in making the deposit 'might destroy a copyright.' Instead of requiring deposit within a fixed number of days, or by the date of publication, the bill as reported, and the 1909 Act as passed, permitted a copyright to be perfected by a 'prompt deposit' after publication. The Committee did not recommend, nor did Congress provide that copyright could be perfected without deposit; the Committee did recommend, and Congress enacted an extension of the time for deposit.\n In considering what Congress meant by continuing in the 1909 revision of the copyright laws the requirement for the deposit of copies, 'we must look to the origin and source of the expression, and the judicial construction put upon it before the enactment in question was passed.' \n7\n Prior to the 1909 Act this Court had construed provisions for deposit as essential requirements to the perfection of copyright, whether considered as conditions precedent or subsequent. \n8\n The Committee reporting the 1909 Act pointed out that 'Under existing law (the 1891 Act) the filing of title and deposit of copies on or before the date of first publication are conditions precedent, and any failure to comply with them works a forfeiture of \n\n[306 \nU.S. 30, 47]\n\u00a0\n the copyright. It is proposed under this bill to so change this as to have the copyright effective upon the publication with notice, and the other formalities become conditions subsequent.' \n9\n\u00a0\n\n'A condition precedent is one which must happen or be performed before the estate to which it is annexed can vest' or which must be performed 'before some right dependent thereon accrues.' \n10\n A 'condition subsequent is one annexed to an estate already vested, ... and by the failure or non-performance of which it is defeated.'11\n\n It is clear that Congress intended that the requirement as to deposits must be complied with in order to perfect the copyright interest under the 1909 Act. Any other construction runs counter to the policy of the copyright law and rewards disobedience to plain statutory provisions.\n Only compelling language could justify the conclusion that Congress intended to abandon a statutory policy-in effect since 1790-which required owners of patent or copyright monopolies to disclose upon the public records the extent of their claimed monopolies. Under the prevailing judgment here, public deposit and public registration are no longer necessary in order to obtain rights under the copyright law. And without deposit and registration, there need be no public disclosure of the day or the year of publication (by which copyright is obtained) of many copyrighted works. Under Section 18, 17 U.S.C.A.  18-the only mandatory provision for public disclosure now left unimpaired-many types of copyright will be obtained merely by marking publications with the name of the proprietor and the word 'Copyright', 'Copyr.', or \n\n[306 \nU.S. 30, 48]\n\u00a0\n 'C'. Hereafter, there need be no public (or even private) record of the beginning and the ending of many of these monopolies. And it is unreasonable to assume that an owner of a copyright will voluntarily make the extent and limitations of his monopoly more public than the law requires. Congress did not intend to enshroud copyright monopolies in such secrecy. See Sections 16, 23, 55, 62, 17 U.S.C.A.  16, 23, 55, 62. If disobedience of the statutory requirement is to be rewarded, the reward should certainly be limited-as the Court of Appeals held-so that a deposit which does not comply with the law could not be given retroactive operation permitting recovery of damages for public use during the period of disobedience.\n Third. Section 12 of the 1909 Act-requiring registration and prompt deposit, after publication, of two complete copies of the best edition of a copyrighted article-provides that no action or proceeding shall be maintained for copyright infringement until the required copies are deposited and the article registered with the register of copyrights. Under Section 13, if the copies are not promptly deposited after publication, the register of copyrights may demand deposit by the proprietor. If deposit is not then made within three months, the proprietor is liable to a fine of $100 and payment to the Library of Congress of twice the amount of the retail price of the best edition of the article, and the copyright becomes void for all purposes. It is suggested that Section 13 provides the sole and exclusive penalty for failure to comply with the statutory requirement of prompt deposit of copies. But this ignores one of the two distinct purposes of Congress in requiring deposits of copies in the 1909 Act and in all preceding copyright Acts. First, the deposit is intended to record publicly full and complete information about a work for which copyright is claimed and to make that work continuously available for public \n\n[306 \nU.S. 30, 49]\n\u00a0\n inspection in order that the extent and boundaries of the monopoly may be understood by the public at all times during the life of the copyright. The judgment here renders this primary Congressional purpose ineffective. Second, Congress intended to preserve 'desirable or useful'12 works in a governmental agency dedicated to the diffusion of public knowledge. In furtherance of this second purpose the Act of 1909,-as did other Acts since 1846-required copies to be deposited with the Library of Congress. These two separate and distinct purposes have been manifested by Congress sometimes in different sections of a single copyright statute and at other times in separate Acts.\n To effectuate the first purpose, that is, to notify the public of the existence and extent of a copyright monopoly, the first Act of 1790 required deposit, public recording and registration in a District Court, and publication in a newspaper; the Act of 1831 required deposit with the Clerk of a District Court (without penalty for failure to deposit); the Act of 1870 required deposit of one copy of the title with the Librarian of Congress before publication and two copies of the article within ten days after publication without provision for money penalty for failure to comply; Section 4956 of the Revised Statutes (1878) required deposit of one copy of the title before publication and two copies of the work after publication. Deposit has served as an integral part of every legislative plan to give the public full information of copyright monopolies. These plans have included deposits, registration, notice on the copyrighted article itself and full publication in newspapers. Deposit, registration and notice on the article-which every prior copyright Act required-are specifically provided for in the 1909 Act. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 30, 50]\n\u00a0\n To effectuate the second purpose, that is, to preserve worthy works for the diffusion of knowledge, the Act of 1790 made separate provision for delivery of an additional copy to the Secretary of State 'to be preserved in his office;' in a non-copyright Act of 1846, (9 Stat. 102, 106) creating the Smithsonian Institute 'for the diffusion of knowledge,' Congress required deposit of separate copies with the Institute and with the Library of Congress; a special Act of 1865 (13 Stat. 540, the origin of Section 13 now considered) permitted a separate copy to be franked to the Library of Congress within a month of publication 'for the use of said Library,' gave the Librarian the right to demand this additional copy, and penalized non-compliance with his demand by forfeiture of copyright; Section 93 of the Act of 1870 required two additional copies of the best edition to be delivered, within ten days after publication, to the Librarian of Congress, and (Section 94) 'in default of such deposit' which was required for the benefit of the Library, a penalty of $25 could be collected by the Librarian of Congress; Section 4959 of the Revised Statutes (1878) required deposit of two additional separate copies of the best edition 'within ten days from publication' with the Librarian of Congress, and Section 4960 extended the penalty of $25 to cover all failures to make deposits of copies.\n Section 12 of the Act of 1909, following the provisions of the Act of 1891 (26 Stat. 1106), provided in a single Section for deposit of copies with the Librarian both for notice to the public and for use of the Library. Section 13 of the 1909 Act now provides in a single Section-as had Section 4960 of the Revised Statutes-a penalty for failure to make deposits which are required for the two purposes of notice to the public and use by the Library. Neither this Section 13 nor any of its legislative predecessors indicated a Congressional intent to abandon-as a con- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 30, 51]\n\u00a0\n dition to the perfection of a copyright-the requirement of deposits for the salutary purpose of providing adequate public records of the existence and continuing extent of copyright monopolies. Section 13 gives the Librarian of Congress authority to demand deposit of copies of every article on which copyright is claimed, adding an additional penalty for failure to comply with his demand. This additional penalty may be imposed whether the claimed copyright is valid or invalid, and does not nullify the mandatory provision of Section 12 requiring deposit of copies for the public benefit.\n Section 12 itself provides that 'no action or proceeding shall be maintained for infringement of copyright in any work until the provisions of this Act (title) with respect to the deposit of copies and registration of such work shall have been complied with.' Compliance with 'the provisions of this Act' is made a condition of the right to sue, and the Act is not complied with by delaying fourteen months after publication before making deposit. The Act requires 'prompt deposit.'\n It is said that two new Sections (59 and 60) of the 1909 Act, 17 U.S. C.A.  59, 60, indicate an intention of Congress to abandon the protective mandate for public record of copyright monopolies. These Sections show a contrary purpose and distinctly mark the line between deposits for Library uses and deposits for public information.\n Section 59 permits the Librarian of Congress acting alone to transfer deposited copies to other governmental libraries for their use. Since 1909, acting under this authority, the Librarian has distributed 186,037 volumes. 13 \n\n[306 \nU.S. 30, 52]\n\u00a0\n Section 60 permits the Librarian (supervising both the Library and Copyright offices) acting jointly with the Register of Copyrights ( directly in charge of deposits for copyright purposes), to determine what deposits 'received during any period of years it is desirable or useful to preserve in the permanent files of the copyright office ....' (Italics supplied.) After duly published notice to the public, and 'specific notice to the copyright proprietor of record' other articles can be destroyed or returned to the proprietor 'of record.' But even as to articles destroyed or returned, public records of the copyright monopolies must be retained in the registration files (Sections 10, 11, 16, 45, 47, 53, 54, 55) and in the indices or catalogues (Section 56). All these records 'shall be open to public inspection.' (Section 58.) And-among other purposes-these records remain open to public inspection, in the event of a copyright renewal.\n During the last forty-one years copyright registrations numbered over five million, and 'have increased over five-fold.' \n14\n In 1909, it was obviously necessary to enact legislation providing for disposal of some of the multitudinous accumulated copyrighted articles no longer necessary for the purpose of public disclosure. But far from showing a Congressional intent to permit copyright monopolies with no public governmental record available for public inspection, Sections 59 and 60 are the clearest and most conclusive evidence of a contrary purpose. They carried forward and emphasized once more the dual statutory purpose to require deposits for the use of the Library, and to preserve for the public the historic and wise policy that the ownership, nature and extent of private monopolies granted by government should always be spread upon government records open for public inspection.\n Fourth. There remains the suggestion that administrative interpretation of the 1909 Act lends support to \n\n[306 \nU.S. 30, 53]\n\u00a0\n the judgment here under which the statutory provisions for public registration and deposit are nullified. On the contrary, the rules and regulations promulgated by the Register of Copyrights under the 1909 Act have continuously and consistently recognized that registration and deposit are mandatory. From the first (1910) until the latest (1927) edition of these rules and regulations they have substantially provided as follows:\n'Promptly after first publication of the work with the copyright notice inscribed, two complete copies of the best edition of the work then published must be sent to the Copyright Office with the proper application for registration correctly filled out and a money order for the amount of the legal fee.\n\n'The statute requires that the deposit of the copyrighted work shall be made 'promptly' which has been defined as 'without unnecessary delay.' It is not essential, however, that the deposit be made on the very day of publication.' (Italics supplied.)15\n\n But it is said that a letter from the Register of Copyrights to the Librarian of Congress-dated September 17, 1938-indicates a different interpretation of the Act by the Copyright Office. However, this letter does not purport to change the formal rules and regulations-in force and effect since 1910-which provide that deposit and registration 'must' be 'promptly' made. The 1909 Act gives the Register of Copyrights authority to promulgate rules and regulations but it does not give him authority to alter the law's meaning by communicating with the Librarian of Congress. Nor, in fact, does this letter represent an effort by the Register of Copyrights to change the rules and regulations dating from 1910. Practitioners in the Copyright Office, as well as the public generally, \n\n[306 \nU.S. 30, 54]\n\u00a0\n rely upon formal rules and regulations made available to the public. But whether they have access to interdepartmental communications such as the letter does not appear.\n This interdepartmental communication bears the date of September 17, 1938. It appeared in public form for the first time January 4, 1939. Its appearance thus occurred nearly six years after the complaint in this suit was filed; more than eight months after the Circuit Court of Appeals decided that the statutory provisions for deposit were mandatory; almost three months after this Court granted certiorari, \n305 \nU.S. 583\n, 59 S.Ct. 85, 83 L.Ed. --, and twenty-nine days after the cause was argued and submitted for final decision by this Court. The communication is admittedly contrary to the only two court decisions which it cites on the precise question of the effect of failure to make deposit. \n16\n It does not represent an administrative practice consistently pursued, or an administrative interpretation of long standing, and therefore is not entitled to any weight in the construction of the 1909 Act. The administrative rules and regulations-to which we may look-have since 1910 consistently required that deposit 'must' be made.\n It is of far greater importance to the public today than it was in 1790, 1831, 1870, or 1891, that public record be made of copyright monopolies granted to further the arts and sciences, since these privileges have been extended by statute to include almost every conceivable type of production of the human mind. \n17\n It has been well \n\n[306 \nU.S. 30, 55]\n\u00a0\n said that the 'general rule of law is, that the noblest of human productions-knowledge, truths ascertained, conceptions, and ideas-become, after voluntary communication to others, free as the air to common use.' \n18\n All voluntary communications become 'free as the air to common use' unless protected by compliance with the copyright statutes. More than twenty-five years ago (1911) a careful and accurate survey of the copyright laws led to the conclusion that 'For 75 years it has been the settled law of this country that protection under the copyright law is granted only to those who perform the conditions essential to a perfect copyright title.' \n19\n No decision of this Court-previous to that of today-has questioned the consistent purpose of Congress to require 'that the public should have notice, by a true and correct official registry, as to the real author or proprietor entitled to the enjoyment of such monopoly as against the public.' \n20\n To grant monopoly privileges-by judicial construction-to those who fail to comply with statutory safeguards intended to protect the public against abuses of such privileges conflicts with statutory policy extending back to the beginning of the nation's history. An author is entitled to the benefit of every right afforded by copyright law, but only 'upon complying with the provisions of' that law. Congress has provided for a grant of monopoly privileges under \n\n[306 \nU.S. 30, 56]\n\u00a0\n copyright for a term which may extend by renewal to fifty-six years for those who do comply. Petitioner having conceded that it disobeyed a plain requirement of the Act designed to inform and protect the public, I cannot agree that it should recover damages under the very law it admittedly disobeyed.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS and Mr. Justice REED concur in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act March 4, 1909-\n'Section 1.

Among other things this says-\n'Sections 12 and 13 deal with the deposit of copies, and should be considered together. They materially alter the existing law, which provides that in order to make the copyright valid there must be deposited two complete copies of the book or other article not later than the date of first publication. The failure of a shipping clerk to see that the copies go promptly forward to Washington may destroy a copyright of great value, and many copyrights have been lost because by some accident or mistake this requirement was not complied with. The committee felt that some modification of this drastic provision, under which the delay of a single day might destroy a copyright, might well be made. The bill reported by the committee provides that there shall be 'promptly' deposited in the copyright office, or in the mail, addressed to the register of copyrights, two complete copies of the best edition then published, and that no action or proceeding shall be maintained for the infringement of copyright in any work until the provisions with respect to the deposit of copies and the registration of such work shall have been complied with. \n\n'If the works are not promptly deposited, we provide that the register of copyrights may at any time after publication of the work, upon actual notice, require the proprietor of the copyright of deposit, and then in default of deposit of copies of the work within three months from any part of the United States, except an outlying territorial possession of the United States, or within six months from any outlying territorial possession of the United States, or from any foreign country, the proprietor of the copyright shall be liable to a fine of $100 and to pay to the Library of Congress twice the amount of the retail price of the best edition of the work, and the copyright shall become void. It was suggested that the forfeiture of the copyright for failure to deposit copies was too drastic a remedy, but your committee feel that in many cases it will be the only effective remedy: certainly the provision for compelling the deposit of copies by the imposition of a fine would be absolutely unavailing should the copyright proprietor be the citizen or subject of a foreign state.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] See Report Register Copyrights for 1938. During the year there were 166,248 registrations; 194,433 current articles deposited were transferred to the Library of Congress. Also 3612 motion picture films, and 43,302 deposits from other classes were returned to the authors or proprietors. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] For Statement of the views of the Copyright Office concerning Act of 1909 and practice thereunder See, Letter from the Register of Copyrights to the Librarian of Congress dated September 17, 1938, printed at the Government Printing Office 1938.

UNITED STATES(1939)\nNo. 42\nArgued: Decided: December 11, 1939\n\n\n\n\n[308 \nU.S. 321, 322]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Theodore Kiendl, of New York City, for petitioner goldstein.\n Mr. Lloyd Paul Stryker, of New York City, for petitioner Weiss.\n Mr. Jacob W. Friedman, of New York City, for petitioner Gross.\n Messrs. Frank Murphy, Atty. Gen., and O. John Rogge, Asst. Atty. Gen., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[308 \nU.S. 321, 324]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioners were indicted, with five others, in the District Court for the Southern District of New York for using the mails to defraud and for conspiracy so to use them. \n1\n The alleged scheme was to cheat insurance companies by inducing them to pay false claims for disability, health, and accident benefits to three of the defendants, Nelson, Berger, and Spitz. These three pleaded guilty and testified for the Government. Three defendants who were physicians,-Messman, Goldstein, and Krupp-were alleged to have assisted by furnishing policy holders false medical certificates and instructing them how to simulate illness. Messman pleaded guilty and testified for the Government. The other two stood trial. Two lawyers, Joseph J. Weiss, and Alfred L. Weiss, and an investigator, Gross, were charged with having furthered the claims knowing them to be false. Alfred L. Weiss was granted a severance; Joseph J. Weiss and Gross stood trial. Each of the petitioners was convicted and sentenced. The judgments were affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The conspiracy and scheme charged covered a period extending from January 15, 1934, to July 30, 1937, the date of the indictment. The principal issue of fact was whether the petitioners participated in making false claims with guilty knowledge. Over objection and ex- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 321, 325]\n\u00a0\n ception, the trial judge admitted evidence of seventy-six intercepted telephone communications.\n For months prior to the finding of the indictment telephone messages over the wires leading into the offices of Weiss and Messman in New York City, were intercepted. The wires were tapped by a policeman acting under instructions of a United States Post Office Inspector. The intercepted messages were taken stenographically and were also simultaneously recorded on phonograph discs by employes of a detective agency acting under the same instructions. Each night the records and stenographic transcripts of communications intercepted during the day were delivered to the United States Attorney or his representative. Interstate calls were made from Weiss' office and the tapped wires were the conduits of both interstate and intrastate communications. Every call, whether interstate or intrastate, to or from Weiss' office, was intercepted and recorded.\n It appeared at the trial that one of the defendants who pleaded guilty had been confronted with the phonographic records and had then decided to plead guilty and become a witness for the Government. Others who had been informed of the Government's possession of the records did likewise. In the preparation for trial one of the defendants, who was to testify for the prosecution, held a typed copy of the stenographic transcript of a telephone conversation in which he had participated while a phonographic record of the conversation was played to him. He corrected the typed manuscript to make it conform to the words emitted from the phonograph. He then marked the phonographic record and the script for identification.\n The Government's procedure at the trial in proving the communications was to call as a witness one of the defendants who had pleaded guilty, and to hand him a transcript \n\n[308 \nU.S. 321, 326]\n\u00a0\n he had marked for identification. After he had testified that, on a given date, he held a telephone conversation with one of the other defendants, he was asked whether he could repeat the conversation verbatim. Upon his stating that he could not do so without the use of the typed transcript he was permitted to read it to the jury. Subsequently the Government offered the identified phonograph records and typewritten transcripts in evidence and they were admitted. Certain of the records were played to the jury while each juryman held a copy of the typewritten transcript of the conversation. All of the communications in question are conceded to have been intrastate save one which, however, was not shown to have been interstate.\n The petitioners' objections to the admission of this evidence were that it would violate Sec. 605 of the Federal Communications Act of 1934;3 would violate the Fourth and Fifth Amendments of the Federal Constitution, U.S.C.A., and would be in the teeth of Sec. 1423, subdivision 6, of the Penal Law of the State of New York, Consol. Laws, c. 40,4 making wire tapping a crime.\n Because of conflict of decision in the Circuit Courts of Appeal5 we granted certiorari, limited to the 'question whether the trial court properly received in evidence intercepted telephone communications.' \n6\n\u00a0\n\n In Nardone v. United States, \n302 \nU.S. 379\n, 58 S.Ct. 275, it was decided that Sec. 605 of the Federal Communications Act prohibited the reception in a federal court of evidence of interstate communications obtained by federal agents by tapping telephone wires. The petitioners assert, and the \n\n[308 \nU.S. 321, 327]\n\u00a0\n respondent denies, that the section bars evidence of intrastate communications similarly obtained. The Government further claims that, even if the section would otherwise bar the evidence, it does not have that effect in this case, because interception and divulgence of the messages put in evidence was 'authorized by the sender' within the meaning of the section.\n The section consists of four clauses separated by semicolons. The pertinent one is the second: 'and no person not being authorized by the sender shall intercept any communication and divulge or publish the existence, contents, substance, purport, effect, or meaning of such intercepted communication to any person;'. Plainly the interdiction thus pronounced is not limited to interstate and foreign communications. And, as Congress has power, when necessary for the protection of interstate commerce, to regulate intrastate transactions,7 there is no constitutional requirement that the scope of the statute be limited so as to exclude intrastate communications.\n The petitioners and the Government alike refer to the context of the critical clause, and the legislative history of the Communications Act, the former to demonstrate that all communications are protected from interception and divulgence, the latter to prove that the language of the Act must be more narrowly interpreted to cover only interstate and foreign communications.\n In support of the petitioners' view it is pointed out that each clause of Sec. 605 is complete in itself; that in the first and third clauses, which deal with divulgence of messages by persons engaged in receiving or transmitting them, the communications are specified as 'any interstate or foreign communication', whereas, in the second and fourth \n\n[308 \nU.S. 321, 328]\n\u00a0\n clauses, which deal with interception and divulgence of communications, the phrases used are 'any communication' and 'such intercepted communication.' It is argued that the difference in phraseology must have significance; and, in support of the assertion that the variety of expression was not due to inadvertence, the petitioners call attention to the fact that Sec. 605 was taken over from Sec. 27 of the Radio Act of 1927,8 which, referring to radio messages, used uniformly, in each clause, the term 'communication' or 'message' and nowhere qualified the designation by the use of the phrase 'in interstate or foreign commerce.'\n The petitioners further urge that there is good reason for the distinction in the phrasing of the clauses in  605 since persons employed by communication companies can distinguish between interstate and intrastate messages which they handle, whereas, inasmuch as messages of both sorts pass indiscriminately over the same wires, the intercepter cannot make a similar distinction and the only practicable way to protect interstate messages from interception and divulgence is to prohibit the interception of all messages.\n The Government argues that a reading of the whole section makes it plain that to give the second clause the scope contended for by the petitioners will lead to incongruities and inconsistencies in the operation of the section. We find none such as are sufficient to countervail what appears to be the plain meaning of the second clause.\n The Government correctly asserts that the main purpose of the Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C.A.  151 et seq., was to extend the jurisdiction of the existing Radio Commission to embrace telegraph and telephone communications as well as those by radio. We are asked to hold that if Congress \n\n[308 \nU.S. 321, 329]\n\u00a0\n had intended to make so drastic a change as to regulate intrastate as well as interstate communication, both the legislative history of the Act and its phraseology would so indicate, whereas there is nothing in either to emphasize any such extension of authority. We think, however, that the legislative history does not serve to explain the difference in the wording of the various clauses of Sec. 605. In making the alterations in the phraseology of the similar section of the earlier act the Congress must have had some purpose. We cannot conclude that the change in the wording of two of the four clauses of the section was inadvertent.\n The Government further contends that the Act, viewed as a whole, indicates an intent to regulate only interstate and foreign communication. The title and sections 1 and 2, with a single exception which serves to emphasize the distinction, expressly so declare. But we think these considerations are not controlling in the construction of Section 605. The Commission's regulatory powers and administrative functions have to do only with interstate and foreign communications. But Section 605 delegates no function and confers no power upon the Commission. It consists of prohibitions, sanctions for violation of which are found in Section 501.9 We hold that the broad and inclusive language of the second clause of the section is not to be limited by construction so as to exclude intrastate communications from the protection against interception and divulgence.\n We come, then, to the Government's second proposition,-that disclosure of the intercepted communications was 'authorized by the sender' within the meaning of the clause. It is true that one or both of the parties to each of the admitted communications attested in the manner we have indicated to the intercepted conversations. This \n\n[308 \nU.S. 321, 330]\n\u00a0\n is said to amount to a consent to the divulgence of the subject matter and to satisfy the statute in that respect. We think the position is untenable. The Act contemplates voluntary consent and not enforced agreement to publication. The participants were ignorant of the interception of the messages and did not consent thereto. The contents of the stenographic transcripts and phonographic records were, prior to the trial, made available to Government agents and United States attorneys. This divulgence was not consented to by either of the parties to any of the telephone conversations. In the absence of such divulgence the Government would have been without the evidence embodied in the messages.\n It is said, however, that, when some of the defendants pleaded guilty, elected to take the stand and to testify to the contents of the messages, they gave the authorization contemplated by the statute. We have already adverted to the method by which this supposed authorization was obtained. Certain of the defendants who were participants in the telephone conversations were informed of the Government's possession of the contents of their communications. Under the stress of this situation they determined to turn state's evidence. Messman's license to practice medicine has not been revoked; he was not required to plead to the indictment; he was paid a salary by the Government, first of $65 per week and later of $100 per week, amounting, in the total, to $3,237.12. Nelson's sentence was suspended. He was paid a salary of $50 per week. Berger's sentence was suspended. Spitz's sentence was suspended.\n Statement of these facts is convincing that the so-called authorization consisting of the agreement to turn state's evidence, by some of the defendants after they had been apprized of the knowledge of their communications by the Government's representatives, and in the hope of leniency, was not that intended or described by the stat- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 321, 331]\n\u00a0\n ute and emphasizes the offensive use which may be made of intercepted messages, whether interstate or intrastate. It is not too much to assume the interdiction of the statute was intended to prevent such a method of procuring testimony.\n We hold that Section 605 rendered the communications inadmissible, and that it was prejudicial error for the trial court to admit them either by permitting the defendants who turned state's evidence to read the transcripts or allowing the prosecutor to put the transcripts and phonographic records into evidence upon identification by the parties to the conversations.\n We have no occasion to consider or decide the questions raised by the other objections of the petitioners to the admission of the evidence.\n The judgments are reversed and the cause is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Under U.S.C.

CITY NAT. BANK OF WICHITA FALLS(1939)\nNo. 314\nArgued: January 6, 1939Decided: January 30, 1939\n\n\n\n\n[306 \nU.S. 103, 104]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Ray Bland and Guy Rogers, both of Wichita Falls, Tex., for petitioners.\n Messrs. Leslie Humphrey and T. R. Boone, both of Wichita Falls, Tex., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n We are asked to determine whether the Circuit Court of Appeals correctly applied the law of Texas in a suit upon a cause of action arising in that state between a Texas association acting under a declaration of trust and a national bank doing business there.\n The proceedings in the present litigation have been extensive and complex but only those relevant to the issue presented here need be detailed. Respondent, the City National Bank of Wichita Falls, brought suit in a Texas court against the association, petitioner here, and its trustee to recover on two promissory notes, one made and the other endorsed by petitioner. They filed a cross-action against the bank, impleading its vice-president, to recover a deposit balance in favor of petitioner on the ground that the bank had improperly charged the account with drafts drawn upon it by Peckham, a former trustee of petitioner, or at his direction, and that Peckham, in breach of trust, had used the proceeds in part to pay his own debts to the bank or its vice-president, and in part for other expenditures for his own benefit.\n The misappropriations were alleged to have been effected by the withdrawal of funds from the deposit account by a large number of checks signed by Peckham as trustee, or at his direction, and payable to his own order or to the bank. Some were alleged to have been credited by the bank in payment of the trustee's personal debts and some to his personal account with the bank, from \n\n[306 \nU.S. 103, 105]\n\u00a0\n which he later withdrew a substantial part of the amounts so deposited and used it for his own purposes. Petitioner contended that some of the funds thus withdrawn from his personal account were used in payment of his personal debts to the bank or its vice-president and that the bank and its vice-president, because of the transactions with the bank and the form of the checks, had notice of and had participated in the breaches of trust or some of them and to that extent were liable for all the misappropriations.\n The trial court directed a verdict and entered judgment in favor of the bank on the notes and against petitioner on its cross-action. On appeal the Supreme Court of Texas reversed and remanded the cause for a new trial upon such further evidence as might be adduced, and in its opinion stated the applicable principles of law for the guidance of the trial court. 127 Tex. 158, 184, 89 S.W.2d 394, 93 S.W.2d 143. Meanwhile, the bank had closed its doors. Its assets were taken over by respondent, the newly organized City National Bank in Wichita Falls, which assumed the liabilities of the old bank.\n On the remand the directors and the liquidating agent of the old bank and the new bank were made parties defendant to the cross-action by petitioner association, and the pleadings were amended so as to charge the new individual defendants with responsibility for the liability originally asserted against the old bank, and also to charge the new bank by reason of its acquisition of the assets and its assumption of the liabilities of the old one.\n The cause was then removed to the federal District Court for northern Texas, under  28 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  71, 28 U.S.C.A.  71. On the trial of the cause there, in the course of which voluminous evidence was taken before a commissioner, the District Court denied recovery to the old bank on the promissory notes and to the association upon its claim against the old bank and the various other \n\n[306 \nU.S. 103, 106]\n\u00a0\n parties sought to be charged with its liability, but directed that jurisdiction be retained to wind up the affairs of the insolvent bank.  24(16) of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  41(16), 28 U.S.C.A.  41(16); International Trust Co. v. Weeks, \n203 \nU.S. 364\n, 27 S.Ct. 69.\n The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit set aside the decree because of the failure of the trial court to make findings of fact and state conclusions of law as required by Equity Rule 70 1\/2, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723. 95 F.2d 671. In remanding the cause the court stated, for the guidance of the trial court, principles of law which it thought applicable to the cause of action asserted by the association. These were at variance with those which the Texas Supreme Court in its earlier remand of the case had declared to be controlling. It rejected in part the rulings of the state court because it thought that the questions presented were of general commercial law, with respect to which the federal courts were not bound by local decisions, and that the rules which the Texas courts had adopted were not favored by the decisions of the federal and some state courts.\n In its opinion denying a second petition for rehearing, 5 Cir., 97 F. 2d 249, presented after our decision in Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, \n304 \nU.S. 64\n, 58 S.Ct. 817, 114 A.L.R. 1487, the court disclaimed any purpose not to follow the law of Texas, but reaffirmed its instructions for the trial court on the ground that they were in harmony with the opinion of the Supreme Court of Texas in a later case, Quanah, Acme & Pacific R. Co. v. Wichita State Bank & Trust Co., 127 Tex. 407, 93 S.W.2d 701, 106 A.L.R. 821, which the Court of Appeals thought had modified and restricted the rules announced by the state court on the appeal in this case. We granted certiorari, \n305 \nU.S. 587\n, 59 S.Ct. 101, 83 L.Ed. --, on a petition urging that it was the duty of the Court of Appeals to apply the law as defined by the Supreme Court of Texas on the first ap- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 103, 107]\n\u00a0\n peal, the question, concerning the relations of the federal and state courts, being of public importance.\n In departing from the 'law of the case,' as announced by the state court, and applying a different rule, the court below correctly stated that by reason of the removal it had been substituted for the Texas Supreme Court as the appropriate court of appeal and that it was its duty to apply the Texas law as the Texas court would have declared and applied it on a second appeal if the cause had not been removed. It was the duty of the federal court to apply the law of Texas as declared by its highest court. Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, supra. But the case on the first appeal had not become res judicata. Remington v. Central Pacific R. Co., \n198 \nU.S. 95, 99\n, 100 S., 25 S.Ct. 577, 579; Messinger v. Anderson, \n225 \nU.S. 436, 444\n, 32 S.Ct. 739, 740; Diaz A. v. Patterson, \n263 \nU.S. 399, 402\n, 44 S.Ct. 151, 152; Seagraves v. Wallace, 5 Cir., 69 F.2d 163, 164, 165. And since the Supreme Court of Texas holds itself free upon reconsideration to modify or recede from its own opinions, see Quanah, Acme & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Wichita State Bank & Trust Co., supra, superseding 89 S.W.2d 385, the court below, in applying the local law, was likewise free to depart from the earlier rulings to the extent that examination of the later opinions of the Texas Supreme Court showed that it had modified its opinion on the first appeal. Hence the only question for our decision is whether the Court of Appeals rightly concluded that the state court had thus altered its opinion.\n The Court of Appeals held, as did the Texas Supreme Court, that the old bank, so far as it had accepted payment of the trustee's personal debts from his personal account, with notice that the payments had their source in trust funds, had become liable for the trustee's misappropriations by reason of its participation in them. But the two courts differed with respect to the liability of the bank for trust funds commingled with the trustee's per- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 103, 108]\n\u00a0\n sonal account and later withdrawn and used for his personal benefit. The state court had ruled that the bank was responsible for all such misappropriations as took place after it had knowingly accepted trust funds in payment of the trustee's personal debts. Pointing out that there was evidence of such transactions, it declared, 127 Tex. 158, 174, 175, 89 S.W.2d 402: 'the bank, after being charged with knowledge of Peckham's dishonest dealings, continued to credit Peckham's personal account with checks drawn on the trust account, and persisted in its course of dealings with respect to the two accounts. Having incurred the burden of ascertaining whether subsequent expenditures made by the trustee from the commingled funds were for authorized trust purposes, it cannot effectively complain of the weight of that burden'. And it concluded, 127 Tex. 158, 182, 89 S.W.2d 407: 'It is apparent from what has been stated that the amount of the bank's liability is the difference between the total amount of the deposits (of trust moneys) for which Peckham's personal account received credit after he began commingling trust funds with his own on October 8, 1925, and the total amount of withdrawals therefrom which the bank may show were used for authorized trust purposes.' \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The court below, relying on the decision of the Texas Supreme Court in the later Quanah Case, declined to accept this conclusion. Instead it declared that the bank was not chargeable with notice of the trustee's misappropriations through withdrawal and use of trust funds deposited in his personal account by the bare fact of its knowledge that the trustee had previously paid his per- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 103, 109]\n\u00a0\n sonal debts to the bank with trust funds passed through his personal account. But the Quanah Case presented a different question from that considered by the Texas court in the present case. The former involved no question of actual knowledge and participation by the bank in the misappropriation of trust funds. There an officer of a corporation deposited its funds in his personal account in a bank with which the corporation had no account. The bank had knowledge that the funds or some of them belonged to the corporation and not to the officer personally, but it paid them out on the order of the officer, who appropriated them to his own use. In holding that the bank was not liable, the court adopted the rule, for which it found support in the decisions of other courts and in text writers, that the bank in such circumstances is not liable for the misappropriation. The court was at pains to point out that a different rule would have been applicable if, before the withdrawals from the account, 'the bank (had) actively participated in the spoliation of the trust fund and knowingly received a part of the fund to itself in payment of the trustee's individual debt to it', citing its opinion in the present case. Quanah, A. & P.R. Co. v. Wichita State Bank & Trust Co., 127 Tex. 407, 421, 422, 93 S.W.2d 701, 709, 106 A.L.R. 821.\n Even if we thought this distinction not well taken, nothing requires the state courts to adopt the rule which the federal or other courts may believe to be the better one, or to be consistent in their decisions if they do not choose to be. That the distinction taken in the Quanah Case was advisedly made and was not intended to modify the rule announced by the state court on the appeal in this case, appears from the opinions in both cases. On the same day that the final opinion in the Quanah Case, from which we have quoted, was delivered by the Texas Supreme Court, it denied a petition for rehearing in the present case, with an opinion, 127 Tex. 184, 93 S.W.2d 143, which left undisturbed the principles announced in the first decision. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 103, 110]\n\u00a0\n In its final opinion in the Quanah Case it said: '... we have again carefully reviewed the opinion in the Wichita Royalty Co. et al. v. City National Bank of Wichita Falls Case (127 Tex. 158) 89 S.W.2d 394 (93 S.W. 2d 143), decided by this court on the same day the case at bar was originally decided. ...

As there is no contention that the opinion of the Texas court in this case has in any other respect been modified by the Quanah or any other case in the Texas Supreme Court, we do not discuss other parts of the opinion below which it is argued fail to follow the opinion of the state court.\n We think that the opinion of the Supreme Court of Texas in the present case has not been modified by the Quanah Case and must be accepted as stating the law of Texas; and that it affords the appropriate guide for the District Court so far as it may be applicable to the facts which have been developed on the trial there.

SOVEREIGN CAMP, W.O.W.(1939)\nNo. 448\nArgued: March 2, 1939Decided: April 17, 1939\n\n\n\n Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the District of New Jersey. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 573, 574]\n\u00a0\n Mr. E. J. Dimock, of New York City, for appellants. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 573, 574]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. David M. Wood, of New York City, and Arthur T. Vanderbilt, of Newark, N.J., for appellee. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 573, 575]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question is whether we have jurisdiction to consider the merits of this appeal taken under  266 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.A.  380, directly to this Court from the decree of a district court of three judges.\n Appellee brought the present suit in equity in the District Court for the District of New Jersey, praying a declaratory decree against the validity of certain provisions of the New Jersey Municipal Finance Commission Act, c. 340, New Jersey Laws of 1931, as amended, and an injunction restraining state and municipal officers from acting pursuant to the Commission Act, on the ground that it impairs the obligation of contract in violation of the federal Constitution by depriving appellee of the remedies existing when the contracts were entered into. The Commission Act provides an elaborate scheme for the control and management of the affairs of any municipality, found by the Supreme Court to be unable to meet its obligations when due, by a commission composed of state officers acting in conjunction with the local municipal authorities. The Act, in its amended form, appears in Title 52, c. 27,  1 to 66, inclusive, c. 24 ,  19.1, c. 14,  32, Title 1, c. 1,  10, Revised Statutes of New Jersey, 1937\n\n\n Appellants, members of the Municipal Finance Commission, and the other appellants, members of the Board of Assessors of the Borough of Runnemede, a New Jersey municipal corporation, and its Tax Collector, were joined \n\n[306 \nU.S. 573, 576]\n\u00a0\n as defendants. Decision on an application for an interlocutory injunction, presented to the district court of three judges assembled pursuant to  266 of the Judicial Code, and also on a motion of appellants to remit the case to a single district judge, was reserved, and the court, after hearing, rendered its final decree sustaining appellants' contention that the challenged statute was unconstitutional and granting relief by injunction against all the appellants. The case comes here on appeal under  238 and 266 of the Judicial Code. 28 U.S.C.  345, 380, 28 U.S.C.A.  345, 380.\n Appellants press here the objection made below that the case is not one for a court of three judges as prescribed by  266 of the Judicial Code, and that consequently this Court is without jurisdiction to pass on the merits of the appeal taken directly from the district court, a contention which requires our consideration of the nature of the cause of action and of the relief sought and awarded. See Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co. v. Oklahoma Packing Co., \n292 \nU.S. 386\n, 54 S.Ct. 732. \n\n[306 \nU.S. 573, 577]\n\u00a0\n The bill of complaint states that appellee, a fraternal benefit life insurance association, organized under the laws of Nebraska, purchased on June 1, 1930, school bonds issued by the Board of Education of the Borough of Runnemede, which is coterminous with the school district of Runnemede; that default having occurred in the payment of principal and interest on the bonds remaining unpaid, appellee brought suit upon them in a federal court and on December 5, 1935, recovered a judgment against the Board of Education in the sum of $21,776.21, execution upon which was returned unsatisfied; and that appellee then began in the federal district court for New Jersey a suit for mandamus, which is still pending undecided, to compel the proper officers of the Borough to assess and collect taxes for payment of appellee's judgment.\n The bill of complaint further alleges that appellee's contract, acquired by the purchase of the bonds, has been impaired in violation of the contract clause of the Constitution (Art. 1,  10, U.S.C.A.Const.) by the later enactment of c. 195, and  17 of c. 258, New Jersey Laws of 1935, R.S.1937, 52:27-46, 52:27-62, which extended the stay provisions of the State Municipal Finance Commission Act ( 351, 352, 354, Municipal Finance Commission Act, as amended by  8, 9, c. 330, New Jersey Laws of 1933, c. 191, New Jersey Laws of 1935, R.S.1937, 52:27-32.1, 52:27-33, 52: 27-33.2) to a school district whenever the Commission shall function in a municipality which is coterminous with the school district. In that event  17 stays suits and proceedings for recovery on school bonds of the municipality and stays execution on judgments in such suits, except that the Supreme Court or one of its justices is given discretionary power on application, prescribed by the statute, to authorize the suit to proceed, or execution to issue, under conditions calculated to secure equality of treatment of all creditors.\n Section 103 of the Municipal Finance Act, R.S.1937, 52:27-3, provides that upon petition of a municipality showing that it 'is not in a position to meet its obligations when due', a justice of the Supreme Court is authorized to make an order to that effect, whereupon the 'commission shall function' in that municipality 'with all the powers and duties conferred by this chapter'. It is alleged in the bill of complaint, and was found below, that a justice of the Supreme Court had determined that the Borough of Runnemede was unable to meet its obligations and that the Commission, pursuant to the statute, then commenced to function and has since functioned in the Borough and in its coterminous school district.\n As a further impairment of appellee's contract the bill of complaint alleges that in 1930, when the school district bonds were issued, the statutes of New Jersey provided \n\n[306 \nU.S. 573, 578]\n\u00a0\n that taxes levied on property within the state should be paid only in lawful money of the United States, but that  6 of c. 330 of the New Jersey Laws of 1933, R.S.1937, 52:27-26, authorizes the governing body of a municipality in which the Commission is functioning to compromise and adjust delinquent taxes due the municipality, except claims for taxes in excess of $500, which may not be so compromised without the written assent of the Commission; that acting under these provisions the Commission has given its written assent to compromises previously authorized by the Runnemede Borough Council, whereby bonds were received in payment of taxes due the Borough in excess of $500, thus impairing the security and obligation of appellee's bonds.\n The bill of complaint prays a judicial declaration that appellee's right to compel a levy and collection of taxes for the satisfaction of its judgment is governed by  35 of the Execution Act of New Jersey, 2 Comp. Stat. of New Jersey, p. 2256, and  237 of the School Law of New Jersey, 4 Comp.Stat. of New Jersey, p. 4804, R.S.1937, 2:26-85, in force in 1930, when the school bonds were issued; that the statutes assailed, c. 330, New Jersey Laws of 1933, cc. 195 and 258, New Jersey Laws of 1935, all as amended and supplemented, be declared unconstitutional and void as infringing the contract clause; that the Commission be enjoined from functioning in the Borough of Runnemede and from assenting to the compromise of delinquent taxes of the Borough for any sum less than the full amount due, and that appellant Tax Collector be enjoined from carrying into effect any such compromise; that appellants, the Borough's Assessors and its Tax Collector, be enjoined from assessing and collecting taxes for the year 1936 without including in them the amount of appellee's judgment.\n The trial court sustained the allegations of the bill by its findings and granted the relief prayed, except that it declined to enjoin any action by the Assessors and Col- \n\n[306 \nU.S. 573, 579]\n\u00a0\n lector with respect to the assessment and collection of 1936 taxes. In enjoining the Commission from functioning in the Borough the court directed that its decree should be 'without prejudice to any of the powers or duties of the Municipal Finance Commission under the Municipal Finance Commission Act except as the stays therein contained affect the right of the complainant to enforce its judgment.' The decree in its practical operation thus enjoined no action by the Commission and amounted to no more than a declaration that the stay provisions of the challenged statute were invalid and unenforceable.\n By  266 of the Judicial Code, a suit in which application is made and pressed for an interlocutory injunction 'restraining the enforcement, operation, or execution of any statute of a State by restraining the action of any officer of such State in the enforcement or execution of such statute, or in the enforcement or execution of an order made by an administrative board or commission' is required to be heard by a court of three judges constituted as the section prescribes. The section also declares that 'a direct appeal to the Supreme Court may be taken from a final decree granting or denying a permanent injunction in such suit.' Our jurisdiction to hear the appeal on the merits, which is now challenged, turns upon the question whether the present is 'such suit'.\n The reasons for the adoption of the extraordinary procedure prescribed by  266 of the Judicial Code in the class of cases defined by it, and the rule that it may be invoked only when the suit is one to restrain state officers, have often been pointed out. Ex parte Collins, \n277 \nU.S. 565\n, 48 S.Ct. 585; Ex parte Public National Bank, \n278 \nU.S. 101\n, 49 S.Ct. 43; Stratton v. St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co., \n282 \nU.S. 10\n, 51 S.Ct. 8; Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co. v. Oklahoma Packing Co., supra. This requirement is one of substance, not of form, and it is not satisfied by joining, as nominal parties defendant \n\n[306 \nU.S. 573, 580]\n\u00a0\n state officers whose action is not the effective means of the enforcement or execution of the challenged statute. See Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co. v. Oklahoma Packing Co., supra, 292 U.S. page 391, 54 S.Ct. page 734.\n By its terms  266 embraces only those cases in which an interlocutory injunction is sought to prevent the operation of a state statute 'by restraining the action' of a state officer 'in the enforcement or execution of such statute'. Here it appears on the face of the bill of complaint, and from the findings, that the statutes assailed as unconstitutional are those prescribing a stay of suit or execution against any municipality and its coterminous school district in which the commission is functioning, and also the statute which permits a compromise of delinquent taxes by such a municipality and school district. The only state officers against whom an junction is sought are the members of the Commission. But they are clothed with no authority to enforce the challenged statutes and have taken no steps to enforce them. The stays prescribed by the statute become effective with respect to any particular municipality by virtue of other statutory provisions whenever the state Supreme Court finds that the municipality is unable to meet its obligations. The order of the Supreme Court promulgating its finding is the decisive action which calls the stay provisions into operation, and when that action is taken the statute becomes self-executing. The Commission is thus without power to grant or withhold a stay, and as the form of the decree, already noted, shows, there is no occasion to enjoin action by the Commission as the means of preventing operation of the stay provisions.\n The Commission is similarly without authority to enforce the provisions of the Act of 1933, authorizing the compromise of delinquent taxes. Its written assent, prerequisite to execution of a compromise which the Commission cannot command, is not an order within the \n\n[306 \nU.S. 573, 581]\n\u00a0\n meaning of  266. Great Northern Railway Co. v. United States, \n277 \nU.S. 172\n, 48 S.Ct. 466. The Borough Council, whose members are not state officers and are not parties to the present suit, is the exclusive agency for arranging the compromise. The effective agent for carrying the statute into execution is appellant Borough Tax Collector, who is not a state officer. The functions which the Council and the Collector perform, affecting the collection of taxes for payment of the local school district bonds, are not state, but local functions, and a suit for an injunction restraining such action by local officers is not within  266. Ex parte Collins, supra; Ex Parte Public National Bank of New York, supra; cf. Spielman Motor Sales Co. v. Dodge, \n295 \nU.S. 89\n, 55 S. Ct. 678.\n Even though the written assent of the Commission, without which there can be no compromise of tax claims in excess of $500, be said to be action in 'execution' of the statute, we think this case is not one for a court of three judges, because the injunction sought against the Commission is but incidental to the sole purpose of the suit to prevent the performance by local officers of a local function. The members of the Commission are not necessary parties to the suit, and there is no occasion for relief against them in addition to that sought against the Collector. The Commission, in the performance of its statutory duty, acts only to approve the exercise by local officers of an authority conferred on them as such. A suit to restrain the latter from carrying into execution a state statute by performance of the local function which it authorizes is not to be brought within the purview of  266 by the expedient of adding as nominal parties state officers whose presence is not necessary to prevent the operation of the challenged statute and whose only action is the approval of that of local officers to be taken under it. In such circumstances their presence in the suit generates no interest which it is the purpose of  266 to \n\n[306 \nU.S. 573, 582]\n\u00a0\n protect and must be regarded as colorable only for the purpose of securing the advantages of proceeding before a court of three judges, as was the presence of the state officers in Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co. v. Oklahoma Packing Co., supra, where it was held that there was no appeal under  266.\n The extraordinary procedure before a court of three judges, designed for a specific class of cases sharply defined by the statute, cannot properly be extended to cases in which there is no substantial basis for relief by injunction restraining the action of state officers in enforcing or carrying into effect a challenged state statute of general application. Ex parte Collins, supra; Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co. v. Oklahoma Packing Co., supra, 292 U.S. page 391, 54 S.Ct. page 734. Here the issue is not one of jurisdiction of the district court as a federal court, see Ex parte Poresky, \n290 \nU.S. 30, 31\n, 54 S.Ct. 3, 4; Healy v. Ratta, \n292 \nU.S. 263\n, 54 S.Ct. 700, but is whether a final hearing by three judges is prescribed by the section and hence whether this Court has jurisdiction to hear the appeal. Smith v. Wilson, \n273 \nU.S. 388\n, 47 S.Ct. 385. As the case was not one for which a court of three judges is prescribed by  266, no appeal lies to this Court and it is without jurisdiction to hear the merits of the appeal.\n In the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction, this Court has authority to give such directions as may be appropriate to enforce the limitations of  266, and may frame its mandate in such manner as will save to appellants their appropriate remedy by appeal to the proper court. Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co. v. Oklahoma Packing Co., supra; Gully v. Interstate Natural Gas Co., \n292 \nU.S. 16\n, 54 S.Ct. 565. But as is indicated by the briefs, appellants have already taken an appeal from the decree below to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, and it thus appears that their remedy will be preserved by dismissing the appeal to this Court without more.\n The appeal will be dismissed with costs to appellants. See Mansfield, Coldwater & Lake Michigan Ry. Co. v. Swan, \n111 \nU.S. 379\n, \n\n[306 \nU.S. 573, 583]\n\u00a0\n 387, 4 S.Ct. 510, 514; Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co. v.

MORGENTHAU(1939)\nNo. 717\nArgued: May 1, 1939Decided: May 15, 1939\n\n\n\n Mr. William D. Mitchell, of New York City, for appellant. \n\n[307 \nU.S. 171, 172]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Robert H. Jackson, Sol. Gen., and Phillip E. Buck, of Washington, D.C., for appellees.\n\n PER CURIAM.\n Appellant, an importer and distributor of alcoholic beverages, having been denied the right to import its product into the United States under the label of 'blended Scotch whisky', upon the ground that it was improperly labeled, brought this suit against the Secretary of the Treasury and other officials to enjoin them from refusing to release the product from customs custody upon payment of the required customs duties. Appellant also asked for a declaratory judgment that the Federal Alcohol Administration Act, 49 Stat. 977, 1965,  5(e), 27 U.S.C.A.  205(e) is unconstitutional and void and that Regulations No. 5 promulgated thereunder, and particularly Sections 21(k), 34(f) and 46(a) of these Regulations, are unenforceable as against appellant and are without warrant of statutory authority.\n In the view that the question of the Validity of an Act of Congress was involved and that the suit was within the purview of Section 3 of the Act of Congress of August 24, 1937, 50 Stat. 751, 28 U.S.C.A.  380a, the case was heard below by a court of three judges, which denied an application for preliminary injunction and dismissed the complaint. D.C., 25 F.Supp. 771. From its decree a direct appeal has been taken to this Court.\n Section 3 of the Act of Congress of August 24, 1937, providing for a court of three judges and a direct appeal to this Court, is not applicable unless the questions raised as to the constitutional validity of an Act of Congress are substantial. California Water Service Company v. Redding, \n304 \nU.S. 252, 254\n, 255 S., 58 S.Ct. 865, 866, 867\n\n\n Here, the Federal Alcohol Administration Act was attacked upon the ground that the Twenty-first Amend- \n\n[307 \nU.S. 171, 173]\n\u00a0\n ment to the Federal Constitution, U.S.C.A., gives to the States complete and exclusive control over commerce in intoxicating liquors, unlimited by the commerce clause, and hence that Congress has no longer authority to control the importation of these commodities into the United States. We see no substance in this contention.\n The other contentions of appellant assailed the Regulations and administrative action thereunder rather than the Act of Congress. So far as the Federal Alcohol Administration Act itself is concerned, no substantial question of constitutional validity was raised.\n Section 3 of the Act of Congress of August 24, 1937, while providing for a procedure analogous to that under Section 266 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  380, 28 U.S.C.A.  380, creates a distinction which we think is controlling. Section 266 of the Judicial Code provides for a court of three judges where an injunction is sought to restrain the enforcement 'of any statute of a State' or 'of an order made by an administrative board or commission acting under and pursuant to the statutes of such State', upon the ground of unconstitutionality. The provision in relation to administrative orders was added by an amendment to the original section. Act of March 4, 1913, 37 Stat. 1013. While that addition has been said to be unnecessary, as such orders were previously covered (Oklahoma Natural Gas Company v. Russell, \n261 \nU.S. 290, 292\n, 43 S.Ct. 353, Congress adopted the amendment out of abundant caution. But with these provisions of Section 266 before it, Congress in enacting Section 3 of the Act of August 24, 1937, did not refer to 'any statute' or to administrative orders, but confined its requirement to cases of attack upon an 'Act of Congress' upon the ground that 'such Act or any part thereof is repugnant to the Constitution of the United States'. This is not an apt description of administrative regulations or orders. We must regard the choice of language as deliberate and as indicating a limitation deemed to be advisable. It does not appear to have been the intention of Congress that \n\n[307 \nU.S. 171, 174]\n\u00a0\n direct appeal should lie to this Court when administrative action and not the Act of Congress is assailed.\n While we are of the opinion that the Court is without jurisdiction to review the merits on this appeal, the Court does have jurisdiction to make such corrective order as may be appropriate to the enforcement of the limitations$ which Section 3 imposes, and in the circumstances disclosed the appropriate action is to vacate the decree below and to remand the cause to the District Court for further proceedings to be taken independently of Section 3 of the Act of August 24, 1937. See Gully v. Interstate Natural Gas Co., \n292 \nU.S. 16\n, 54 S.Ct. 565; Oklahoma Gas Co. v.

It has permission under the Federal Motor Carrier Act, 1935,1 to operate as a contract carrier, and claims the right to transport whiskey as heretofore, notwithstanding inhibitions of the Kentucky Alcoholic Beverage Control Law approved March 7, 1938.2 By this proceeding it \n\n[308 \nU.S. 132, 134]\n\u00a0\n seeks to restrain officers of the State from enforcing the contraband and penal provisions of that enactment.\n The bill charges that to enforce the Control Law would impair appellant's rights under the Commerce Clause, Federal Constitution, U.S.C. A.Const. art. 1,  8, cl. 3, and deprive it of the Due Process and Equal Protection guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. The District Court- three judges sitting-sustained a motion to dismiss. 24 F.Supp. 924. A direct appeal brings the matter here.\n The Statute is a long, comprehensive measure (123 sections) designed rigidly to regulate the production and distribution of alcoholic beverages through means of licenses and otherwise. The manifest purpose is to channelize the traffic, minimize the commonly attendant evils; also to facilitate the collection of revenue. To this end manufacture, sale, transportation, and possession are permitted only under carefully prescribed conditions and subject to constant control by the state. Every phase of the traffic is declared illegal unless definitely allowed. The property becomes contraband upon failure to observe the statutory requirement and whenever found in unauthorized possession.\n Section 52 provides-'It shall be a criminal offense for any person to manufacture, store, sell, purchase, transport or otherwise in any manner traffic in alcoholic beverages as that term is defined in this Act, without first having paid to the Department of Revenue at its office in Frankfort, the license tax required by this Act, and without first having obtained the license required by this Act.' \n3\n\u00a0\n\n Section 53 declares to be contraband: '(2) Any spirituous, vinous or malt liquors in the possession of any one not entitled to possession of the same under the pro- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 132, 135]\n\u00a0\n visions of this Act.' \n4\n Peace officers are authorized to seize such contraband and institute proceedings for forfeiture.\n Licenses are authorized, sec. 18(1)-(9)5 for distillers, rectifiers, vintners, wholesalers, retailers, and, sec. 18(7)6 for the transportation of liquors to and from any point in the state. Privileges which may be exercised under these are definitely set out.\n Section 21-'A distiller's, rectifier's or Vintner's license, as the case may be, shall authorize the holder thereof, at \n\n[308 \nU.S. 132, 136]\n\u00a0\n the premises specifically designated in the license, to engage in the business of distiller, rectifier, or vintner, as the case may be, as those terms are defined in this Act, and to transport for himself only any alcoholic beverage which he is authorized under this license to manufacture or sell, ....'7\n Section 22-'Sales and deliveries of alcoholic beverages may be made at wholesale, and from the licensed premises only, ... (3) by licensed distillers, rectifiers or vintners for export out of the Commonwealth; provided, no distiller, rectifier or vintner, shall sell or contract to sell, give away or deliver any alcoholic beverages to any person, who is not duly authorized by the law of the State of his residence and of the Federal Government if located in the United States, to receive and possess said alcoholic beverages; and in no event shall he sell or contract to sell, give away or deliver, any of his products to any retailer or consumer in Kentucky.' \n 8\n\u00a0\n\n Section 27-'A Transporter's License shall authorize the holder to transport distilled spirits and wine to or from the licensed premises of any licensee under this Act, provided' etc. \n9\n Section 54(7)-'A Transporter's License as provided for in section 18(7) of this Act shall be issued only to persons who are authorized by proper certificate from the Division of Motor Transportation in the Department of Business Regulation to engage in the business of a common carrier.' \n10\n\u00a0\n\n Section 89-'No person except a railroad company or railway express company shall transport or cause to be transported any distilled spirits or wine, otherwise than as provided in this Act, except such beverages may be \n\n[308 \nU.S. 132, 137]\n\u00a0\n transported by the holder of any license authorized by section 18 of this Act, from and to express or freight depots to and from the premises covered by the license of the person so transporting distilled spirits or wine.' \n11\n\u00a0\n\n A license may only issue, sec. 33,12 upon an application which incorporates, sec. 36(5),13 a promise that 'the applicant will in all respects and in good faith conscientiously abide by all the provisions of this Act and of any other Act or ordinance relating to alcoholic beverages' etc. Also, sec. 37,14 there must be a bond 'conditioned that such applicant, if granted the license sought, will not suffer or permit any violation of the provisions of this Act' etc.\n Having been denied a Common Carrier's Certificate, appellant sought and was refused a transporter's license because it held no such certificate.\n In sum, counsel for appellant say: The complaint charges that the Control Law is unconstitutional because repugnant to the Commerce, Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Federal Constitution in that, under pain of excessive penalties, it undertakes to prevent an authorized interstate contract carrier from continuing an established business of transporting exports of liquors from Kentucky in interstate commerce exclusively. Also: Intoxicating liquors are legitimate articles of interstate commerce unless Federal law has declared otherwise. Interstate commerce includes both importation of property within a state and exportation therefrom. Prior to the Wilson and Webb-Kenyon Acts, and the Twenty-first Amendment, the powers of the states over intoxicants in both of these movements were limited by the \n\n[308 \nU.S. 132, 138]\n\u00a0\n Commerce, Clause. These enactments relate to importations only. Exports remain, as always, subject to that clause. 'Although a state may prohibit the manufacture of liquor, if a state permits distillation, sale and transportation-as Kentucky does-the rule of law is that the state may not annex to its consent to manufacture and sell the unconstitutional ban upon carriage of interstate exports of liquors by contract carriers.'\n The court below rejected appellant's insistence and affirmed the asserted power of the state.

Clifton, 249 Ky. 815, 61 S.W.2d 645, 88 A.L.R. 1361\n\n\n The Twnenty-first Amendment sanctions the right of a state to legislate concerning intoxicating liquors brought from without, unfettered by the Commerce Clause. Without doubt a state may absolutely prohibit the manufacture of intoxicants, their transportation, sale, or possession, irrespective of when or where produced or obtained, or the use to which they are to be put. Further, she may adopt measures reasonably appropriate to effectuate these inhibitions and exercise full police authority in respect of them. Clark Distilling Co. v. Western Maryland Ry. Co., \n242 \nU.S. 311, 320\n, 37 S.Ct. 180, 182, L.R.A.1917B, 1218, Ann.Cas. 1917B, 845; Crane v. Campbell, \n245 \nU.S. 304, 307\n, 38 S.Ct. 98, 99; Seaboard Air Line Ry. v. North Carolina, \n245 \nU.S. 298, 304\n, 38 S.Ct. 96, 98; Samuels v. McCurdy, \n267 \nU.S. 188, 197\n, 198 S., 45 S.Ct. 264, 266, 267, 37 A.L.R. 1378.\n Having power absolutely to prohibit manufacture, sale, transportation, or possession of intoxicants, was it permissible for Kentucky to permit these things only under definitely prescribed conditions. Former opinions here make an affirmative answer imperative. The greater power includes the less. Seaboard Air Line Ry. v. North Carolina, supra. The state may protect her people \n\n[308 \nU.S. 132, 139]\n\u00a0\n against evil incident to intoxicants, Mugler v. Kansas, \n123 \nU.S. 623\n, 8 S. Ct. 273; Kidd v. Pearson, \n128 \nU.S. 1\n, 9 S.Ct. 6; and may exercise large discretion as to means employed.\n Kentucky has seen fit to permit manufacture of whiskey only upon condition that it be sold to an indicated class of customers and transported in definitely specified ways. These conditions are not unreasonable and are clearly appropriate for effectuating the policy of limiting traffic in order to minimize well known evils, and secure payment of revenue. The statute declares whiskey removed from permitted channels contraband subject to immediate seizure. This is within the police power of the state; and property so circumstanced cannot be regarded as a proper article of commerce. Sligh v. Kirkwood, \n237 \nU.S. 52, 59\n, 35 S.Ct. 501, 502; Clason v. Indiana, \n306 \nU.S. 439\n, 59 S.Ct. 609.\n In effect we are asked by injunction to allow a distiller to do what the statute prohibits-deliver to an unauthorized carrier. Also to enable a carrier to do what it is prohibited from doing-receive and transport within the state.\n Kidd v. Pearson, supra: An Act of the Iowa Legislature in general terms forbade manufacture or sale of intoxicating liquor but permitted these for mechanical or other purposes. An injunction was approved which restrained Kidd from operating his distillery although he claimed the output would be exported for sale beyond the state. This Court said (\n128 \nU.S. 1\n, 9 S.Ct. 11): 'Whether a state, in the exercise of its undisputed power of local administration, can enact a statute prohibiting within its limits the manufacture of intoxicating liquors, except for certain purposes, is not any longer an open question before this court . ... The police power of a state is as broad and plenary as its taxing power, and property within the state is subject to the operations of the former so long as it is within the regulating restrictions of the latter.' \n\n[308 \nU.S. 132, 140]\n\u00a0\n The doctrine of that case has been often applied. Geer v. Connecticut, \n161 \nU.S. 519\n, 16 S.Ct. 600; Rippey v. Texas, \n193 \nU.S. 504, 509\n, 24 S.Ct. 516, 517; Hudson Water Co. v. McCarter, \n209 \nU.S. 349, 357\n, 28 S.Ct. 529, 532, 14 Ann.Cas. 560; 'A man cannot acquire a right to property by his desire to use it in commerce among the states. Neither can he enlarge his otherwise limited and qualified right to the same end'; Sligh v. Kirkwood, \n237 \nU.S. 52\n, 35 S.Ct. 501; State Board of Equalization v. Young's Market Co., \n299 \nU.S. 59, 63\n, 57 S.Ct. 77, 78; Clason v. Indiana, \n306 \nU.S. 439\n, 59 S.Ct. 609.\n The two cases last cited recognize that the State may decline to consider certain noxious things legitimate articles of commerce, and inhibit their transportation. Property rights in intoxicants depend on state laws and cease if the liquor becomes contraband.\n We cannot accept appellant's contention that because whiskey is intended for transportation beyond the state lines the distiller may disregard the inhibitions of the statute by delivery to one not authorized to receive; that the carrier may set at naught inhibitions and transport contraband with impunity.\n The point suggested in respect of Due Process is not in accord with what has been decided in the cases above referred to.\n The record shows no violation of Equal Protection. A licensed Common Carrier is under stricter control than an ordinary contract carrier and may be entrusted with privileges forbidden to the latter.\n Here the state law creates no discrimination against interstate commerce. It is subjected to the same regulations as those applicable to intrastate commerce.\n The Motor Carrier Act of 1935 is said to secure to appellant the right claimed, but we can find nothing there which undertakes to destroy state power to protect her people against the evils of intoxicants or to sanction the receipt and conveyance of articles declared contraband. The Act has no such purpose or effect. \n\n[308 \nU.S. 132, 141]\n\u00a0\n The power of a state to regulate her internal affairs notwithstanding the consequent effect upon interstate commerce was much discussed in South Carolina Highway Dept. v. Barnwell Bros., \n303 \nU.S. 177, 189\n, 58 S.Ct. 510, 515, 516. There it was again affirmed that although regulation by the state might impose some burden on interstate commerce this was permissible when 'an inseparable incident of the exercise of a legislative authority, which, under the Constitution, has been left to the states.' In the absence of controlling language to the contrary-and there is none-the Federal Motor Carrier Act should not be brought into conflict with this reiterated doctrine.\n The challenged decree must be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice BUTLER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Aug. 9, 1935, c. 498, 49 Stat. 543, 49 U.S.C.A.  301, et seq. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Kentucky Acts 1938, Ch. 2, Baldwin's Supp. to Carroll's Statutes 1936, ch. 81, sec. 2554b-97, et seq. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Baldwin's Supplement to Carroll's Kentucky Statutes 1936, sec. 2554b-150. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Supra Note (3), sec. 2554b-151.
