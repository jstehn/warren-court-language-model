BRODERICK & BASCOM ROPE CO(1906)\nNo. 187\nArgued: March 1, 1906Decided: March 19, 1906\n\n\n\n\n[201 U.S. 166, 167]\n\u00a0\n This was a bill in equity brought in the circuit court for the eastern district of Missouri by the appellant, a Missouri corporation, against the appellee, another Missouri corporation, for the infringement of a trademark for wire rope, registered under the act of Congress of March 3, 1881 (21 Stat. at L. 502, chap. 138, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3401).\n The bill alleged that the plaintiff, the A. Leschen & Sons Rope Company, in 1888 had 'adopted for its use as a trademark for its highest and best grade of wire rope, a strand of a different color from the other strands of the rope, the said trademark then and now being effected by your orator by painting one of the strands of the rope so as to make it distinctly unlike the other strands of the rope;' that it had continuously used the trademark to the present day; that it had been extensively advertised; that its sale had been very great, and that the company had obtained, December 4, 1900, a registration of such trademark in the office of the Commissioner of Patents.\n The bill further averred that early in the year 1900 the defendant company 'commenced to paint one of the strands of its wire rope so as to make it of a distinctly different color from the other strands of the rope;' that on October 31, 1900, it applied to the Commissioner of Patents for a registration; that the Commissioner declared an interference with the plaintiff, upon which proofs were taken, the case fully \n\n[201 U.S. 166, 168]\n\u00a0\n argued, and plaintiff was declared to be the first to adopt the trademark; that notwithstanding this, defendant continued its unlawful use of this trademark with the intent to defraud plaintiff, to deceive the public, and to take unfair advantage of the demand for plaintiff's wire ropes, and that said mark is being used by said defendant to make sales of rope upon the strength of plaintiff's reputation. The bill further alleged the use of the trademark by both parties in commerce between the United States and foreign countries.\n Defendant demurred on the ground that the trademark set up in the bill was not a lawful and valid trademark. The demurrer was sustained, the bill dismissed (123 Fed. 149), and the decree of the circuit court affirmed by the circuit court of appeals. 67 C. C. A. 418, 134 Fed. 571.\n Messrs. Melville Church, Hervey S. Knight, J. C. Jones, and George H. Knight for appellant. \n\n[201 U.S. 166, 169]\n\u00a0\n No counsel for appellee.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Brown:\n\n Mr. Justice Brown delivered the opinion of the court:\n As both parties are citizens of the state of Missouri, the jurisdiction of the circuit court can only be sustained upon the theory that the case is one arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States.\n By an act of Congress of July 8, 1870 (16 Stat. at L. 198-210,  77, chap. 230), to revise the statutes relating to patents and copyrights (Rev. Stat.  4937), permission was given citizens of the United States and some others, 'who are entitled to the exclusive use of any lawful trademark, or who intend to adopt and use any trademark for exclusive use within the United States,' to obtain registration of such trademark in the Patent Office; and by act of August 14, 1876 (19 Stat. at L. 141, chap. 274), a punishment was provided for a fraudulent use of such trademarks by others. But in the Trademark Cases, \n100 U.S. 82\n, 25 L. ed. 550, this legislation was declared to be unconstitutional, upon the ground that it was intended to embrace all commerce, including that between citizens of the same state; and it was held that, if the power of Congress extended to the registration of trademarks at all, it must be limited to their use in commerce with foreign nations and between the several states and with the Indian tribes.\n Apparently in consequence of this decision, Congress, by act of March 3, 1881 (21 Stat. at L. 502, chap. 138, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3401), passed a new act, declaring that the 'owners of trademarks used in commerce with foreign nations, or with the Indian tribes, provided such owners shall \n\n[201 U.S. 166, 170]\n\u00a0\n be domiciled in the United States, or located in any foreign country, or tribes, which by treaty, convention, or law affords similar privileges to citizens of the United States, may obtain registration of such trademarks . . . by causing to be recorded in the Patent Office a statement specifying name, domicil, location, and citizenship of the party applying ; . . . a description of the trademark itself with facsimiles thereof, and a statement of the mode in which the same is applied and affixed to goods,' etc.\n The registration of the trademark in question contains the following description:\n'The trademark consists of a red or other distinctively colored streak applied to or woven in a wire rope. The color of the streak may be varied at will, so long as it is distinctive from the color any body of the rope.\n\n'The essential feature of the trademark is the streak of distinctive color produced in or applied to a wire rope.\n\n'This mark is usually applied by painting one strand of the wire rope a distinctive color, usually red.'\n\n It is true that the drawing annexed to the registration, a copy of which is here given, as well as the exhibits furnished,\n\n\n\n\n\n show one of the strands colored red; and if the trademark were restricted to a strand thus colored, perhaps it might be sustained; but the description of a colored streak, which would be answered by a streak of any color painted spirally with the strand, longitudinally across the strands, or by a circular streak around the rope, was held by both courts, and we think properly, too indefinite to be the subject of a valid trademark. Certainly a trademark could not be claimed of a rope, the entire \n\n[201 U.S. 166, 171]\n\u00a0\n surface of which was colored; and if color be made the essential feature, it should be so defined, or connected with some symbol or design, that other manufacturers may know what they may safely do. Upon the plaintiff's theory, a wire rope containing a streak of any description or of any color would be an infringement, and a manufacturer honestly desiring to distinguish his wire rope from that of the plaintiff's by difference in color might, by adopting a white streak running along the length of the rope across the strands, find himself an infringer, when his real object may have been to obtain a mark which would distinguish his manufacture from that of the plaintiff's. Even if it were conceded that a person might claim a wire rope colored red or white, or any other color, it would clearly be too broad to embrace all colors. So, although it might be possible to claim the imprint of a colored figure on a wire rope, the figure should be so described that other manufacturers would know how to avoid it. If the trademark be a colored streak, it should be, at least, described, and a statement of the mode in which the same is applied and affixed to the rope; and a trademark which may be infringed by a streak of any color, however applied, is manifestly too broad.\n It would not aid plaintiff's case even if it were shown that it made use of a colored strand, and that defendant made use of a strand similarly colored, since the trademark must stand or fall in its entirety, and if the description therein be too broad, it cannot be sustained by showing that defendant imitated its color and its method of applying it. Perhaps, however, the defendant might be liable under a bill framed upon the theory that it was endeavoring to dispose of its goods as those of the plaintiff.\n Whether mere color can constitute a valid trademark may admit of doubt. Doubtless it may, if it be impressed in a particular design, as a circle, square, triangle, a cross, or a star. But the authorities do not go farther than this. In the case of Re Hanson's Trademark, L. R. 37 Ch. Div. 112, in which a trademark was claimed for a red, white, and blue label, in imitation \n\n[201 U.S. 166, 172]\n\u00a0\n of the French tri-color, for French coffee, it was held not entitled to registration under the English statute, which requires a trademark to be distinctive in order to be valid. The court remarked as follows:\n'It is the plain intention of the act that, where the distinction of the mark depends upon color, that will not do. You may register a mark, which is otherwise distinctive, in color, and that gives you the right to use it in any color you like; but you can not register a mark of which the only distinction is the use of a color, because practically, under the terms of the act, that would give you a monopoly of all the colors of the rainbow.'\n\n It is unnecessary to express an opinion whether, if the trademark had been restricted to a strand of rope distinctively colored, it would have been valid. As already observed, the claim is much broader than this. Nor car we assume jurisdiction of this case as one wherein the defendant had made use of plaintiff's device for the purpose of defrauding the plaintiff and palming off its goods upon the public as of the plaintiff's manufacture. Our jurisdiction depends solely upon the question whether plaintiff has a registered trademark, valid under the act of Congress, and, for the reasons above given, we think it has not.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","1":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nALABAMA & V R. CO. v. RAILROAD COMMISSION OF STATE OF MISSISSIPPI(1906)\nNo. 97\nArgued: Decided: December 17, 1906\n\n\n\n On November 16, 1903, the railroad commission of Mississippi, by written order, directed the Alabama & Vicksburg Railway Company, hereinafter called the Vicksburg company, to put into effect, over its line of road from Vicksburg to Meridian, a flat rate of 3 1\/2 cents per 100 pounds on grain and grain products. December 3, 1903, an application was made by the railway company to the chancellor of the fifth chancery district of the state to restrain the enforcement of this order. July 11, 1904, a temporary injunction issued on the filing of the bill was dissolved and the bill dismissed. On appeal to the supreme court of the state this decree of the chancellor was affirmed (86 Miss. 667, 38 So. 356 ), and thereupon this writ of error was sued out.\n Messrs. Harry H. Hall and McWillie & Thompson for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n[203 U.S. 496, 497]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Hannis Taylor, C. H. Alexander, and Monroe McClurg for defendant in error.\n\n\n[203 U.S. 496, 499]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n The facts in this case are few. The company made what it called a 'rebilling rate' of 3 1\/2 cents per 100 pounds on grain and grain products shipped from Vicksburg to Meridian, that rate, however, being applicable only in case of shipments over the Vicksburg, Shreveport, & Pacific Railroad, hereinafter called the Shreveport road. Instead of being enforced as solely a rebilling rate, the Vicksburg merchant who received a car load of grain or grain products over the Shreveport road was permitted to either forward it over the plaintiff's road to Meridian, or, at any time within ninety days, in lieu thereof, send a similar car load, no matter whence received, from Vicksburg to Meridian at the same rate. It was in consequence of this effort on the part of the plaintiff to favor shippers who brought grain to Vicksburg over the Shreveport road that the \n\n[203 U.S. 496, 500]\n\u00a0\n railroad commission made the order declaring that all grain products shipped from Vicksburg to Meridian should be at the same rate, 3 1\/2 cents per 100 pounds. The order of the commission merely meant this: If a Vicksburg merchant who received a car load of grain over the Shreveport road was permitted by the railway company to ship over the Vicksburg road to Meridian any other car load 3 1\/2 cents per 100 pounds, every other merchant in Vicksburg should be permitted to ship at the same rate, although he had had no dealings with the Shreveport company. It is unnecessary to inquire whether the order could be sustained if it appeared that the plaintiff received only 3 1\/2 cents as its share of a total rate on through shipments to Meridian from the Northwest by the Shreveport road; for here, under the guise of a rebilling rate, the Vicksburg merchant who dealt with this Western road was given a rate of 3 1\/2 per cent on any grain that he might see fit to ship to Meridian. While it may be true that a local railway's share of an interstate rate may not be a legitimate basis upon which a state railroad commission can establish and enforce a purely local rate, yet, whenever, under the guise or pretense of a rebilling rate, some merchants are given a low local rate, the commission is justified in making that rate the rate for all. It is not bound to inquire whether it furnishes adequate return to the railway company, for the state may insist upon equality, to be enforced under the same conditions against all who perform a public or quasi public service. When voluntarily the Vicksburg company established a local rate of 3 1\/2 per cent from Vicksburg to Meridian for those who had, within 90 days, made a shipment over the Shreveport road, it estopped itself from complaining of an order making that rate applicable to all shipments, no matter whence they arose, and in favor of all merchants, whether those transporting over the Shreveport road or not.\n We are not unaware of our decision in Texas & P. R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n162 U.S. 197\n, 40 L. ed. 940, 5 Inters. Com. Rep. 405, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 666, in which, on review of the interstate commerce act, we held that \n\n[203 U.S. 496, 501]\n\u00a0\n a mere inequality of rate was not always proof of undue discrimination, but we were passing upon an act of Congress, and seeking to ascertain its intent and scope. There was no intimation that it was not within the power of Congress to prescribe an absolute equality of rate. In the present case we are not construing an act of the state of Mississippi or passing upon the powers which by it are given to the state railroad commission. Those matters are settled by the decision of the supreme court of the state, and the question we have to consider is the power of the state to enforce an equality of local rates as between all parties shipping for the same distance over the same road. That a state has such power cannot be doubted, and it cannot be thwarted by any action of a railroad company which does not involve an actual interstate shipment, although done with a view of promoting the business interests of the company. Even if a state may not compel a railroad company to do business at a loss, and conceding that a railroad company may insist, as against the power of the state, upon the right to establish such rates as will afford reasonable compensation for the services rendered, yet, when it voluntarily establishes local rates for some shippers, it cannot resist the power of the state to enforce the same rates for all. The state may insist upon equality as between all its citizens, and that equality cannot be defeated in respect to any local shipments by arrangements made with or to favor outside companies.\n We see no error in the ruling of the Supreme Court of the State of Mississippi, and its judgment is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","2":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nALABAMA GREAT SOUTHERN R. CO. v. THOMPSON(1906)\nNo. 58\nArgued: Decided: January 2, 1906\n\n\n\n Messrs. Edward Colston, Judson Harmon, Edmund F. Trabue, A. W. Goldsmith, and George Hoadly for the railway company.[ Alabama Great Southern R Co v. Thompson \n200 U.S. 206\n (1906) ]\n\n\n[200 U.S. 206, 209]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. E. S. Daniels, J. V. Williams, and John O. Benson for Thompson, administrator.\n\n\n\n[200 U.S. 206, 211]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case is here on a certificate from the United States circuit court of appeals for the sixth circuit. The certificate states the facts and propounds the questions as follows:\n'This was an action in tort, brought by the administrator of Florence James for the negligent killing of the intestate by the defendant railroad company.\n\n'The suit was started in a circuit court of the state of Tennessee, and a declaration was there filed.\n\n'The plaintiff was a citizen of Tennessee.\n\n'The defendants were the Alabama Great Southern Railway Company, a corporation organized under the laws of Alabama, and William H. Mills and Edgar Fuller, both citizens of the state of Tennessee.\n\n'The case was then removed into the court below upon petition of the railroad company alone, upon the ground that a separable controversy, involving more than $2,000, exclusive of interest and costs, existed between the petitioner and the plaintiff, as to whom diversity of citizenship existed, which could be tried out without the presence of either of the individual codefendants of petitioner. \n\n[200 U.S. 206, 212]\n\u00a0\n 'A motion to remand to the state court because no removable separable controversy appeared was overruled.\n\n'Thereupon an issue was made and the case heard by court and jury, and a judgment rendered in favor of the plaintiff, and against the railroad company alone.\n\n'From this judgment the railroad company sued out this writ of error.\n\n'Upon the hearing in this court, the court raised the question as to whether the court below had rightfully acquired jurisdiction by the removal proceedings referred to, the removal being grounded only upon the question of separable controversy appearing upon the face of the declaration of the plaintiff at the time of the application for removal.\n\n'That declaration substantially averred that the intestate of the plaintiff had been negligently, wrongfully, and carelessly run over while upon the track of the railroad company, in the exercise of due care, by an engine and train of cars owned and operated by the railroad company, which said train was, at the time, under the management and control of the individual defendants, William H. Mills, as conductor, and Edgar Fuller, as engineer.\n\n'Entertaining giave doubt as to whether a joint right of action was stated against the railroad company and the two individual defendants, who were servants of the railroad company, it is ordered that the foregoing statement be certified to the Supreme Court, and that the instruction of that court be requested for the proper decision of the following questions which arise upon the record:\n\n'1. May a railroad corporation be jointly sued with two of its servants, one the conductor and the other the engineer of one of its trains, when it is sought to make the corporation liable only by reason of the negligent act of its said conductor and engineer in the operation of a train under their management and control, and solely upon the ground of the responsibility of a principal for the act of his servant, though not personally \n\n[200 U.S. 206, 213]\n\u00a0\n present or directing, and not charged with any concurrent act of negligence?\n\n'Is such a suit removable by the corporation, as a separable controversy, when the amount involved exceeds $2,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and the requisite diversity of citizenship exists between the said company and the plaintiff, the citizenship of the individual defendants sued with the company as joint tort-feasors being identical with that of the plaintiff?'\n\n A question certified must be one the answer to which is to aid the court in determining a case before it. Columbus Watch Co. v. Robbins, \n148 U.S. 266\n, 37 L. ed. 445, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 594. And it is evident that the matter to be determined in the case pending, desiring which the opinion of this court is asked, is the removability of the case brought in the state court against the railroad company and the individual defendants. We shall answer the questions in that view.\n The right to remove the controversy is founded upon  2 of the act of March 3, 1887 [24 Stat. at L. 553, chap. 373], as corrected August 13, 1888 (1 U. S. Rev. Stat. Supp. 611, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 509). It is therein provided, among other things, 'and when, in any suit mentioned in this section, there shall be a controversy which is wholly between citizens of different states, and which can be fully determined as between them, then either one or more of the defendants actually interested in such controversy may remove said suit into the circuit court of the United States for the proper district.'\n The case was removed upon the theory that it contains a separable controversy between the nonresident railroad company and the plaintiff. The removal act of 1875 [18 Stat. at L. 470, chap. 137], as amended in 1887-88, in the part quoted above as to separable controversies, has been the subject of frequent adjudication in this court. Independent of statute, there is much conflict in the authorities as to whether a corporation whose liability does not arise from an act of concurrence or direction on its part, but solely as a result of the relation of master and servant, may be jointly sued with the servant whose negligent conduct directly \n\n[200 U.S. 206, 214]\n\u00a0\n caused the injury. In a leading case in this court (Chesapeake & O. R. Co. v. Dixon, \n179 U.S. 131\n, 45 L. ed. 121, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 67), many of the cases were reviewed by the chief justice who delivered the opinion, and it was shown that in a number of English and American cases it has been held that, as to third persons, the master is responsible for the negligence of his servant in a joint action against both, to recover damages for an injury. In the case of Warax v. Cincinnati, N. O. & T. P. R. Co. 72 Fed. 637, a case which has been much cited and sometimes followed in the Federal courts, it was held that a joint action could not be sustained against master and servant for acts done without the master's concurrence or direction, when his responsibility arises wholly from the policy of the law, which requires that he shall be held liable for the acts of those he employs in the prosecution of his business. And it was held that the petition against the engineer and the company presented a case of misjoinder, and could be removed on the application of the nonresident company.\n In the case of Powers v. Chesapeake & O. R. Co. \n169 U.S. 92\n, 42 L. ed. 673, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 264, 265, suit was brought against a railroad company and several of its servants for an injury alleged to have been caused by the joint negligence of all. Mr. Justice Gray, delivering the opinion of the court, said:\n'It is well settled that an action of tort, which might have been brought against many persons or against any one or more of them, and which is brought in a state court against all jointly, contains no separate controversy which will authorize its removal by some of the defendants into the circuit court of the United States, even if they file separate answers and set up different defenses from the other defendants, and allege that they are not jointly liable with them, and that their own controversy with the plaintiff is a separate one; for, as this court has often said, 'a defendant has no right to say that an action shall be several which the plaintiff seeks to make joint. A separate defense may defeat a joint recovery, but it cannot deprive a plaintiff of his right to prosecute his suit to final decision \n\n[200 U.S. 206, 215]\n\u00a0\n in his own way. The cause of action is the subject-matter of the controversy, and that is, for all the purposes of the suit, whatever the plaintiff declares it to be in his pleadings.' Pirie v. Tvedt, \n115 \nU.S. 41, 43\n, 29 S. L. ed. 331, 332, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1034, 1161; Sloane v. Anderson, \n117 U.S. 275\n, 29 L. ed. 899, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 730; Little v. Giles, \n118 \nU.S. 596, 600\n, 601 S., 30 L. ed. 269-271, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 32; Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Wangelin, \n132 U.S. 599\n, 33 L. ed. 474, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 203; Torrence v. Shedd, \n144 \nU.S. 527, 530\n, 36 S. L. ed. 528, 531, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 726; Connell v. Smiley, \n156 \nU.S. 335, 340\n, 39 S. L. ed. 443, 444, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 353.'\n\n After thus stating the rule, the justice commented on the Warax Case, 72 Fed. 637, as a departure from the former ruling of the circuit court. And while the Powers Case was decided on the ground of the right to remove after the local defendants had been dismissed from the action by the plaintiff, it is patent from the language just quoted from the opinion that, conceding the misjoinder of cause of action appeared on the face of the petition, that fact was not decisive of the right of the nonresident defendant to remove the action to the Federal court.\n And in Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Wangelin, \n132 \nU.S. 599, 600\n, 33 S. L. ed. 474, 475, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 203, the same eminent judge, speaking for the court, said:\n'It often has been decided that an action brought in a state court against two jointly for a tort cannot be removed by either of them into the circuit court of the United States, under the act of March 3, 1875, chap. 137,  2, upon the ground of a separable controversy between the plaintiff and himself, although the defendants have pleaded severally, and the plaintiff might have brought the action against either alone. 18 Stat. at L. 471, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 508; Pirie v. Tvedt, \n115 U.S. 41\n, 29 L. ed. 331, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1034, 1161; Sloane v. Anderson, \n117 U.S. 275\n, 29 L. ed. 899, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 730; Plymouth Consol. Gold Min. Co. v. Amador & S. Canal Co. \n118 U.S. 264\n, 30 L. ed. 232, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1034; Thorn Wire Hedge Co. v. Fuller, \n122 U.S. 535\n, 30 L. ed. 1235, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1265\n\n\n\n'It is equally well settled that in any case the question whether there is a separable controversy which will warrant a removal is to be determined by the condition of the record in the state court at the time of the filing of the petition for removal, independently of the allegations in that petition, or in the affidavit of the petitioner, unless the petitioner both alleges and proves that the defendants were wrongfully made \n\n[200 U.S. 206, 216]\n\u00a0\n joint defendants for the purpose of preventing a removal into the Federal court.'\n\n The language quoted by Mr. Justice Gray in the Powers Case was used by Chief Justice Waite in delivering the opinion of the court in Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Ide, \n114 U.S. 52\n, 29 L. ed. 63, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 735. The Chief Justice said: 'A defendant has no right to say that an action shall be several which a plaintiff elects to make joint. Smith v. Rines, 2 Sumn. 348, Fed. Cas. No. 13,100. A separate defense may defeat a joint recovery, but it cannot deprive a plaintiff of his right to prosecute his own suit to final determination in his own way.' It is true, as suggested by counsel, that Mr. Justice Gray used the word 'seeks' instead of 'elects;' but we do not perceive that this change deprives the doctrine announced of its force and effect.\n The language is used of an action begun in the state court, and it is recognized that the plaintiff may select his own manner of bringing his action, and must stand or fall by his election. It he has improperly joined causes of action, he may fail in his suit; the question may be raised by answer, and the right of the defendant adjudicated. But the question of removability depends upon the state of the pleadings and the record at the time of the application forremoval (Wilson v. Oswego Twp. \n151 \nU.S. 56, 66\n, 38 S. L. ed. 70, 75, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 259), and it has been too frequently decided to be now questioned that the plaintiff may elect his own method of attack, and the case which he makes in his declaration, bill, or complaint, that being the only pleading in the case, is to determine the separable character of the controversy for the purpose of deciding the right of removal.

Rep. 248, an action was brought by Smithson in a state court of Minnesota against the Chicago Great Western Railway Company and Whitcomb \n\n[200 U.S. 206, 217]\n\u00a0\n and Morris, receivers of the Wisconsin Central Company, to recover for personal injuries while serving the Chicago Great Western Railway Company as a fireman, as the result of a collision between the locomotive upon which he was at work and one operated by the receivers, who were officers of the Federal court. The railway company answered, and the receivers filed a petition for removal to the United States circuit court. The case was thereafter remanded by the Federal court, that court holding there was no separable controversy, and that the joinder was in good faith. Upon the trial in the state court a verdict was directed by the court in favor of the railway company. Thereupon the receivers asked permission to file a supplemental petition for removal, and upon proffer of a petition and bond the application was denied, and a verdict was returned against the receivers only. Of this feature of the case the Chief Justice, delivering the opinion of the coutr, said:\n'The contention here is that when the trial court determined to direct a verdict in favor of the Chicago Great Western Railway Company, the result was that the case stood as if the receivers had been sole defendants, and that they then acquired a right of removal which was not concluded by the previous action of the circuit court. This might have been so if, when the cause was called for trial in the state court, plaintiff had discontinued his action against the railway company, and thereby elected to prosecute it against the receivers solely, instead of prosecuting it on the joint cause of action set up in the complaint against all the defendants. Powers v. Chesapeake & O. R. Co. \n169 U.S. 92\n, 42 L. ed. 673, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 264. But that is not this case. The joint liability was insisted on here to the close of the trial, and the nonliability of the railway company was ruled in invitum.'\n\n In other words, the right to remove depended upon the case made in the complaint against both defendants jointly, and that right, in the absence of a showing of fraudident joinder, did not arise from the failure of the complainant to establish a joint cause of action. \n\n[200 U.S. 206, 218]\n\u00a0\n The fact that by answer the defendant may show that the liability is several cannot change the character of the case made by the plaintiff in his pleading so as to affect the right of removal. It is to remembered that we are not now dealing with joinders which are shown by the petition for removal, or otherwise, to be attempts to sue in the state courts with a view to defeat Federal jurisdiction. In such cases entirely different questions arise, and the Federal courts may and should take such action as will defeat attempts to wrongfully deprive parties entitled to sue in the Federal courts of the protection of their rights in those tribunals.\n In the present case there is nothing in the questions propounded which suggests an attempt to commit a fraud upon the jurisdiction of the Federal courts.\n As shown in the opinion of the Chief Justice in the Dixon Case (\n179 U.S. 131\n, 45 L. ed. 121, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 67), the cases are in difference as to whether a commonlaw action can be sustained against master and servant jointly because of the responsibility of the master for the acts of the servant in prosecuting the master's business. In good faith, so far as appears in the record, the plaintiff sought the determination of his rights in the state court by the filing of a declaration in which he alleged a joint cause of action.\n Does this become a separable controversy within the meaning of the act of Congress because the plaintiff has misconceived his cause of action, and had no right to prosecute the defendants jointly? We think, in the light of the adjudications above cited from this court, it does not. Upon the face of the complaint,-the only pleading filed in the case,-the action is joint. It may be that the state court will hold it not to be so. It may be (which we are not called upon to decide now) that this court would so determine if the matter shall be presented in a case of which it has jurisdiction. But this does not change the character of the action which the plaintiff has seen fit to bring, nor change an alleged joint cause of action into a separable controversy for the purpose of removal. The case cannot be removed unless it is one which presents a separable controversy \n\n[200 U.S. 206, 219]\n\u00a0\n wholly between citizens of different states. In determining this question the law looks to the case made in the pleadings, and determines whether the state court shall be required to surrender its jurisdiction to the Federal court.\n As early as 1816 this court, in determining a question of jurisdiction, was governed by the character of the suit brought by the plaintiff. In New Orleans v. Winter, 1 Wheat. 91, 4 L. ed. 44, it was held that a citizen of a territory could not sue in a Federal court by joining with himself a citizen of another state. The opinion was delivered by Chief Justice Marshall, who said (p. 95, L. ed. 45): 'In this case it has been doubted whether the parties might elect to sue jointly or severally. However this may be, having elected to sue jointly, the court is incapable of distinguishing their case, so far as respects jurisdiction, from one in which they were compelled to unite.'\n It is urged with much earnestness by the learned counsel for the company that this view works a surrender of the right of determination of Federal rights in the Federal courts, and deprives nonresident citizens of their rights to appeal to those tribunals. The decision of a state court that such actions as the present might be joint at common law would have no controlling effect in the Federal courts in determining the question in causes properly before them. And the question here is not what is the rule of the Federal courts in similar cases, but is, What controversies has Congress made removable in the act under consideration? Congress has not said, whatever it might do, that controversies between citizens of different states shall be removable wherein it is sought, contrary to the law as administered in the Federal courts, to hold the citizens of another state to joint liability in tort with a citizen of the state where the action is brought. The fact that the state court may take a different view from the courts of the United States of the common law as to the character of such actions, and the right to prosecute them in form joint as well as several, affords no ground of removal.\n The Federal courts in some states hold a different rule as to \n\n[200 U.S. 206, 220]\n\u00a0\n the doctrine of fellowservants from that administered in the state courts, and in other ways administer the common law according to their own views. It has not been suggested that a right of removal should arise from such differences. No more has Congress given the right where the state permits an action to be prosecuted jointly which would be held to be several only in the courts of the United States. The applicant for removal has been duly summoned into a cause in course of prosecution in the state court. All of the defendants not being nonresidents, it can remove only if it presents a separable controversy, which can be wholly determined between itself and the plaintiff. The test of such controversy, as this court has frequently said, is the cause of action stated in the complaint. That is joint in character, and there is no attack upon the good faith of the action. In such case we hold that no separable controversy is presented within the meaning of the act of Congress.\n We answer the first question: That, for the purpose of determining the right of removal, the cause of action must be deemed to be joint. The views herein expressed lead to an answer to the second question in the negative.\n In this opinion we have taken no account of the peculiar statute of Tennessee as to the liability of railroads for injuries to persons on the tracks, as its effect is not presented in the questions propounded, nor is it stated that the injury was received in the state of Tennessee. \n\n\n\n","3":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nALBRIGHT v. TERRITORY OF NEW MEXICO EX REL SANDOVAL(1906)\nNo. 229\nArgued: Decided: January 2, 1906\n\n\n\n Mr. William B. Childers for appellant.\n Mr. Neill B. Field for appellee.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n This was a proceeding in quo warranto, brought in the district court of Bernalillo county, New Mexico, July 20, 1903, by the territory on the relation of Jesus M. Sandoval against George F. Albright, it being alleged that Sandoval was duly elected to the office of assessor of Bernalillo county for the term of two years from the first day of January, 1903; that he duly qualified and entered on the discharge of the duties of the office; and that he had never resigned, vacated, or abandoned the office, and ever since his election and qualification had continued to discharge the duties thereof. It was further alleged that on \n\n[200 U.S. 9, 10]\n\u00a0\n March 23, 1903, respondent, Albright, without authority of law, unlawfully usurped the office, and took possession of the assessor's room in the courthouse, and of the books and papers, and other insignia of office, claiming office by virtue of a pretended appointment by the board of county commissioners of Bernalillo county, made under the authority of an act of the legislative assembly of the territory of New Mexico, entitled 'An Act to Create the County of Sandoval,' approved March 10, 1903, as amended by an act entitled 'An Act to Amend Section 3 of an Act Entitled 'An Act to Create the County of Sandoval.\" approved March 12, 1903\n\n\n Judgment was rendered by the district court in favor of Albright, August 3, 1903, and carried to the supreme court of the territory, which reversed the judgment, and remanded the cause with directions to the court below to reinstate it and proceed in accordance with the views expressed in its opinion. 78 Pac. 204. The mandate was filed below October 19, 1904, and on the 19th of November the district court entered judgment 'that the respondent, George F. Albright, has unlawfully usurped, and does unlawfully usurp, the office of assessor of the county of Bernalillo and territory of New Mexico, from the relator, Jesus Maria Sandoval, the lawful incumbent of the said office; that the said respondent, George F. Albright do henceforth cease and desist from in any manner intermeddling with, or attempting to perform the duties, or exercise the functions of, the office of assessor of the county of Bernalillo aforesaid, and that he forthwith deliver up to the relator the records, books, papers, and furniture, and all other things appertaining to the office of assessor of the county of Bernalillo and territory of New Mexico, as the lawful custodian thereof,' and for costs.\n The case was again carried to the supreme court and heard upon a motion to dismiss and on the merits, and February 24, 1904, the court denied the motion to dismiss, modified the judgment of the district court by striking out the words 'and that he forthwith deliver up to the relator the records, books, papers, furniture, and all other things appertaining to the office of assessor \n\n[200 U.S. 9, 11]\n\u00a0\n of the county of Bernalillo and territory of New Mexico, as the lawful custodian thereof,' and affirmed the judgment as so modified. 79 Pac. 719. On the same day an appeal was allowed to this court, a supersedeas bond given, which was approved March 9, 1905, and the record was filed here April 17. The case comes before us on a motion to dismiss.\n The ground assigned for the motion is the expiration of the term of the office of assessor of the county of Bernalillo, and the consequent lack of power to grant appellant any effectual relief. But the same motion has already been considered and denied by the supreme court of the territory, and its renewal here amounts to no more than an assignment of error to the action of that court in this regard, to be passed on and disposed of as such, if otherwise we have jurisdiction of the case. If we have not, the appeal must be dismissed, even though for reasons not put forward in support of the motion. The opinion of the supreme court fully discussed the authorities on the subject of the right to have a review of the judgment on appeal after the expiration of the term of office involved in the proceeding in quo warranto. The court refused to dismiss the writ, holding that the statute (9 Anne, chap. 20,  5), providing that, in addition to judgment of ouster, fine and costs may be imposed, was a part of the common law of the territory, and also that the judgment might affect the rights of the parties in another litigation in relation to the emoluments of the office.\n The appeal to this court was taken under the statute of March 3, 1885 ( 23 Stat. at L. 443, chap. 355).1 Shute v. Keyser, \n149 U.S. 649\n, 37 L. ed. 884, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 960.\n Both sections of that act apply to cases where there is a matter in dispute measureable by some sum or value in money, although the amount is not restricted under the 2d section. Washington & G. R. Co. v. District of Columbia, \n146 U.S. 227\n, 36 L. ed. 951, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 64; Farnsworth v. Montana, \n129 U.S. 104\n, 32 L. ed. 616, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 253. In proceedings in quo warranto, such as those in this case, the alleged usurpation is the matter in dispute, and the liability to a fine on judgment of ouster does not make that matter measureable by some sum or value in money. As in criminal cases, \n\n[200 U.S. 9, 12]\n\u00a0\n the fine is, 'in the eye of the law, a punishment for the offense committed, and not the particular object of the suit.' United States v. More, 3 Cranch, 159, 174, 2 L. ed. 397, 402. Moreover, appellant could hardly be allowed to invoke our jurisdiction on the ground that, if his appeal were sustained, he might be fined on a new judgment.\n The term of office had expired before the rendition of judgment by the territorial supreme court, and as to the effect of the judgment of ouster in a suit to recover emoluments for the past, that is collateral, even though the judgment might be conclusive in such subsequent action.

U.S.(1906)\nNo. 381\nArgued: Decided: March 12, 1906\n\n\n\n Messrs. James G. Flanders, Charles F. Fawsett, and William Brace for appellants.\n Messrs. Frank B. Kellogg, James M. Beck, and Attorney General Moody for appellee. \n\n[201 U.S. 117, 118]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n At the very beginning we encounter a question of jurisdiction. Are the orders of which the appellants complain appealable? The orders direct the appellants respectively to appear before Robert F. Taylor, special examiner in the case, at the time and place to be designated, and direct each of them to 'answer each and every question put to them respectively by the counsel for the complainant, the United States of America,' and to produce before such commissioner certain books, papers, records, documents, reports, and contracts, 'for the purpose of their respective examination in said cause, and for use in evidence of the complaint of the United States of America in said examination.' And it is ordered that the complainant's counsel shall have the right to inspect the said books, etc., and to introduce them or any of them in evidence; but, except as necessary for such purposes, the books, etc., to remain in the custody of the appellants.\n A brief statement of the proceedings is all that is necessary. The United States, by its proper officers brought suit in the circuit court of the United States for the district of Minnesota against the General Paper Company and twenty-three other corporations, defendants, under and pursuant to the provisions of the act of Congress of July 2, 1890, entitled 'An Act to Protect Trade and Commerce against Unlawful Restraints and Monopolies.' [26 Stat. at L. 209, chap. 647, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3200.] It is alleged in the bill that the defendants, other than the General Paper Company and the Manufacturers' Paper Company, were engaged in the manufacture of manilla and fibre papers in active competition with one another, and that they entered into an agreement, combination, and conspiracy to control, regulate, and monopolize, not only the manufacture of news print, manilla, fibre, and other papers, but also the distribution and shipment thereof among and throughout the middle, southern, and western states. The General Paper Company was the means employed to execute the combination and conspiracy. That company is a corporation organized, the bill alleges, by \n\n[201 U.S. 117, 119]\n\u00a0\n the other defendants, under the laws of the state of Wisconsin, with a capital stock of $100,000, divided into one thousand shares, which were distributed among and owned and held by the other defendants in proportions based upon the average daily output of the mills of each defendant. It is authorized to become at its principal place of business the sales agent of the products of the defendants' mills in the state of Wisconsin and elsewhere. Absolute power is conferred upon it to control and restrict the output of the mills, fix the price of their products, and determine to whom and the terms and conditions upon which such products shall be sold, into what states and places they shall be shipped, and what publishers and customers each mill shall supply.\n The Manufacturers' Paper Company, it is alleged, is a New York corporation, with its principal place of business in Chicago, and, from about the year 1897 to 1902, acted as the sales agent of various manufacturers of paper for the sale of news print and other papers; that in 1902 it became a party to the combination and conspiracy alleged in the bill, and agreed with the General Paper Company not to compete with it in certain territories.\n It is admitted that, prior to the formation of the General Paper Company, the other defendants, except the Manufacturers' Paper Company, were in active competition. The formation of the General Paper Company is also admitted, and that it became, by contract with the defendants who manufacture paper, their selling agent. The defendants deny, however, a purpose to violate the act of July 2, 1890. The violation of that law is the issue in the case, and the bill prays an injunction against the defendants and their officers from doing the acts or executing the purpose charged against them.\n In trial of the issue thus made the circuit court appointed Robert S. Taylor special examiner, with authority to hear and take testimony within and without the district of Minnesota, and made an order fixing the time to take the testimony for the United States the 16th of May, 1905, at the city of Milwaukee, \n\n[201 U.S. 117, 120]\n\u00a0\n state of Wisconsin. The order was duly served on the counsel of the respective parties. Thereupon the United States petitioned the circuit court for an order directing the clerk of the circuit court to issue a subpoena duces tecum. The subpoena was duly issued and served on the appellants as individuals and as officers of certain of the defendant companies. They appeared before the examiner in obedience to the subpoena, but, under the advice of counsel, they refused to permit the use of books or certain parts of them, and refused to answer certain questions put to them, the ground of this action being the immateriality and irrelevancy of the evidence sought to be adduced. The United States then presented a petition to the United States circuit court for the district of Wisconsin, which recited the issues in the case, and the statement of the questions asked, and the parts of the books and documents sought to be used. To this petition the appellants filed separate answers.\n The answers may be regarded for out present purpose as identical. They allege the immateriality of the evidence and that its materiality should be established as a condition precedent to its production; that they are officers of the companies, and as such officers, the custodians of the books, papers, and documents, and that the same are of interest and value to the company in its business, and the company forbids their production; that the United States seeks evidence to convict the company and the individual appellants of violations of the act of July 2, 1890, to annul the contracts and agreements of the company, and subject it and the other appellants to the penalities prescribed in that act, and to compel the company and the other appellants to furnish evidence against themselves, contrary to the provisions of the 5th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which provides that no person shall be a witness against himself; also contrary to the 4th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, which provides that the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated. It is also said that the alleged acts of the \n\n[201 U.S. 117, 121]\n\u00a0\n paper company complained of in the original petition of the United States, and which the United States is endeavoring to establish, would, if committed by the company, be violations of the laws of Wisconsin, and would subject the company to forfeiture of its charter and other penalities under said laws, and to compel it, through its officers, to produce the books and documents sought would be to compel it to furnish evidence tending to establish that it has violated the law of the state, and such purpose is contrary to the provisions of the 4th and 5th Amendments of the Constitution of the United States.\n As we have said, the court entered orders requiring the appellants to answer the questions put to them and to produce the books, papers, and documents requested. Appeals were allowed to this court. To justify the appeals, appellants contend that the orders of the circuit court constitute practically independent proceedings and amount to final judgments. To sustain the contention, Interstate Commerce Commission v. Brimson, \n154 U.S. 447\n, 38 L. ed. 1047, 4 Inters. Com. Rep. 545, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1125, and Interstate Commerce Commission v. Baird, \n194 U.S. 25\n, 48 L. ed. 860, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 563, are cited.\n Those cases rested on statutory provisions which do not apply to the proceedings at bar, and, while there may be resemblances to the latter, there are also differences. In a certain sense finality can be asserted of the orders under review; so, in a certain sense, finality can be asserted of any order of a court. And such an order may coerce a witness, leaving him no alternative but to obey or be punished. It may have the effect and the same characteristic of finality as the orders under review, but from such a ruling it will not be contended there is an appeal. Let the court go farther, and punish the witness for contempt of its order,-then arrives a right of review; and this is adequate for his protection without unduly impeding the progress of the case. Why should greater rights be given a witness to justify his contumacy when summoned before an examiner than when summoned before a court? Testimony, at times, must be taken out of court. In instances like those in the case at bar the officer who takes the testimony, having no power to \n\n[201 U.S. 117, 122]\n\u00a0\n issue process, is given the aid of the clerk of a court of the United States; having no power to enforce obedience to the process or to command testimony, he is given the aid of the judge of the court whose clerk issued the process, and if there be disobedience of the process, or refusal to testify or to produce documents, such judge may 'proceed to enforce obedience . . . or punish the disobedience in like manner as any court of the United States may proceed in case of disobedience to like process issued by such court.' Rev. Stat.  868, 869, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 664, 665. This power to punish being exercised, the matter becomes personal to the witness and a judgment as to him. Prior to that the proceedings are interlocutory in the original suit. This is clearly pointed out by Circuit Judge Van Devanter, disallowing an appeal from an order like those under review, in the case of Nelson v. United States [\n201 U.S. 92\n, 50 L. ed. --, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 358], in error to the circuit court of the United States for the district of Minnesota. The learned judge said:\n'I am of opinion that the mere direction of the court to the witnesses to answer the questions put to them and to produce the written evidence in their possession is not a final decision; that it more appropriately is an interlocutory ruling or order in the principal suit, and that if the witnesses refuse to comply with it and the court then exercises its authority either to punish them or to coerce them into compliance, that will give rise to another case or cases to which the witnesses will be parties on the one hand, and the government, as a sovereign vindicating the dignity and authority of one of its courts, will be a party on the other hand. I have no doubt that a judgment adverse to the witnesses in that proceeding or case will be a final decision, and will be subject to review by writ of error, but not by appeal. My opinion is also that the parties to the principal suit cannot appeal or obtain a writ of error from that decision.'\n\n See also Logan v. Pennsylvania R. Co. 132 Pa. 403, 410, 19 Atl. 137.\n This court having no jurisdiction, the appeals must be dismissed, and it is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","5":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nALLEN v. RILEY(1906)\nNo. 99\nArgued: Decided: December 3, 1906\n\n\n\n Frances J. Riley, the defendant in error, who was plaintiff below, recovered a judgment against plaintiffs in error, defendants below, for $1, 250, in the district court of Brown county, in the state of Kansas, which judgment was affirmed by the supreme court of the state, and the defendants below have brought the case here by writ of error.\n The suit was commenced by the filing of a petition by defendant in error, plaintiff below, in a district court of Kansas, March 17, 1902, to recover the value of certain lands alleged to have been transferred by the plaintiff to the defendant Erasmus W. Allen, in part payment for the transfer to plaintiff of rights for the state of Kentucky under a patent dated January 30, 1901, for a washing machine. The right to recover is based upon the failure of the defendants to comply with the Kansas statute, which failure defendants do not \n\n[203 U.S. 347, 348]\n\u00a0\n deny, but they insist that the statute is void as being in violation of the Constitution of the United States and the act of Congress referred to in the opinion. The Kansas statute is chapter 182 of the Laws of 1889. A copy of the act is set out in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Messrs. N. H. Loomis, R. W. Blair, and H. A. Scandrett for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n[203 U.S. 347, 350]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. A. E. Crane and T. T. Woodburn for defendant in error.\n\n\n[203 U.S. 347, 351]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Peckham, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The sole question for our determination in this case is con- \n\n[203 U.S. 347, 352]\n\u00a0\n cerning the constitutionality of the Kansas act. The opinion of the supreme court of the state of Kansas is reported in 71 Kan. 378, 80 Pac. 952.\n The judgment herein is founded upon Mason v. McLeod, 57 Kan. 105, 41 L.R.A. 548, 57 Am. St. Rep. 327, 45 Pac. 76; which case has been followed by that of Pinney v. First Nat. Bank, 68 Kan. 223, 75 Pac. 119.\n The defendants insist that the act in question violates article 1,  8, of the Con stitution of the United States, and the Federal statute passed in pursuance thereof, being Rev. Stat.  4898, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3387. The Constitution grants to Congress the right 'to promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing, for limited times, to authors and inventors, the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries;' and  4898 of the Revised Statutes provides that every patent or interest therein shall be assignable in law by an instrument in writing, which assignment is made void against any subsequent purchaser or mortgagee, for a valuable consideration, without notice, unless it is recorded in the Patent Office within three months from the date thereof.\n It is asserted by the plaintiffs in error that the subject of the sale or assignment of the whole or any part of an interest in a patent is derived from the laws of Congress passed with reference to the constitutional provision quoted above, and that any regulations whatever, by any state authority, in regard to such assignment or sale, and making provision in respect to them, are illegal.\n The supreme court of Kansas has maintained and upheld the Kansas act on the ground that the statute is simply a reasonable and proper exercise of the police power of the state in regard to the subject of the act. Mason v. McLeod, supra. That court was of opinion that the provisions of the Kansas statute did not trench upon the Federal power nor interfere with the rights secured to patentees by Federal law. The opinion does not assert that a state statute can interfere with the right of a patentee to sell or assign his patent, nor that it can take away any essential feature of his exclusive right, but, \n\n[203 U.S. 347, 353]\n\u00a0\n as is stated, the provisions in the act have no such purpose or effect; that 'they are in the nature of police regulations designed for the protection of the people against imposition and fraud. There is great opportunity for imposition and fraud in the transfer of intangible property, such as exists in a patent right, and many states have prescribed regulations for the transfer of such property differing essentially from those which control the transfer of other property.' Many authorities are cited, and the opinion then continues: 'The doctrine of these cases is that the patent laws do not prevent the state from enacting police regulations for the protection and security of its citizens, and that regulations like ours, which are mainly designed to protect the people from imposition by those who have actually no authority to sell patent rights or own patent rights to sell, should be upheld. We think the statute is vaild.'\n In Indiana a statute which is like that in Kansas has been upheld by the supreme court of that state. Brechbill v. Randall, 102 Ind. 528, 52 Am. Rep. 695, 1 N. E. 362. That case has, since that time, been followed in Indiana. New v. Walker, 108 Ind. 365, 58 Am. Rep. 40, 9 N. E. 386. In Ohio a statute somewhat similar to the one in question has been upheld. Tod v. Wick Bros. 36 Ohio St. 370. And the same result has been reached in Pennsylvania. Haskell v. Jones, 86 Pa. 173. In Herdic v. Roessler, 109 N. Y. 127, 16 N. E. 198, the validity of the same kind of a statute has been upheld. See also Wyatt v. Wallace, 67 Ark. 575, 55 S. W. 1105; State v. Cook, 107 Tenn. 499, 62 L.R.A. 174, 64 S. W. 720. The statutes in the different states are not all precisely like the Kansas law, but they make provisions in regard to the sale or assignment of rights under a patent, and sometimes in regard to notes given for their purchase, which cannot be upheld under the contention of plaintiffs in error herein, that all such provisions are in violation of, or inconsistent with, the laws of Congress on the subject. The courts of some other states, having like questions before them, have held their statutes void. Hollida v. Hunt, 70 Ill. 109, 22 Am. Rep. 63; Cranson v. Smith, 37 Mich. 309, 26 Am. Rep. 514; Wilch v. Phelps, 14 \n\n[203 U.S. 347, 354]\n\u00a0\n Neb. 134, 15 N. W. 361; State v. Lockwood, 43 Wis. 405, and some others.\n The circuit court of appeals of the eighth circuit, in Ozan Lumber Co. v. Union County Nat. Bank, 145 Fed. 344, has held a statute of Arkansas upon this same subject void because of its discrimination between articles of property of the same class or character, based only on the fact that the property discriminated against was protected by a patent granted by the United States. In the opinion in the case, authorities upon the subject are cited and commented upon. Among the cases cited are Patterson v. Kentucky, \n97 U.S. 501\n, 24 L. ed. 1115, and Webber v. Virginia, \n103 U.S. 344\n, 26 L. ed. 565.\n In Patterson v. Kentucky, supra, the owner of a patent right for an improved burning oil was convicted of the violation of a Kentucky statute by the sale of the oil covered by the patent. The owner claimed the right to sell such oil notwithstanding the statute, which provided a standard below which oil was regarded as dangerous for illuminating purposes, and the sale of which was prohibited. It was admitted the patented oil did not come up to the state standard. This court held the conviction was right, and that the owner of the patent was not protected, by reason of his ownership, from liability under the state statute. That statute was held to be one passed in the legitimate exercise of the powers of the state over its purely domestic affairs, and it was said that it did not violate either the Constitution or laws of the United States, as, when property protected by patent once comes into existence, its use is subject to the control of the several states to the same extent as any other species of property.\n Webber v. Virginia, supra, relates also to tangible property covered by a patent, and it was held that the patent did not exclude from the operation of the taxing or licensing law of the state the tangible property manufactured under a patent. It was said in that case that 'Congress never intended that the patent laws should displace the police powers of the states, meaning by that term those powers by which the health, good \n\n[203 U.S. 347, 355]\n\u00a0\n order, peace, and general welfare of the community are promoted. Whatever rights are secured to the inventors must be enjoyed in subordination to this general authority of the state over all property within its limits.'\n While these two cases do not cover the one now before us, because they refer to tangible property which has been manufactured and come into existence under a patent, and the case before us relates to provisions which are to accompany an assignment of intangible rights, growing out of a patent, yet the general power of the states to legislate in order to protect their citizens in their lives and property from fraud and deceit is recognized, not as being without limit, of course, but as being properly exercised in the cases named.\n We think the state has the power (certainly until Congress legislates upon the subject) with regard to the provision which shall accompany the sale or assignment of rights arising under a patent, to make reasonable regulations concerning the subject, calculated to protect its citizens from fraud. And we think Congress has not so legislated by the provisions regarding an assignment contained in the act referred to.\n In some of the cases holding such statutes void it is said that it is unfortunately true that many frauds are committed under color of patent rights, and that the patent laws are not so framed as to secure the public from being cheated by worthless inventions; but, notwithstanding that, they hold statutes of the nature of the one under consideration to be void, as trenching upon the rights of the owner of a patent secured by the Constitution and laws of the United States.\n To uphold this kind of a statute is by no means to authorize any state to impose terms which, possibly, in the language of Mr. Justice Davis, in Ex parte Robinson, 2 Biss. 309, Fed. Cas. No. 11,932, 'would result in a prohibition of the sale of this species of property within its borders, and in this way nullify the laws of Congress which regulate its transfer, and destroy the power conferred upon Congress by the Constitution.' Such a statute would not be a reasonable exercise of the powers of the state. \n\n[203 U.S. 347, 356]\n\u00a0\n In Michigan, the court, speaking through Mr. Justice Campbell, while holding the act under review in that case upon the subject invalid ( Cranson v. Smith, 37 Mich. 309, 26 Am. Rep. 514), said: 'While we cannot but recognize the magnitude of an evil which has brought patents into popular discredit, and has provoked legislation in several states similar to that of Michigan, we cannot, on the other hand, fail to see in these laws a plain and clear purpose to check the evil by hindering parties owning patents from dealing with them as they may deal with their other possessions.' If there is a special evil, unusually frequent and easily perpetrated when parties are dealing in the sale of rights existing or claimed to exist under a patent, we do not see why a state may not, in the bona fide exercise of its powers, enact some special statutory provision which may tend to arrest such evil, and may omit to enact the same provision concerning the disposal of other property. There is no discrimination which can be properly so called against property in patent rights, exercised in such legislation. It is simply an attempt to protect the citizen against frauds and impositions which can be more readily perpetrated in such cases than in cases of the sale or assignment of ordinary property.\n The act must be a reasonable and fair exercise of the power of the state for the purpose of checking a well-known evil, and to prevent, so far as possible, fraud and imposition in regard to the sales of rights under patents. Possibly Congress might enact a statute which would take away from the states any power to legislate upon the subject, but it has not as yet done so. It has simply provided that every patent, or interest therein, shall be assignable in writing, leaving to the various states the power to provide for the safeguarding of the interests of those dealing with the assumed owner of a patent, or his assignee. To deal with that subject has been the purpose of the acts passed by the various states, among them that of the state of Kansas, and we think that it was within the powers of the state to enact such statute. The expense of \n\n[203 U.S. 347, 357]\n\u00a0\n filing copies of the patent and the making of affidavits in the various counties of the state in which the owner of the rights desired to deal with them is not so great, in our judgment, as to be regarded as oppressive or unreasonable, and we fail to find any other part of the act which may be so regarded. Some fair latitude must be allowed the states in the exercise of their powers on this subject. It will not do to tie them up so carefully that they cannot move, unless the idea is that the states have positively no power whatever on the subject. This we do not believe; at any rate, in the absence of congressional legislation. The mere provision in the Federal statute for an assignment and its record as against subsequent purchasers, etc., is not such legislation as takes away the rights of the states to legislate on the subject themselves in a manner neither inconsistent with, nor opposed to, the Federal statute. We think the judgment is right, and it is affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice White, with whom concurs Mr. Justice Day, dissenting:\n My brother Day and myself dissent. The reasons, however, which impel him are broader than those influencing me. In general terms, the Kansas statute which the court now upholds compels one selling a patent right in any county of the state of Kansas to file with the clerk of such county an authenticated copy of the patent, together with an affidavit as to the genuineness of the patent, and as to other matters. The statute, moreover, exacts that where a note is given for the purchase price of a patent right, there shall be inserted in the note a statement that it is given for a patent right, presumably to deprive the note of the attributes of commercial paper. We both think that the requirements as to recording the patent and affidavit are void, because repugnant to the power delegated to Congress by the Constitution on the subject of patents, and because in conflict with the legislation of Congress on the \n\n[203 U.S. 347, 358]\n\u00a0\n same subject. And, for like reasons, my brother Day is also of the opinion that the provision is void which exacts an insertion in a note given for the sale of a patent right of the fact that it was given for such sale. This latter provision, in my opinion, the state had the power to make as a reasonable police regulation, not repugnant to the authority as to patents delegated to Congress by the Constitution, or the legislation which Congress has enacted in furtherance thereof. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Chapter 182, Laws of 1889 (paragraphs 4356, 4357, and 4358, General Statutes of Kansas, 1901), reads as follows:\n'Sec. 1.

NORTHERN ASSUR CO(1906)\nNo. 199\nArgued: March 8, 1906Decided: April 2, 1906\n\n\n\n\n[201 U.S. 194, 195]\n\u00a0\n Messrs.Fritz von Briesen and Charles M. Boerman for plaintiffs in error.\n Messrs.,Frederic D. McKenney, Francis H. Dexter, and John Spalding Flannery for defendants in error.\n\n\n\n[201 U.S. 194, 197]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n In No. 199 the action was commenced April 21, 1903, by Antonio Jos e Amadeo, as sole plaintiff, to recover from the Northern Assurance Company damages in the sum of $10,000 on a certain fire insurance policy issued on property in Porto Rico. The policy was dated December 21, 1884, and insured plaintiff against loss by fire for one year from that date. The loss was alleged to have occurred February 7, 1885\n\n\n Defendant filed several pleas, and, among others, that 'the alleged cause of action did not accrue within fifteen years before this suit,' and that prior to the institution of the suit the policy and its proceeds had been duly sold and transferred by plaintiff 'to the firm of Pastor Marquez & Company, who are the only persons entitled to sue herein.' \n\n[201 U.S. 194, 198]\n\u00a0\n Plaintiff demurred to both these pleas, but subsequently, by leave of court, amended his declaration by adding to the caption, after the name Amadeo, the words 'for the use of and together with Pastor Marquez Company, in liquidation,' and by inserting in the body of the declaration the following: 'And plaintiff avers that about the month of August, 1885, the said policy was assigned to the Pastor Marquez Company, which is a company in liquidation and of which Pedro Salazar is liquidator.'\n Thereafter plaintiff's demurrer to defenddant's pleas of prescription was overruled by the court, and plaintiff excepted, and subsequently replied that the prescription pleaded had been interrupted 'extrajudicially.' To that replication defendant interposed a demurrer, which was sustained by the court. Plaintiffs thereupon declined to plead further and the court entered judgment, January 12, 1904, as follows: 'And it is therefore adjudged by the court that issue is found in favor of the defendant, and that the plaintiffs recover nothing herein, and that the defendant go hence with judgment for cost against the plaintiffs.' It now appears that plaintiff Amadeo died intestate May 14, 1904. September 20, 1904, application was made for the allowance of a writ of error from this court to review the judgment, which was allowed September 21, 1904. On December 20, 1904, an appeal bond in the sum of $500, wherein Pastor Marquez & Company was named as principal and Lucas Amadeo and Felix Salazar as sureties, was filed in the clerk's office of the district court, but the bond did not bear the approval of the judge. The bond was entitled 'Antonio Jos e Amadeo and Pastor Marquez & Company vs. Northern Assurance Company;' recited that 'whereas the above-named plaintiffs have sued out a writ of error to the Supreme Court,' etc., and was conditioned that 'the above-named plaintiffs shall prosecute said writ to effect,' etc. It was signed 'Pastor Marquez & Com. en Liquid. E. Salazar, Lucas Amadeo, Felipe Salazar.' The writ of error, which is dated December 31, 1904, bears the allowance of the district judge, who \n\n[201 U.S. 194, 199]\n\u00a0\n also signed the citation under that date. The writ of error and the citation described 'Antonio Jos e Amadeo for the use of and together with the Pastor Marquez Company, in liquidation,' as plaintiffs in error. The writ of error asserts that the error complained of wrought damage to 'said Antonio Jos e Amadeo for the use of and together with the Pastor Marquez Company in liquidation.' The transcript of record was docketed in this court March 15, 1905.\n In No. 200, the action was brought by Antonio Jos e Amadeo alone, upon two policies of insurance against the Royal Insurance Company, April 21, 1903. The policies of insurance were dated September 15 and December 21, 1884, respectively, and insured plaintiff against loss and damage for one year from their respective dates. The loss as alleged occurred February 7, 1885. Defendant, among other defenses, pleaded prescription of fifteen years and transfer by plaintiff, prior to the institution of the suit, of the policies and all interest therein. To these pleas plaintiff at first demurred, but subsequently, with leave of the court, amended his declaration as follows: In the title, after the name of the plaintiff, by adding the following words, 'for the use of and together with the Pastor Marquez Company in liquidation,' and by adding in the body of the declaration the following: 'And plaintiff avers that on or about August, 1885, the said policy was assigned to the Pastor Marquez Company, which is a company in liquidation and of which Pedro Salazar is liquidator.' Plaintiff's demurrer to defendant's pleas of prescription having been overruled and exception thereto noted, plaintiff replied that the prescription had been interrupted 'by extrajudicial demand;' to which replication defendant interposed a demurrer, which was sustained. And plaintiff having refused to plead further to defendant's pleas of prescription, and 'failing to offer proofs as to the other issues made and tendered,' judgment was, on the 15th day of January, 1904, entered for defendant as follows: 'That the plaintiffs herein, Antonio Jos e Amadeo, for himself and for the use and benefit of the firm of Pastor \n\n[201 U.S. 194, 200]\n\u00a0\n Marquez & Company, and Pedro Salazar as liquidating partner of the said Pastor Marquez & Company, take nothing by either of their said suits, and that the defendants go hence without day and recover of and from the said plaintiffs all costs in this behalf incurred or expended, for which execution may issue.' Petition for allowance of writ of error was filed September 20, 1904, and allowed the next day. An appeal bond entitled 'Jos e Antonio Amadeo and Pastor Marquez & Company vs. Royal Insurance Company' was 'filed and approved Dec. 20th, 1904,' but the copy of the bond in the transcript of record does not show the approval of the district judge. This bond was signed by 'Pastor Marquez & Co. en liqui., E. Salazar, Felipe Salazar, Lucas Amadeo,' Pastor Marquez & Company being described as principal and Lucas Amadeo and Felipe Salazar as sureties. The writ of error and citation were as in case No. 199. Record filed March 15, 1905.\n No. 201 was a consolidation of two similar actions, and the course of procedure was like that in Nos. 199 and 200. The judgment was rendered January 15, 1904, in favor of defendant and against 'Frederico Amadeo, for himself and for the use and benefit of the firm of Pastor Marquez & Company, and Pedro Salazar as liquidating partner of the said Pastor Marquez & Company.'\n The appeal bond was filed December 20, 1904, and was signed by 'Pastor Marquez & Company, in liquidation, E. Salazar, Felipe Salazar, and Lucas Amadeo;' and did not bear the approval of the district judge. The record was filed March 15, 1905.\n The sureties on each of the appeal bonds in Nos. 199, 200, and 201 made affidavit as to their responsibility before the clerk of the district court, and acknowledged the execution of the bonds before him.\n It was admitted at the bar that, on the merits, these judgments must be reversed. Royal Ins. Co. v. Miller, \n199 U.S. 353\n, 50 L. ed. --, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 46.\n But it is insisted that the writs of error in Nos. 199 and 200 \n\n[201 U.S. 194, 201]\n\u00a0\n should be dismissed because Antonio Jos e Amadeo died after judgment, and before the writs of error were sued out, and the Pastor Marquez Company, if otherwise competent, could not prosecute the writs until after notice to the succession of the deceased. And further, that as it appeared that Pastor Marquez Company was in liquidation, the writs of error as well as the actions could only be prosecuted in the name of the liquidator, which was denied to be the fact here. And that the writ of error in No. 201 should be dismissed on the latter ground as well as because of want of summons and severance.\n Antonio Jos e Amadeo was dead when the writs of error issued in Nos. 199 and 200, and it is contended that the writs cannot be maintained because the actions had not been revived below, the death was not suggested on the record, and no notice of intention to take out the writs was given to his succession. Defendant, however, pleaded, among other defenses, that Amadeo had no interest in the cause of action, because the policies and their proceeds had been duly sold and transferred to Pastor Marquez & Company, who were alone entitled to sue. And thereafter the complaints were amended, as previously stated. For the purposes of these motions to dismiss, defendant in error cannot be permitted in this court to assert that Amadeo was other than a nominal plaintiff, and the cases fall within the principle, occasionally applicable, that parties having no legal interest in maintaining or reversing a judgment or decree are not necessary parties to a writ of error or appeal. Basket v. Hassell, \n107 U.S. 602\n, 27 L. ed. 500, 2 Sup.Ct.Rep. 415; Germain v. Mason, 12 Wall. 259, 20 L. ed. 392; Forgay v. Conrad, 6 How. 201, 12 L. ed. 404.\n And although these records are much confused and very carelessly made up, we think that it may be properly held that the effect of the amendments was to bring the liquidator into court with the liquidating company, and, at all events, that, in view of defendants' pleas, the amendments thereupon, and the want of objection below in respect of the liquidator, that objection should not now be entertained in defeat of our jurisdiction. These considerations control the disposition of No. 201. \n\n[201 U.S. 194, 202]\n\u00a0\n As to the suggested irregularities in the appeal bonds, they do not render the writs of error void, and we do not feel called on to enter any orders in regard to them, as these cases must go back for further proceedings.\n Judgments reversed and causes remanded for further proceedings in conformity with law. \n\n\n\n","7":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nANDREWS v. EASTERN OREGON LAND CO(1906)\nNo. 48\nArgued: October 19, 1906Decided: November 12, 1906\n\n\n\n Messrs.\nS. M. Stockslager, James F. Moore, and George C. Heard for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Aldis B. Browne and Alexander Britton for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case brings before us a judgment of the supreme court of the state of Oregon. 45 Or. 203, 77 Pac. 117. It involves the title to lot 3 and the east 1\/2 of the southwest 1\/4 of section 7, township 1 north, range 17 east of the Willamette meridian. The plaintiff in error claims title as a preemptor; the defendant in error under a patent from the United States. The land was patented as a part of the grant made by act of Congress, approved February 25, 1867 (14 Stat. at L. 409, chap. 77), of three alternate sections on each side of the road, to the Dalles Military Wagon Road Company, a full account of which is to be found in Wilcox v. Eastern Oregon Land Co. \n176 U.S. 51\n, 44 L. ed. 368, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 269. If the patent was valid the title to the land was in the defend- \n\n[203 U.S. 127, 128]\n\u00a0\n ant, and the judgment of the supreme court of Oregon was correct. There being no conflicting land grant, the question whether the land was within the territorial limits of that to the road company is apparently one of fact only, and the decision of the Land Department on matters of fact is ordinarily conclusive in the courts.\n The difficulty in the case arises from the condition of the record. This shows that by the trial court findings of fact and conclusions of law were made, one of the findings being that the land is situated entirely outside the limits of the grant, and more than 3 miles from the road as actually surveyed, platted, and constructed by the company, and certified by the governor of the state to the Land Department. No testimony is preserved, although it appears that the case was referred to a referee, who took and reported the testimony. The supreme court reversed the judgment of the trial court, and, while making no special findings, in its opinion discusses certain matters of evidence, and, after stating that the testimony tends to show that the land was in fact within the limits of the grant, rests its conclusion upon the general proposition that there is no competent proof to impeach the records of the Land Department or overthrow the presumption of validity which attends a patent of the United States. The certificate of the clerk of the supreme court states that the transcript is the full and complete record filed in that court and upon which the appeal was heard; while the certificate of the clerk of the trial court to the record sent to the supreme court is 'that the same is a full, true, and correct copy of the complaint, amended answer, demurrer to the amended answer, reply, findings of fact and conclusions of law, undertaking on appeal, notice of appeal filed in my office in the above- entitled cause, and of all journal entries made in said cause, and of the whole thereof.'\n From this is is contended that the supreme court, without any evidence before it, set aside the findings of fact made by the trial court. But it is the judgment of the supreme court \n\n[203 U.S. 127, 129]\n\u00a0\n whose validity we are to consider, and while it made no special findings, its statement of what was before it for consideration and its conclusions therefrom are sufficient to sustain its judgment. True, the record fails to show how the facts were brought to its knowledge, but it is the highest court of the state, and we may not ignore its recital of what it considered, especially as it appears that testimony was taken and preserved. Egan v. Hart, \n165 U.S. 188\n, 41 L. ed. 680, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 300. And when its conclusions are in harmony with the general rule of the effect to be given to a patent of the United States, we are not justified in setting aside the judgment upon any presumption of what might have been the testimony upon which the trial court made its findings.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of the state of Oregon is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","8":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nAPPLEYARD v. COM. OF MASSACHUSETTS(1906)\nNo. 115\nArgued: Decided: December 3, 1906\n\n\n\n\n[203 U.S. 222, 223]\n\u00a0\n The appellant was indicted in the supreme court of New York, county of Erie, for the crime of grand larceny, first degree, alleged to have been committed in that county on the 18th day of May, 1904\n\n\n Upon that indictment a warrant of arrest was issued, but the accused was not arrested, for the reason that he was not found within the state.\n Then the district attorney of Erie county applied to the governor of New York for a requisition upon the governor of Massachusetts for Appleyard as a fugitive from justice. The application was based upon the above indictment and numerous accompanying affidavits, stating, among other things, that the accused was then in Massachusetts. A requisition was accordingly made upon the governor of that commonwealth for the apprehension of Appleyard, and his delivery to a named agent of New York, who was authorized to receive and convey him to the latter state, to be there dealt with according to law. With that requisition went properly authenticated copies of all the papers which had been submitted to the governor of New York by the district attorney of Erie county.\n The governor of Massachusetts received the requisition, and, pursuant to the statutes of that commonwealth, referred it to the attorney general for examination and report. Giving the accused full opportunity to be heard and to introduce \n\n[203 U.S. 222, 224]\n\u00a0\n evidence, of which he availed himself, that officer examined the case and reported that the requisition was in regular and proper form and that there was no sufficient reason why it should not be honored. The governor thereupon issued a warrant for the arrest of Appleyard and his delivery to the agent of New York, to be taken to that state, the officer who should execute the warrant being required to give the accused such opportunity to sue out a writ of habeas corpus as was prescribed by the laws of Massachusetts in such cases. Appleyard, having been arrested applied for a writ of habeas corpus to the supreme judicial court of Massachusetts. This fact is stated in the return of the officer holding the accused, and is not denied. That court, after hearing an argument, denied the application, and remanded the petitioner to the custody of the agent of New York, to be held in accordance with the warrant issued by the governor of Massachusetts.\n The accused then applied to the circuit court of the United States for a writ of habeas corpus, alleging that the warrant of the governor of Massachusetts and the order for his delivery to the agent of New York were issued without authority of law, and contrary to the Constitution and laws, as well of the United States as of Massachusetts, and 'especially contrary to  2, article 4, of the Constitution of the United States, and of  5278 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3597), in that your petitioner is not a fugitive from justice.' The writ was issued and a return was made of the above facts.\n At the hearing in the circuit court the accused requested a ruling that, on the evidence, it did not appear that, within the meaning of the Constitution and laws of the United States, he was a fugitive from justice, and, also, that he should be discharged from custody unless it appeared positively, by a preponderance of proof, that he 'consciously fled from justice when he left the state of New York.' Those requests were denied. But the court granted a request that the finding by the governor of Massachusetts as a fact that the accused was a fugitive from justice was not conclusive. The court refused \n\n[203 U.S. 222, 225]\n\u00a0\n to find, as facts, that the acts of Appleyard did not constitute a crime under the laws of New York; that no crime was committed by him in that state; and that Appleyard was not in New York on May 18th, 1904, the date of the alleged crime. It consequently discharged the writ of habeas corpus. From that order the present appeal was prosecuted.\n Messrs. Benjamin S. Minor and Fred H. Williams for appellant.\n Messrs. Dana Malone and Frederic B. Greenhalge for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan delivered the opinion of the court:\n It cannot be said that the appellant has not had ample opportunity to test the question whether his detention was in violation of the Constitution and laws of the United States. He has had three hearings upon that question; first, before the executive authorities of Massachusetts, then before the supreme judicial court of that commonwealth, and finally before the circuit court of the United States. Upon each occasion he insisted that, within the meaning of the Constitution and laws of the United States, he could not be regarded as a fugitive from justice. The decision at each hearing was adverse to that contention, and, unless this court reverses the judgment of the circuit court, he must stand his trial upon the charge that he committed a crime against the laws of New York. In view of the history of this case from the time of the demand upon the governor of Massachusetts for the surrender of the appellant, this court should hesitate, by disturbing the ruling below, to further delay the administration by New York of its criminal laws through its own judicial tribunals. Regularly, the accused should have prosecuted a writ of error to the supreme judicial court of Massachusetts before \n\n[203 U.S. 222, 226]\n\u00a0\n invoking the jurisdiction of the circuit court of the United States upon habeas corpus.

Brundage, \n180 \nU.S. 499, 502\n, 45 S. L. ed. 639, 640, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 455; Reid v. Jones, \n187 U.S. 153\n, 47 L. ed. 116, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 89. But, in view of the long time which has elapsed since the governor of New York made his requisition for the surrender of the accused, and as the case is one which the public interests demand should be speedily determined, we think the ends of justice will be promoted if we proceed to a final judgment on this appeal.\n Upon a careful scrutiny of the record we discover no ground for the assertion that the detention of the appellant is in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States. The crime with which he is charged is alleged in the indictment to have been committed at Buffalo, New York, on May 18th, 1904. It is, we think, abundantly established by the evidence that he was personally present in that city on that day, and that thereafter he left New York, although there was some evidence to the effect that on the particular day named he was not in the state. In his own affidavit, submitted and accepted as evidence, the accused specified several days when he was in Buffalo, prior to and subsequent to May 18th, 1904, but, as stated by the attorney general of Massachusetts in his report to the governor of that commonwealth, there was in that affidavit no statement directly denying that he was in New York at the time and place indicated in the indictment.\n But the appellant contended below, as he does here, that he had no belief when leaving New York at any time that he had violated its criminal laws, and therefore, within the meaning of the Constitution and laws of the United States, he could not be deemed a fugitive from its justice. This contention cannot be sustained; indeed, it could not be sustained without materially impairing the efficacy of the constitutional and statutory provisions relating to fugitives from justice. An alleged fugitive may believe that he has not committed any crime against the laws of the state in which he is indicted, \n\n[203 U.S. 222, 227]\n\u00a0\n and yet, according to the laws of such state, as administered by its judicial tribunals, he may have done so, and his belief or want of belief may be without foundation in law. It is the province of the courts of New York to declare what its laws are, and to determine whether particular acts on the part of an alleged offender constitute a crime under such laws. The constitutional provision that a person charged with crime against the laws of a state, and who flees from its justice, must be delivered up on proper demand, is sufficiently comprehensive to embrace any offense, whatever its nature, which the state, consistently with the Constitution and laws of the United States, may have made a crime against its laws. Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How. 66, 69, 16 L. ed. 717; Ex parte Reggel, \n114 \nU.S. 642, 650\n, 29 S. L. ed 250, 252, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1148. So that the simple inquiry must be whether the person whose surrender is demanded is in fact a fugitive from justice, not whether he consciously fled from justice in order to avoid prosecution for the crime with which he is charged by the demanding state. A person charged by indictment or by affidavit before a magistrate with the commission within a state of a crime covered by its laws, and who, after the date of the commission of such crime, leaves the state,-no matter for what purpose or with what motive, nor under what belief,-becomes, from the time of such leaving, and within the meaning of the Constitution and the laws of the United States, a fugitive from justice, and if found in another state must be delivered up by the governor of such state to the state whose laws are alleged to have been violated, on the production of such indictment or affidavit, certified as authentic by the governor of the state from which the accused departed. Such is the command of the supreme law of the land, which may not be disregarded by any state. The constitutional provision relating to fugitives from justice, as the history of its adoption will show, is in the nature of a treaty stipulation entered into for the purpose of securing a prompt and efficient administration of the criminal laws of the several states,-an object of the first concern to the people of the entire country, \n\n[203 U.S. 222, 228]\n\u00a0\n and which each state is bound, in fidelity to the Constitution, to recognize. A faithful, vigorous enforcement of that stipulation is vital to the harmony and welfare of the states. And while a state should take care, within the limits of the law, that the rights of its people are protected against illegal action, the judicial authorities of the Union should equally take care that the provisions of the Constitution be not so narrowly interpreted as to enable offenders against the laws of a state to find a permanent asylum in the territory of another state.\n In Roberts v. Reilly, \n116 \nU.S. 80, 95\n, 97 S., 29 L. ed. 544, 549, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 291, this court said that the act of Congress,  5278 of the Revised Statutes, made it the duty of the executive authority of the state in which is found a person charged with crime against the laws of another state, and who has fled from its justice, 'to cause the arrest of the alleged fugitive from justice whenever the executive authority of any state demands such person as a fugitive from justice, and produces a copy of an indictment found, or affidavit made before a magistrate of any state, charging the person demanded with having committed a crime therein, certified as authentic by the governor or chief magistrate of the state from whence the person so charged has fled. It must appear, therefore, to the governor of the state to whom such a demand is presented, before he can lawfully comply with it, first, that the person demanded is substantially charged with a crime against the laws of the state from whose justice he is alleged to have fled, by an indictment or an affidavit, certified as authentic by the governor of the state making the demand; and, second, that the person demanded is a fugitive from the justice of the state the executive authority of which makes the demand. The first of these prerequisites is a question of law, and is always open upon the face of the papers to judicial inquiry, on an application for a discharge under a writ of habeas corpus. The second is a question of fact, which the governor of the state upon whom the demand is made must decide, upon such evidence as he may deem satisfactory. How far his decision may be \n\n[203 U.S. 222, 229]\n\u00a0\n reviewed judicially in proceedings in habeas corpus, or whether it is not conclusive, are questions not settled by harmonious judicial decisions, nor by any authoritative judgment of this court. It is conceded that the determination of the fact by the executive of the state in issuing his warrant of arrest, upon a demand made on that ground, whether the writ contains a recital of an express finding to that effect or not, must be regarded as sufficient to justify the removal until the presumption in its favor is overthrown by contrary proof. Ex parte Reggel, \n114 U.S. 642\n, 29 L. ed. 250, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1148.'\n Replying to the suggestion, in that case, that the fugitive was not within the demanding state subsequent to the finding of the indictment, the court further said: 'The appellant in his affidavit does not deny that he was in the state of New York about the date of the day laid in the indictment when the offense is alleged to have been committed, and states, by way of inference only, that he was not in that state on that very day; and the fact that he has not been within the state since the finding of the indictment is irrelevant and immaterial. To be a fugitive from justice, in the sense of the act of Congress regulating the subject under consideration, it is not necessary that the party charged should have left the state in which the crime is alleged to have been committed, after an indictment found, or for the purpose of avoiding a prosecution anticipated or begun, but simply that having within a state committed that which by its laws constitutes a crime, when he is sought to be subjected to its criminal process to answer for his offense, he has left its jurisdiction and is found within the territory of another.' To the same effect are Ex parte Brown, 28 Fed. 653, 655; Re White, 5 C. C. A. 29, 14 U. S. App. 87, 55 Fed. 54, 57; Re Bloch, 87 Fed. 981, 983. It is suggested that Roberts v. Reilly was substantially modified in Streep v. United States, \n160 \nU.S. 128, 134\n, 40 S. L. ed. 365, 369, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 244, in which the court had occasion to construe  1045 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 726). But this is an error. Interpreting the words 'fleeing from justice' as found in that section, the court expressly held that these words must receive \n\n[203 U.S. 222, 230]\n\u00a0\n the same construction as was given in Roberts v. Reilly to like words in  5278 of the Revised Statutes, the inquiry in that case being whether the accused was a fugitive from justice.\n In support of his contention, the appellant refers to Hyatt v. New York, \n188 U.S. 691\n, 47 L. ed. 657, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 456. That was the case of an arrest in New York, under the warrant of the governor of that state, of an alleged fugitive from the justice of Tennessee, in which state he stood charged by indictment with crime committed in that state. This court said (p. 719, L. ed. p. 664, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 462) that as the alleged fugitive 'showed, without contradiction, and upon conceded facts, that he was not within the state of Tennessee at the times stated in the indictments found in the Tennessee court, nor at any time when the acts were, if ever, committed, he was not a fugitive from justice within the meaning of the Federal statute upon that subject, and upon these facts the warrant of the governor of the state of New York was improperly issued, and the judgment of the court of appeals of the state of New York, discharging the relator from imprisonment by reason of such warrant, must be affirmed.' The present case is a wholly differnet one; for here the presumption arising from the recitals in the warrant of arrest in favor of its validity was not everthrown by the proof; on the contrary, it appeared, by a preponderance of evidence, that the accused was in the state of New York when the alleged crime was committed.\n Similar views to those expressed in Roberts v. Reilly have been expressed by state courts. In Kingsubury's Case, 106 Mass. 223, 227, 228, the contention of the fugitive from justice was that, as she went into the demanding state and returned to her home in the other state before the alleged crime was known, she could not be deemed to have fled from justice. But the court said: 'The material facts are, that the prisoner is charged with a crime in the manner prescribed, and has gone beyond the jurisdiction of the state, so that there has been no reasonable opportunity to prosecute him after the facts were known. The fact in this case, that she returned to her premanent home, cannot be material. . . . It is sufficient \n\n[203 U.S. 222, 231]\n\u00a0\n that the crime of larceny has been properly charged, and that the prisoner is a fugitive, and a requisition has been properly made.' In State ex rel. Burner v. Richter, 37 Minn. 436, 438, 35 N. W. 9, the contention was that to constitute a fugitive from justice a person must have left the state where the crime was committed for the purpose of escapting the legal consequences of his crime. Referring to Roberts v. Reilly, above cited, as authoritative and binding, and as in accordance with its own views, the supreme court of Minnesota well said: 'The sole purpose of this statute, and of the constitutional provision which it was designed to carry into effect, was to secure the return of persons who had committed crime within one state, and had left it before answering the demands of justice. The important thing is not their purpose in leaving, but the fact that they had left, and hence were beyond the reach of the process of the state where the crime was committed. Whether the motive for leaving was to escape prosecution or something else, their return to answer the charges against them is equally within the spirit and purpose of the statute; and the simple fact that they are not within the state to answer its criminal process, when required, renders them, in legal intendment, fugitives from justice, regardless of their purpose in leaving.' In Re Voorhees, 32 N. J. L. 141, 150, the court said: 'A person who commits a crime within a state, and withdraws himself from such jurisdiction without waiting to abide the consequences of such act, must be regarded as a fugitive from the justice of the state whose laws he has infringed. Any other construction would not only be inconsistent with good sense and with the obvious import of the word to be interpreted in the context in which it stands, but would likewise destroy, for most practical purposes, the efficacy of the entire constitutional provision.' In Ex parte Swearingen, 13 S. C. 74, 80, the court held that the terms 'fugitive from justice' 'were intended to embrace not only a case where a party, after committing a crime, actually flees, in the literal sense of that term, from the state where such crime was committed, but also a case where \n\n[203 U.S. 222, 232]\n\u00a0\n a citizen of one state, who, within the territorial limits of another state, commits a crime, and then simply returns to his own home. The object of the Constitution was to enable a state whose laws had been violated, to secure the arrest of the person charged with such violation, even though such person might be beyond the reach of the ordinary process of such state.' In Re Mohr, 73 Ala. 503, 512, 49 Am. Rep. 63, the court, referring to the words in the Constitution, 'who shall flee from justice and be found in another state,' said: 'There is a difference of opinion as to what must be the exact nature of this flight on the part of the criminal, but the better view, perhaps, is that any person is a fugitive whithin the purview of the Constitution, 'who goes into a state, commits a crime, and then returns home.\" In Hibler v. State, 43 Tex. 197, 201, the court said: 'The words 'fugitive from justice' as used in this connection, must not be understood in a literal sense, but in reference to the subject- matter, considering the general object of the Constitution and laws of the United States in relation thereto. A person who commits a crime in one state, for which he is indicted, and departs therefrom, and is found in another state, may well be regarded as a fugitive from justice in the sense in which it is here used.'\n Referring to the opinion in Pettibone v. Nichols (just decided) \n203 U.S. 192\n, 51 L. ed. 148, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 111, for a further discussion of the general subject, and perceiving no error in the action of the Circuit Court, its final order is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","9":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nARMOUR PACKING CO. v. LACY(1906)\nNo. 53\nArgued: November 8, 1905Decided: January 8, 1906\n\n\n\n\n[200 U.S. 226, 227]\n\u00a0\n Statement by Mr. Chief Justice Fuller:\n This was 'a controversy without action,' submitted in accordance with the laws of North Carolina in that behalf, in the superior court of Buncombe county, that state, in which B. R. Lacey, treasurer of North Carolina, was plaintiff, and Armour Packing Company was defendant.\n By the revenue law of North Carolina of March 9, 1903 (N. C. Public Laws, p. 323, chap. 247), it is provided in schedule B:\n'Sec. 26. Defining taxes under this schedule. Taxes in this schedule shall be imposed as license tax for the privilege of carrying on the business or doing the act named, and nothing in this act contained shall be construed to relieve any person or corporation from the payment of tax as required in the preceding schedule.'\n\n'Sec. 56. Packing houses. Upon every meat-packing house doing business in this state, $100 for each county in which said business is carried on.'\n\n'Sec. 88. Unless prohibited, county may levy same license tax as state. In case where a specific license tax is levied for the privilege of carrying on any business, trade, or profession, the county may levy the same tax, and no more: Provided, no provision to the contrary is made in the section levying the specific license tax.' \n\n[200 U.S. 226, 228]\n\u00a0\n Section 107 of chapter 251 of Public Laws of 1903 (p. 407) reads:\n\n Sec. 107. State treasurer to sue for taxes. Upon failure to pay to the state treasurer within thirty days after the same shall have become due, any tax which by law is made payable direct to the state treasurer, it shall be his duty to institute an action to enforce the same in the county of Wake, or in the county in which the property taxed is located.'\n The 3d section of article 5 of the Constitution of North carolina provides:\n'Laws shall be passed taxing, by a uniform rule, all moneys, credits, investments in bonds, stocks, joint stock companies, or otherwise; . . . The general assembly may also tax trades, professions, franchises, and incomes.'\n\n It appeared from the facts agreed, as in substance stated by the supreme court of North Carolina, that the Armour Packing Company was incorporated in New Jersey, but has its principal office and place of business in Kansas, that business being 'a meat-packing house business,' and that it has property in North Carolina; that 'a meat-packing house is a place where the business of slaughtering animals, and dressing and preparing the products of their carcasses for food and other purposes, is carried on; the products thus prepared consist of fresh and cured meats, such as hams, dry salt sides, bacon, lard, beef extracts, glue, blood, tankage, etc.' That the Armour Packing Company 'does not, anywhere within the state of North Carolina, slaughter, dress, cure, pack, or manufacture any products hereinbefore set forth, of any animal, for food, or for commercial use, or for other purposes;' but that after the animals are slaughtered, dressed, and prepared for food or other commercial purposes in Kansas, such product is shipped in bulk to Wilmington, Greensboro, Asheville, Charlotte, and Fayetteville, North Carolina, where the company has cold storage plants and warehouses, and sold from such storage plants, some of such product to parties in North Carolina and some to parties outside of that state; that part of said products shipped to \n\n[200 U.S. 226, 229]\n\u00a0\n the cold storage warehouse in Asheville, Buncombe county, remain there until disposed of in due course of trade on orders taken and received after said products have been stored or placed in said warehouse or cold storage plants. At each of said five points in North Carolina, where the company maintains a warehouse and cold storage plants, it has one or more employees, i. e., bookkeepers, stenographers, shipping clerks, salesmen, drivers, laborers who box said meats and who wrap and crate goods for delivery as they are sold. There are, in Wilmington and other cities of said state, commission merchants, brokers, and butchers who sell by wholesale and retail in competition with the Armour Packing Company, who are not engaged in a meat-packing house business in North Carolina or elsewhere, fresh, cured, and salt meats and other products that have been manufactured from the carcasses of slaughtered animals for food and commercial purposes, and, under the laws of North Carolina, said commission merchants, brokers, and butchers are not amenable to the tax levied under  56 of said revenue act of 1903. At all points in North Carolina where the Armour Packing Company is engaged in business, and at various other places in said state, there are engaged in business, as the Armour Packing Company is engaged, packing houses which pack articles of food other than meat, and offer them for sale in said state, such as peas, beans, tomatoes, corn, pumpkins, fruit, fish, oysters, etc. The products of said packing houses are articles of food and commerce, and are sold in the state of North Carolina through agents, brokers, wholesale and retail merchants, just as the products packed by the Armour Packing Company are sold.\n The ruling of the court was invoked on certain points stated, all of which were adjudged adversely to defendant, and judgment was rendered against it for the tax and costs, which was affirmed by the supreme court of North Carolina. 134 N. C. 567, 47 S. E. 53.\n Mr. Thomas B. Felder, Jr., for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[200 U.S. 226, 231]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Robert D. Gilmer for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n\n[200 U.S. 226, 233]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n The supreme court of North Carolina stated the contentions of the Armour Packing Company thus:\n'1. That it is not engaged in doing a packing-house business in this state; . . . (2) that the tax is an interference with interstate commerce; ( 3) that the tax contravenes  3 of article 5 of the Constitution of North Carolina, which requires taxation 'by uniform rule;' (4) that the tax is forbidden by the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States; ( 5) that singling out 'meat-packing houses' for taxation is arbitrary or class legislation, and prohibited by both state and Federal Constitutions.'\n\n The court said:\n'If the business of the defendant was solely that of shipping food products into this state, consigned directly to purchasers, on orders previously obtained, it is clear that this would be interstate commerce, and a tax laid by the state upon such business would be illegal. But the defendant does a large business within the state,-the selling of products already stored here on orders received after these products are thus stored. The tax is laid upon every meat-packing house 'doing busines in this state.' The evident meaning of the legislature is to \n\n[200 U.S. 226, 234]\n\u00a0\n tax the agency 'doing business' within this state, and not to lay any tax upon the interstate commerce of shipping products into the state, to be directly or indirectly delivered to purchasers whose orders were obtained before the goods were shipped.'\n\n And, after recapitulating from the agreed statement the particulars of the business transacted in North Carolina, the court applied the rule that the legislature could prescribe such conditions as it saw fit on the transaction of business by a foreign corporation within the state, and held that the license tax was the condition upon which defendant was permitted to do the business so described; and cited Osborne v. Florida, \n164 U.S. 650\n, 41 L. ed. 586, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 214, as decisive on the question that the license tax applied only to business within the state, and not to that which was interstate in its character; and added: 'The defendant doing business in this state, and the license tax being exacted only by virtue of its intrastate business, the first two grounds of objection are overruled.'\n As was said in Osborne v. Florida, this construction of a state statute by its highest court is not open to review; and, accepting it, the case plainly comes within Kehrer v. Stewart, \n197 U.S. 60\n, 49 L. ed. 663, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 403. That was a writ of error to the supreme court of Georgia (115 Ga. 184, 41 S. E. 680), involving the constitutionality of a statute imposing a tax upon packing house agents, and the liability of an agent of Nelson Morris & Company, a meat-packing firm of Chicago, to pay it. It was contended that Morris & Company did not slaughter, dress, cure, pack, or manufacture the products of animals for food anywhere in the state of Georgia, and that therefore the firm was not doing a packing- house business within the state; that the statute violated the commerce clause of the Constitution, and that it was invalid, in that it denied the equal protection of the laws. These contentions were overruled by the supreme court of Georgia, and this court affirmed the judgment. And among other things it was there said:\n'The act in question does not deny to the petitioner the \n\n[200 U.S. 226, 235]\n\u00a0\n equal protection of the laws, as the tax is imposed alike upon the managing agent both of domestic and of foreign houses. . . . There is no discrimination in favor of the agents of domestic houses, and, while we may suspect that the act was primarily intended to apply to agents of ultra state houses, there is no discrimination upon the face of the act, and none, so far as the record shows, upon its practical administration. As we have frequently held, the state has the right to classify occupations, and to impose different taxes upon different occupations. Such has been constantly the practice of Congress under the internal revenue laws. Cook v. Marshall County, \n196 \nU.S. 261, 275\n, 49 S. L. ed. 471, 476, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 233. What the necessity is for such tax, and upon what occupations it shall be imposed, as well as the amount of the imposition, are exclusively within the control of the state legislature. So long as there is no discrimination against citizens of other states, the amount and necessity of the tax are not open to criticism here.' \n197 U.S. 69\n, 49 L. ed. 668, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 403.\n\n This practically disposes of the fourth and fifth contentions, since the classification of meat-packing houses cannot be said to be an arbitrary selection or not to rest on reasonable grounds, and the 14th Amendment was not intended to prevent a state from adjusting its system of taxation in all proper and reasonable ways, or, through the undoubted power of classification, to impose different taxes upon different trades and professions.\n'A tax may be imposed only upon certain callings and trades; for when the state exerts its power to tax, it is not bound to tax all pursuits or all property that may be legitimately taxed for governmental purposes. It would be an intolerable burden if a state could not tax any property or calling, unless, at the same time, it taxed all property or all callings.' Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co. \n184 \nU.S. 540, 562\n, 46 S. L. ed. 679, 690, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 431, 440.\n\n And see W. W. Cargill Co. v. Minnesota, \n180 U.S. 452\n, 45 L. ed. 619, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 423; Kidd v. Alabama, \n188 U.S. 730\n, 47 L. ed. 669, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 401; Savannah, T. & I. of H. R. Co. v. Savannah, \n198 U.S. 392\n, 49 L. ed. 1097, 25 Sup. Ct.

Co. \n191 U.S. 307\n, 48 L. ed. 193, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 74.\n By the act under consideration the tax is levied upon every packing house doing business in the state, which includes by its terms both domestic and foreign meat-packing houses. It is true that it appears that where the Armour Packing Company does business certain persons sell, both by wholesale and retail, packing-house products, and yet are not subjected to this tax, but also that those parties are not doing, either in North Carolina or elsewhere, a packing-house business. And so it appears that in North Carolina, at the points where the Armour Packing Company is engaged in business, and at other places in the state, there are establishments engaged in business, which pack articles of food other than meats, such as peas, beans, pumpkins, etc., and offer them for sale; but we cannot accept the suggestion that the statute is void as denying the equal protection of the laws to meat-packing houses because houses packing vegetables and the like are not included in the same classification, and subject to the same tax.\n As to the contention that the act is in violation of  3 of article 5 of the state Constitution, the state supreme court held that this tax, although not a property or ad valorem tax, was controlled, even if the requirement of uniformity were applicable, by the rule that 'a tax is uniform when it is equal upon all persons belonging to the described class upon which it is imposed.' And with that conclusion it is not our province, nor are we disposed, to interfere.\n Judgment affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice Brown (with whom was Mr. Justice Peckham), dissenting:\n The main, and practically the only, question in this case is whether the Armour Packing Company was a 'meat-packing house doing business' in the state of North Carolina within \n\n[200 U.S. 226, 237]\n\u00a0\n the meaning of the statute. The seventh and eighth items of the stipulation of facts are as follows:\n'7. A meat-packing house is a place where the business of slaughtering animals, and dressing and preparing the products of their carcasses for food and other purposes, is carried on. The products thus prepared consist of fresh and cured meats, such as hams, dry salt sides, bacon, lard, beef extracts, glue, blood, tankage, etc.\n\n'8. Said Armour Packing Company does not anywhere, within the state of North Carolina, slaughter, dress, cure, pack, or manufacture any products hereinbefore set forth, of any animal, for food, or for commercial use, or for other purposes.'\n\n As one article of the findings defines the meat-packing business to consist in doing certain things, and the very next article declares that none of these things are done within the state, it is difficult to say that, notwithstanding these findings of fact, there is a conclusion of law that the company is doing a meat-packing business in that state. The packing company doubtless falls within the letter of the statute. It does a meat-packing business in Kansas City. It does a business in North Carolina. But, as we have said in numerous cases, a thing may be within the letter of a statute, and not be within its spirit. United States v. Babbit, 1 Black, 55, 17 L. ed. 94. The letter of the statute in this case would be satisfied if the packing company did a furniture or dry goods business in North Carolina, yet it would clearly not be within the intent of the statute. If, for instance, the tax were upon breweries, and the beer were all manufactured out of the state, and then shipped into the state for sale and distribution, is it possible that the defendant would be liable for doing business as a brewer? So if the tax were imposed upon the manufacturers of carriages, and all the manufacturing were done in Chicago, and the carriages shipped into North Carolina, and there sold, the defendant would be liable as a dealer in carriages, but certainly not as a manufacturer. The business done at the five cold storage plants, which consists in packing the meats and wrapping them for delivery as \n\n[200 U.S. 226, 238]\n\u00a0\n they are sold, is not mentioned in the seventh finding, even as an incidental part of the packing business. Much less even is the business of selling meats at retail, as ordinary butchers do. Yet, in the opinion of the court, the company was doing a meat-packing house business within the state. In the view of the minority, the business done within the state must be a meat-packing business, and not the business of selling meats, either at wholesale or retail; and when the meat-packing house is accurately defined in the stipulation, and no part of the business thus defined appears to have been done within the state, it is impossible to support the tax.\n The case resembles that of Kehrer v. Stewart, \n197 U.S. 60\n, 49 L. ed. 663, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 403, in many particulars, but with the vital difference that the law of Georgia imposed a tax upon 'all agents of packing houses doing business within this state, $200, in each county where said business is carried on.' As the tax was imposed upon agents of packing houses, and not upon the packing houses themselves, the court was unanimously of the opinion that the managing agents of foreign packing houses were subject to the tax. But in this case the act attempts to reach out and tax packing houses doing business as such exclusively in another state.\n With the utmost deference to the opinion of the court, we are constrained to dissent from its view.\n Mr. Justice White and Mr. Justice McKenna also dissented upon other grounds. \n\n\n\n","10":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nATLANTIC COAST LINE R. CO. v. FLORIDA EX REL ELLIS(1906)\n\nArgued: Decided: December 3, 1906\n\n\n\n On December 17, 1903, the railroad commission of the state of Florida, after notice and a hearing, made an order:\n'That the rate to be charged by all the railroads and common carriers doing business wholly or in part within the state of Florida, for the transportation of phosphate from points in the state to points within the state, shall not exceed 1 cent per ton per mile.\n\n'Provided, however, that where the rate of 1 cent per ton per mile will raise any rate now in operation, that said rate of 1 cent per ton per mile shall not be effective, but the rate as now charged by the railroad companies is hereby adopted by the railroad commissioners as their rate between such points.\n\n'It is therefore ordered, that where a shipment of phosphate shall pass over two or more railroads in reaching its destination within the state of Florida, the initial line may charge 1 1\/2 cents per ton per mile for the first ten miles which said phosphate shall be hauled.'\n\n The railroad company, plaintiff in error, which was a party to the \n\n[203 U.S. 256, 257]\n\u00a0\n proceedings before the commission, not complying with this order, application was made on March 7, 1904, to the supreme court of the state for a writ of mandamus to compel compliance, and on October 19, 1904, the peremptory writ was ordered by that court, as prayed for. 48 Fla. 146, 37 So. 657. Thereupon the railroad company sued out this writ of error.\n No special findings of fact were made by the supreme court, but in its opinion it said:\n'There is a total lack of positive proof that the commission rate is materially less than that now charged. The company proves merely that its books do not show that any local phosphate has been carried by it, but does not show what rate it charges on the interstate shipments of phosphate. There is some showing of the expensiveness of handling phosphate for foreign shipment, much of which would not enter into the local or intrastate business, should such be carried, but nothing is shown from which this court can say that the rate fixed by the commission is unreasonable. The evidence offered might tend to show that the rate is unnecessary or that it is speculative, but such questions the court is not called upon to decide.\n\n ... * *\n'Taking the figures from the brief filed by the respondent, we find that the local business alone produces a net earning of at least 3 per cent on the total value of the road in Florida, charging against such income the whole of the taxes. While a state is not permitted to offset local business against interstate business, and to justify low local rates by reason of the profitableness of the latter, yet the interstate and foreign business may and should be considered in determining the proportion of the value of the property of the company assignable to local business. There is no proper showing of the interstate and foreign business, so that we may determine on what fraction of the whole value of the property in Florida the company might be entitled to earn an income from local business; there is, however, a showing that the interstate and foreign business is large and, on a proper showing and a proper pro- \n\n[203 U.S. 256, 258]\n\u00a0\n portioning of the service between domestic and foreign business, this percentage of net income would be largely increased.\n\n ... * *\n'Under the burden of proof case by the law upon the respondent, we find that the rate in question is not unreasonable.'\n\n Mr. John E. Hartridge for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[203 U.S. 256, 259]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. J. M. Barrs and W. H. Ellis for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justic e Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n Passing all matters of a local nature, in respect to which the decision of the state court is final, the Federal question is whether the order of the railroad commission, sustained by the supreme court of the state, deprived the company of its property without due process of law, or denied to it the equal protection of the law. The testimony taken before the commission was not preserved, but, by the law of the state, the rates established by such commission are to be taken in all courts as prima facie just and reasonable. Florida Laws 1899, chap. 4700,  8, pp. 76, 82. We start, therefore, with the presumption in favor of the order.\n The testimony on the hearing of the application in the supreme court is, however, in the record. That court, in the exercise of its original jurisdiction of mandamus cases, determines questions of fact as well as of law. State ex rel. Columbia County v. Suwannee County, 21 Fla. 1. \n\n[203 U.S. 256, 260]\n\u00a0\n While it did not make any distinct findings of fact, yet its deductions from the testimony are clearly indicated by the quotations from its opinion. If it be said that, in the absence of special findings of fact, it is the duty of this court to examine the testimony upon which the judgment was entered, it is very clear that there was no sufficient evidence presented to that court to justify a refusal to enforce the order of the railroad commission.\n And here we face this situation: The order of the commission was not operative upon all local rates, but only fixed the rate on a single article; to wit, phosphate. There is no evidence of the amount of phosphates carried locally; neither is it shown how much a change in the rate of carrying them will affect the income, nor how much the rate fixed by the railroads for carrying phosphate has been changed by the order of the commission. There is testimony tending to show the gross income from all local freights and the value of the railroad property, and also certain difficulties in the way of transporting phosphates, owing to the lack of facilities at the terminals. But there is nothing from which we can determine the cost of such transportation. We are aware of the difficulty which attends proof of the cost of transporting a single article, and, in order to determine the reasonableness of a rate prescribed, it may sometimes be necessary to accept as a basis the average rate of all transportation per ton per mile. We shall not attempt to indicate to what extent or in what cases the inquiry must be special and limited. It is enough for the present to hold that there is in the record nothing from which a reasonable deduction can be made as to the cost of transportation, the amount of phosphates transported, or the effect which the rate established by the commission will have upon the income. Under these circumstances it is impossible to hold that there was error in the conclusions reached by the Supreme Court of the State of Florida, and its judgment is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","11":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nAYER & LORD TIE CO. v. COM. OF KENTUCKY(1906)\nNo. 268\nArgued: April 27, 1906Decided: May 21, 1906\n\n\n\n The commonwealth of Kentucky, by Frank A. Lucas, revenue agent, commenced an action in the county court of McCracken county to recover from the Ayer & Lord Tie Company alleged omitted state, county, and municipal taxes for the years 1899, 1900, and 1901, claimed to be assessable upon two steamboats and certain barges, and, for the year 1901, upon one other steamboat, all the property of the company.\n In the statement of the plaintiff the right to recover in respect of the steamboats was based solely upon the assertion that, on the dates when it was alleged the boats became subject to the taxes in question, they were 'enrolled, in accordance with the laws of the United States governing navigation, at the port of Paducah, in the county of McCracken and state of Kentucky; that, as required by the said laws of the United \n\n[202 U.S. 409, 410]\n\u00a0\n States governing navigation, the words of 'Paducah, Kentucky' were painted on the stern of said steamboats; that said boats, when not in use, are kept at Paducah, Kentucky, and that the said port of Paducah is, and was, on each of said days, the home port of said steamboats.'\n The right to recover in respect of the barges was based upon the allegation that 'each and all of said boats are now, and were, on each of the above days mentioned, used by the defendant for the purpose of towing ties, loaded on barges; that the defendant was, on each of the days aforesaid, the owner, seised of, and in possession of, certain barges, used in connection with said steamboats, for the purpose of transporting railroad ties.'\n The tie company answered as follows: That it was an Illinois corporation, chartered in 1893, and empowered 'to transact business with steamboats engaged in interstate commerce;' that 'ever since its incorporation it has been engaged in business as owner of towboats, plying on the Mississippi, Ohio, Tennessee, and Cumberland rivers, and their tributaries; that the business in which towboats had been engaged is that of interstate commerce and of transporting railroad ties in its own barges from different points of said rivers to the port of Brookport, in the state of Illinois; that their said towboats, in pursuit of their business, occasionally touch at the point of Paducah, Kentucky, but never to discharge their cargo, but simply for the purpose of buying stores, employing seamen, and for other like purposes; that they and said barges are in the state of Kentucky but temporarily, and most of their business is transportations from ports and places in Alabama, Mississippi, Kentucky, Missouri, Arkansas, Illinois, and Tennessee to said Port of Brookport, in the state of Illinois; St. Louis, in the state of Missouri; Duval's Bluff, in the state of Arkansas,-at which ports said towboats discharge and deliver their respective cargo of ties; and said boats and barges, owned and controlled by Ayer & Lord Tie Company, were engaged in the business aforesaid during and prior to years \n\n[202 U.S. 409, 411]\n\u00a0\n 1899, 1900, and 1901, and, since owned by the said defendant company, have never been engaged in any other business but as aforesaid, nor has said company, since its incorporation, been engaged in any other business than as aforesaid; that their said vessels were and are regularly licensed and enrolled by the United States under and in pursuance to the acts of Congress.'\n It is further averred that, although the tie company had offices in various cities of Illinois situated on the Ohio river, as also offices in the cities of Paducah and Fulton, in the state of Kentucky, and Duval's Bluff, in the state of Arkansas, it had such offices in Kentucky for convenience, and its principal office was averred to be in the state of Illinois, of which state it was a citizen.\n It was denied that the home port of its vessels was in the port of Paducah, Kentucky, and it was averred that such vessels were enrolled in Kentucky for convenience, and that, when they were so enrolled, the general manager of its transportation department and of the steamboats of the tie company was a resident of the state of Kentucky.\n It was further specifically averred that, during the year for which the state of Kentucky was seeking to assess the property in question for taxation, 'all of said property was assessed (listed?) by the defendant in the state of Illinois for taxation, and has been taxed, and defendant has paid taxes under the state of Illinois, to said state and city of Chicago on all of said property, and denies the right of the state of Kentucky to subject same property to taxation.'\n Claiming the right, under the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States, to trade at the ports of the different states without molestation by the state of Kentucky, the company averred that the imposition and the collection of taxes in question would operate an unlawful interference with the right of the company to trade or engage in interstate commerce as it had heretofore been accustomed to do.\n A demurrer was filed to the answer on the ground that it \n\n[202 U.S. 409, 412]\n\u00a0\n did not state facts sufficient to constitute a defense. The county court overruled the demurrer, and, plaintiff declining to plead further, the court dismissed 'the plaintiff's statement and action.' The case was then taken by appeal to the circuit court of McCracken county. As part of the record from the county court, the defendant filed in the circuit court a petition and bond for removal of the cause to a Federal court, upon the ground of diversity of citizenship. On the trial of the case, before action taken on a demurrer which had been refiled to the answer, the court overruled and dismissed the petition for removal, and the defendant excepted. The demurrer to the answer was overruled, and, the plaintiff declining to plead further, a judgment of dismissal was entered. The cause was then appealed to the court of appeals of Kentucky. That court held that the demurrer should have been sustained, and the judgment in favor of the company was reversed. 25 Ky. L. Rep. 1068, 77 S. W. 686. A petition for rehearing was denied for reasons stated in an opinion. 25 Ky. L. Rep. 2061, 79 S. W. 290.\n After the mandate of the court of appeals was filed in the circuit court, that court, upon the pleadings, and the mandate and opinion of the court of appeals, entered a judgment sustaining the demurrer, and, the defendant declining to plead further, the allegations of plaintiff's statement were taken for confessed, and it was adjudged that the property therein described was liable for taxation at the values stated in the judgment, and the defendant was adjudged to pay the taxes due upon such assessable values for the years in controversy, with the statutory penalty. In compliance with the request of the defendant the court separately stated its findings of fact and conclusions of law, which are as follows:\n'Separation of Findings of Facts from Conclusions of Law.\n\n'That the defendant was, at the time specified in the pleadings, the sole owner of the following-described property, named in the petition, to wit: Steamers Russel Lord, Pavonia, Inver- \n\n[202 U.S. 409, 413]\n\u00a0\n ness, and barges; that the same were of the value as follows, as set out in the statement: Russel Lord, $13,000; Pavonia, $10,000; Inverness, $2, 500; barges, $10,000; that the defendant had enrolled said steamboats at Paducah, Kentucky, with the name 'Paducah' painted on the stern of said vessels; that the defendant was a corporation legally incorporated under the laws of the state of Illinois.\n\n'As a matter of law the court adjudges that the port of Paducah, Kentucky, was, at the times mentioned in the statement, the home port of said vessels and barges belonging to defendant and named in the statement, and that all of said vessels were liable to assessment and valuation, at the times stated in the statement, in McCracken county, Kentucky, for purposes of state, county, and city taxes for the years, respectively, Russel Lord and Pavonia, 1899, 1900, and 1901; Inverness, 1901; barges, 1899, 1900, and 1901. The defendant excepts to each of the above findings of facts, and also to all of the conclusions of law.'\n\n A motion to set aside the judgment and for a new trial having been made and overruled, the cause was again appealed to the courts of appeals of Kentucky. That court affirmed the judgment of the circuit court upon the authority of its previous opinion, and the case was then brought to this court.\n Messrs. Charles E. Kremer and James Campbell for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[202 U.S. 409, 416]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. N. B. Hays, Charles H. Morris, J. H. Ralston, and Taylor & Lucas for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n\n[202 U.S. 409, 418]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice White, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n As, in the argument, counsel for plaintiff in error has not discussed the alleged error in overruling the motion to remove, we treat that question as waived and pass to the merits.\n Notwithstanding, by the demurrer to the answer, it was conceded that the tie company was the owner of the alleged taxable property, that it was an Illinois corporation, and that its main office was in Chicago, that it had paid taxes in Illinois upon such property, that the property was employed in interstate commerce between ports of different states, including the state of Illinois, that its steamboats were enrolled at Paducah, Kentucky, for convenience, Kentucky being the place of residence of one of its managing officers, and that its boats touched Paducah only temporarily, never receiving or discharging cargo at that port, the court of appeals of Kentucky held that the property in question was subject to the taxing power of the state of Kentucky. The existence of power in the state to tax the property in question was rested solely upon the proposition that, as the steamboats were enrolled at Paducah, and the name 'Paducah' was painted upon their sterns, it was to be conclusively presumed that the home port of the vessels was at Paducah, and that such home port was the situs of the property for taxation. The barges were brought within the principle announced, because they were treated as mere accessories of the steamboats. While, in the opinion, the steamboats were regarded as operated under a registry, the fact is they were engaged in the coastwise trade under an enrolment and license. But this is immaterial, since vessels, in order to be enrolled, must possess the qualifications and fulfil the requirements necessary for registration.\n To comprehend the question a chronological statement of the legislation of Congress as to the registration or enrolment of vessels, etc., is necessary. \n\n[202 U.S. 409, 419]\n\u00a0\n By  3 of an act approved December 31, 1792 (1 Stat. at L. 288, chap. 1 U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 2808, 2830), it was provided as follows:\n'Sec. 3. And be it further enacted, that every ship or vessel, hereafter to be registered (except as is hereinafter provided), shall be registered by the collector of the district in which shall be comprehended the port to which such ship or vessel shall belong, at the time of her rigistry, which port shall be deemed to be that at or nearest to which the owner, if there be but one, or, if more than one, the husband or acting and managing owner of such ship or vessel, usually resides. And the name of the said ship or vessel, and of the port to which she shall so belong, shall be painted on her stern, on a black ground, in white letters of not less than three inches in length. And if any ship or vessel of the United States shall be found without having her name, and the name of the port to which she belongs, painted in manner aforesaid, the owner or owners shall forfeit fifty dollars; one half to the person giving the information thereof; the other half to the use of the United States.'\n\n On June 23, 1874 (18 Stat. at L. 252, chap. 467), the foregoing provision was amended so to allow the name of the vessel to be painted upon her stern in yellow or gold letters. In the Revised Statutes the requirement in question was separated into two sections ( 4141, 4178, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 2808, 2830), reading as follows:\n'Sec. 4141. Every vessel, except as is hereinafter provided, shall be registered by the collector of that collection district which includes the port to which such vessel shall belong at the time of her registry; which port shall be deemed to be that at or nearest to which the owner, if there be but one, or, if more than one, the husband or acting and managing owner of such vessel, usually reaides.'\n\n'Sec. 4178. The name of every registered vessel, and of the port to which she shall belong, shall be painted on her stern, on a black ground, in white letters of not less than three inches in length. If any vessel of the United States shall be \n\n[202 U.S. 409, 420]\n\u00a0\n found without having her name and the name of the port to which she belongs so painted, the owner or owners shall be liable to a penalty of fifty dollars, recoverable one half to the person giving the information thereof, the other half to the use of the United States.'\n\n By  2 of the act of February 18, 1793 (1 Stat. at L. 305, chap. 8), 'for enrolling and licensing ships or vessels to be employed in the coasting trade,' etc., the same requirements were made essential for enrolment as for registering; and, by  11, licensed vessels were specifically obliged to have the name and port painted on the stern. As incorporated into the Revised Statutes the latter provision reads as follows:\n'Sec. 4334 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2968). Every licensed vessel shall have her name and the port to which she belongs painted on her stern, in the manner prescribed for registered vessels; and if any licensed vessel be found without such painting, the owner thereof shall be liable to a penalty of twenty dollars.'\n\n By  21 of an act approved June 26, 1884 (23 Stat. at L. 58, chap. 121, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2831), it was provided as follows:\n'Sec. 21. That the word 'port,' as used in sections forty-one hundred and seventy-eight and forty-three hundred and thirty-four of the Revised Statutes, in reference to painting the name and port of every registered or licensed vessel on the stern of such vessel, shall be construed to mean either the port where the vessel is registered or enrolled, or the place in the same district where the vessel was built, or where one or more of the owners reside.'\n\n Again, by acts approved February 21, 1891, chap. 250,  1 (26 Stat. at L. 765), and January 20, 1897, chap. 67,  1 (29 Stat. at L. 491, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2830),  4178, Rev. Stat., was amended so that it now reads as follows:\n'Sec. 4178. The name of every documented vessel of the United States shall be marked upon each bow and upon the stern, and the home port shall also be marked upon the stern. These names shall be painted or gilded, or consist of cut or carved or cast roman letters in light color on a dark ground, \n\n[202 U.S. 409, 421]\n\u00a0\n or in a dark color on a light ground, secured in place, and to be distinctly visible. The smallest letters used shall not be less in size than four inches. If any such vessel shall be found without these names being so marked, the owner or owners shall be liable to a penalty of ten dollars for each name omitted: Provided, however, That the names on each bow may be marked within the year eighteen hundred and ninety-seven.'\n\n Was the ruling below justified by these statutes? We think not.\n The general rule has long been settled as to vessels plying between the ports of different states, engaged in the coastwise trade, that the domicil of the owner is the situs of a vessel for the purpose of taxation, wholly irrespective of the place of enrolment, subject, however, to the exception that where a vessel engaged in interstate commerce has acquired an actual situs in a state other than the place of the domicil of the owner, it may there be taxed because within the jurisdiction of the taxing authority.\n In Hays v. Pacific Mail S. S. Co. 17 How. 596, 15 L. ed. 254, vessels were registered in New York, where the owner resided. The vessels were employed in commerce on the Pacific ocean between San Francisco and Panama, and the question was whether the vessels were subject to taxation in California. It was decided that they were not, as they had not become incorporated into the property of California so as to have an actual situs in that state, and it was declared that the vessels were properly taxable at the domicil of their owner.\n In St. Louis v. Wiggins Ferry Co. 11 Wall. 423, 20 L. ed. 192, the boats of the company, an Illinois corporation, were enrolled at St. Louis and plied between that city and the city of East St. Louis, in the state of Illinois. The company had an office in St. Louis, where its president and other principal officers lived, and where the ordinary business meetings of the directors were held and the corporate seal was kept. A tax was paid upon the boats in Illinois, the residence of the owner. The city of St. Louis \n\n[202 U.S. 409, 422]\n\u00a0\n taxed the ferry boats as personal property 'within the city.' It was, however, held that the boats did not so abide within the city as to become incorporated with and form part of its personal property, citing Hays v. Pacific Mail S. S. Co. supra. In the course of the opinion the court said ( italics mine):\n'The boats were enrolled at the city of St. Louis, but that throws no light upon the subject of our inquiry. The act of 1789,  2 (1 Stat. at L. 55, chap. 11), and the act of 1792,  3 (1 Stat. at L. 288, chap.1), require every vessel to be registered in the district to which she belongs, and the 4th section of the former act, and the 3d section of the latter, declares that her home port shall be that at or near which her owner resides. The solution of the question where her home port is, when it arises, depends wholly upon the locality of her owner's residence, and not upon the place of her enrolment. 3 Kent. Com. 133, 170; Hill v. The Golden Gate, Newberry, Adm. 308, Fed. Cas. No. 6,492; Dudlg v. The Superior, Newberry, Adm. 181, Fed. Cas. No. 4,115; Jordan v. Young, 38 Me. 276.\n\n In Morgan v. Parham, 16 Wall. 471, 21 L. ed. 303, a vessel originally registered in New York had been engaged for years in the coastwise trade between Mobile and New Orleans and was enrolled at Mobile. It was decided that the boat could not be taxed in Alabama.\n In Wheeling, P. & C. Transp. Co. v. Wheeling, \n99 U.S. 273\n, 25 L. ed. 412, vessels engaged in commerce between ports of different states were held taxable at the domicil of the owner.\n Quite recently, in Old Dominion S. S. Co. v. Virginia, \n198 U.S. 299\n, 49 L. ed. 1059, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 686, the foregoing authorities were approvingly cited, and were in effect reaffirmed. In that case the vessels were enrolled in New York, the domicil of the owner, but, although engaged in interstate commerce, the vessels were navigated wholly within the limits of the state of Virginia, it was held that they came within the exception to the general rule which we have previously stated, and were properly taxable in Virginia. \n\n[202 U.S. 409, 423]\n\u00a0\n As, in the case at bar, the owner of the vessels was domiciled in Illinois and the vessels were not employed exclusively in commerce between points in the state of Kentucky, but were engaged in traffic between that state and the ports of other states, including Illinois, it seems obvious that, as a question of fact, they had no permanent situs in the state of Kentucky within the rule announced in the Old Dominion Steamship Case. The right, then, of the state of Kentucky to tax the vessels, must solely depend upon the fact that they were enrolled at the port of Paducah, in that state. But, if enrolment at that place was within the statutes, it is wholly immaterial, since the previous decisions to which we have referred decisively establish that enrolment is irrelevant to the question of taxation, because the power of taxation of vessels depends either upon the actual domicil of the owner or the permanent situs of the property within the taxing jurisdiction. The court below, however, did not apparently decline to apply the previous decisions of this court, but treated them as inapposite, under the assumption that they were rendered before the act of 1884, and that the necessary effect of that statute was to change the general law so as to cause vessels to be subject to taxation within a state where they were enrolled, although that state was neither the residence of the owner nor the place of the actual situs of the property. As the ruling below was made before the decision of this court in the Old Dominion Steamship Company Case, rendered since the act of 1884, we might well leave the demonstration of the error into which the court fell to result from the decision of that case, since the ruling below is wholly inconsistent with that decision. This clearly follows, since, in the Old Dominion Steamship Case, the right of the state of Virginia to tax was based upon the permanent situs of the vessels in Virginia, although they were enrolled in another state. But, in view of the general importance of the subject, we shall briefly point out the mistaken construction given by the court below to the act of 1884\n\n\n After referring to the act of 1884, and quoting the provisions \n\n[202 U.S. 409, 424]\n\u00a0\n of the Rev. Stat.  4178, as now existing, the court below said:\n'Appellee had a right to cause its boats to be registered at Paducah, although that was not the place nearest to the port where it resided, and it fully complied with the law regulating the subject by painting the words 'of Paducah, Kentucky,' on the stern thereof; and, by the amendment of 1884, Paducah became the home port of the vessels so registered and marked.\n\n ... * *\n'The steamboats involved in this litigation are separated from the residence of their owner by a long distance . . . ; in fact, they can never visit the port at which their owner resides; they are, so far as their actual situs is concerned, permanently confined to the rivers over which they float; if their home port had to be Chicago, because that is the residence of their owner, as under the law prior to 1884, then they would have a home port from which they could derive no advantage or protection, because they could never reach it. It was to obviate this hardship, with others, that the act of 1884 was passed by Congress, permitting their owners to select for them a home port in the field of their operations, which is for them a home port in fact, as well as in law and name. Property such as that under consideration ought, logically, to be taxed at its own home port; there it can be seen and properly valued for assessment by the fiscal officers; whereas, at the residence of its owner (Chicago), the officers, of necessity, must rely on the statements of the latter for both its existence [of the property] and its value. At its home port it enjoys the protection of the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is located, and both justice and reason would seem to require that property thus permeanetly located, both in legal contemplation and in fact, within a jurisdiction foreigh to that of its owner, should contribute its fair share to the support of that government whose protection it enjoys.' [25 Ky. L. Rep. 1071, 77 S. W. 688.]\n\n It is at once apparent that this line of reasoning, whilst it \n\n[202 U.S. 409, 425]\n\u00a0\n asserts the principle of actual situs, and expounds the act of 1884 as making that the exclusive rule to test the power to tax, at once causes the act to destroy the very principle which it was assumed the act upheld. This is the inevitable consequence of the conclusion reached by the court below, that the act of 1884 endowed the owner of a vessel with the power, simply by the painting a name of a place upon his vessel, to make such place the situs for taxation, although it might be neither the actual situs of the property nor the residence of the owner.\n The act in question was an elaborate one, containing thirty sections, relating to the American merchant marine, and was entitled 'An Act to Remove Certain Burdens on the American Merchant Marine, and Encourage the American Foreign Carrying Trade, and for Other Purposes.' 23 Stat. at L. 53, chap. 121, U. S. Comp, Stat. 1901, p. 2804. The only provision contained in that act which had any reference to the subject under consideration, and which was relied upon in the court below, was  21, which we have previously quoted, and which we again copy:\n'Sec 21. That the word 'port,' as used in sections forty-one hundred and seventy-eight and forty-three hundred and thirty-four of the Revised Statutes, in reference to painting the name and port of every registered or licensed vessel on the stern of such vessel, shall be construed to mean either the port where the vessel is registered or enrolled or the place in the same district where the vessel was built or where one or more of the owners reside.'\n\n Clearly this section does not essentially change the prior general law respecting enrolment, as it simply enlarges the power of an owner in regard to painting on the stern of his vessel the name of the place from which he may desire to hail her. The prior provisions as to enrolment clearly exacted that the owner, as an incident to enrolment, should mark upon his vessel the name of the place of enrolment; in other words, compelled the owner to hail his vessel from the place of enrolment, although he might be domiciled elsewhere. Now, \n\n[202 U.S. 409, 426]\n\u00a0\n as the settled rule at the time of the passage of this act was that enrolment, and consequent marking of the stern of the vessel with the name of the place of enrolment, was not the criterion by which to determine the power of taxation, it is impossible to conceive that Congress intended, by merely conferring a privilege to select the name of a place other than the port of enrolment to be marked upon a vessel, to overthrow the settled rules in regard to taxation of such property which existed at the time of the passage of the act of 1884. To give to the statute the construction adopted by the court below would be simply to hold that its purpose was to endow the owner with the faculty of arbitrarily selecting a place for the taxation of his vessel in defiance of the law of domicil, and in disregard of the principle of actual situs, since, by the statute, the owner was given the right to paint either the name of the place where the vessel was built, where enrolled, or where one of the owners resided. And this demonstrates the misconception of the construction given to the act of 1884 by the court below, since the court declared that the whole effect of the act was to endow the owner of vessels with the power to select, by marking on the stern, a place 'in the field of operations,' which should be the place of taxation. But no such limitation as the field of operations can be implied from the language of the statute, and, therefore, if the construction adopted were upheld, the unlimited right of the owner to arbitrarily frustrate the taxing laws of the state where he was rightfully subject to taxation would result.\n Undoubtedly, as we have said, the general statutes as to enrolment in force prior to 1884 required that the name of the port to be painted upon the vessel should be the port of enrolment, although such place might not be the domicil of the owner. In practice, however, that rule was not always observed, because the owners of vessels desired to hail them from the place of the residence of the owner. The Albany, 4 Dill. 439, Fed. Cas. No. 131. And the history of the adoption of the provision now known as  21 of the act of 1884 referred to leaves \n\n[202 U.S. 409, 427]\n\u00a0\n no room for doubt that Congress simply intended to legalize such practice. The provision had its origin in an amendment unanimously reported by the committee on commerce of the Senate on May 1, 1884, to a bill then pending in the Senate. The chairman of the committee, in reporting the proposed amendment, said (15 Cong. Rec. p. 3650):\n Mr. Frye. The next amendment I am authorized to offer is a section in reference to the painting of the name of the ship on the stern. Not very important that must appear to Senators. Many of our shipowners in the state of Maine think more of that than they do of the rest of this bill. This man who owns a ship looks upon her as his wife or his children; he loves his ship; and, under the law as it stands to-day, he is required to paint on the stern the name, it may be that of his wife or of his daughter, and the port to which she belongs. For seventy-five years the port to which she belonged was construed to be the place where she was owned, and if a man built a ship in Surry, and she was owned there, he painted in the stern the 'May Ann, from Surry, Maine.' In 1875 a sharp Treasury official discovered that it was a violation of the law. He reported to the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Secretary issued an order that all those ships must bear the name of the port of entry, regardless of where they were built or owned. They are building vessels, home vessels, owned at home, owned in families, in many instances by the blacksmith, the carpenter, the captain, and the mate. Their vessels they wish to name after one of the family and the home, the place where she is owned and built; and yet, under the construction of the Treasury Department, she may be the 'Julia Ann,' from Machias, her port of entry, but actually built and owned a hundred miles from there. Take Bath and Richmond, on the Kennebec river,-Bath, the greatest ship-building city in the United States to-day of wooden ships; her rival, Richmond, is 15 miles above. The men who build their ships in Richmond regard it as about as serious a wrong as can be imposed upon them by law to compel them \n\n[202 U.S. 409, 428]\n\u00a0\n to put a ship built there and owned there under the name of bath, her port of entry, and Bath would fully reciprocate under like circumstances. I take it that no Senator will object to that provision.\n Mr. Hale. Just there let me ask my colleague, was not the reason for the ruling of the Secretary of the Treasury that the technical view was taken of the word 'port,' and it was concluded there could be nothing but the port of entry, thereby taking away this privilege from the men who built the ship?\n Mr. Frye. I so understand it.\n And, without debate, the amendment was adopted, and subsequently, with other amendments, was incorporated as part of the bill which came from the House of Representatives, relating to the same general subject as the bill which was under consideration in the Senate. Ib. pp. 3869, 3973, 5440.\n The suggestion that, because the vessels were enrolled at Paducah, the owner was estopped from disputing that they had a situs for taxation there, is but to contend that the place of enrolment was per se controlling, in disregard of the repeated rulings of this court to the contrary.\n The judgment of the Court of Appeals of Kentucky must be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","12":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBALLMANN v.

Smith and A. Johnson during the months of December, 1904, and January and February, 1905.' He appeared before the grand jury, and on the same day the grand jury reported his failure to produce the books and papers called for by the subpoena. The court entered an order as of that day, April 7, that he should produce all books and papers pertaining to his business. On April 8 the grand jury filed charges of contempt against him, in that 'being required by said subpoena to produce a certain cash book in use in his business' he refused to do so, and also that he refused to answer the following questions: (a) 'State what, on account No. 140, sheet No. 1, on this big ledger now in use in your business, these figures under the word 'folio,' on the debit side of the account, to wit: No. 349, 349, 349, 349, 349, and 351, refer to.' (b) 'Do not these figures '349,' in your handwriting, on account No. 140, refer to the folios in your cash book in use in your business in January, 1905?' On the same day, April 8, the court, after hearing evidence, ordered Ballmann to produce the said cash book and to answer the above questions at noon on April 10, or to be committed to jail until compliance or discharge by due process of law.\n On April 10 Ballman appeared and made the following answers: 'I have not now, and neither at the time of, nor at any time since, the service of the first subpoena upon me in this matter, have I had in my possession or under my custody or control the book referred to in the order of the court entered on April 8, 1905, or any book showing transactions under the names of A. Smith or A. Johnson, and am unable to produce the same.' 'I decline to answer the questions contained in said order of April 8, 1905, on the ground that it might tend to criminate me; and in this connection I produce copy of a petition filed against me and others by Emanuel Oppenheimer, in the court of common pleas of Hamilton county, being case No. 126,824, and I state that there are many other actions of the same kind pending \n\n[200 U.S. 186, 194]\n\u00a0\n against me.' The petition referred to charged Ballman and others with conducting a scheme of gambling known as a 'bucket shop,'-criminal conduct under the laws of Ohio, the state where the case was being tried.\n Thereupon, upon the same day, the court, without hearing further evidence, reciting its former order and Ballmann's failure to comply with it, ordered him to be imprisoned in accordance with the same. Afterwards a bill of exceptions was allowed, which set forth the proceedings of April 8. It appears that on that day the foreman of the grand jury testified that Ballmann was inquired of with reference to the cash book, and said that there was no such book. (It is fair to read the statement as meaning the same as his formal answer on the 10th, and no more.) Other witnesses gave evidence tending to prove the existence of a cash book, although not, or at least not except by very remote inference, a cash book showing transactions under the name of A. Smith or A. Johnson. It also appears that Ballmann's counsel said to the court: 'As to the book, we say to your honor that we haven't got it;' and also handed the court a paper from Ballmann, reading: 'As to the questions asked, I refuse to answer, as they might tend to criminate me.'\n It appears to us, and it hardly is denied, that the charge of contempt in failing to produce a book is confined, as it was taken by Ballmann's answer to be confined, to a failure to produce a cash book showing transactions under the anme of A. Smith or A. Johnson. We assume that the commitment was upon the charge and the order of April 8, not upon the order entered as of April 7. Upon that assumption it might be enough to say that the court was not warranted in finding Ballmann guilty by any evidence which it had before it. There was nothing to show that his answer was not literally true. Re Watts, \n190 \nU.S. 1, 35\n, 36 S., 47 L. ed. 933, 944, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 718. But we need not stop there. Suppose that Ballmann had in his possession a book which he was privileged from producing, and which he wished not to produce. Suppose, also, that he were summoned as he was in this case, and that the book did not show the dealings \n\n[200 U.S. 186, 195]\n\u00a0\n described,-he could not be criticised very severely for avoiding, if possible, the discrediting claim of privilege, by an answer literally exact. If, then, he should be asked in general terms to produce his cash book, he would not be debarred from pleading his privilege by what he had said before. And without any inclination to enlarge a witness's rights beyond the settled requirements of law, we think that the privilege might extend to any question, the manifest object of which was to prove possession or control as a preliminary to calling for the book.\n To determine whether the case which we have supposed in the case at bar we must consider whether we can see reasonable grounds for believing that the book was privileged, or that it was not,-it does not matter for our purposes in which form the question is put. The subject under investigation, according to the government's statement, was the criminal liability of some employee of a national bank from the vaults of which a large amount of cash had disappeared. The book very possibly may have disclosed dealings with the person or persons naturally suspected, and, especially in view of the charges that Ballmann kept a 'bucket shop,' dealings of a nature likely to lead to a charge that Ballmann was an abettor of the guilty man. If he was, he was guilty of a misdemeanor under Rev. Stat.  5209, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3497, and no more bound to produce the book than to give testimony to the facts which it disclosed. Boyd v. United States, \n116 U.S. 616\n, 29 L. ed. 746, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 524; Counselman v. Hitchcock, \n142 U.S. 547\n, 35 L. ed. 1110, 3 Inters. Com. Rep. 816, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 195.\n Not impossibly Ballmann took this aspect of the matter for granted, as one which would be perceived by the court without his disagreeably emphasizing his own fears. But he did call attention to another, less likely to be known. As we have said, he set forth that there were many proceedings on foot against him as party to a 'bucket shop,' and so subject to the criminal law of the state in which the grand jury was sitting. According to United States v. Saline Bank, 1 Pet. 100, 7 L. ed. 69, he was exonerated from disclosures which would have exposed him to the penalties of the state law. See Jack v. Kansas (decided this term), \n199 U.S. 372\n, 50 L. ed. --, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 73. One way or the other we are of opinion \n\n[200 U.S. 186, 196]\n\u00a0\n that Ballmann could not be required to produce his cash book if he set up that it would tend to criminate him.\n But it is said that he did not set it up, but, on the contrary, denied the existence of the book. We are not of that opinion. We think that he was giving an answer which, whether too sharp or not, might be true even if he had a cash book within his control. His denial was limited explicitly, and with on disguise in the form of statement, to a cash book showing transactions under the name of A. Smith or A. Johnson. It called attention to the limit by its form. And when thereupon he was asked questions, the manifest meaning of which was to fasten upon him an admission that there was a cash book, he at once declined to answer. Of course it may be that he declined because he knew that further answers would disclose the falsity of his first denial. But the natural explanation of the claim of privilege is that a cash book existed, that Ballmann knew it, and that he delieved that if produced it would criminate him in one of the two ways which we have explained. Nothing more need be said about the questions as distinguished from the production of the book. See Counselman v. Hitchcock, \n142 U.S. 547\n, 35 L. ed. 1110, 3 Inters. Com. Rep. 816, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 195.\n We are aware that the courts below came to their conclusions upon the assumption that Ballmann denied generally the possession of a cash book, and that he was before the court for disobedience to an order to produce it. It may be that he now escapes liability as much by luck as by desert. But he is entitled to demand a judgment according to the record, and we are of opinion that, on the record, fairly construed, the judgment of the district court should be reversed. This decision makes any other than formal action upon the habeas corpus unnecessary, and therefore the judgment of the circuit court may be affirmed for the purpose of ending the case.\n Judgment of the District Court reversed.\n Judgment of the Circuit Court affirmed.\n Mr. Justice Harlan and Mr. Justice McKenna dissent. \n\n\n\n","13":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBLAIR v. CITY OF CHICAGO(1906)\nNo. 331\nArgued: Decided: April 2, 1906\n\n\n\n\n\n[201 U.S. 400, 404]\n\u00a0\n These are appeals from the decree of the circuit court of the United States for the northern district of Illinois. The origin of the cases dates from April 22, 1903, when the Guaranty Trust Company of New York, a corporation and citizen of that state, filed three suits in the circuit court of the United States for the northern district of Illinois against the Chicago Union Traction Company, the North Chicago Street Railroad Company, and the West Chicago Street Railroad Company, corporations and citizens of the state of Illinois. On the day the declaration was filed the general issue was joined, the jury waived, and, upon trial, judgment was rendered against the respective defendants for $318,690.66, $565,052. 66, and $270,440. Executions having been awarded and returned 'no property found,' bills were filed by the Guaranty Trust Company, and receivers appointed for the property of each and all of those companies. Under the order of the court of July 18, 1903, the receivers filed two ancillary bills, one against the city of Chicago, the Chicago West Division Railway Company, the Chicago Union Traction Company, and the West Chicago Street Railroad Company; the other against the city of Chicago, the Chicago Union Traction Company, the North Chicago Street Railroad Company, and the North Chicago City Railway Company. They were afterwards amended by leave of the court. These bills state, among other things (having reference now to the west side case), that, as receivers, and under the order of the court, the complainants were in possession of the system of street railroads; that the property included the rights, privileges, and franchises originally granted to the Chicago West Division Railway Company by the state of Illinois; that on October 20, 1887, the Chicago West Division Railway Company leased the property to the West Chicago Street Railroad Company for the full term of nine \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 405]\n\u00a0\n hundred and ninety-nine years; that on June 1, 1889, that company transferred and conveyed to the Chicago Union Traction Company all its property, franchises, and rights, which were taken possession of by that company and were possessed and enjoyed by it with the consent of the city council, until the appointment of complainants as receivers; that since the appointment they have been directed by the court to make expenditures of about $580,000 in procuring new equipment; for that purpose it was necessary to issue receiver's certificates to borrow money, which they alleged they were unable to do, because of the hostile acts of the city of Chicago, its mayor, its council committees and representatives, which amounted to an impairment of the contract rights and franchises secured to the complainants and granted by the acts of the general assembly of Illinois, passed February 14, 1859, and February 6, 1865. They received a notice from the superintendent of streets, dated July 16, 1903, addressed to them as receivers, and stating that all permits issued to the Chicago Union Traction Company to do work and make repairs upon the streets, alleys, or public places in the city of Chicago were to be revoked on July 30, 1903. The bill sets out a large number of ordinances of the city and acts of the state of Illinois, under which acts, it was alleged, privileges and franchises were granted on fifty-six of the streets of the city, for the period of ninety-nine years from February 14, 1859\n\n\n It is averred that the city denies any contract right with the complainants under and by virtue of the said laws and ordinances, and, for the purpose of coercing the railroad companies to surrender their franchises, received from the state, asserts and claims that the act of 1865 is unconstitutional and void; that, if valid, it only operates to the extent of such lines as were authorized and consented to before its passage; that, if valid, the railroads could only operate their lines by animal power; that by force of the ordinance of July 30, 1883, the right to operate lines constructed prior thereto was absolutely limited to July 30, 1903, and that thereafter the railroad com- \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 406]\n\u00a0\n pany would be a trespasser upon the streets of the city; that, by messages and official declarations of the mayor and council of the defendant city, it was given out that, unless the railroad company would surrender its franchises and rights to occupy the streets of the city, the city would oust the railroad company therefrom and pass an ordinance granting the right to operate street railways upon the streets now occupied by the railroad company, to other persons or corporations. That unless an injunction is granted, the city will, after July 30, 1903, proceed, by declaration of forfeiture or otherwise, to interfere with and prevent the occupation and enjoyment of the fifty-six railway routes described in the bill. That as to the street railroads where ordinances provided for possession until the city shall purchase the lines, the city has never made an offer to purchase, and seeks to force a surrender of the franchises and privileges, and to compel the railroad company to accept a twenty years' license, at an oppressive and ruinous annual rental. That if the claim and contentions of the city are sustained, the entire system of the railroad company will be destroyed and its charter rights illegally confiscated.\n The prayer for relief is that the Chicago West Division Railway Company be decreed to be vested by the state of Illinois with the franchises and right to own, maintain, and operate fifty-six street railway routes, described in the bill, until 1960, and until such time thereafter as the city shall purchase the lines and pay for them in cash at their then appraised value, according to the terms of the ordinance contract; that it be decreed that the claim of the city of Chicago that the rights of the companies will expire on July 30, 1903, impairs the obligation of the charter subsisting between the state of Illinois and the said companies, and constitutes an unlawful taking of the rights and property of the company without compensation, and an unlawful interference with the property in the custody of the court; that the charter rights of the companies to maintain, operate, and enjoy the lines described in the bill until the \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 407]\n\u00a0\n year 1960, and thereafter until the city purchases the same, be established and quieted as against the hostile claims of the city, and that such claims be declared and decreed unconstitutional, contrary to law, and exist as clouds upon the title of the company, and for a perpetual injunction against the city from asserting the claims aforesaid, or interfering with the possession, occupation, and enjoyment of the railroad's property, except in the proper exercise of its police power, until the lwful determination of the charter rights.\n The bill in the North Chicago case is substantially the same. It avers that the property vested in the receivers in the north division of the city is about 100 miles of street railroad and the franchises and privileges thereunto belonging; that on May 24, 1886, the North Chicago City Railway Company leased to the North Chicago Street Railroad Company for the term of nine hundred and ninety-nine years all its property, franchises, and rights, except the right to exist as a corporation. That on June 1, 1899, the North Chicago Street Railroad Company leased and conveyed the property, for the full life of the leasor corporation, to the Chicago Union Traction Company; that the traction company entered into possession of the property and continued to use the same until the appointment of the receivers named therein.\n The city answered and set up, among other things, that the suits wherein the receivers were appointed were collusive and in pursuance of a scheme concocted by the West Chicago Street Railroad Company, the North Chicago Street Railroad Company, the Chicago Union Traction Company, and the Guaranty & Trust Company of New York for the purpose of conferring jurisdiction upon the circuit court of the United States on the ground of diverse citizenship; that the Guaranty Trust Company was not a bona fide owner of the judgment upon which the suits were brought; and that the evidences of indebtedness upon which that company brought suit and obtained judgment as a colorable basis for the allowance of creditor's bills and appointment of receivers were not in fact owned by the Guar- \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 408]\n\u00a0\n anty Trust Company, but were owned by divers persons and corporations of the state of Illinois.\n The city denies that the city council passed any ordinance or resolutions that constitute an impairment of the contract rights of the complainants, granted under the acts of the general assembly of the state of Illinois, February 14, 1859, and February 6, 1865, or the ordinances of the city, and denies that it has ever threatened interference with any lawful rights, franchises, or privileges held by the complainants. It admits that its superintendent of streets sent a written notice to the complainants, as alleged in the bill, but without authority from the defendant, and that on July 21, 1903, the same was rescinded and recalled.\n The answer then sets up the claims of the city concerning the legislative acts and ordinances pleaded in the bill, admits the passage or attempted passage thereof, but denies that the same has resulted in investing the railroad companies with a franchise from the state, to maintain and operate the system of railroads for ninety-nine years, and avers that the rights under certain of the ordinances set up in the bill expire on July 30, 1903. Defendant denies that it unlawfully or oppressively injured the lawful rights of the company; admits that it has contended and now contends that the alleged act of 1865 is unconstitutional and void as construed by the company; that the said act, when properly construed, did not operate to extend the duration of time beyond that fixed in various ordinances respectively relating to said lines; that the said companies have no right to operate street railway lines by other than animal power; and that the time for operation of certain of the lines existing under ordinances passed prior to July 30, 1883, expired on July 30, 1903, by reason of the time limits prescribed in said ordinances, as extended by the ordinance of July 30, 1883, and by reason of the limitation in the power of the city by the city and village law of the state of Illinois, passed July 1, 1872. It avers that it has never claimed or asserted that the time for the operation of lines constructed \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 409]\n\u00a0\n under ordinances passed prior to July 30, 1883, absolutely ceased and determined, but, on the contrary, has recognized and conceded the existence of the purchase clause contained in certain of said ordinances as affecting the time limitations therein, and has endeavored to procure proper fiscal legislation by the general assembly of the state, which would enable the city to avail itself of said ordinance provisions with reference to purchase, and has frequently proposed and desired negotiations with the companies to provide new ordinances for the purchase by the defendant of the tangible property of said companies. The answer denies the allegations of the bills as to unlawful threats and compulsions, but admits that it does intend to enforce its rights in its streets against the unlawful claims of the companies, and admits that, unless restrained by injunction, it will proceed by every proper and lawful method to enforce its rights in its streets as set up in the answer, and to procure necessary street railway facilities for the citizens of Chicago, and to prevent the companies from unlawful usurpation of rights in the streets or from continuing to occupy the same after the right so to do has ceased and determined. It admits that as early as 1883 a serious difference as to the nature and extent of the legal and contract rights of the street railway companies in certain of the streets of the city arose between the companies and defendant. It sets up the messages of the mayor and copies of the various resolutions of the council with regard to opening negotiations with the companies for the ascertainment of their rights and those of the city.\n The case having been tried, the circuit court rendered a decree holding that the legislative acts of 1859, 1861, and 1865 constituted a grant to the companies to use the streets of the city to be designated by the council, but that the franchise to use the streets was a grant from the state; that the acts of 1859, 1861, as amended in 1865, extended the franchises of the companies for ninety-nine years, the extended life of the corporation; that the Constitution of Illinois of 1870 prohibited the further creation of corporations by special laws, and de- \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 410]\n\u00a0\n creed that the general assembly should not grant the right to construct any street railways in the city without acquiring the consent of the local authorities then having control over the streets; that the cities and villages act of 1872 empowered cities organized under that act to permit, regulate, or prohibit the locating, laying, or constructing of tracks of horse railroads in any street, alley, or public place, but such permission was limited to a period not to exceed twenty years; that the acts of 1859, 1861, as amended in 1865, did not constitute a grant by the legislature of streets which were authorized to be used and occupied by the city after it adopted and elected to be governed by the city and village act, and that after date of May 3, 1875, as to such streets, the street railway companies' rights were regulated by the city ordinances affecting the same; that the act of 1859, under the 10th section of which the North Chicago City Railway Company was incorporated, amended by the act of February 21, 1865, extended the life of the corporation for ninety-nine years; and held that said amendment applied not only to the Chicago City Railway Company, but as well to the rights conferred by the act of 1859 on the North Chicago City Railway Company. The case is reported in 132 Fed. 848.\n Pertinent parts of the ordinance of August 16, 1858, the acts of February 14, 1859, February 21, 1861, and February 6, 1865, are given in the margin. \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 411]\n\u00a0\n Messrs.

Darrow, Glenn Edward Plumb, Edgar Bronson Tolman, and James Hamilton Lewis for the city of Chicago.\n\n\n\n[201 U.S. 400, 412]\n\u00a0\n\n\n[201 U.S. 400, 413]\n\u00a0\n\n\n[201 U.S. 400, 414]\n\u00a0\n\n\n[201 U.S. 400, 415]\n\u00a0\n\n\n[201 U.S. 400, 416]\n\u00a0\n\n\n[201 U.S. 400, 417]\n\u00a0\n\n\n[201 U.S. 400, 418]\n\u00a0\n\n\n[201 U.S. 400, 430]\n\u00a0\n\n Messrs. Brainard Tolles, John S. Miller, John G. Johnson, John P. Wilson, John J. Herrick, Joseph S. Auerbach, Frederic D. McKenney, and W. W. Gurley for the receivers and railway companies.\n\n\n\n[201 U.S. 400, 447]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n The jurisdiction of the circuit court to render the original judgments against the companies and to maintain the ancillary bill is challenged at the outset. These objections require notice before considering the controversy upon its merits. It is insisted that the circuit court had no jurisdiction to render the judgments at law because of the provisions of the act of August 13, 1888 (25 Stat. at L. 433, 434, chap. 866, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 508), providing that no circuit court shall have cognizance of any suit to recover the contents of any promissory note in favor of any assignee or subsequent holder if such instrument be payable to bearer, unless such suit might have been prosecuted in such court to recover, if an assignment or transfer had not been made. As the notes were made payable to the order of 'Markham B. Orde, Treas.,' and there is no allegation that Orde was not a citizen of the state of Illinois, of which state the defendant fendant companies were corporations and citizens, it is insisted that the jurisdiction must fail, under the provisions of the statute just referred to. Assuming, without deciding, that this ques- \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 448]\n\u00a0\n tion could be raised by way of defense to the ancillary bill, we think the objection must fail, for, under the allegations of the declaration, the money was furnished directly to the defendants by the Guaranty Trust Company, and that company was the first taker of the notes. In Falk v. Moebs, \n127 U.S. 597\n, 32 L. ed. 266, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1319, it was held that notes made in this form, payable to the treasurer, indorsed before delivery by him, are the notes of the company. And when it appears that the indorser is not in fact an assignee of the paper, suit may be brought in a Federal court by a holder having the requisite diverse citizenship, notwithstanding the indorser might have been a citizen of the same state with the defendant. Holmes v. Goldsmith, \n147 U.S. 150\n, 37 L. ed. 118, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 288.\n It is further argued that the entire proceedings were fraudulent and collusive; that no money was in fact loaned, and that they were the result of a conspiracy between corporations of Illinois, to obtain the jurisdiction of the Federal court, and its decision on the controverted rights of the parties under the statutes of the state. We have examined the supplemental records submitted since the argument in this court, on this branch of the case, and think the charges of bad faith and conspiracy are not sustained. We have no doubt that the money was loaned by the Guaranty Trust Company to these corporations, and that the original judgments were bona fide. As to the conspiracy to get the case into the Federal court, with a view to the decision of the rights of the parties therein, we are not aware of any principle which prevents parties having the requisite citizenship and a justiciable demand from seeking the Federal courts for redress, if such be their choice of a forum in which to have contested rights litigated. Having a proper cause of action and the requisite diversity of citizenship confers jurisdiction upon the Federal courts, and in such cases the motive of the creditor in seeking Federal jurisdiction is immaterial. South Dakota v. North Carolina, \n192 \nU.S. 286, 310\n, 48 S. L. ed. 448, 457, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 269; Dickerman v. Northern Trust Co. \n176 \nU.S. 181, 190\n, 44 S. L. ed. 423, 430, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 311; Lehigh Min. & Mfg. Co. \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 449]\n\u00a0\n v. Kelly, \n160 \nU.S. 327, 336\n, 40 S. L. ed. 444, 447, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 307; Crawford v. Neal, \n144 U.S. 585\n, 36 L. ed. 552, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 759; Cheever v. Wilson, 9 Wall. 108, 123, 19 L. ed. 604, 608; Smith v. Kernochen, 7 How. 198, 216, 12 L. ed. 666, 673.\n It is true that the judgments were taken and the receivers appointed on the same day, and it is quite likely that the receiverships were in view when the judgments were taken, and that preparations had been made in that direction, but we perceive in this no legal objection to the jurisdiction of the court. It is further insisted by the counsel for the city that the ancillary bills cannot be sustained upon their merits. But we think a case was made out by the allegations of the bills, especially when considered with reference to the admissions of the answer, which showed that the extent and character of the property rights of the corporations whose rights and franchises were the subjects of the receivership were in direct and serious controversy between the company and the receiver on the one hand and the city on the other. While it may be that there would have been no interference on the part of the city with the property while it was in the hands of the court's receivers, still the record shows that the city strenuously contested the asserted rights of the corporations to the franchise to use the streets of the city for ninety-nine years, the term claimed to have been granted to them by the act of February, 1865. It was the claim of the city that as to many of the ordinances granting rights in a number of the streets, the right to the use and occupancy of them would expire July 30, 1903. The city had asserted in a number of ways its purpose to treat the rights of the companies and whatever franchises they had as terminated at that date. It declares its purpose to treat the rights of the comstreets and resort to all legal means to protect its rights against what were deemed the unfounded claims of the companies as to the extended franchises. Without going into further detail upon this branch of the case, we think that the attitude and claims of the city cast a cloud upon the title to this property which was in the hands of the receivers to be administered \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 450]\n\u00a0\n under the orders of the court, and that in such case the receivers may, with the authority of the court, proceed by ancillary bill to protect the jurisdiction and right to administer the property, and to determine the validity of the claims of the parties which cast a cloud upon the franchises and rights claimed by the companies and the receivers, and that in such case it was proper to grant an injunction until the rights of the parties could be determined. Detroit v. Detroit Citizens' Street R. Co. \n184 U.S. 368\n, 46 L. ed. 592, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 410; Re Tyler, \n149 U.S. 164\n, 37 L. ed. 689, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 785; Rouse v. Letcher, \n156 U.S. 47\n, 39 L. ed. 341, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 266; White v. Ewing, \n159 U.S. 36\n, 40 L. ed. 67, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1018. We think, then, that the court had jurisdiction of the case made in the ancillary bills.\n A further preliminary question is made in the contention that the leases under which the various transfers were made, and which are supposed to have vested title in the Chicago Union Traction Company, are void for want of corporate power in the companies to make or receive the same. We do not think the city of Chicago is in a position to raise that question. The corporations have undertaken to transfer the rights of the lessor companies, and the lessees have gone into possession thereof, and the same are now in possession of the receivers under authority of the court. All of the companies are parties to the suit, and the rights and franchises of all are, by order of the court, vested in the receivers. They hold the title to all these rights to be sold at judicial sale, or otherwise dealt with, as the court may direct. In this view we cannot see that it is material to inquire into the validity of the intermediate transfers between the companies. No contract is undertaken to be enforced with the city of Chicago which depends upon the validity of these transfers. The city has no power to invalidate them, and the state has not attempted to inquire into their validity by a proceeding in quo warranto. In such case, we think, the principle laid down in Fritts v. Palmer, \n132 \nU.S. 282, 293\n, 33 S. L. ed. 317, 321, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 93, 96, is controlling: 'The question whether a corporation having capacity to purchase and hold real estate for certain defined purposes or in certain quantities \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 451]\n\u00a0\n has taken title to real estate for purposes not authorized by law, or in excess of the quantity permitted by its charter, concerns only the state within whose limits the property is situated. It cannot be raised collaterally by private persons unless there is something in the statute, expressly or by necessary implication, authorizing them to do so.'\n Passing now to the merits of the case, we will first notice the objection that the acts of 1859, 1861, and 1865 are unconstitutional. The Illinois Constitution of 1848 contained the provision that no private or local law shall embrace more than one subject, and that shall be expressed in the title. The acts are attacked upon the ground that they are violations of this requirement. But we do not think that these objections are tenable. The title of the act of February 14, 1859, is 'An Act to Promote the Construction of Horse Railways in the City of Chicago;' the title of the act of February 21, 1861, is 'An Act to Authorize the Extension of Horse Railways in the City of Chicago;' the title of the act of February 6, 1895, is 'An Act Concerning Horse Railways in the City of Chicago.' In People ex rel. Deneen v. People's Gaslight & Coke Co. 205 Ill. 482, 98 Am. St. Rep. 244, 68 N. E. 950, the Illinois cases were reviewed and the conclusion reached that the purpose of the constitutional provision is accomplished if the title is comprehensive enough as reasonably to include within the general subject or the subordinate branches thereof, the several objects which the statute seeks to effect. And it was held that generality of the title is no objection to a law so long as it is not made to cover legislation incongruous in itself, and which by no fair intendment can be included as having necessary or proper connection. In the case of Montclair Twp. v. Ramsdell, \n107 U.S. 147\n, 27 L. ed. 431, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 391, a statute of New Jersey was before this court which was claimed to be unconstitutional because it embraced more than one subject, not expressed in its title. The provision of the New Jersey Constitution was 'To avoid improper influences which may result from intermixing, in one and the same act, such things as have no proper relation to each other, every law shall embrace but one object, \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 452]\n\u00a0\n and that shall be expressed in the title.' [Art. 4,  7.] The Montclair Twp. Case held: 1. That this provision does not require the title of an act to set forth a detailed statement or an index or abstract of its contents; nor does it prevent uniting in the same act numerous provisions having one general object, fairly indicated by its title. 2. That the powers, however varied and extended, which a township may exercise, constitute but one object, which is fairly expressed in a title showing nothing more than the legislative purpose to establish such township. In the late case of Detroit v. Detroit Citizens' Street R. Co. \n184 U.S. 368\n, 46 L. ed. 592, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 410, the court had occasion to deal with a similar provision in the Constitution of Michigan. In it the language of Judge Cooley in People ex rel. Secretary of State v. State Ins. Co. 19 Mich. 392, was quoted with approval: 'We must give the constitutional provision a reasonable construction and effect. The Constitution requires no law to embrace more than one object, which shall be expressed in its title. Now, the object may be very comprehensive and still be without objection, and the one before us is of that character. But it is by no means essential that every end and means necessary or convenient for the accomplishment of the general object should be either referred to or necessarily indicated by the title. All that can reasonably be required is that the title shall not be made to cover legislation incongruous in itself, and which by no fair intendment can be considered as having a necessary or proper connection.' Applying this principle, we do not think that any of the subjects treated were so far foreign to the title of the several acts as to be open to this constitutional objection. See also upon this subject: Independent School District v. Hall, \n113 U.S. 141\n, 28 L. ed. 956, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 371; Jonesboro v. Cairo & St. L. R. Co. \n110 \nU.S. 192, 198\n, 28 S. L. ed. 116, 118, 4 Sup. Ct. Rep. 67; Otoe County v. Baldwin, \n111 U.S. 1\n, 28 L. ed. 331, 4 Sup. Ct. Rep. 265; Mahomet v. Quackenbush, \n117 U.S. 508\n, 29 L. ed. 982, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 858; Carter County v. Sinton, \n120 U.S. 517\n, 30 L. ed. 701, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 650.\n Without taking time to analyze the acts in this connection we pass to what we deem more important features of the case.\n The principal controversy in this case turns upon the con- \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 453]\n\u00a0\n struction of the act of 1865, amending the act of 1859. On the part of the companies it is insisted that this act means to give an irrevocable grant from the state of the right to use the streets of the city of Chicago for street railway purposes for a term of ninety-nine years from the passage of the law; that the only right conferred upon the city is one of designation of the streets to be occupied and the regulation by agreement with the companies of what are termed the 'administrative' features of the occupancy. It is insisted that this broad right is derived from the public act of the state legislature, which, upon its acceptance, has become an inviolable contract between the state and the companies. Upon the part of the city it is contended that there has been no grant to the railways to occupy the streets of the city except with the authorization of the city council and upon such terms and conditions, including the term of occupancy, as that body may see fit to fix by contract with the companies; that the only legitimate effect of the act of 1865, other than the extension of the corporate life of the companies, has been to continue the control of the city over the streets, and to reaffirm the contracts theretofore made between the city and the companies. The theory that the franchise to use the streets was derived solely from the state, subject only to the right of the city to designate the streets to be occupied, and to regulate the 'administrative' features of the use, was adopted by the learned circuit court in construing the act in controversy. It is therefore important to consider the nature of the franchises, licenses, rights, and privileges dealt with in the act of 1865, to ascertain, as near as may be, in what sense its terms were used, and with what meaning they are incorporated into the act. In order to construe this act and determine, if possible, its true meaning and the extent of the powers and rights intended to be granted or confirmed, reference may appropriately be had to prior legislation upon the subject, for the act of 1865 is amendatory, and can only be understood if a correct apprehension is first had of the powers previously granted, and the extent and nature of the rights and \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 454]\n\u00a0\n privileges conferred and the sources from which they severally came. Whether the city charter, granted while the Constitution of 1848 was in force, gave the city the right to grant to railway companies the privilege of using the streets for street railway purposes, is a question much discussed in the briefs and the arguments at bar. The city, by the charter of 1851, and the amendment of 1863, had general power to control the use and occupation of the streets of the city and to regulate the use of horse railways therein and the laying of tracks thereon. It is insisted for the city that, independent of the acts under consideration in this case, the general powers conferred in the city charter, as construed by the supreme court of Illinois, were broad enough to empower it to grant the use of the streets for street railway surposes. See Quincy v. Bull, 106 Ill. 337, 349, and cases cited in the opinion. On the part of the companies it is contended that this right could only come from the state, and that the effect of the act in question was to confer the right upon the companies as a charter right granted by the sovereign power.\n It is said to have been the settled understanding of all concerned, and in accordance with the then-existing policy of the state, that the act of 1859 was a franchise directly granted by the state, giving the full right to use the streets of the city for the term of the corporate life of the companies, subject only to the designating power of the city as to streets to be used. In this connection it may be observed that the supreme court of Illinois in Chicago Union Traction Co. v. Chicago, 199 Ill. 484, 525, 59 L. R. A. 631, 645, 65 N. E. 451, 462, distinctly stated that the act of 1859 recognized the power of the common council to pass the ordinance of August 16, 1858. 'There,' it is said in the opinion, 'was no other action of the common council, taken before the passage of the act of February 14, 1859, except the ordinance of August 16, 1858. By the use of the words, 'with such rights and privileges as the said common council has prescribed,' the legislature could not have referred to any other action of the common council than the passage of the ordinance \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 455]\n\u00a0\n of August 16, 1858. It thereby recognized the power of the common council to pass that ordinance, and the appellant here introduces it and relies upon it. The legislature, by thereby affirming and recognizing the passage of the ordinance of August 16, 1858, also recognized the power of the common council to pass that ordinance under clause 9 of  4 of chapter 4, of the charter of 1851.' In the act of 1859 the legislature did not assume to fix independently the term for the use of the streets, but affirmed that which the common council had authorized the corporators to do, and gave authority to confer future rights by agreement with the corporations. In the first grants after the passage of the act of February 14, 1859, those of May 23, 1859, to the Chicago City Railway Company and the North Chicago City Railway Company, as we shall have occasion to show later, so far from acting upon the theory that the state had granted to the corporations the full right to use the streets for the corporate life of the companies, and needed no permission from the city council other than such as designated the streets and regulated administrative features, the council made and the companies accepted the ordinances which, on the north side, were for the term of twenty-five years and no longer, and on the south and west sides for the term named in the act of 1859, which had affirmed the grant from the council in the ordinance of 1858. The south and west side ordinance, as its recitals show, was not only passed in pursuance of the act of February 14, 1859, but also by virtue of the power and authority otherwise vested in the common coucil by its charter. Union Traction Co. v. Chicago, supra. Thereafter and frequently until the passage of the act of 1865, the council made and the companies accepted specific ordinances fixing the time of occupancy, as had been done in the original ordinances of May 23, 1859. And neither before nor after the passage of the act of 1865 was the ninety-nine year term recognized or acted upon in ordinances granting the use of the streets.\n Under the ordinance of 1858 the council undertook to au- \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 456]\n\u00a0\n thorize the persons named to lay and operate a horse railway in certain streets of the city. This right, by the terms of the ordinance, was granted for the period of twenty-five years, and until the common council, in the manner designated, should elect to purchase and pay for the property of the railway companies. If this ordinance had been without legislative authority previous to the act of February 14, 1859, that act constituted the persons named in the ordinance of 1858, with one other, and their successors, a body politic and corporate under the name of the Chicago City Railway Company, for the term of twenty-five years, with all the powers incident to such corporations. The corporation was authorized to construct, maintain, and operate a single or double track railway in the city of Chicago, within the present or future limits of the south or west divisions of the city. But the grant did not stop there. It was immediately qualified and limited by the authority given to the common council of the city, for it provided that this right to maintain and operate street railways was upon streets, etc., 'as the common council of said city have authorized said corporators, or any of them, or shall authorize said corporation so to do in such manner and upon such terms and condition, and with such rights and privileges, as the common council has or may, by contract with said parties, or any or either of them, prescribe.' The corporation was given the right of eminent domain. Then, as to the action of the city, already taken under the ordinance of 1858, by  7, all of the rights and privileges granted or intended so to be to the incorporators and their associates by the ordinances and amendments thereto passed by the council were approved and vested in the corporation. By  10 of the act the North Chicago City Railway Company was incorporated. Is this act consistent with the theory that the full franchise of occupying and using the streets, without regard to authority from the city, except in designating streets, was vested by the state in the companies incorporated? This act conferred upon the railway companies, it is true, the right to use and occupy \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 457]\n\u00a0\n the streets of the city, but this right was upon the terms prescribed in the law. Conceding the plenary power of the legislature over the subject at that time, and that franchises, broadly speaking, are rights and privileges conferred by the state, and are derived from a grant of the sovereign power, nevertheless the state, while exercising its authority, might give to the city such measure of right and control in the manner as it saw fit. Dill. Mun. Corp. 3d ed.  705; Richmond, F. & P. R. Co. v. Richmond, \n96 U.S. 521\n, 24 L. ed. 734. The city is the corporate body directly interested in the use and control of the streets. By the charter of 1851 exclusive control over the streets was given to the council. That it was the intention of the legislature to give effect to the right of municipal control in the act under consideration is shown in its confirmation of terms already fixed by contract between the city and the companies. As to the future, companies were to have no right to the use and occupancy of the streets until they should obtain from the city council authority to that end, under contracts to be agreed upon as to terms and conditions. A more comprehensive plan of securing the city in the control of the use of the streets for railway purposes could hardly be devised. The company must be 'authorized' by the city council before it can lay tracts or operate railways in the streets. This is more than to designate that for which authority has already been given. To authorize is to 'cloth with authority' (Webster's dict.); 'to give legal power to' ( Century dict.). It is an additional grant of right and power which the legislature requires the corporation to obtain as a condition precedent to its use and occupation of the streets. This power of the city, in the absence of language in the statute excluding the authority and reserving its exercise to the state, necessarily includes the right to fix the time for which the streets may be used. This doctrine was, we think, correctly stated by Judge Lurton, in delivering the opinion of the court of appeals in Louisville Trust Co. v. Cincinnati, 22 C. C. A. 334, 346, 47 U. S. App. 36, 59, 76 Fed. 296, 308. 'The right of the local authority thority to impose terms and conditions is \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 458]\n\u00a0\n clearly conferred, and no such corporation can impose itself upon the public streets or highways unless it enter into an agreement touching the occupancy of such streets, or resorts to the right of condemnation, in default of an agreement. This right to impose terms and conditions most obviously implies the right to agree upon the duration of such occupancy. The right to exclude altogether, unless resort be had to condemnation, involves the right to limit the period of the grant.' Coverdale v. Edwards, 115 Ind. 374, 381, 58 N. E. 495; Elliott, Railroads,  1081.\n The act under consideration nowhere assumes to fix the duration of the grant, nor excludes the conclusion that it is embraced in the terms and conditions which are to be fixed by contract with the city. If the franchise to use the streets, without regard to municipal action, was fully conferred by the legislative act under consideration, then the company had only to take possession of the streets, subject to regulations as to running of cars, etc., by the city council. On the contrary, under the terms of this act, the city, by withholding its consent, could prevent the use of the streets by the corporations. No way is pointed out by which this consent could be compelled against the will of the council. That body might, for reasons sufficient to itself, under the terms of this act, by withholding assent, determine that it was undesirable to have the corporations in control of the use of the streets.\n While the decisions of the supreme court of the state are not binding upon us in determining whether a contract was made which is entitled to protection under the Federal Constitution, we may notice the case of Chicago City R. Co. v. People, 73 Ill. 541. That was a proceeding in quo warranto against the Chicago City Railway Company, asking to declare a forfeiture of its franchise consent of two thirds of the owners of the avenue. The grounds relied upon were that the railway company had not obtained the consent of two third of the owners of the property fronting on the avenue within fifteen months from the passage of the \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 459]\n\u00a0\n ordinance of August 22, 1864, the time limited for construction in the ordinance of that date. The respondent, the Chicago City Railway Company, relied upon an ordinance passed November 13, 1871, amendatory of the ordinance of August 22, 1864, extending the time to complete its railway for a period of two years from the date of the last-named ordinance. The court found that two thirds of the property owners had consented, as provided in the ordinance of August 22, 1864, but found that the company had neglected to construct its road to the city limits within fifteen months from the passage of the ordinance, as therein provided. The question turned upon the validity of the extending ordinance of November 13, 1871, passed after the Constitution of 1870 went into effect. The majority of the court-Chief Justice Walker and Justices Breese and Sheldon dissenting-held that the common council had authority, under the act of 1865, to extend the time for the building of the roads on Indiana avenue, as the time limitation was a provision in favor of the city, which it might waive, as the charter of the company was silent upon the time within which the railway might be constructed, and in this connection held that the right granted by the city to construct the railway was a license as distinguished from a franchise derivable from the state, and, therefore, not within the constitutional prohibition against the passage of local or special laws granting to any corporation, association, or individual the right to lay down railroad tracks, or amending existing charters for that purpose, or granting to any corporation, association, or individual any special or exclusive privilege, immunity, or franchise whatever. The minority of the court were of opinion that the Constitution of 1870 made the extending ordinance invalid. In neither the majority nor the dissenting opinions is there any intimation that the railway company could occupy or use a street of the city of Chicago without the permission of the city. In discussing how far the charter authorized the company to act without the consent of the city, Mr. Justice Sheldon, in the course of an able dissenting opinion, concurred in by the Chief \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 460]\n\u00a0\n Justice and Mr. Justice Breese, is careful to point out that the right to occupy the streets is not complete in the grant of the charter from the state, and is only capable of being exercised when supplemented by the authorization of the city. And see People's Pass. R. Co. v. Memphis City R. Co. 10 Wall. 38, 55, 19 L. ed. 844, 850. In that case this court held that a charter authorizing a street railroad company to operate street railroads in all the streets of the city 'with the consent of the city' was unavailing until the consent of the city was first had, which consent was a condition precedent to the use of the streets.\n What, then, was conferred in the franchise granted by the state? It was the right to be a corporation for the period named, and to acquire from the city the right to use the streets upon contract terms and conditions to be agreed upon. The franchise conferred by the state is of no practical value until supplemented by the consent and authority of the council of the city. After the passage of the act of 1859 the common council of the city, on May 23, 1859, passed an ordinance authorizing the extension and operation of certain horse railways in the streets of the south and west divisions of the city, and granting the use thereof to the Chicago City Railway Company. The city purported to act under authority of the act of 1859, and by virtue of the powers and authority otherwise vested in the common council by law. By this ordinance the term of use and occupation was fixed at 'during all the term in the said act of the 14th of February, A. D. 1859, specified and prescribed.' On the same day the council passed an ordinance granting rights in certain streets to the North Chicago City Railway Company. This ordinance contained this language: 'The rights and privileges granted to the said company by this ordinance, or intended to be, shall continue and be in force for the benefit of said company for the full term of twenty-five years from the passage of this ordinance, and no longer.' On February 21, 1861, the legislature passed an act incorporating the Chicago West Division Railway Company for the term of twenty-five years, the corporation to pos- \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 461]\n\u00a0\n sess the powers enumerated in the 2d, 3d, 5th, and 6th sections of the act of February 14, 1859. By  4 of the act the corporation was authorized to acquire from the Chicago City Railway Company the powers, franchises, privileges, and immunities conferred upon that company, and the consent of the directors of said company was made a condition precedent to the exercise of the powers conferred as to any streets of the south and west divisions of the city of Chicago.\n Before the passage of the act of 1865 a number of ordinances were passed, conferring the privilege of using streets, in most cases with a time limit definite in character. The record discloses that by an agreement of July 29, 1863, the Chicago City Railway Company had agreed to convey to the Chicago West Division Railway Company certain rolling stock, equipment, etc., together with 'all and singular the franchises, rights, privileges, and immunities' of the Chicago City Railway Company in the upon certain streets, 'conferred, given, or granted by or under any or all acts of the general assembly of the state of Illinois, and any and all ordinances of the city of Chicago, or contracts with the common council.' In this contract it was also provided that if at any time it should be adjudged that consent to the sale by the council of the city of Chicago is or was necessary to secure to the grantee company the rights and privileges embraced in the contract, the grantor company would do all in its power by reasonable and proper effort to secure such consent of the common council. By the deed of transfer of July 30, 1863, the grantor company conveyed its rights, privileges, and franchises in the use and occupation of certain streets, 'to have and to hold the above bargained and granted premises and property to the party of the second part, etc., for and during all the time which the said party of the first part might hold, exercise, and enjoy the same under its present charter and any and all extensions thereof.' On December 13, 1859, the Chicago City Railway Company by agreement gave to the North Chicago City Railway Company permission and authority to make, construct, and use for \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 462]\n\u00a0\n twenty-four years, tracks, etc., as might be necessary to extend its railway southerly to such points in the south and west divisions along certain streets, 'as the party of the first part (Chicago City Railway Company) has been or may be authorized to make and have the same.'\n It thus clearly appears, at least up to the passage of the act of 1865, that legislation upon the subject recognized and enforced the right and authority of the city to fix the term during which the streets might be occupied by street railway companies. The legislature had confirmed the ordinance of the city fixing the term at twenty-five years and until the city should see fit to purchase the property of the railway company. It had required the companies to obtain the authority of the city before using the streets, such use to be upon terms and conditions, and with such rights and privileges, as the city had or might thereafter prescribe by contract with the companies. We find no intention evidenced in legislative action thus far to prevent the municipal authorities from exercising the important and far-reaching authority of fixing by contract with the persons or corporations to whom franchises are granted by the state the term during which the occupancy shall continue. This feature of the right to use the streets, it need hardly be said, is of most vital importance to both parties. Some latitude of time is essential to the value and stability of the investment to be made. An unduly long period might conclude municipal action when changing conditions and growing population demanded it in the public interest.\n We come now to the act of 1865. Does its interpretation justify the contention that by its terms the state took from the local authorities the control which had been theretofore recognized, the right and authority to determine upon what terms and for what length of time the railways might occupy the streets, and without other consideration than the building, equipment, and operation of the roads, conferred upon the companies the right to use and occupy for ninety-nine years to \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 463]\n\u00a0\n come the streets of the city which might thereafter be designated by the city council, and confirmed without qualification for that term the right to use and occupy the streets covered in contracts already made with the city? We may premise, before taking up this act for more detailed consideration, that it is a firmly established rule, which we shall have occasion to refer to later on in this discussion, but which must be borne in mind as we enter upon the consideration of this act, that one who asserts private rights in public property under grants of the character of those under consideration, must, if he would establish them, come prepared to show that they have been conferred in plain terms, for nothing passes by the grant except it be clearly stated or necessarily implied. The 1st section of the act of 1865 was effectual to extend the corporate life of the two companies, created by the acts of 1859 and 1861, from twenty-five to ninety-nine years each. The 2d section authorizes the construction and maintenance of street railways in the city of Chicago upon such streets, etc., within the limits named, as the common council have authorized or shall from time to time authorize, the rights, privileges, and immunities and exemptions to be such as the common council has prescribed, or may, by contracts with said parties, or either of them, prescribe. In the first clause of that section, then, there is shown no disposition to depart from the policy of the state as indicated by the act of 1859, and the action of the companies thereunder, which required the street railway companies, before entering upon the occupation or use of the streets, to obtain, by agreement with the city, its sanction and authority for the right and privilege of so doing. Then comes the clause which, it is contended, works a revolution of former policies and extends former franchises and rights to the full term of ninety-nine years, and withholds from the city the power of granting any further use of the streets to the railway companies, except upon terms of extending the right for the like period. While we have no right to consider this act by segregating its clauses as though they were separate enact- \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 464]\n\u00a0\n ments, for the purpose of having its provisions clearly in view, we insert this clause:\n'And any and all acts or deeds of transfer of rights, privileges, or franchises, between the corporations in said several acts named, or any two of them, and all contracts, tracts, stipulations, licenses, and undertakings made, entered into, or given, and as made or amended by and between the said common council and any one or more of the said corporations, respecting the location, use, or exclusion of railways in or upon the streets, or any of them, of said city, shall be deemed and held and continued in force during the life hereof, as valid and effectual, to all intents and purposes, as if made a part, and the same are hereby made a part, of said several acts.'\n\n Does a fair interpretation of this clause of the act extend all the franchises, privileges, and contracts theretofore made for the term of ninety-nine years? This clause deals with:\n\n 1. \nThe transfers of rights, privileges, or franchises between the corporations.\n\n 2. \nComprehensively speaking, the contracts made between the city and the companies.\n The definition of 'rights and privileges,' as the terms are used in this act, is not difficult to find. It is contained in the context of the act confirming 'such rights and privileges, immunities and exemptions, as the common council has [prescribed], or may, by contract with said parties, or any or either of them, prescribe.' This definition conforms to the use of the terms in prior acts of the legislature on the subject as well as to ordinances of the city granting the use of the streets. The rights and privileges intended are such as have been derived from contracts with the city. Franchises in the sense we have stated have been the grants of the state. Licenses and all other privileges have been obtained from the city, acting under the authority of the acts of the legislature in the manner outlined earlier in this discussion. As to the deeds and acts of transfer of rights, privileges, and franchises, as well \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 465]\n\u00a0\n as the contract rights secured from the city, the act declares they 'shall be deemed and held and continued in force during the life hereof, as valid and effectual, to all intents and purposes, as if made a part, and the same are hereby made a part, of said several acts.'\n What does this mean? It cannot operate to extend the contract rights and privileges, obtained directly from the city before or after the transfer by one company to the other, ninety-nine years, for as to these the act distinctly declares that the contracts, stipulations, licenses, and undertakings, between the council and the companies, shall stand 'as made or amended.' This declaration is in the past tense, and can have no reference, by any fair construction, to future engagements.\n The contracts, by this clause, in all their terms, including time limits, are written into the original acts of 1859 and 1861, as if made a part thereof. Much discussion has been had as to the proper interpretation of the ambiguous expression 'during the life hereof.' For the companies it is insisted that its meaning is to extend all franchises and contracts, and whether the latter have been or may thereafter be made, to the end of the ninety-nine years, so as to give the railways the franchise to use the streets for that period by an irrevocable grant, irrespective of any limitations by state or municipal action subsequently undertaken. To give this act the construction insisted on by the companies is inconsistent with the policy of the state, declared in the act of 1859, which ratified the ordinance of 1858, and gave additional rights in the streets only upon obtaining the consent of the city. It practically reads out of the act the preceding clause of the very section under consideration, which expressly recognizes the authority of the city council to control the use of the streets by contracts which it has made or may make in the future. To say that contracts, the terms and conditions of which are left to agreement with the city, could only be made upon terms of extension to ninety-nine years, is to nullify in an important partic- \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 466]\n\u00a0\n ular the powers conferred in the act. The construction contended for requires us to ignore or entirely change the sense of terms establishing the contracts as made, and requires an interpretation which applies to the future what is specifically stated to be meant for the past. It does violence to the rule contended for by counsel for the companies,-that words are to be considered in their ordinary signification, and every part of the statute, if practicable, given meaning in harmony with its other provisions upon the subject. It is urged that the words 'as made or amended' must have reference to the future, and were intended to give a prospective operation to the act, and to read into all contracts thereafter to be made, as well as theretofore made, a right to use the streets without the consent of the city for the extended period. And it is said that this is particularly shown by the use of the words 'as amended.' But this expression was used in the seventh paragraph of the act of 1859, vesting in the corporations the rights and privileges granted by the ordinances of the common council 'and the amendments thereto.' The ordinance of August 16, 1858, was itself an amendment of prior municipal legislation. The purpose of the act of 1865 was to continue, as made, the former contracts, with their amendments. If it was intended to extend all past contracts and licenses for the use of the streets to the term of ninety-nine years, and to require the city council to enter into no new engagements for terms and conditions which should not extend to that period, it would have been easy to give expression to such purpose in plain words, and not resort to language which, as stated in one of the briefs of the learned counsel for the companies, is 'unusual and more or less figurative.' If the words used have no effect to control the right of future contract, but do extend the term of the contracts made to nenety- nine years, then we may have the anomalous situation of some contracts for short and some for long terms in the same system of railroads. It is true that we are to consider the situation as it was when the act was passed, and not in the light of the subsequent growth and development \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 467]\n\u00a0\n of the city. But in 1865 the policy of local control of the streets for railway purposes had been declared and acted upon. So radical a departure as is contended for must be found in terms plainly stated and clearly defined. It is contended that unless the construction insisted upon for the companies is given to the act, no force or effect is given to the expression 'during the life hereof,' and a well-recognized rule is invoked that all parts of this law must be given force and effect in interpreting its meaning. While it is incumbent upon those claiming under a public grant, as we have already stated, to make out the rights contended for by terms which clearly and unequivocally convey them, and it is enough to deny the privileges contended for if, upon considering the act, the mind rests in doubt and uncertainty as to whether they are intended to be conferred, we think this act can be given a construction which shall give some meaning and effect to the words 'during the life hereof.' Literally construed, the phrase would mean for the life of the act. It has been suggested that it may mean until the corporations, by forfeiture or otherwise, go out of existence. But these meanings do not seem to aid the purpose manifested in the law, and meaningless phrases are not supposed to be used to express the legislative will. Bearing in mind that the franchises granted came from the state, the nature and extent of the rights included in those franchises, that the franchise to be a corporation was extended by the 1st section of the act, and that the franchise, the transfer of which was intended to be confirmed in the clause now before us, embraced the right granted by the state to use the streets with the authority of the city, and that the rights and privileges were obtained from the city, let us see if some meaning can be found consistent with the other parts of the act and recognized rules of construction. Conceding for this purpose the contention on behalf of the companies that the phrase, 'during the life hereof,' may mean for the term of ninety-nine years, for that period the act provides that certain things 'shall be deemed and held and continued in force.' What \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 468]\n\u00a0\n are they? 1. 'Any and all acts or deeds of transfer of rights, privileges, or franchises between the corporations in said several acts named or any two of them.' 2. 'All contracts, stipulations, licenses, and undertakings, made, entered into, or given, and as made or amended by and between the said common council and any one or more of the said corporations, respecting the location, use, or exclusion of the railways in or upon the streets or any of them of said city.' The context of the act, as we have seen, defines rights and privileges to be such as are derived from the contracts with the city. It recognizes, as do the ordinances previously passed, in the use made of the same phrase, that the city is the source from whence they came. Franchises, as we have said, came from the state. The phrase, 'during the life hereof,' cannot be held to extend contract rights to ninety-nine years without doing violence to the terms which just precede this phrase and are found in the same sentence, confirming all contracts, stipulations, licenses, and undertakings 'as made or amended.' The vital part of such contracts is the duration of the occupancy of the streets, expressly limited to twenty-five years, and in some cases twenty- five years and until purchase by the city. To say that 'during the life hereof,' in the sense that it means ninety-nine years, is to be the life of the contracts, permits that part of the sentence to repeal the provision of the clause which reads them into the original act in all respects as made or amended. Rejecting, therefore, such impossible construction as doing violence to the very terms of the law, there is only left of the things provided for which can be consistently extended for ninety-nine years, the acts or deeds of transfer between the corporations so far as they relate to franchises which are not subject to the express limitations of the act,-that they shall stand as made. These franchises as conveyed were necessarily limited to twenty-five years, the then life of the companies. The first part of this act has prolonged the corporate life to ninety-nine years. In the sense which we have already defined the franchise granted by the state, as \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 469]\n\u00a0\n conferring the right to use and occupy the streets with permission from the city, the act may be consistently held to extend and validate the deeds of transfer as conveying a continued right to such franchise for the extended period of the lives of the corporations. This construction gives some weight and force to this ambiguous expression, and, taking the entire act together, is more consistent with the legislative purpose expressed than is the one put forward, which ignores the reference to the contracts in their original form and extends them all for ninety-nine years, while the act declares they shall not be disturbed as made. It is not to be understood that the interpretation herein suggested frees the judicial mind from doubt as to the meaning of this act, any more than its ambiguous and contradictory phrases could have impressed upon the legislative understanding the meaning now contended for by the companies. It is the application of the settled rule of interpretation to such grants which invalidates the claims made for it, rather than any clear and satisfactory interpretation which has been suggested by counsel or arrived at by the court.\n This construction is in harmony with the policy of the state, as evidenced in its prior legislation on the subject, and, in the earlier part of the section under consideration, it gives some meaning to all parts of the act, and makes its provisions consistent with each other. It preserves local control of streets for railway purposes, which the legislature, in all of the acts under consideration, has sought to protect. Considering the act as a whole, it has the effect to extend the life of the corporations to ninety-nine years and to authorize the use of the streets of Chicago, with the consent and upon terms agreed upon with the council, and this right may be acquired in like manner during the extended life of the corporations for such periods as may be contracted for. Contracts already made are affirmed as made. The transfers between the companies are validated.\n Further contracts may be entered into and amendments made without resort to new legislation empowering the cor- \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 470]\n\u00a0\n porations, as the right of amendment is given, reserving the right of modification or repeal, by a majority of the aldermen elected or act of the general assembly, of the right to charge a higher rate than 5 cents.\n While it is true that if, by the act, the state had conferred a grant of the right to use the streets for the period of ninety-nine years, entitled to the protection of the contract clause of the Constitution, such right could not be impaired by any subsequent legislation, it is worthy of note, as showing the continuous legislative policy of the state, that in the act of March, 1867, amending the charter of the city of Chicago, it was provided that no grant of the right to use the streets should be given, or those already given extended, unless by a vote of three fourths of all the aldermen elected, and that no grant, consent, or permission theretofore given or made, or thereafter given, should in any case be extended until within one year of the expiration of the grant, consent, or permission, and in case of veto by the mayor such grant or permission should receive the vote of three fourths of all the aldermen. This act shows a consistent policy of local control, and is inconsistent with the theory of a grant already made for the use of the streets for ninety-nine years.\n In reaching the conclusions herein stated as to the proper construction of the act of 1865, amending the act of 1859, we are not unmindful of the fact that much can be said in favor of the view contended for by the learned counsel for the companies. The construction of this act, as we have said, is by no means free from difficulty.\n It is true that Governor Oglesby, in his message returning this act with his veto, gave it a construction which would maintain the right to use the streets for the period of ninety-nine years. While his construction was assumed rather than demonstrated, and the stress of his argument was upon the impropriety and constitutional invalidity of thus postponing the right of the city to purchase, it may be admitted that his interpretation of the act sustains the view contended for by \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 471]\n\u00a0\n the companies. But, as we have said, the act upon its face is ambiguous and uncertain. We must judge of it by the terms in which it is expressed. A construction can be given it which would extend all the contracts with the city for the term of ninety-nine years. On the other hand, it can be maintained, with at least equal force, that, notwithstanding the Governor's view, it affirmed the contracts as made, thus distinctly recognizing the comparatively short term of twenty-five years, for which they expressly stipulated. It must be, therefore uncertain whether the legislators voted for this act upon one construction or the other. It may be that the very ambiguity of the act was the means of securing its passage. Legislative grants of this character should be in such unequivocal form of expression that the legislative mind may be distinctly impressed with their character and import, in order that the privileges may be intelligently granted or purposely withheld. It is matter of common knowledge that grants of this character are usually prepared by those interested in them, and submitted to the legislature with a view to obtain from such bodies the most liberal grant of privileges which they are willing to give. This is one among many reasons why they are to be strictly construed. Pierce, Railroads, 491; New Orleans & C. R. Co. v. New Orleans, 34 La. Ann. 447. 'Words of equivocal import,' said Mr. Chief Justice Black, in Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Canal Comrs. 21 Pa. 9, 22, 'are so easily inserted by mistake or fraud that every consideration of justice and policy requires that they should be treated as nugatory when they do find their way into the enactments of the legislature.' 'The just presumption,' says Cooley, in his work on Constitutional Limitations, 7th ed. p. 565, 'in every such case is, that the state has granted in express terms all that it designed to grant at all; 'and, after quoting from the supreme court of Pennsylvania to the same effect, the learned author observes: 'This is sound doctrine, and should be vigilantly observed and enforced.'\n Since the decision in Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 4 Wheat. \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 472]\n\u00a0\n 518, 4 L. ed. 629, this court has had frequent occasion to apply and enforce the doctrine that a grant of rights in public property accepted by the beneficiary will amount to a contract entitled to protection against impairment by action of the state, or municipalities acting under state authority. Concurrent with this principle, and to be considered when construing an alleged grant of this character, is the equally well established rule, which requires such grants to be made in plain terms in order to convey private rights in respect to public property, and to prevent future control of such privileges in the public interest. The rule as laid down with clearness by Chief Justice Taney in the often-cited case of Charles River Bridge v. Warren Bridge, 11 Pet. 420, 9 L. ed. 773, and has been uniformly applied in many subsequent cases in this court. In Perrine v. Chesapeake & D. Canal Co. 9 How. 172-192, 13 L. ed. 92-100, the same eminent Chief Justice, speaking for the court, said: 'The rule of construction in cases of this description . . . is this,-that any ambiguity in the terms of the grant must operate against the corporation, and in favor of the public, and the corporation can claim nothing that is not clearly given by the law. We do not mean to say that the charter is to receive a strained and unreasonable interpretation, contrary to the obvious intention of the grant. It must be fairly examined and considered, and reasonably and justly expounded.' In the case of The Binghamton Bridge ( Chenango Bridge Co. v. Binghamton Bridge Co.) 3 Wall. 51, 75, 18 L. ed. 137, 143, it was said: 'The principle is this: That all rights which are asserted against the state must be clearly defined, and not raised by inference or presumption; and if the charter is silent about a power, it does not exist. If, on a fair reading of the instrument, reasonable doubts arise as to the proper interpretation to be given to it, those doubts are to be solved in favor of the state; and where it is susceptible of two meanings, the one restricting and the other extending the powers of the corporation, that construction is to be adopted which works the least harm to the state.'\n This principle has been declared axiomatic as a doctrine of this court. Northwestern Fertilizing Co. v. Hyde Park, \n97 U.S. 659\n, \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 473]\n\u00a0\n 666, 24 L. ed. 1036, 1038. In Slidell v. Grandjean, \n111 \nU.S. 412, 438\n, 28 S. L. ed. 321, 330, 4 Sup. Ct. Rep. 475, it is declared a wise doctrine; 'It serves to defeat any purpose concealed by the skilful use of terms to accomplish something not apparent on the face of the act, and thus sanctions only open dealing with legislative bodies.' Among other cases affirming the principle in this court is Coosaw Mining Co. v. South Carolina, \n144 U.S. 550\n, 36 L. ed. 537, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 689, in which it was applied in adopting, of two doubtful constructions, the one more favorable to the state. Many of the cases are cited in a note to Knoxville Water Co. v. Knoxville, decided at this term. \n200 \nU.S. 22, 34\n, 50 S. L. ed . --, --., 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 224, 227. Applying the principle so frequently asserted and uniformly maintained, we think it cannot be successfully maintained that the act of 1865 contains a clear expression of legislative intention to extend the franchise of these companies to use the streets of Chicago, without reference to the assent of the city, for the long term of ninety-nine years, and for that time preventing other and different legislation restricting this grant of a practically exclusive right. So enormous a grant of privileges, including an exclusion from some streets of any railway system, ought not to be presumed or held to be conferred in doubtful and ambiguous words. Grants of this character are not to be destroyed by an unreasonable or narrow interpretation. But if ambiguity is fatal to such claim of rights as against the public, for the stronger reason must such grants of far-reaching and exclusive privileges as are here asserted fail when they can only be maintained by strained construction in their favor.\n The effect of the act of 1865 was to affirm the contracts as made between the council and the companies; these contracts must stand as concluded, unless changed by subsequent agreement between the parties. As we have said, the principal question in the case concerns the construction of the act of February 14, 1859, as amended by the act of February 6, 1865. The learned circuit court, holding the opinion that the right to use the streets was extended for the prolonged term of the corporate life of the companies, also held that the adoption of \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 474]\n\u00a0\n the cities and villages act by the city of Chicago, in May, 1875, which act was passed under the Constitution of Illinois, taking effect in 1870, put an end to the right of the city of Chicago to thereafter designate streets under the former acts, and that contracts subsequently made were subject to the limitation of twenty years, as provided in the cities and villages act of 1872. The court applied the principles upon which it construed the acts in question, and gave it effects as to numerous streets which were the subject of contracts between the city and the companies. Under our conclusions the decree must be reversed, and the construction we have given the act may require a decree differing from that rendered in the circuit court, when applied to particular streets. But we shall not take up all these controversies in detail, and shall leave to the circuit court a readjustment of the decree upon the lines of this opinion. There are, however, certain matters in the case which have been fully argued and should be determined before the case is again considered in the circuit court. On these features of the case we will not enter upon extended discussion, but briefly indicate our views upon them.\n It was held by the learned circuit court that the amending act of 1865 had application to the North Chicago City Railway Company, and had the effect to extend the corporate life of that company. We think this is a correct view. By the 10th section of the act of 1859 all the grants, powers, privileges, immunities, and franchises conferred upon Parmalee and others, by the act for the south and west divisions of the city of Chicago, were conferred upon certain persons by the corporate name of the North Chicago City Railway Company, for the north division of the city, in the county of Cook, as fully and effectually as if they had been by a separate act incorporated, with all of said grants, powers, immunities, privileges, and franchises. By the 1st section of the act of 1865 the corporate lives of the Chicago City Railway Company, created by the 1st section of the act of 1859, and the Chicago West Division Railway Company, created by the 1st section of the \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 475]\n\u00a0\n act of 1861, were expressly extended for ninety-nine years. While nothing was specifically said of the North Chicago City Railway Company in this connection, the 10th section of the act, after this amendment, we think, should be read in connection with the amended act, so that the act of 1859 is to be read as if it had originally been in the amended form. In this view the extended life of the corporations created by the 1st section must be read into the charter of the North Chicago City Railway Company, created by the 10th section.\n We believe this view is sustained by reason and authority. Holbrook v. Nichol, 36 Ill. 161. The rule was thus stated in Farrell v. State, 54 N. J. L. 421, 24 Atl. 725: 'As a rule of construction, a statute amended is to be understood in the same sense exactly as if it had read from the beginning as it does amended. People ex rel. Parsons v. Circuit Judge, 37 Mich. 287. In Conrad v. Nall, 24 Mich. 275, a section in a chapter of the Code was amended, and it was held that it was not intended to operate independently of the other provisions of the chapter, but that the whole chapter, in its present form, must be read as one act.\n'The rule is correctly stated in Endlich on Interpretation of Statutes,  294, as follows: 'A statute which is amended is thereafter, and as to all acts subsequently done, to be construed as if the amendment had always been there, and the amendment itself so thoroughly becomes a part of the original statute that it must be construed in view of the original statute as it stands after the amendments are introduced and the matters superseded by the amendments eliminated.\" This view is strengthened by the language of the 2d section, which speaks of the deeds of transfer of rights between the corporations, in said several acts, or 'any two of them.'\n\n The city of Chicago has constantly recognized the corporate existence of this company and has made numerous agreements with it as such corporation. In Chicago v. Sheldon, 9 Wall. 50, 19 L. ed. 594, in considering a contract between the North Chicago City Railway Company and the city as to the extent of street improvement by way of paving, etc., which could be required of \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 476]\n\u00a0\n the company under the ordinance of May 23, 1859, granting it rights and privileges in the streets, this court, speaking through Mr. Justice Nelson, concluded its opinion as follows: 'A point is made that the legislature have not conferred or intended to confer authority upon the city to make this contract. We need only say that full power was not only conferred, but that the contract itself has been since ratified by this body.' The learned justice, speaking of the contract, obviously referred to the ordinance of May 23, 1859, passed under the authority conferred by the act of February 14, 1859, and the ratification by the legislature under the act of February 6, 1865. We have no doubt that this act was intended to apply to the North Chicago City Railway Company as well as to the companies specifically covered in the 1st section of the act. The ordinance of 1858 in its 10th section gave the right to operate the 'said railways for twenty-five years, and thereafter to parties operating said railways the enjoyment of all privileges granted until the common council shall elect, by order for that purpose, to purchase the tracks, railway cars, carriages, station houses, station grounds, furniture, and implements of every kind and description used in the construction and operation of said railways or the appurtenances in and about the same.' By  7 of the act of February 14, 1859, all of the rights and privileges granted or intended so to be to Parmalee and others, by the ordinances and amendments, were confirmed and vested in the corporations. The affirmance of these rights and privileges gave them the sanction and made them part of the legislative act. Afterwards certain of the rights and privileges of the Chicago City Railway Company were transferred by the deed of July 30, 1863, as stated in said conveyance, to the Chicago West Division Railway Company. This deed of transfer is confirmed by the act of 1865. Later the system of railways was extended under ordinances of the city and with the assent of village boards of trustees. It is the contention of the receivers that by reason of the premises the railway companies became entitled to operate the entire system for \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 477]\n\u00a0\n the extended period of the act of 1865-for ninety-nine years-and thereafter until the city of Chicago shall lawfully purchase all of the said railways, property, equipment, and appurtenances, and pay for the same in cash at its then appraised value. It is the contention of the city that this extension of the right to purchase by virtue of the ordinance of 1858, affirmed in the act of 1859 and the amendment of 1865, must be confined to the streets covered by the ordinance of 1858. That the right to use the streets under the ordinance of 1858 was extended to all subsequently acquired rights to use the streets under the new contracts, so that the right would continue until purchase be made of the entire property of both systems of railway, we cannot concede. It does violence to the language of the ordinance of 1858, which, by its terms, is limited to the railways therein and thereby provided for, and would be an extension of corporate privileges by implication, in violence of the settled rule to which we have had occasion to refer in the principal discussion.\n While not conceding the soundness of the contention that the right of purchase is extended to all the property of the railway companies by reason of the unity of the system, there are certain ordinances confirmed by the act of 1865 which require special attention. As we have seen, by the ordinance of May 23, 1859, permission was given to lay a street railway on and along certain streets and bridges in the south and west divisons of the city of Chicago, 'and the same to keep, maintain, and use and to operate thereon railway cars and carriages during all the term of the said act of February 14, 1859, specified and prescribed, in the manner and upon the conditions hereinafter designated.' On the same day, May 23, 1859, a grant was made to the North Chicago City Railway Company of the right to use certain streets, the rights and privileges granted to be in force for the benefit of the company for the full term of twenty-five years from the passage of the ordinance, and no longer. This difference in the grants to the two railway companies is significant. In the ordinance of 1858 the \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 478]\n\u00a0\n grant to Parmalee and others was for the term of twenty-five years, with the right of the parties operating the railways to enjoy all the said privileges until the common council elect, by order for that purpose, to purchase the tracks and other property used in the construction and operation of said railways and appurtenances, and pay for the same in the manner designated in the ordinance. This grant was expressly confirmed by the act of 1859, in  7 thereof. Otherwise there was no specific grant in that act fixing the time for which the railway company might operate in the streets. As we have seen, in that law there was a distinct affirmation of what the common council had authorized the corporators to do, and might thereafter authorize the corporation to do by contract. The North Chicago City Railway Company, prior to the act of 1859, had no agreement as to streets. The reason for the grant of different terms to the different compaines, we think, is apparent. On the west side reference was made to the term granted in the act of February 14, 1859, for the purpose of giving the Chicago City Railway Company the same term as had been granted and confirmed therein as to the streets named in the ordinance of August, 1858, and, in our judgment, gave to that company a grant in the same terms, that is, for twenty-five years, and until the city purchase in the manner designated. On the north side, there being no such legislative confirmation of rights already undertaken to be conferred by the council, the grant was specifically limited to a period of twenty-five years, 'and no longer.'\n In considering the effect of the ordinances passed by the common council of the city of Chicago in the period from February, 1859, to May 3, 1875, it may be well to briefly summarize the terms of these ordinances. The will be found in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[201 U.S. 400, 479]\n\u00a0\n After the passage of the cities and villages act of 1872, accepted by the city of Chicago in May, 1875, the following ordinance was passed, being the so-called 'compromise ordinance:' \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 480]\n\u00a0\n 'July 10, 1883 (amended August 6, 1883)--\n'Extending the Term for Twenty Years from This Date. Accepted by North Chicago City Railway Company, August 8, 1883; by the Chicago City Railway Company and the Chicago West Division Railway Company, August 10, 1883.'\n\n This ordinance contained this proviso: 'But nothing in this section contained, or the acceptance hereof, shall in any manner impair, change, or alter the existing rights, duties, and obligations of the city or of said companies, respectively, from and after the said term of years hereinbefore mentioned.'\n We thus perceive a consistent purpose running through the grants to the north side company to adhere to the term of the original ordinance of May 23, 1859, limiting the right to use the streets to the period of twenty-five years, 'and no longer,' by reference in subsequent ordinances to the prior ordinance. We do not regard the exceptional character of the ordinance of October 26, 1874, amended April 26, 1875, as overcoming, as to other ordinances, the general purpose reflected in them. That ordinance was a grant in part to the \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 481]\n\u00a0\n North Chicago Company as the lessee of the Chicago City Company, and was doubtless changed in terms to make it comply with the grant of the latter company as to streets in which it operated.\n As to the west side companies we find running through the ordinances making grants in the divisions covered by that system a purpose to preserve the original permission of the ordinance of August 16, 1858, which granted the use of the streets for the term of twenty-five years and until purchase by the city. The language used in the ordinance of May 23, 1859, granting the use of the streets, is 'during all the term in said act of the 14th of February, A. D. 1859, specified and prescribed.' This ordinance and similar ones passed prior to the act of February 6, 1865, were confirmed by that act, and rights under them were reserved by the compromise ordinance of July 10, 1883. We hold that when streets were occupied under the authority of these ordinances the company has the right to the use of the streets until the city shall purchase under the contracts thus made.\n In the west side system, the ordinance of August 17, 1864, is silent as to the term of the grant. We do not think this indicates any intention on the part of the city, even if it had the power under legislative acts then in existence, to confer the right in perpetuity to the occupancy of the streets, a point which we do not feel called upon to decide. The other ordinances by direct terms or references to prior ordinances have made the grants for the west side system for the term of twenty-five years, and until purchase by the city, in the manner stated, and we do not think there was any intention to depart from the plan in this one ordinance omitting specifically to name a definite time of occupancy. At this time there had been no extension of the life of the corporation, and it was specifically limited to twenty-five years.\n In reaching this conclusion we are not unmindful of the decision of this court in Detroit v. Detroit Citizens' Street R. Co. \n184 \nU.S. 368, 395\n, 46 S. L. ed. 592, 610, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 410, holding that although a corpo- \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 482]\n\u00a0\n ration be organized for a limited period by the terms of its charter, it may receive a grant which would inure to the benefit of those lawfully entitled to succeed to the rights of the corporation, although for a period of years beyond the corporate life. But in the present case the right granted must be construed with reference to the system of which it was made a part, and where the terms of the grant were limited to twenty- five years, and until purchase, we can find no intention to grant or receive a perpetuity simply because no term of years was named in the one ordinance under consideration.\n It is contended that whatever rights would otherwise be included in contracts confirmed by the act of 1865, they were lost to the companies by accepting the privileges conferred in the 'power ordinances' of June 7, 1886, and March 30, 1888. But prior to the passage of those ordinances was the so-called 'compromise ordinance' of July 10, 1883, as amended August 6, 1883, settling certain controversies as to license fees and street paving, and extending the time of operation for twenty years, and further providing: 'But nothing in this section contained, or the acceptance hereof, shall in any manner impair, change, or alter the existing rights, duties, and obligations of the city, or of said companies, respectively, from and after the expiration of the said term of years hereinbefore mentioned.' In the North Chicago City Railway ordinance and the West Chicago City Railway Company ordinance clauses are inserted to the effect that privileges as to time after the expiration of the term of twenty years are to be governed by ordinances theretofore passed. In view of this reservation we are of opinion that whatever rights and privileges the company had in the streets after the expiration of the time limitation in the 'power ordinances' were not lost by the acceptance of privileges conferred in those ordinances.\n It is contended that the railway companies had no power to accept ordinances for the use of other than animal power in the operation of railways, because of the titles of the various \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 483]\n\u00a0\n acts which constituted the charter of the companies, limiting them to the use of animal power, and because of the constitutional provision, which we have referred to earlier in this opinion, providing that no private or local law shall embrace more than one subject, which shall be expressed in its title. We think the intention of the legislature in this respect was not to confine the operation of the road to animal power, but to incorporate street railway companies as distinguished from steam railways, and to endow them with the rights and privileges named in the acts. Section two of the law (act of 1865) expressly gives the power of amendment, in providing that 'it shall be competent for the said common council, with the written consent or concurrence of the other party or parties or their assigns to any of said contracts, stipulations, licenses, or undertakings, to amend, modify, or annul the same.' We think this grant of power was broad enough to authorize the city to grant, and the railway company to accept, a changed method of operation of the railways by applying thereto a new and more efficient and economical power. It is true that the supreme court of Illinois in North Chicago City R. Co. v. Lake View, 105 Ill. 207, 44 Am. Rep. 788, held that the charter of the North Chicago City Railway Company had not authorized a steam railway, but that court has held in later decisions that an electric railway, incorporated under the general incorporation acts to build horse and dummy railways, might organize a street railway company to be operated by electricity or by any motive power other than steam, and might appropriate private property for this purpose. Harvey v. Aurora & G. R. Co. 174 Ill. 299, 51 N. E. 163. The court has also held that the provisions of the horse and dummy act applied to electric railway companies, as did a paragraph of the generl incorporation act in regard to horse railways. We think the Illinois cases recognize the distinction in legislation in that state between railways intended to be operated upon the streets of the city of Chicago and other cities for local accommodation, and steam railways, as such are \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 484]\n\u00a0\n generally understood. And the declaration inserted in the title of the acts, that they concern horse railways, will not, because of the constitutional provision, prevent the exercise of the power of amendment conferred by law upon the city and the companies in such manner as to authorize the use of such power as electricity and cable. We agree with the learned circuit court that these grants as to changed methods of operation were within the powers legally conferred by the act of 1865. Furthermore, on June 9, 1897, the legislature passed an act having application to companies organized under general or special laws, which provided: 'Every such street railway may be operated by animal, cable, electric, or any other motive power that may have been or shall hereafter be granted to it by the public officers or authorities, except steam locomotive engines.' It is true that this statute was repealed by the act of March 7, 1899, but we do not perceive how this could destroy its effect to ratify the contracts which were in existence when the act was passed. This view renders it unnecessary to pass upon the question whether the city of Chicago, having undertaken to authorize the use of new power, upon the faith of which authority large sums of money have been expended and extensive changes made, can now be heard to say that it had no authority to grant such right.\n The learned circuit court held that privileges granted under ordinances of the town of Jefferson were limited to twenty years. This ruling, it is contended by the Chicago West Division Railway Company, is erroneous, because of the act of 1859, which provided: 'Section 5. The said corporation is hereby authorized to extend the said several railways herein authorized to be built in the manner aforesaid to any point or points within the county of Cook in this state; and to enable said corporation to construct any or all of the railways herein authorized, or their appendages, the said corporation is hereby vested with power to take and apply private property for the purposes and in the manner prescribed,' etc. Section 6: 'The said corporation is hereby authorized \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 485]\n\u00a0\n with the assent of the supervisor of any township, to lay down and maintain its said railway or railways in, upon, over, and along any common highway in said township, but in such manner as not to obstruct the common travel of the public over the same.' The town of Jefferson was one of the townships of Cook county, adjoining the city of Chicago on the northwest. So far as the record discloses, no effort was made to extend the lines of the Chicago West Division Railway Company into the town of Jefferson until 1877. Before that year the town of Jefferson had adopted the provisions of the cities and villages act of 1872, in which the power to grant the use of the streets for street railway purposes was limited to twenty years. On January 28, 1878, the village passed the ordinance granting to the Chicago West Division Railway Company and its successors the right to maintain and operate a street railway in Milwaukee avenue and Armitage road, in said village, the rights and privileges thereby granted to extend for the term of eighty-one years. Under the act of 1859 the right to lay down tracks and maintain railways over and along the common highways in the townships in Cook county required the consent of the supervisor in the township. This does not appear to have been obtained, and when the authority was given by the president and board of trustees of the village, it was subject to the limitation already referred to. We cannot assent to the soundness of the argument that the act of 1859, in the event of the abolition of the office of supervisor, during the life of the corporation, would authorize the extension to these adjoining townships of the system of railways intended to be constructed, without official consent.\n Before the passage of the act of 1865, incorporating the board of trustees of the town of Lake View, the supervisors granted permits to use some of the highways of Lake township. This authority was exercised under  5 and 6 of the act of February 14, 1859. We cannot agree that the duration of these permits would be in perpetuity, because of the fact that no time was specifically named in them. The extension into \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 486]\n\u00a0\n Lake View was part of the north side railway system, which, by the terms of the grants from the city, were limited to twenty-five years, and no longer. There certainly could be no intention in granting these permits from the supervisors as extensions of the system to make perpetual grants, when the right of user of the main part of the line was expressly limited to twenty-five years. A fair inference would be that, in extending this part of the system so as to make a portion of that already granted, such grants were to be for the same term as those already made. As to extensions in the town of Lake View, obtained otherwise than from the supervisors, it appears that on February 16, 1865, an act was passed entitled 'An Act to Incorporate a Board of Trustees for the Town of Lake View, in Cook County,' and it was provided that the supervisors, assessors, and commissioners of highways and their successors in office should be constituted and incorporated, ex officio, a board of trustees for said town of Lake View. On March 5, 1867, an amendatory act was passed entitled 'An Act to Incorporate a Board of Trustees for the Town of Lake View, in Cook County,' which provided ( 7) that the board of trustees should have the control and supervision of the highways, streets, alleys, and public parks in said town. This board afterwards passed ordinances consenting to the laying down of tracks in the town of Lake View, on a number of avenues and streets named in the ordinances.\n The cases in the state courts are much divided as to the right of a municipal corporation, because of its charter power of controlling the streets, to grant the use thereof to a street railway company. Some of the cases are collected in Detroit Citizens' Street R. Co. v. Detroit, 26 L. R. A. 667, 12 C. C. A. 365, 22 U. S. App. 570, 64 Fed. 628, 637.\n The act of 1859,  6, required the consent of the supervisor to the extension of the railways into townships of Cook county outside of Chicago. When the supervisor became a member of the township board of trustees, and that board gave its consent, we think this satisfied the requirement of the act in that respect. The legislature might have given the railway \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 487]\n\u00a0\n company the right to extend its lines in Cook county without the consent of any local authority. We are not concerned with the general powers of the supervisor. When the legislature designated him as the official whose assent should be obtained, it empowered him to give such assent, and when given in any substantial way, that satisfied the requirements of the act of 1859.\n As we understand the decisions of the supreme court of Illinois, the power to control the streets and highways by the township trustees, given by the act of March 5, 1867, would include the right to authorize their use for street railway purposes. In Chicago Municipal Gaslight & Fuel Co. v. Lake, 130 Ill. 54, 22 N. E. 616, the court held: 'The power to control and regulate the streets, alleys, and other public places within the limits of the town of Lake, and abate any obstructions, encroachments, or nuisances thereon, was given, in its charter, to the corporate authorities of the town. Under this power the town could lawfully permit any use of such streets and alleys that is consistent with the public objects for which they are held, and could make a grant of a right of way for the purpose of laying gas pipes and mains under the surface.' In People ex rel. Rinne v. Blocki, 203 Ill. 363, 368, 67 N. E. 809, 810, the same court said, having reference to a grant of the right to lay switch tracks in the street: 'The street, at the time said permits were granted, was under the control of the board of trustees of the town of Lake, and, under the power conferred upon that municipality by law, it was authorized to allow the use of said street for any purpose not incompatible with the purpose for which it was established, and to allow a railroad track to be laid therein was not a use incompatible with the purpose for which it was established.' In Quincy v. Bull, 106 Ill. 337, on page 349, it was said: 'In this state there is vested in municipal corporations a fee-simple title to the streets. Under the power of exclusive control over streets it is very well settled by decisions of this court that the municipal authorities may do anything with, or allow any use of streets, which is not in- \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 488]\n\u00a0\n compatible with the ends for which streets are established, and that it is a legitimate use of a street to allow a railroad track to be laid down in it. Moses v. Pittsburgh, Ft. W. & C. R. Co. 21 Ill. 516; Murphy v. Chicago, 29 Ill. 279, 81 Am. Dec. 307; Chicago & N. W. R. Co. v. People, 91 Ill. 251.' In view of these Illinois decisions, construing the legislative acts of the state, we think the learned circuit court erred in holding that the trustees of the town of Lake had no power to grant the railway the use of the streets for street railway purposes.\n The question remains as to the term for which the rights granted by the trustees and the municipality of Lake View were to be held. The ordinances making these grants required the company to perform certain duties to the municipalities, such as the laying of pavement, subject to the approval of the trustees. On April 16, 1887, the incorporated town of Lake View became incorporated as the city of Lake View under the cities and villages act of 1872. On July 15, 1889, the territory included in the city of Lake View was annexed to the city of Chicago. We think in such case that the terms granted would not extend beyond the life of the corporation conferring them, where there was no attempt to confer a definite term, assuming, without deciding, that it was within the authority of the municipality to grant a perpetuity. Our attention has been called to a late case decided in the supreme court of Illinois ( People ex rel. v. Chicago Telephone Co., not officially reported) 77 N. E. 245, in which it was held that where trustees of villages and towns have granted rights extending telephone privileges, not for a definite period, that such grants could not be construed to be perpetuities, and did not extend beyond the lives of the corporations granting them. The court says: 'The ground of the defendant's claim that the ordinance does not limit its charges in the annexed territory is that, before the annexation, the minor municipalities had granted to it the right to occupy the streets therein for its business, without any limits as to time. If the grants had been for terms of \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 489]\n\u00a0\n years under legislative authority authorizing them, and the term had extended beyond the existence of the corporations granting the privileges, there might be ground for saying that the grants were binding upon the city, because they had become binding contracts, under which the defendants had vested contract rights for such term; but they were not for definite periods, and the grants were in consideration of furnishing something to the town or village, such as telephone service to the town or village hall or the village authorities, free or for some reduced rate. Such grants cannot be construed to be perpetual, and, at most, cannot extend beyond the lives of the corporations granting them. Upon annexation there ceased to be any town or village authorities entitled to the benefits of the contract or authorized to demand or receive them, and it could not have been understood that the grant could continue, discharged of the obligation annexed to it. . . . The ordinances of the city extended over the annexed territory immediately upon annexation (Illinois C. R. Co. v. Chicago, \n176 U.S. 646\n, 44 L. ed. 622, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 509) and the limitations of the ordinance applied to the annexed territory.'\n This seems to us a reasonable view, and, being the construction of the highest court of the state of Illinois, we are willing to accept it. Furthermore, these grants in Lake View were mere extensions of the old system, which, as we have seen, was limited in its rights to use the streets received from the city to the term of twenty-five years, extended twenty years by the compromise ordinance. In the absence of express language conferring a longer term, we do not think it was intended to extend the grant beyond the period already permitted to the system by grants from the city.\n As we have said, we do not deem it necessary to take up all the questions which were raised and determined by the circuit court in considering the case and settling the decree in that court. Upon further proceedings the judgment of this court is only to be held conclusive upon matters specifically stated in this opinion. \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 490]\n\u00a0\n The decree is reversed and the cause remanded to the Circuit Court for further proceedings in accordance with the views herein expressed.\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna, with whom concur Mr. Justice Brewer and Mr. Justice Brown, dissenting:\n This case as to questions common to all the railways depends mainly upon the acts of 1859 and 1865,-incidentally upon the act of 1861. The latter act may be omitted from special consideration, as it depends upon the others. Ill. Private Laws 1861, p. 340. It incorporated the Chicago West Division Railway Company and gave to that company all the powers conferred upon the other companies by the 2d, 3d, 4th, and 6th sections of the act of 1859.\n It will be observed of the acts of 1859 and 1865 that they created corporations respectively for the period of twenty-five and ninety-nine years, and empowered them to construct, maintain, and operate a single and double track railway in Chicago.\n The acts, as was remarked by the circuit court, fall into three divisions: (1) The granting part,-the authority of the companies to construct railways; (2) the identifying part,-the designation of the streets by the common council; (3) the terms and conditions of the occupation of the streets by the commpanies and the manner in which the terms and conditions shall be prescribed.\n The meaning of the third division is one of the chief controversies in the case; in other words, the extent of the authority of the common council,-whether it was virtually an authority to grant rights in the streets or authority to regulate the rights conferred by the legislature; or, as it is aptly expressed by the circuit court, whether it was an authority to fix, by stipulation with the companies, that which relates 'to the physical side of the occupancy of the streets or the administrative side of the operation of the lines.' \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 491]\n\u00a0\n It will be convenient in the discussion to exhibit the acts of 1859 and 1865, showing wherein the latter amends the former, omitting the provision extending the corporate lives of the companies from twenty-five years to ninety-nine years, about which there is no dispute. The words in italics are the amendments made by the act of 1865:\n'The said corporation is hereby authorized and empowered to construct, maintain, and operate a single or double track railway, with all necessary and convenient tracks for turn-outs, side tracks, and appendages, in the city of Chicago, and in, on, over, and along such street or streets, highway or highways, bridge or bridges, river or rivers, within the present or future limits of the south and [or] west divisions of the city of Chicago, as the common council of said city have authorized said corporators, or any of them, or shall from time to time authorize said corporations, or either of them, so to do, in such manner, and upon such terms and conditions, and with such rights and privileges, immunities and exemptions, as the said common council has or may, by contract with said parties, or any or either of them, prescribe; and any and all acts or deeds of transfer of rights, privileges, or franchises between the corporations in said several acts named, or any two of them, and all contracts, stipulations, licenses, and undertakings made, entered into, or given, and as made or amended by and between the said common council and any one or more of the said corporations, respecting the location, use, or exclusion of railways in or upon the streets, or any of them, of said city, shall be deemed and held and continued in force during the life hereof as valid and effectual, to all intents and purposes, as if made a part, and the same are hereby made a part, of said several acts; provided that it shall be competent for the said common council, with the written consent or concurrence of the other party or parties, or their assigns, to any of said contracts, stipulations, licenses, or undertakings, to amend, modify, or annul the same.'\n\n It is obvious, as far as words can accomplish it, and as directly as words can accomplish it, the companies were granted \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 492]\n\u00a0\n the right 'to construct, maintain, and operate' railways upon the streets of the city. And no other power could have granted such right. Chicago City R. Co. v. People, 73 Ill. 541.\n That such grant must come from the state is, of course, not denied; but it is urged that the grant of rights passed to the railway companies through the agency of the city, the city receiving a delegation of the state's power. This is based upon the words of the city's charter, and the authority given in the acts of 1859 and 1865 to designate the 'terms and conditions' upon which the streets might be occupied.\n The view I take of the acts makes it comparatively unimportant to consider the city's charter. There seemed to be a necessity for the acts, and they were complete in themselves, independent of other grants of power, except what were continued or confirmed by them. If the charter was adequate to invest in the city plenary power over the streets, we may wonder at the enactment of those statutes and many years of misapprehension of them and concern about them. Counsel for the companies assert, and the assertion does not seem to be denied, that an injunction was issued by the circuit court of Cook county, restraining the laying of tracks under the ordinance of 1858. The extent of the power of the city, however, I shall presently consider more at length, and will now pass to those parts of the act which the city insists conferred authority on the common council.\n The stress of the argument is on the words 'terms and conditions,' in the third division. The city contends, and the court decides, reversing the decree of the circuit court, that the authority of the city to prescribe terms and conditions of the occupation of the streets included the authority to fix the time of occupation. I dissent from that interpretation for several reasons. It is opposed to the context in which the words 'terms and conditions' are used. It is opposed to their primary and natural meaning. It would be a careless employment of them, and disregard or destroy dis- \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 493]\n\u00a0\n tinctions necessary to be observed. As was said by the circuit court, ordinarily in legal phraseology those terms are not employed 'to convey power over or relating to the time or period through which the tenure dealt with is intended to run; but conveys power over, or relates to the means, the methods, and the incidents connected with the exercise of such tenure.' Citing Hurd v. Whitsett, 4 Colo. 77; Chicago Terminal Transfer R. Co. v. Chicago, 203 Ill. 576, 68 N. E. 99. Of course, directness and simplicity of methods are not always used, but some argument can be based on their omission, and it is natural to believe that had it been intended to give the power contended for to the city, words would not have been employed which would have to be turned from their first and legal signification to express it, and which could be claimed to be in opposition to other parts of the act, and made dependent, besides, upon contracts with the companies, which could only be amended by consent of the companies. The power would have been more directly conferred by a delegation of the whole matter to the city, and would have been absolute,- not limited or embarrassed or opposed by conditions unnecessary to it.\n The act of 1859 was certainly a direct grant from the state to the companies for the time of their charter life, and the necessity or the advisability of conferring authority upon the city of limit the time of occupancy of the streets could not have entered into the head of anybody. No conditions existed which suggested the necessity or prudence of giving such authority. The time of occupancy expressed in the ordinance of 1858, the time of the life of corporations prescribed in the act of 1859, and the time for which the franchises conferred by that act could be exercised, all coincided. It could not have occurred to anyone that twenty-five years, the term fixed in all the instruments, was injuriously long and demanded authority somewhere to limit its excess. To these considerations as proof that the words 'terms and conditions' were not intended to give authority to prescribe a time \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 494]\n\u00a0\n of occupancy of the streets may be added that of contemporary practice.\n By an ordinance passed in 1859 the time of occupation was expressed to be 'during all the term in the said act of the 14th of February, A. D. 1859, specified and prescribed.' This, as said by counsel for the companies, 'is a distinct recognition of the fact that the term for the enjoyment of the franchise was to be found in the statute, and was not among the elements of the contract which the ordinance might prescribe.'\n With the act of 1865 there came a change,-differences from the act of 1859 of conspicuous and striking import. These differences were too full of meaning not to be considered enlargements of the act of 1859, and they were not misunderstood. The lives of the corporations were extended to ninety-nine years. There is no dispute about this, and it would seem necessarily that the other provisions were on account of and completed the purpose of the extension. And the extension had some valuable purpose. It was certainly not for the purpose only of extending the time of the abstract beings with nothing to do,-no functions to exercise, no rights, no obligations,-and the latter might, we can conceive, be as necessary for the public to enforce as the former for the companies to exercise. Chicago Union Traction Co. v. Chicago, 199 Ill. 484, 59 L. R. A. 631, 65 N. E. 451. It would be a strange confusion and confounding of purposes to make the existence of a corporation more important than that which it was created to do. Necessarily, life and functions went together, the term of the rights and obligations of the corporations coinciding with the term of their life.\n This coincidence of the life and the rights of the corporations being kept in mind, we can easily resolve whatever ambiguities are in the statute of 1865. It will give to every word a use and meaning, and keep distinct the power which was exercised by the legislature and the powers to be exercised by the common council. Let me, at the expense of repetition, enter into some detail. The act of 1865, amending the act of \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 495]\n\u00a0\n 1859, enlarged the life of the corporations from twenty-five years to ninety-nine years, and in  2 empowered the companies to 'construct, maintain, and operate' a single or double track of railway in the streets of Chicago. These words necessarily imported a continuing power. Time was of the very essence of the right. It is true that there was no designation of time but the life of the corporations, but this was sufficient, in the absence of qualification, and there was no qualification; certainly none in explicit words. Streets were not designated by name, but, in a certain sense, all streets were subject to whatever right was given, though it could be exercised in none without the designation of the common council. This is sought to be made very dominant,-determinative, indeed, of the power of the city,-making the city, in effect, the source of the rights of the companies, not merely the regulator of the manner of exercising those rights.\n Upon what reasoning is the conclusion based? Before considering the question, however, let me refer to the statement in the opinion that 'the council made, and the companies accepted, specific ordinances fixing the time of occupancy, as had been done in the original ordinances of May 23, 1859. And neither before nor after the passage of the act of 1865 was the ninety-nine-year term recognized or acted upon in ordinances granting the use of the streets.' I am uncertain as to the conclusion deduced from the statement. It needs some explanation. Standing alone it may produce an erroneous impression. If the companies accepted the ordinances, conceding the power of the city, without protest or reservation of their rights under the act of 1865 to longer terms of occupancy, there could be no controversy over the interpretation of the act of 1865. Other considerations would supervene and demand attention. Counsel for the city contended for an estoppel against the companies, and because the court has not responded to that contention, but discusses and bases its opinion upon the meaning of the act, I also have discussed its meaning as necessary to the case and determinative of it; \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 496]\n\u00a0\n and I recur to the question, Upon what reasoning is the plenary power of the city supported?\n First, let me quote the language of the act of 1865, separated from the parts which I think are not relevant to the present part of the discussion: 'The said corporation is authorized and empowered to construct, maintain, and operate a single or double track railway . . . in the city of Chicago, and in, on, over, and along such street or streets . . . as the common council of said city have authorized said corporators, or any of them, or shall from time to time authorize said corporations, or either of them, so to do, in such manner and upon such terms and conditions . . . as the said common council has (prescribed) or may by contract with said parties, or any or either of them, prescribe, . . . and any and all acts or deeds of transfer of rights, privileges, or franchises between the corporations in said several acts named, or any two of them, and all contracts, stipulations, licenses, undertakings made, entered into, or given, and as made or amended by and between the said common council and any one or more of the said corporations, respecting the location, use, or exclusion of railways in or upon the streets, or any of them, of said city, shall be deemed and held and continued in force during the life hereof, as valid and effectual to all intents and purposes as if made a part of said several acts . . .' (Italics mine.)\n The language is orderly and, to me, unmistakable in its relations and meaning. What element is omitted necessary to the clear expression of a definite purpose? Not one. We have already seen that the rights given would have been, if there had been no other expression of time, coincident with the life of the corporations, but time was not left to implication, however clear the implication might have been. It was expressed. It is true it is not said that the rights, contracts, etc., shall be 'held and continued in force' for ninety-nine years. If it\n In Chicago Union Traction Co. v. Chicago, 199 Ill. 484, 524, 59 L. R. A. 631, 645, 65 N. E. 451, 462, it is said: 'The word 'prescribed,' to which the word 'has' applies, was accidentally omitted.' \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 497]\n\u00a0\n had, there certainly would be no ambiguity. It would suit with the other words, and complete their meaning without change of a single syllable. Why then is there any ambiguity, if we substitute an equivalent for the phrase 'for ninety-nine years?' If 'during the life hereof' is not the equivalent for 'ninety-nine years,' that is, the life of the corporations, what does it mean?\n There are various answers offered, some accepting that meaning, others disputing it. One counsel for the city submits rather tentatively that the words 'during the life hereof' may be words of limitation, and that 'the grants by the common council thus ratified by the act should continue for their full term,' unless 'the corporate existence of one or more of the corporations be terminated by dissolution or forfeiture within the period for which its privileges in the streets were granted.' It is said, 'Thus construed, the act means precisely and exactly what it says,- that is, during the life, i. e., during the corporate lives of the several companies, the contracts made with them by the common council are as valid and effectual as if made part of the act. . . .'\n Other counsel for the city leave a choice of interpretations. They say 'The expression 'during the life hereof\" is vague and ambiguous. It may be capable of three interpretations: As meaning the life of the act; or the life of the deeds, licenses, and contracts; or the lives of the railway corporations, respectively. They incline rather to the second, and say that 'during the life hereof' means the life of the section or the matters mentioned in the section, and 'hereof' should be changed to 'thereof.' The court accepts neither of the interpretations, but gives its authority to another. It was apparent that the interpretations advanced by counsel were too restricted and ignored too much the words of the act. It was apparent that the clause referred to the lives of the corporations ( ninety-nine years), continued something for those lives, and the court selects as the things so continued 'the acts or deeds of transfer between the corporation so far as \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 498]\n\u00a0\n they relate to franchises which are not subject to the express limitations of the act-that they shall stand as made.' The construction, however, is not confidently asserted. It seems to be adopted in submission to the rule of strict construction. A word, therefore, as to that rule.\n I concede the rule to be that nothing passes by a grant of franchises, such as those conferred by the acts under review, unless it be clearly stated or necessarily implied; but I do not think the statutes under review call for an application of the rule. Whatever is ambiguous in the acts yields a definite and consistent purpose and meaning by the application of the simple rules of interpretation. In such case there is no place for the rule of strict construction. Our reports abound in cases where, against bold and able controversy, public grants have been sustained, and where division in the court has marked with emphasis the strength of the doubts which existed. And we have taken care to warn against a misunderstanding of the rule in a case of significant import. It will be conceded, I think, that the power of taxation is the highest attribute of sovereignty, one the most necessary to it, and against the limitation of which all intendments proclaim. The Delaware Railroad Tax, 18 Wall. 206, 21 L. ed. 888. Limitations of this power have been sustained in favor of private individuals, arising from statutes of disputable meaning. In Citizens' Bank v. Parker, \n192 U.S. 73\n, 48 L. ed. 346, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 181, interpreting the charter of the bank, it was held that the bank was exempt from the license tax, and we there said that the rule of strict construction is to be used to solve ambiguities, not to create them. There was a dissent that pressed the rule against the reasoning and conclusions of the court.\n Returning, then, to the argument of the court, not required by any rule to find ambiguity in the statutes, but required by every rule to solve if found, what is that argument? Its first premise is the assumption that it was the policy of the state to vest in the city the control of the streets. Some control, yes; but how much? Was it a policy of unlimited or qualified \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 499]\n\u00a0\n control; the grant of rights in them or the regulation of rights? Or, to use a technical term, the grant of franchises or the grant of power of administration over their exercise? The answer is found in the case of Chicago City R. Co. v. People, supra.\n The case was based on the act of 1859, and the right derived from it as distinguished from the rights derived from an ordinance of the city. It was said: 'It is a misconception of the law to suppose the railway company derives its power to construct a railroad from any ordinance of the city. All its authority is from the state, and is conferred by its charter. The city has delegated to it the power to say in what manner and upon what conditions the company may exercise the franchises conferred by the state, but nothing more.' The reason given was that the ordinance emanated from a source not 'competent to grant a franchise.' That power the legislature alone possessed. The date of the ordinance was November 13, 1871. It is manifest therefore, that the policy of the state of Illinois up to 1871, and necessarily in 1859 and 1865, was not to give its municipal corporations the authority to grant a right in the streets, but only empowered them to regulate the right. And it was necessary to decide the kind and the extent of authority that was vested in the city. It was urged that the ordinance passed on purported to grant 'special privileges' or 'franchises,' and was therefore void under the Constitution of 1870. The court replied that the ordinance did not grant a franchise, and that by no construction could the Constitution be said to be a 'limitation upon the municipal corporation to designate certain streets and fix the conditions upon which a railway company, organized under a special charter previously granted, or under a general law since the adoption of the Constitution might lay its track.' (P. 548.)\n This view acquired emphasis from the dissenting opinion, which took issue with the court, and virtually made the city the source of the rights of the railway, and not the state, and, \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 500]\n\u00a0\n describing what the court said as to the power of the city, observed: 'These special privileges of the rights of the railway upon particular streets are said to be conferred, not by the city, by its ordinance, but by the state, by the company's charter, and the city only regulates the use.' (Italics mine.)\n The case was decided in 1874, and the principle it declared is the exact contention of the railways to-day, and, to the strength of the reasoning of the court, may be added the consideration that the property acquired and the investments made under the sanction of the decision for thirty-two years now claims its protection against impairment. Such considerations should prevail over ambiguity, could ambiguity ever have been asserted to exist. It received its solution and should never again be brought forward to cloud the meaning of the statute.\n The distinction between the plenary and the limited control over the streets by the city is substantial in the controversy between it and the railway companies. Manifestly, the power to grant a franchise is not the same as the power to designate streets on which the franchise can be exercised. Of course, the streets must be designated before the franchise can be exercised, and therefore the power to designate may be magnified and confounded with the other power. It is so magnified, and the inability of the railroads to compel any action upon the part of the city is urged and dwelt on by counsel. The argument is that, as the city could have refused to designate any street, it had the right to exact anything of the railroads. In other words, the defects in the remedies of the railway companies enlarged the power of the city and changed the nature of the grant to the companies. Or it may be put this way,-the power given to the city as a subordinate instrumentality of the state may be employed to defeat the purpose of the state. This cannot be done. Pittsburgh's Appeal, 115 Pa. 4, 7 Atl. 778; Atlantic City Waterworks Co. v. Consumers Water Co. 44 N. J. Eq. 427, 15 Atl. 581; Galveston & W. R. Co. v. Galveston, 90 Tex, 399, 36 L. R. A. 33, 39 S. W. 96, 91 Tex. 17, 36 L. R. A. 44, 39 S. W. 920; Homestead \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 501]\n\u00a0\n Street R. Co. v. Pittsburg & H. Electric Street R. Co. 166 Pa. 171, 172, 27 L. R. A. 383, 30 Atl. 950, 955. And I may observe that there are some duties, the performance of which cannot be immediately coerced. It need not be pointed out that the agencies of government are kept, in a great measure, to co-operation by sense of duty and propriety, and if they should, disregarding that sense, exercise the mere physical power possessed to refuse to act, disorder, temporary at least, would result. It is, besides, a strange contention to me that a municipality of a state, because of its ability, physical, it may be, more than legal, to refuse to exercise powers conferred upon it, can assume or assert other powers. Let us not overlook that a municipality must have warrant, express or necessarily implied, for what it does. It, too, is within the rule of strict construction. Dill. Mun. Corp.  91.\n In the grant of franchises from the state and their regulation merely by the city there was no inconsistency, and this division of functions was not only natural of itself, but comported with the policy of the state, as explained in Chicago City R. Co. v. People, supra. The decision cannot, it seems to me, be explained away. It was nearer in time to the enactment of the statutes than we are to-day, and it is the conditions of that time we should try to realize. This is not as easy as it seems to be. Whatever we may profess, it is not easy to realize the conditions, thoughts, and purposes of another time. In 1859 nothing indicated the necessity of giving the city the power now contended for. In 1859 there could be no foresight of the development of street railways. Then they were just beginning to be thought of as a means of transportation and the city was as eager to procure them as capitalists to construct them. It is said that time is the wisest thing on earth, and taking to ourselves its wisdom, in 1906, we are sure we would have seen in an enterprise just starting, and yet tentative, the growth it might attain and the measures that would be necessary to restrain and control it. But if there was anyone capable of such prophecy, the act of 1859 did \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 502]\n\u00a0\n not challenge its exercise. There was nothing in it excessive, as I have already pointed out; nothing to invoke a jealous care. I dwell on this because the provisions of the act of 1859 were carried into the act of 1865, and certainly were not intended to give a greater power to the city than when used in the act of 1859. In other words, a provision which could have had no purpose in the act of 1859 to give power to the city to fix the time of the occupation of the streets could not, by mere repetition in the act of 1865, have such purpose.\n The situation in 1859 was exceedingly simple. Certain persons had been given the power by an ordinance of the city to construct a street railway. The right under the ordinance was questioned,-maybe it had been adjudged illegal, and the act of 1859 was passed. It explicitly gave, in my opinion, the right to construct and operate railways in the streets, and gave authority to the city only to regulate the exercise of the right. But granting that some of its words are ambiguous,-granting that the words 'terms and conditions' can be interpreted to authorize a limitation of time,-such interpretation is not the only one of which they are susceptible. We should, therefore, consider whether that interpretation can be adhered to in view of the other provisions of the act of 1865.\n First, I may lay down as a fundamental rule that we must seek the meaning of the act from its words, and that we should so exercise interpretation 'as to bring a sense out of the words used, and not to bring a sense into them.' McCluskey v. Cromwell, 11 N. Y. 593, 602. And with the consequences of the act we should not concern ourselves. This court has said that a plain meaning of a provision of a statute, not contradicted by another provision, must prevail, even against a charge of absurdity and injustice, unless they by so monstrous that all mankind would, without hesitation, unite in rejecting the meaning. Sturges v. Crowninshield, 4 Wheat. 122, 202, 4 L. ed. 529, 550. With these rules in mind, and by referring to  2 of the act of 1865, it will be observed that its parts are providently arranged and its words are clear,-so clear, that conjecture must be pur \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 503]\n\u00a0\n to work and speculation must be indulged in to resist their manifest meaning.\n The section makes provision for certain things, to wit (1) the acts or deeds of transfer of rights, privileges, or franchises between the corporations; (2) contracts, stipulations, licenses, and undertakings made and entered into 'and as made or amended' between the corporations and the common council 'respecting the location, use, or exclusion of the railways in or upon the streets.' And what is done with these things? The answer is in the following provision: 'Shall be deemed and held and continued in force during the life hereof as valid and effectual, to all intents and purposes, as if made a part, and the same are hereby made a part, of said several acts.' Can a distinction be made between the things provided for? Which of those things shall 'be deemed and held and continued in force during the life' of the corporations? I say life of the corporations, as that, it is decided, is the meaning of the phrase.\n Considering the language of the provision, there can be but one answer. It permits no exception of any of the things, nor a distinction between them. A distinction is, however, asserted, and the provision is confined to the instruments transferring 'franchises,' as distinguished from the instruments transferring 'rights and privileges,' and is denied all application to the 'contracts, stipulations, licenses, and undertakings' between the companies and the city. In what way is this done and with what consequences?\n It will be observed that the provision does not simply confirm or ratify either the acts or deeds of transfer or the contracts; it does more. It continues them in force and makes them valid and effectual for the life of the act, the conceded equivalent of the life of the corporations. The provision is not, therefore, that the contracts and privileges obtained from the city shall 'stand as made,' but shall be continued in force during the life of the corporations,-a distinctly different purpose,-one which the words of the act sustain and at the same time exclude the other. It was not a provision for simple rat- \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 504]\n\u00a0\n ification which would carry, by necessary force, the time limits of the contracts, but one which adopts another measure of time,-the life of the corporations. And a provision was necessary to make the new measure of time applicable to the contracts. It was afforded, and again the necessity is demonstrated of adhering to the words of the act, unless we may regard it a mistake in the act for any of its words to have a purpose.\n Plainly, therefore, the phrase 'during the life hereof' cannot be limited to the acts or deeds of transfer of franchises. To do so is not only to distinguish between the instruments of transfer of franchises and the instruments of transfer of rights and privileges, but is to detach the phrase and its correlated words from its immediate objects, the 'contracts, stipulations, licenses, and undertakings' entered into by the common council and the companies, and to leave those objects without provision,- without connection with anything, coherence, or purpose. Against this all the rules of interpretation protest, and the rules of construction cannot be invoked to justify a greater liberty. The purpose of construction, it is true, is to arrive at conclusions beyond the absolute sense of the text . (Leiber, 53.) But the integrity of the text cannot be disregarded. I do not overlook the fact that the court sees an inconsistency between the parts of  2, and attempts to reconcile them. But in what way? As it seems to me, by magnifying the obscure in one part of the section and making it prevail over the manifestly clear in another part. By making the words 'terms and conditions'-doubtful necessarily, and which, as I think, can only by an extreme indulgence be given the meaning put upon them-dominate everything else, even to the breaking of the section into unrelated and meaningless parts. To my mind a strange situation is presented. The legislature of the state had in its mind, we are told, a simple purpose,- the purpose to create corporations and to give them power to acquire rights from the city; and how did they express the purpose-simply, directly, and obviously? No; but in such way that the words \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 505]\n\u00a0\n it employed con fused or opposed the purpose. And the legislature was dealing with important rights, some to be confined to twenty-five years, others to be extended to ninety-nine years, and we are asked to believe that it bunched those rights indiscriminately and trusted to a searching construction to sort them afterwards and take them out of the meaning of words which included them all.\n There is another consideration of potent weight. The construction of the court was not the contemporary construction of the act of 1865. It was not the construction proclaimed by the governor, justifying his veto of the act. He pointed out that the necessary effect of extending the lives of the corporations was to extend their rights in the streets of the city, and that he had received petitions signed by a large number of the citizens of Chicago, protesting against the measure as one which had been passed without their assent, or that of the corporate authorities, and that it extended the franchise for ninety-nine years in advance of the term already vested in the corporation. And he also pointed out that the right given to the city to purchase the railway property at the end of twenty-five years, secured to it by the ordinance of August 16, 1858, was also extended to ninety-nine years. And, upon a fair construction, the governor said, 'the act seems hardly susceptible of any other meaning,' and he had heard, he further said, 'none other claimed for it.' The governor also considered the clause which continued in force the acts or deeds of transfer, and, so far as his words indicate, he perceived no difference betwen the instruments of transfer.\n Seldom has a statute enacted at a distant time received so clear and influential proclamation of its meaning and effect as is afforded of the act of 1865, by the governor's message. It seems now, forty years removed from the enactment of the law, that the governor, who was close to its enactment, and the citizens of Chicago, who protested against it, were mistaken in its meaning. And the governor was part of the lawmaking power. It was his duty, therefore, to study the statute, and \n\n[201 U.S. 400, 506]\n\u00a0\n to try to know its purpose, not only from its text but from external circumstances. His misunderstanding needs to be accounted for. The misunderstanding of the protesting citizens of Chicago needs to be accounted for. Explanation cannot be found by asserting ambiguities in the act. There is not a syllable of evidence to indicate that any were perceived or regarded of consequence. The governor was confident in his views. Of one of the effects of the act, and one which could not result unless his construction was correct, he said he had heard no other claimed for it than that which he entertained and expressed. There was no doubt with him, therefore,-no disguise of the measure by its advocates. We are, however, now asked to believe that the legislature alone either saw or was persuaded of the real merits of the measure, and passed it over a groundless veto and ignorant opposition, with consciousness that it would be construed to have the meaning now given it.\n I am unable to so believe and am constrained to dissent from the judgment. \n\nFootnotes\n Ordinance of August 16, 1858.\n An Ordinance Authorizing the Construction and Operation of Certain Horse Railways in the Streets of the City of Chicago (Passed August 16, 1858).\n Be it ordained by the common council of the city of Chicago:\n Section 1.

ILLINOIS(1906)\nNo. 103\nArgued: November 14, 1906Decided: December 24, 1906\n\n\n\n Messrs. Charles H. Aldrich, Henry S. McAuley, and Lawrence Maxwell, Jr., for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[203 U.S. 553, 556]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Edwin M. Ashcraft and William H. Stead for defendant in error.\n\n\n[203 U.S. 553, 558]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n This writ of error is directed to a judgment of the supreme court of the state of Illinois sustaining a tax assessed against plaintiff in error under the inheritance tax law of that state, passed June 15, 1895, entitled 'An Act to Tax Gifts, Legacies, and Inheritances in Certain Cases, and to Provide for the Collection of the Same.' Laws of 1895, p. 301.\n The facts are as follows: Fanny Speed, a citizen and resident of Kentucky, died seised of certain real estate in the city of Chicago. She devised a one-half interest to plaintiff in error, to be used as part of its educational fund, 'to be held, invested, and administered' as other properties forming a part of that fund. The will was probated in the probate court of Cook county, state in Illinois. An inheritance tax of $6, 280.50 was assessed by the county judge against plaintiff in error, based on the value of the interest devised.\n Plaintiff in error was incorporated by an act of the legislature of the state of Kentucky to form an educational fund for the promotion of literature, education, art, morality, and religion. Its funds are held and used exclusively for such purposes, and are required to be wholly expended within the state of Kentucky. It is not permitted to make dividends or distribution of profits or assets among its members or stockholders. It does not have or maintain an office in the state of Illinois, or engage in educational or religious work therein.\n From the action of the county judge imposing the tax, plaintiff in error appealed to the county court of Cook county and assigned as grounds of appeal: (1) That by reason of its organization and the purposes of its organization, as shown by the record, it was exempt from such tax under the act of May 10, 1901, amending the act of June 15, 1895. (2) For that the imposition of such tax upon it (the plaintiff in error), when \n\n[203 U.S. 553, 559]\n\u00a0\n corporations organized for like purposes under the laws of the state were exempt therefrom, was in conflict with the Constitution of the state of Illinois, and rendered said act void as to plaintiff in error, as in conflict with the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, in that it abridged the privileges and immunities of plaintiff in error, who was a citizen of the United States, and denied to it the equal protection of the laws. The county court sustained the tax and the supreme court affirmed the judgment. This writ of error was then sued out.\n The assignment of errors in this court, omitting the specification of error based on the Constitution of the state, is the same as that in the state courts.\n It is enough for our purpose to say that  1 of the act of 1895 subjects to a tax all property situated within the state, which shall, by will or by the intetsate laws, pass from any person who may die seised or possessed of the same. The act was amended in 1901 by adding thereto the following section:\n'When the beneficial interest of any property or income therefrom shall pass to or for the use of any hospital, religious, educational, Bible, missionary, tract, scientific, benevolent, or charitable purpose, or to any trustee, bishop, or minister of any church or religious denomination, held and used exclusively for the religious, educational, or charitable uses and purposes of such church or religious denomination, institution, or corporation, by grant, gift, bequest, or otherwise, the same shall not be subject to any such duty or tax; but this provision shall not apply to any corporation which has the right to make dividends or distribute profits or assets among its members.'\n\n The supreme court decided that this amendment did not apply to 'corporations created under the laws of a sister state.' And also decided, as so construed, the amendment was not repugnant to the Constitution of the United States. The court said:\n'A clear distinction exists between domestic corporations \n\n[203 U.S. 553, 560]\n\u00a0\n and corporations organized under the laws of other states. Such corporations fall naturally into their respective classes. Over the one- that which the state has created-the state has certain powers of control; and the other is beyond its jurisdiction. Those of its own creation have been endowed with corporate powers for the purpose of subserving the interests of the state and its people; those which have been given life by the laws of a sister state have entirely different ends and objects to accomplish. The lawmaking power would find many weighty considerations authorizing the classification of foreign and domestic corporations into different classes and justifying the creation of liability on the part of foreign corporations to pay a tax on the right to take property by descent, devise, or bequest, under the laws of the state, and at the same time leaving the right of a domestic corporation so to take free of any such exaction.' [216 Ill. 28, 74 N. E. 811.]\n\n It will be seen by a reference to the assignment of errors that the ground of the attack by the plaintiff in error on the validity of the tax assessed against it is that the imposition of the tax upon it, while other corporations organized for like purposes under the laws of Illinois are exempt, renders the act of May 10, 1901, void, as to plaintiff in error. And, in their argument, counsel say: 'It is effect given by the supreme court of Illinois to this amendment (the act of 1901) that violates the rights claimed by the plaintiff in error under the Constitution of the United States.' The construction of the act by the supreme court we must accept as determining the meaning of the act. In other words, we must regard the act as if the legislature had, in explicit language, excluded from its provisions foreign corporations. If this renders the act void, plaintiff in error, whether its argument be tenable or untenable, seems to be put in the dilemma urged by the defendant in error, and an affirmance of the judgment is required. If the act of May 10, 1901, is invalid, it cannot give exemption from taxation to either domestic or foreign corporations, and plaintiff in error was rightly taxed under the act of June 15, 1895. \n\n[203 U.S. 553, 561]\n\u00a0\n Plaintiff in error, of course, does not desire to take exemption from domestic corporations. It desires to remove the discriminatory effect of the amendment of May 10, 1901, by including in its bounty foreign corporations. Can this be done? May a court by construction put into a law that which the legislature has left out? There is a difference between burdens and benefits, and it may well be that a law which confers the latter upon some persons, and thereby increases burdens on others, may be declared invalid by the courts. But if the courts may strike down privileges, may they extend favors and make objects of bounty those whom the legislature has excluded? The questions raise important considerations, but we may pass them, because the contention that the act of 1901 is invalid encounters an insuperable obstacle in the power of the state to classify objects of legislation and discriminate between classes. This power is not unconstitutionally exercised by legislation which exempts the religious and educational institutions of the state from an inheritance tax and subjects educational and religious institutions of other states to the tax. Regarding alone the purposes of the institutions, no difference may be perceived between them, but regarding the spheres of their exercise, and the benefits derived from their exercise, a difference is conspicuous. It is this benefit that may have constituted the inducement of the legislation.\n Plaintiff in error contests the classification of the act of 1901 and the conclusions deduced from it in an able argument. We do not reply to the argument in detail, because we have defined so often the principles of classification that we must regard repetition as unnecessary. An observation or two, however, may be worth while. It is contended that the exemption of the amendment of 1901 'is not limited by the decision of the supreme court to corporate takers or users,' and that the decision, by treating the act 'as a grant of privileges and immunities to corporations,' ignored 'the test of use found in the inquiry 'To what purpose is the beneficial \n\n[203 U.S. 553, 562]\n\u00a0\n interest in the property devoted?\" and the consideration that there was no necessity for corporate rate agency in that connection. The result of this is, it is urged, that the court made the 'power of state visitation and control' over corporations 'the test of taxability or nontaxability upon the right of succession.' Denying this to be the test, and contending that the test should be the use to which the property is devoted, and the question of tax or freedom from tax determined thereby, and asserting that plaintiff became a person within the jurisdiction of the state by going there to take title to property there situated, and by probating the will of Mrs. Speed as evidence of such title, it is deduced that it was not competent for the state to tax the property of plaintiff in error at one rate and the property of corporations, organized under her laws, at another rate.\n It must be kept in mind that the controversies in this case depend upon the power of the state over inheritances, and the conditions she may put upon them in the exercise of that power. And this is prominent in the decision of the supreme court. In considering this power, and classification in the exercise of this power, the court took into account the greater control and direction the state had over domestic than over foreign corporations. It did not put out of view the uses of property expressed in the act of 1901, nor ignore the consideration that there was no necessity for a corporate agency to execute those uses. The case presented especially a comparison of the rights of corporations, but the decision was broad enough to consider natural persons. 'In laying such a tax' (an inheritance tax), the court said, 'the legislature may consider the relation which the person or corporation given the right of succession sustains to the deceased, to the property, or to the state, and may regulate the amount of the tax to be required in view of such relation, and in exercising this power may lay a tax on the right of one class of persons or corporations to take, and may deem it wise to impose no tax upon the right of other classes of persons or corporations to \n\n[203 U.S. 553, 563]\n\u00a0\n take.' A Federal court would hesitate indeed to put impediments on this power or declare invalid any classification of persons or corporations that had reasonable regard to the purposes of the state and its legislation. And it cannot be said that if a state exempt property bequeathed for charitable or educational purposes from taxation it is unreasonable or arbitrary to require the charity to be exercised or the education to be bestowed within her borders and for her people, whether exercised through persons or corporations.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","15":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBROWN v. GURNEY(1906)\nNo. 97\nArgued: Decided: April 2, 1906\n\n\n\n Brown applied for patent on a mining claim, known as the Scorpion, and Gurney adversed this application as the owner and claimant of the Hobson's Choice, as did Small, \n\n[201 U.S. 184, 185]\n\u00a0\n also, as the owner and claimant of the P. G. claim. Thereafter each brought suit in support of his adverse claim in the district court of Teller county, Colorado, The cases were tried together on an agreed statement of facts. This showed that the Scorpion, Hobson's Choice, and P. G. locations covered substantially the same tract of ground, and were all made in compliance with law, with the exception repeated in connection with each of said locations: 'Provided, however, that it is not admitted that at the time of said location the ground embraced in said location was a part of the vacant and unappropriated public domain.'\n It appeared that prior to May 28, 1895, a mining lode location called the Kohnyo was owned by the Cripple Creek Mining Company, which claim was divided into two noncontiguous tracts by the Mt. Rosa placer claim. The north end of the Kohnyo, comprising 500 feet of the claim, was where the discovery of mineral was made, and it also contained a discovery shaft and the other workings and improvements of the claim. The south end, being 700 feet in length, did not show mineral, and was without development work of any kind.\n The following diagram illustrates the situation:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The local land office permitted the claimant of the Kohnyo to enter the two tracts as one claim, but the Department ultimately refused to issue a patent for such tracts, basing the refusal upon the ground that two portions of a lode mining claim, separated by a patented placer, could not be included within one patent. The land office gave the applicant, however, the privilege to apply for a patent upon either of \n\n[201 U.S. 184, 186]\n\u00a0\n the segregated tracts, and directed that, in default of an election or appeal by the claimant within sixty days from the date of the order, the entry of that portion of the claim lying south of the Mt. Rosa claim should be canceled without further notice. This decision was rendered May 28, 1895, and no appeal was taken from it; but the claimant of the Kohnyo instituted proceedings against the claimant of the Mt. Rosa placer, the purpose of which was to secure title to the vein of the Kohnyo, which, it was claimed, passed through the portion of the placer claim which conflicted with the Kohnyo location. These proceedings were prosecuted before the Land Department, with the result that on May 7, 1898, a decision was rendered against the Kohnyo claimant's contention of a known vein in the placer conflict.\n June 14, 1898, the claimant of the Kohnyo filed in the land office a written instrument, dated June 10, by which it elected to retain and patent the north end of the Kohnyo claim, and in which it also waived any right to further question or review the decision of the Secretary of the Interior of May 7, 1898, affirming the decision of May 28, 1895\n\n\n July 15, 1898, the Commissioner of the General Land Office canceled the entry of the Kohnyo claim as to that portion south of the Mt. Rosa placer.\n May 13, 1898, Brown located this 700 feet as the Scorpion lode claim. June 23, 1898, Gurney located the same premises as the Hobson's Choice lode claim, and July 16, 1898, Small located the same ground as the P. G. lode claim. July 15 and 16, 1898, the claimant of the Scorpion filed amended and second amended certificates.\n On these facts, judgment was rendered for defendant in each case, from which plaintiffs appealed to the supreme court of the state. That court reversed the judgment in Gurney v. Brown, and entered judgment that Gurney recover the premises included in the Hobson's Choice location, and for costs; and reversed the judgment in Small v. Brown, and entered judgment 'that neither party has established any right to the \n\n[201 U.S. 184, 187]\n\u00a0\n premises in controversy,' and for costs.

Butler for Gurney.\n\n\n\n[201 U.S. 184, 189]\n\u00a0\n No brief was filed for Small.\n\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n The question in these cases, which was intended to be, and was passed upon, is when, in respect of the three locations, did the premises in controversy become subject to location?\n In the state supreme court, counsel for Brown contended that the judgment below must be affirmed because the agreed facts failed to identify the premises in dispute as part of the Kohnyo claim; did not establish the validity of that location; and did not affirmatively show that the premises, when lo- \n\n[201 U.S. 184, 190]\n\u00a0\n cated as the Scorpion, were not part of the unappropriated public domain.\n But the supreme court applied the rule that where the existence of certain facts is assumed in the trial court and the trial proceeds, without objection, on that assumption, and the case is decided in reliance thereon, neither party will be heard in the court of review to question there, for the first time, the existence of the facts, and especially not where the alleged omissions might have been supplied if called to the attention of the trial court. And properly applied it, for the identity of the ground in controversy and the validity of the original Kohnyo location were conceded by both parties; and, indeed, counsel really does not deny them as matters of fact, but simply objects that the stipulation did not include them. Moreover, we think the stipulation and exhibits attached containing the various proceedings before the Commissioner of the General Land Office and the Secretary of the Interior establish the validity of the Kohnyo location. According to that record, the Kohnyo claim had passed to final entry; this entry had been recognized by the Commissioner of the General Land Office and the Secretary; the question litigated in the Land Department for something like three years, as to the knowledge of the placer applicant at the time of his application for patent of the existence of the Kohnyo vein in the placer ground, had been decided adversely to the Kohnyo claim; the Kohnyo claimant had thereupon accepted this decision, acquiesced therein, and availed himself of the privilege extended by the Commissioner's decision of May 28, 1895, and elected to retain the northerly tract of the Kohnyo claim, which amounted to a relinquishment of the southerly tract, and the entry as to that tract was thereafter formally canceled.\n It may be added also that in adverse proceedings each party is practically a plaintiff and must show his title. Jackson v. Roby, \n109 U.S. 440\n, 27 L. ed. 990, 3 Sup. Ct. Rep. 301; Perego v. Dodge, \n163 \nU.S. 160, 167\n, 41 S. L. ed. 113, 118, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 971. By the act of Congress of March 3, 1881 (21 Stat at L. 505, chap. 140, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1431), it was provided that if, in an adverse suit, 'title to the ground \n\n[201 U.S. 184, 191]\n\u00a0\n in controversy shall not be established by either party, the jury shall so find, and judgment shall be entered according to the verdict.' Under that act it is held that before the applicant for a patent can have judgment, he must prove his claim of title to the ground. The object of the statute was, as we said in Perego v. Dodge, supra, to provide, in the case of a total failure of proof of title, for an adjudication 'that neither party was entitled to the property, so that the applicant could not go forward with the proceedings in the land office simply because the adverse claimant had failed to make out his case, if he had also failed.' 2 Lindley, Mines,  763, and cases cited.\n Of course it is essential that the date of a location the ground located on should be part of the public domain, and in the present case the specific question affirmatively raised was whether the ground in controversy was a part of the public domain at the time of the respective contested locations.\n It seems to us that when the Scorpion locator attempted to make that location he conceded the validity of the Kohnyo location and the segregation by that location from the public domain of the southerly portion of that claim, but assumed that the decision of the Secretary of May 7, 1898, operated to restore that tract to the public domain as of that date, since he relocated it on May 13, and on the following 15th of July filed an amended location. But the filing of the latter certificate did not cure the defect arising from the fact that the discovery shaft of the Scorpion was upon ground covered by the Kohnyo's claim, and the filing of the amended certificate could not perfect the Scorpion location in view of the previous location of the Hobson's Choice, which created intervening rights in favor of a third person.\n The stipulation of facts was evidently prepared in respect of the inquiry concerning the date at which the ground in controversy reverted to and became a part of the public domain, and that embraced the question whether that resulted from the decision of the Secretary of May 7, 1898; or from \n\n[201 U.S. 184, 192]\n\u00a0\n the filing by the Kohnyo claimant of its election to retain the northerly tract and relinquish the other, June 14, 1898; or upon the formal cancelation of the entry, July 15, 1898.\n Nevertheless, it is further contended that the proceedings in the Land Department between way 28, 1895, and May 7, 1898, did not suspend the operation of the decision of the Commissioner of May 28, 1895, and since by that order the Kohnyo's applicant was required to make its election within sixty days from that date, as to which end of the claim it would retain and patent, in default of which election the entry of the southerly portion became canceled, and the Kohnyo's claimant did not make such election until June, 1898, that the entry became canceled as to the ground in controversy at the expiration of sixty days from May 28, 1895, and thereupon the tract reverted to the public domain. The Land Department ruled otherwise. It treated the order of May 28, 1895, as suspended during the intermediate period, while the proceedings as to the knowledge of the placer claimant of the existence of the Kohnyo lode were pending. Manifestly because, if it was known by the placer applicant at the time of application for the patent that the Kohnyo vein extended through the placer ground, then the vein did not pass by the patent, and the Kohnyo's claimant might be entitled to patent both ends of its claims, embracing the vein and a strip through the placer location\n And when on July 15, 1898, the Department canceled the Kohnyo entry as to the tract in controversy, it was declared that: 'In view of the fact that no motion for a review of the departmental decision of May 7, 1898, affirming the decision of this office of May 28, 1895, was filed within the time prescribed by the rules of practice, the decision last mentioned became final, and it now devolves upon this office to execute the same.'\n The election, then, by the Kohnyo claimant, filed in the land office June 14, 1898, was an abandonment of the south 700 feet of the Kohnyo claim, which took effect eo instanti. Lindley, Mines,  642-644; Derry v. Ross, 5 Colo. \n\n[201 U.S. 184, 193]\n\u00a0\n 295, 300. This was voluntarily done, and took effect notwithstanding the receiver's receipt had not been formally canceled. The order of cancelation of July 15 simply recorded a pre-existing fact, and did not change the effect of the previous abandonment. By reason of that abandonment, the southerly tract, for the first time, reverted to and became a part of the public domain. And as the Hobson's Choice was the first location of the ground made after such abandonment, it follows that it was valid, and that its owner was entitled to a decision in its favor.\n We again state the dates of the respective locations. The Scorpion was located May 13, 1898. The Hobson's Choice was located June 23, 1898. The location of the P. G. was July 16. Thus it is seen that the Scorpion was attempted to be located at a time when the premises were not subject to location; that the Hobson's Choice was located when the premises had reverted to the public domain; and that the location of the P. G. was after that date.\n We have accepted the rulings of the Land Department that the Kohnyo location covered the southerly as well as the northerly end of that claim. Such was the decision of May 28, 1895, and that of the Secretary of the Interior of May 7, 1898, and the formal cancelation of July 15, 1898. In this separate distinct proceedings counsel cannot challenge these rulings. The attack is collateral and cannot be entertained. Steel v. St. Louis Smelting & Ref. Co. \n106 U.S. 447\n, 27 L. ed. 226, 1 Sup. Ct. Rep. 389; St. Louis Smelting Co. v. Kemp, \n104 U.S. 636\n, 26 L. ed. 875. True, those decisions refer to instances where the patent had issued, but the principle of freedom from collateral attack is equally applicable where final entry has been made. The final certificate issued by the receiver after the submission of final proof and payment of the purchase price, where such is required, has been repeatedly held to be for many purposes the equivalent of a patent. We are advised in argument that the patent was issued, but it is objected that though such may be the fact, it is not so stated in the facts agreed.\n The cancelation of the entry of the 700 feet did \n\n[201 U.S. 184, 194]\n\u00a0\n not rest on any defect in the original location. On the contrary, the Land Department held the proceedings sufficient to entitle the Kohnyo's claimant to proceed to patent for this particular tract if he should so elect. It was only when the Kohnyo claimant abandoned that tract by making his election that he waived his right to patent, it and permitted the receiver's receipt to be canceled to that extent.\n That cancelation did not itself operate to restore the southerly tract to the public domain, which had already taken place by the action of the Kohnyo claimant in compliance with the judgment of the Land Department.\n We concur in the conclusions of the Supreme Court of Colorado, and the judgments are affirmed. \n\n\n\n","16":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBURT v.

Smith \n203 U.S. 129\n (1906) ]\n\n\n[203 U.S. 129, 131]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Milton A. Fowler for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[203 U.S. 129, 133]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is an action for malicious prosecution, brought by the plaintiffs in error, in which the New York court of appeals ordered judgment for the defendent in error. 181 N. Y. 1, 73 N. E. 495. The suit complained of was a bill brought by the defendant in error in the United States circuit court to restrain the infringement of a registered trademark. A preliminary injunction was granted in that suit. An appeal was taken to the circuit court of appeals where the injunction was dissolved, and, the plaintiff making default at the final hearing, a decree was entered by the circuit court, expressed to be upon the merits, and dismissing the bill. The special damage alleged in the present action is the interruption of the plaintiffs' business by the injunction while it was in force.\n In the case at bar the trial court ordered a nonsuit on the ground that the granting of the injunction by the circuit court established probable cause. The principle of the decision in Crescent City L. S. L. & S. H. Co. v. Butchers' Union S. H. & L. S. L. Co. \n120 U.S. 141\n, 30 L. ed. 614, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 472, that a final decree of the circuit court has that effect, even if subsequently reversed, was thought to extend to a preliminary decree. See also Deposit Bank v. Frankfort, \n191 \nU.S. 499, 511\n, 48 S. L. ed. 276, 280, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 154. The decision of the trial court \n\n[203 U.S. 129, 134]\n\u00a0\n was reversed by the appellate division. The defendant then took the case to the court of appeals, assenting, as required, that, if the order should be affirmed, judgment absolute should be rendered against him. As we have said, the order was reversed. The ground on which a review is asked here is that the court of appeals by its reasoning implies that it finds probable cause in its own opinion that the decree in the former case was wrong, whereas not to assume it to be correct is to fail to give it the faith and credit required by Rev. Stat.  905, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 677.\n It is unnecessary to consider whether a court bound by a previous judgment would not be warranted in saying that if the question had come before it in the first instance it would have decided the case the other way, and therefore that there was probable cause for a nistake of law into which it would have fallen itself. A mistaken view of the law may constitute probable cause in some instances, as is shown by the case cited above. Probable cause does not mean sufficient cause. But this last proposition shows that the former decree could not have decided the question now before the court, and therefore that the case is not properly here. The former decree was conclusive on the merits of the suit in which it was rendered, of course (Lyon v. Perin & G. Mfg. Co. \n125 U.S. 698\n, 31 L. ed. 839, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1024), but it only decided that that suit was brought without sufficient cause. It decided nothing as to whether the plaintiff had probable cause for expecting to prevail. If the court of appeals had affirmed the judgment of the trial court for the reason that a preliminary injunction fairly obtained from any court conclusively established probable cause, or that there was no evidence of a want of it, there would have been nothing to bring here, whether that reason was right or wrong. The only ground on which our jurisdiction is maintained is that the opinion of the court of appeals shows that it gave a different and inadmissible reason for the result to which it came.\n No doubt an opinion may be resorted to for the purpose of \n\n[203 U.S. 129, 135]\n\u00a0\n showing that a court actually dealt with a question presented by the record, or that a right asserted in general terms was maintained and dealt with on Federal grounds. Missouri, K. & T. R. Co. v. Elliott, \n184 \nU.S. 530, 534\n, 46 S. L. ed. 673, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 446; San Jos e Land & Water Co. v.

Rep. 49. The record discloses no question under the Constitution or laws of the United States until we come to the assignment of errors in this court. Then it was too late. Hulbert v. Chicago, \n202 \nU.S. 275, 280\n, 50 S. L. ed. 1026, 1028, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 617. It is true that the complainants allege the decree, but that was merely to show that the litigation complained of was ended, as was required by the law of New York ( Marks v. Townsend, 97 N. Y. 590, 595), not to suggest a Federal question, which at that moment probably was not dreamed of. Even the opinion of the court of appeals, which is not part of the record in New York, does not disclose that there had been presented to it any argument or claim of right based upon the effect due to the previous final decree under the Revised Statutes, or indeed, in a specific way, upon the effect of the decree in any light. Furthermore, notwithstanding a few broad words relied upon by the plaintiffs in error, we doubt if the court of appeals meant to lay down the proposition which we have said that we would not discuss, or to go further than to decide that the whole evidence was not sufficient to entitle the plaintiffs to go to the jury in an action for malicious prosecution, as that action is limited in New York.\n It is argued that the court of appeals exceeded its functions under the Constitution of the state, and in that way denied the plaintiffs due process of law. We see no reason to think so, but with that question we have nothing to do. French v. Taylor, \n199 U.S. 274\n, 50 L. ed. 189, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 76; Rawlins v.

The accused was found guilty, and, on writ of error, the judgment was reversed by this court, and a new trial ordered, upon the ground, among others, that, according to the facts disclosed in that case, the offense charged was not committed in the state of Missouri, where the accused was tried. \n196 U.S. 283\n, 49 L. ed. 482, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 243.\n Subsequently, the defendant was tried under a new indictment (the present one) charging him with certain violations of  1782. The indictment contained eight counts. Stating the case now only in a general way, the first, second, fourth, sixth, and eighth counts charged, in substance, that the defendant, a Senator of the United States, had agreed to receive compensation, namely, the sum of $2,500, for services to be rendered by him for the Rialto Grain & Securities Company, a corporation ( to be hereafter called the Rialto Company), in relation to a proceeding, matter, and thing, in which the United States was interested, before the Postoffice Department, those counts differing only as to the nature of the interest which the United States had in such proceeding, matter, and thing; some of the counts alleging that the United States was directly, others that it was indirectly, interested in such proceeding, matter, and thing. The third, fifth, and seventh counts charged that the defendant did receive compensation to the amount of $500 for the services alleged to have been so rendered by him, those three counts differing only as to the nature of the interest, whether direct or indirect, which the United States had in the alleged proceeding, matter, and thing before the Postoffice Department. \n\n[202 U.S. 344, 361]\n\u00a0\n The defendant demurred to each count. The government, at that stage of the prosecution, dismissed the indictment as to the fourth and fifth counts and the court overruled the demurrer as to all the other counts. The accused filed a plea in bar to the third and seventh counts. To that plea the government filed an answer, to which we will advert hereafter. A demurrer to that answer was overruled, and, defendant declining to plead further, the plea in bar was denied. He was then arraigned, tried, and found guilty on the first, second, third, sixth, seventh, and eighth counts. No judgment or sentence was pronounced on the first, second, and eighth counts, because they covered the transaction and offense mentioned in the sixth count. And as the third count covered the transaction and offense embraced by the seventh count, no judgment or sentence was pronounced on it.\n On the sixth count the defendant was sentenced to be imprisoned for six months in the county jail and to pay a fine of $2,000; on the seventh, to be imprisoned for six months in the county jail and fined $500. It was declared or recited in the judgment on each of those counts that the accused, by his conviction, 'is rendered forever hereafter incapable of holding any office of honor, trust, or profit under the government of the United States.'\n It will be well to bring out fully the allegations of the two counts upon which the sentences were based. They will show the nature of the proceeding, matter, or thing before the Postoffice Department, in respect of which the defendant was indicted.\n The sixth count alleged that on the 18th day of November, 1902, the defendant was a Senator of the United States from the state of Kansas, having been theretofore elected for a term of six years, expiring on the 4th day of March, 1907, and the Rialto Company was a corporation engaged in the business of buying, selling, and dealing in grain and securities, having its principal offices at the city of St. Louis, Missouri; that before and on the above day there was pending before \n\n[202 U.S. 344, 362]\n\u00a0\n the Postoffice Department of the United States, and before the then Postmaster General of the said United States, a certain proceeding in which the United States was then indirectly interested, for determining the question whether that corporation was engaged in conducting a scheme for obtaining money through the mails of the said United States, by means of false and fraudulent pretenses, representations, and promises, made by the said corporation, and whether the said Postmaster General should instruct the postmaster at the postoffice at St. Louis, the same then being a postoffice at which registered letters were then arriving, directed to the said corporation, to return all such letters to the postmasters at the several postoffices at which they were or should thereafter be originally mailed, with the word 'fraudulent' plainly written or stamped upon the outside thereof, to be by such postmasters returned to the writers thereof under the regulations of the said Postoffice Department, and in the same manner to dispose of all other letters and matter sent by mail to the said postoffice directed to the said corporation, 'all of which the said Postmaster General might then have lawfully done, upon evidence satisfactory to him that the said corporation was engaged in conducting such a scheme to defraud as that in this count mentioned; and, further, that before and on the day in this count first aforesaid the facts pertaining to the questions in this count mentioned were under investigation by the said Postoffice Department and the said Postmaster General and, on that day, were still undetermined by the said Postmaster General. And the grand jurors aforesaid, upon their oath aforesaid, do further present that the said Joseph Ralph Burton, Senator, as in this count of this indictment aforesaid, on the said 18th day of November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and two, after his said election as such Senator, and during his continuance in office as such Senator, at St. Louis, aforesaid, in the division and district aforesaid, then well knowing the proceedings in this count mentioned, in which the United States was then indirectly interested, to be, \n\n[202 U.S. 344, 363]\n\u00a0\n as it then still was, pending as last aforesaid, before the said Postoffice Department and the said Postmaster General, and undetermined by the said Postmaster General, and then well knowing the character of that proceeding, and that the said United States was then indirectly interested in the same proceeding as last aforesaid, and then well knowing all the premises in this count set forth, unlawfully did agree with the said Rialto Grain & Securities Company, corporation as aforesaid, by and through its officers, agents, and attorneys, to receive directly from that corporation, through its officers, agents, and attorneys, certain other compensation, to wit, the sum of $2,500, lawful money of the said United States, for certain services to be rendered by him, the said Joseph Ralph Burton, to the said corporation, in relation to the last-mentioned proceeding, in which the said United States was then indirectly interested as aforesaid, before the said Postoffice Department and before the said Postmaster General, while the same proceeding was and should still be pending before the said Postoffice Department and the said Postmaster General, and still undetermined by the said Postmaster General, and after his, the said Joseph Ralph Burton's, said election as such Senator, and during his continuance in office as such Senator,-that is to say, services consisting of his, the said Joseph Ralph Burton's, appearing before the said Postoffice Department and before the said Postmaster General, the Chief Postoffice Inspector, and the Assistant Attorney General for said Postoffice Department, and other officers of said Postoffice Department, as an agent of, and attorney for, the said corporation, and obtaining information for said corporation concerning said proceeding in this count mentioned, in which the United States was then indirectly interested, and by the influence of his presence and of his office as such Senator, and by statements, representations, and persuasion, inducing the said Postmaster General to believe that the said corporation was not conducting any such scheme to defraud as that last above mentioned, and to \n\n[202 U.S. 344, 364]\n\u00a0\n put a stop to any further investigation of the questions in this count mentioned by the said Postoffice Department and by the said Postmaster General, and to refrain from determining the same adversely to the interests of the said corporation, and from instructing the said postmaster at the said postoffice at St. Louis aforesaid to return the registered letters, and other letters and matter sent by mail aforesaid to the postmasters at the postoffices at which they were or should thereafter be originally mailed as aforesaid, with the word 'fraudulent' plainly written or stamped upon the outside thereof, as aforesaid, to be by such postmasters returned to the writers thereof as aforesaid, and also from forbidding the payment to the said corporation, by the said postmaster at the postoffice at St. Louis aforesaid, of postal money orders drawn to its order, or in its favor. And so the grand jurors aforesaid, upon their oath aforesaid, do say that the said Joseph Ralph Burton, at the time and place, and in manner and form in this count of this indictment aforesaid, unlawfully did offend against  1782 of the Revised Statutes of the said United States, against the peace and dignity of the said United States.'\n The seventh count alleged 'that on the said 26th day of March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and three, the said Joseph Ralph Burton, then still being a Senator of the said United States for the said state of Kansas, as in the sixth count of this indictment set forth, and having, after his election as such Senator, and during his continuance in office, to wit, on divers days between the said 18th day of November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and two, and the said 26th day of March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and three, rendered the services in the said sixth count described, to the corporation in that count mentioned, before the Postmaster General of the said United States and before the said Postoffice Department, and the same having been, as he, the said Joseph Ralph Burton, when so rendering the same, well knew, services in relation to the \n\n[202 U.S. 344, 365]\n\u00a0\n proceeding described in the said sixth count, in which the said United States was indirectly interested, pending, as he, the said Joseph Ralph Burton also well knew, before the said Postoffice Department and Postmaster General, unlawfully did, after his said election and during his continuance in office, at St. Louis aforesaid, in the said eastern division of the said eastern district of Missouri, receive directly from the said corporation, through its officers, agents, and attorneys, certain compensation for the same services, that is to say $500; he, the said Joseph Ralph Burton, when so receiving such compensation for the said services, well knowing the same to have been services in relation to a proceeding pending before a department and before an officer of the government of the said United States, and well knowing the said proceeding to have been a proceeding in which the said United States was indirectly interested, and one pending before the said Postoffice Department and Postmaster General, and undetermined by the said Postmaster General, as in the said sixth count is more fully set forth: against the peace and dignity of the said United States, and contrary to the form of the statute of the same in such case made and provided.'\n Motions for new trial and in arrest of judgment having been denied the case was brought here upon writ of error.\n\n 1. \nThe first question to be considered is whether  1782 is repugnant to the Constitution of the United States. This question has been the subject of extended discussion by counsel. But we cannot doubt the authority of Congress by legislation to make it an offense against the United States for a senator, after his election and during his continuance in office, to agree to receive or to receive compensation for services to be rendered or rendered to any person, before a department of the government, in relation to a proceeding, matter, or thing in which the United States is a party or directly or indirectly interested.\n The principle that underlies  1782 is not wholly new in our legislative history. For instance, by the act of March 3d, \n\n[202 U.S. 344, 366]\n\u00a0\n 1863 (12 Stat. at L. 765, chap. 92, Rev. Stat. 1058, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 731), it was declared that members of Congress shall not practise in the court of claims. Later, Congress by statute declared that no member of, or delegate to, Congress, shall, directly or indirectly, himself or by any other person in trust for him, or for his use or benefit, or on his account, undertake, execute, hold, or enjoy, in whole or in part, any contract or agreement made or entered into in behalf of the United States, by any officer or person authorized to make contracts on behalf of the United States; and every person violating this section was to be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and fined $3,000. Rev. Stat. 3739, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2508.\n Counsel for the accused insists that  1782 is in conflict with the fundamental idea of the Federal system; namely, that the government is one 'of limited powers, with duties and restrictions imposed, and no authority is lodged anywhere to change those duties or restrictions, except the power reserved by the people.' The proposition here stated is certainly not to be disputed; for it is settled doctrine, as declared by Chief Justice Marshall, and often repeated by this court, that 'the government, then, of the United States, can claim no powers which are not granted to it by the Constitution, and the powers actually granted must be such as are expressly given or given by necessary implication.' Martin v. Hunter, 1 Wheat. 304, 343, 4 L. ed. 97, 107. We do not, however, perceive that there has been in the statute before us any departure from that salutary doctrine.\n It is said that the statute interferes, or, by its necessary operation, will interfere, with the legitimate authority of the Senate over its members, in that a judgment of conviction under it may exclude a Senator from the Senate before his constitutional term expires; whereas, under the Constitution, a Senator is elected to serve a specified number of years, and the Senate is made by that instrument the sole judge of the qualifications of its members, and, with the concurrence of two thirds, may expel a Senator from that body. In our judgment \n\n[202 U.S. 344, 367]\n\u00a0\n there in no necessary connection between the conviction of a Senator of a public offense prescribed by statute and the authority of the Senate in the particulars named. While the framers of the Constitution intended that each department should keep within its appointed sphere of public action, it was never contemplated that the authority of the Senate to admit to a seat in its body one who had been duly elected as a Senator, or its power to expel him after being admitted, should, in any degree, limit or restrict the authority of Congress to enact such statutes, not forbidden by the Constitution, as the public interests required for carrying into effect the powers granted to it. In order to promote the efficiency of the public service and enforce integrity in the conduct of such public affairs as are committed to the several departments, Congress, having a choice of means, may prescribe such regulations to those ends as its wisdom may suggest, if they be not forbidden by the fundamental law. It possesses the entire legislative authority of the United States. By the provision in the Constitution that 'all legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States,' it is meant that Congress-keeping within the limits of its powers and observing the restrictions imposed by the Constitution-may, in its discretion, enact any statute appropriate to accomplish the objects for which the national government was established. A statute like the one before us has direct relation to those objects, and can be executed without in any degree impinging upon the rightful authority of the Senate over its members or interfering with the discharge of the legitimate duties of a Senator. The proper discharge of those duties does not require a Senator to appear before an executive department in order to enforce his particular views, or the views of others, in respect of matters committed to that department for determination. He may often do so without impropriety, and, so far as existing law is concerned, may do so whenever he chooses, provided he neither agrees to receive nor receives compensation for such services. Congress, when passing this statute, knew, as, indeed, \n\n[202 U.S. 344, 368]\n\u00a0\n everybody may know, that executive officers are apt, and not unnaturally, to attach great, sometimes, perhaps, undue, weight to the wishes of Senators and Representatives. Evidently the statute has for its main object to secure the integrity of executive action against undue influence upon the part of members of that branch of the government, whose favor may have much to do with the appointment to, or retention in, public position of those whose official action it is sought to control or direct. The evils attending such a situation are apparent and are increased when those seeking to influence executive officers are spurred to action by hopes of pecuniary reward. There can be no reason why the government may not, by legislation, protect each department against such evils, indeed, against everything from whatever source it proceeds, that tends or may tend to corruption or inefficiency in the management of public affairs. A Senator cannot claim immunity from legislation directed to that end, simply because he is a member of a body which does not owe its existence to Congress, and with whose constitutional functions there can be no interference. If that which is enacted in the form of a statute is within the general sphere of legitimate legislative, as distinguished from executive and judicial, action, and not forbidden by the Constitution, it is the supreme law of the land,-supreme over all in public stations as well as over all the people. 'No man in this country,' this court has said, 'is so high that he is above the law. No officer of the law may set that law at defiance with impunity. All the officers of the government, from the highest to the lowest, are creatures of the law, and are bound to obey it.' United States v. Lee, \n106 \nU.S. 196, 220\n, 27 S. L. ed. 171, 181, 1 Sup. Ct. Rep. 240. Nothing in the relations existing between a Senator, Representative, or Delegate in Congress and the public matters with which, under the Constitution, they are respectively connected from time to time, can exempt them from the rule of conduct prescribed by  1782. The enforcement of that rule will not impair or disturb those relations or cripple the power of Senators, Representatives, or Delegates to meet all rightful \n\n[202 U.S. 344, 369]\n\u00a0\n or appropriate demands made upon them as public servants.\n Allusion has been made to that part of the judgment declaring that the accused, by his conviction, 'is rendered forever hereafter incapable of holding any office of honor, trust, or profit under the government of the United States.' That judgment, it is argued, in inconsistent with the constitutional rights of a Senator to hold his place for the full term for which he was elected, and operates of its own force to exclude a convicted Senator from the Senate, although that body alone has the power to expel its members. We answer that the above words, in the concluding part of the judgment of conviction, do nothing more than declare or recite what, in the opinion of the trial court, is the legal effect attending or following a conviction under the statute. They might well have been omitted from the judgment. By its own force, without the aid of such words in the judgment, the statute makes one convicted under it incapable forever thereafter of holding any office of honor, trust, or profit under the government of the United States. But the final judgment of conviction did not operate, ipso facto, to vacate the seat of the convicted Senator, nor compel the Senate to expel him or to regard him as expelled by force alone of the judgment. The seat into which he was originally inducted as a Senator from Kansas could only become vacant by his death, or by expiration of his term of office, or by some direct action on the part of the Senate in the exercise of its constitutional powers. This must be so for the further reason that the declaration in  1782, that anyone convicted under its provisions shall be incapable of holding any office of honor, trust, or profit 'under the government of the United States,' refers only to offices created by, or existing under the direct authority of, the national government, as organized under the Constitution, and not to offices the appointments to which are made by the states, acting separately, albeit proceeding, in respect of such appointments, under the sanction of that instrument. While the Senate, as a branch of the legislative department, \n\n[202 U.S. 344, 370]\n\u00a0\n owes its existence to the Constitution, and participates in passing laws that concern the entire country, its members are chosen by state legislatures, and cannot properly be said to hold their places 'under the government of the United States.'\n We are of opinion that  1782 does not, by its necessary operation, impinge upon the authority or powers of the Senate of the United States, nor interfere with the legitimate functions, privileges, or rights of Senators.\n\n 2. \nIt is next contended that the indictment does not present the case of a proceeding, matter, or thing in which, within the meaning of the statute, the United States was a party or interested, nor adequately state the facts constituting the offense. These objections are, we think, without merit. Our reading of the statute and the indictment leads to the opposite conclusion.\n The statute makes it an offense for a Senator, after his election, and during his continuance in office, to receive or agree to receive compensation, in any form, from any person, in relation to a proceeding, matter, or thing before a department, in which the United States is a party, or directly or indirectly interested. The scope of the statute is, in our judgment, most manifest, and the nature of the offense denounced cannot well be made clearer than it has been made by the words used to express the legislative intent. The business in respect of which the accused is charged to have both agreed to receive, and to have received, compensation, was plainly a proceeding or matter in which the United States was interested. That such proceeding or matter involved the pecuniary interests of the defendant's client is not denied. That it also involved the use of the property as well as postal facilities furnished by the United States for carrying and transporting mail matter must also be admitted. What the Postoffice Department aimed to do in the execution of the acts of Congress and the regulations established under those acts was to protect the mails of the United States from being used, in violation of law, to promote schemes for obtaining money and property by means of false and fraudulent pretenses, representations, and promises. That \n\n[202 U.S. 344, 371]\n\u00a0\n statute has its sanction in the power of the United States, by legislation, to designate what may be carried in the mails and what must be excluded therefrom; such designation and exclusion to be, however, consistent with the rights of the people as reserved by the Constitution. Ex parte Jackson, \n96 \nU.S. 727, 732\n, 24 S. L. ed. 877, 879; Re Rapier, \n143 U.S. 110\n, 36 L. ed. 93, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 374; American School of Magnetic Healing v. McAnnulty, \n187 U.S. 94\n, 47 L. ed. 90, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 33; Public Clearing House v. Coyne, \n194 \nU.S. 498, 508\n, 47 S. L. ed. 1093, 1098, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 789. In the proceeding, matter, and thing before the department, with which the defendant was connected as an attorney for a corporation immediately concerned in the result, the Postmaster General represented the United States, and, in the discharge of his official duties, sought to enforce a law of the United States. The United States was the real party in interest on one side, while the Rialto Company was the real party in interest on the other side. If the Postmaster General did not represent the United States, whom did he represent? The word 'interested' has different meanings, as can be readily ascertained by examining books and the adjudged cases. 4 Words & Phrases Judicially Defined, 3692; Stroud's Judicial Dictionary, 399. But its meaning here is to be ascertained by considering the subject-matter of the statute in which the word appears. And it is, we think, a mistake to say that the United States was not interested, directly or indirectly, in protecting its property, that is, its mails and postal facilities, against improper and illegal use, and in the enforcement, through the agency of one of its departments, of a statute regulating such use. It would give too narrow an interpretation to the statute to hold that the United States was not interested, directly or indirectly, in a proceeding in the department having such objects in view. It is true the business before the Postoffice Department in which the Rialto Company was concerned did not assume the form of a suit in which there were parties according to the technical rules of pleading. But it was, nevertheless, in a substantial sense, a proceeding, matter, or thing before an executive department, in which both the United States and the Rialto Company were interested. \n\n[202 U.S. 344, 372]\n\u00a0\n It is said that, within the meaning of the statute, the United States is not interested in any proceeding or matter pending before an executive department, unless it has a direct moneyed or pecuniary interest in the result. Under this view, Senators, Representatives, and Delegates in Congress who are members of the bar may regularly practise their profession for compensation before the executive departments in proceedings which, if not directly involving the pecuniary interests of the United States, yet involve substantial pecuniary interests for their clients as well as the enforcement of the laws of the United States, enacted for the protection of the rights of the public. Such a view rests upon an interpretation of the statute which is wholly inadmissible. In our opinion,  1782 excludes the possibility of such a condition of things, and makes it illegal for Senators, Representatives, or Delegates to receive, or agree to receive, compensation for such services. We may add that the judgment in Burton v. United States, \n196 U.S. 283\n, 49 L. ed. 482, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 243, proceeded upon the ground that the case then made- and the present case, as to the facts, is much stronger against the defendant-was embraced by the statute.\n It is equally true that the accused was informed with reasonable certainty by the indictment of the nature and cause of the accusation against him,-the two counts hereinbefore given at large, and upon which sentences were pronounced, being as full as any of the others. The averments of the indictment were sufficient to enable the defendant to prepare his defense, and, in the event of scquittal or conviction, the judgment could have been pleaded in bar of a second prosecution for the same offense. The accused was not entitled to more, nor could he demand that all the special or particular means employed in the commission of the offense should be more fully set out in the indictment. The words of the indictment directly, and without ambiguity, disclosed all the elements essential to the commission of the offense charged, and, therefore, within the meaning of the Constitution, and according to the rules of pleading, the defendant was informed of the nature and cause of the \n\n[202 U.S. 344, 373]\n\u00a0\n accusation against him. United States v. Simmons, \n96 \nU.S. 361, 362\n, 24 S. L. ed. 820; United States v. Carll, \n105 U.S. 611\n, 26 L. ed. 1135; Blitz v. United States, \n153 \nU.S. 308, 315\n, 38 S. L. ed. 725, 727, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 924.\n\n 3. \nIt is insisted, however, that the court below erred in not directing the jury to acquit the defendant; in other words, that the evidence in support of the indictment was so meager that the jury could not properly have found him guilty of any offense. We cannot assent to this view. There was, beyond question, evidence tending to establish on one side the defendant's guilt of the charges preferred against him; on the other side, his innocence of those charges. It will serve no useful purpose to set out all the testimony. It is sufficient to say that the whole evidence has been subjected to the most careful scrutiny, and our conclusion is that the trial court was not authorized to take the case from the jury and direct a verdict of not guilty. That course could not have been pursued consistently with the principles that underlie the system of trial by jury. The case was pre-eminently one for the determination of a jury. It was for the jury to pass upon the facts; and, as there was sufficient evidence to go to the jury, this court will not weigh the facts, and determine the guilt or innocence of the accused by the mere preponderance of evidence, but will limit its decision to questions of law. In its charge to the jury the circuit court held the scales of justice in even balance, saying all that was necessary to guard the rights of the accused. Nothing seems to have been omitted that ought to have been said nor anything said that was not entirely appropriate. Upon the general question of guilt or innocence, and as to the rules by which the jury should be guided in their consideration of the case, the circuit court, in substance, said that the indictment was not evidence in any sense, but only an accusation which it was incumbent upon the government to sustain by proof establishing guilt beyond a reasonable doubt; that the presumption of law was that he was innocent of the accusation as a whole and as to every material element of it, and that such presumption abided with him from the beginning to the end of \n\n[202 U.S. 344, 374]\n\u00a0\n the trial, and required, at the hands of the jury, an acquittal, unless a careful, intelligent, fair consideration of the whole evidence, attended by the presumption of innocence, produced in the mind, beyond a reasonable doubt, the conviction that the defendant was guilty; and that they, the jury, were the sole judges of the credibility of the witnesses and of the weight to be attached to their testimony.\n The circuit court was equally direct and impartial in what it said in relation to the particular issues of fact raised by the indictment and evidence. After explaining the nature of the proceeding before the Postoffice Department, in respect of which, the indictment alleged, the defendant acted as counsel for the Rialto Company, for compensation received and to be received, and after referring, with some fullness, to the specific charges in the several counts, the court called attention to the questions that were common to all the counts. It said to the jury: 'Was the defendant a Senator of the United States for the state of Kansas during the times covered by the transactions under investigation? It is admitted that he was, and therefore you will have no difficulty in determining that. Was the Rialto Grain & Securities Company an existing corporation carrying on business of the character described during the times covered by the transactions under investigation? There was proof that it was, and no proof to the contrary, so you will have no difficulty with that. Was a proceeding pending before the Postoffice Department from November 18th, 1902, to March 26th, 1903, to determine whether or not a fraud order should be issued against that company? If the evidence shows that the officers of the Postoffice Department, at the instance of private individuals or otherwise, had, before that time, set on foot an inquiry to determine whether or not satisfactory evidence existed that the Rialto Grain & Securities Company was engaged in conducting a scheme or device for obtaining money through the mails by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, as charged in the indictment; and if the evidence further shows that that inquiry had \n\n[202 U.S. 344, 375]\n\u00a0\n not been concluded, and was, during the period named, in the charge of any of the officers of the Postoffice Department then charged with the performance of any duty in respect of such inquiry,-then I charge you that there was such a pending proceeding before the Postoffice Department, as described in the indictment, and is referred to in the statutes before mentioned; and also that it was a proceeding in which the United States was both directly and indirectly interested.'\n It then called the attention of the jury to the particular counts charging the defendant with having agreed with the Rialto Company to receive a stated compensation for services to be rendered in the proceeding before named. Touching those counts, the court said: 'Did he make such an agreement? That he made an agreement of some character to act as counsel for that company for a stated compensation is conceded. The real question is whether that agreement included, among other matters in relation to which he was to serve the company, the proceeding in the Postoffice Department before named. Upon that question the evidence is conflicting, and it is your duty to weigh the evidence and determine the truth. If, among other things, it was intended by the defendant and the Rialto Grain & Securities Company in making the agreement that he would, in part consideration for the compensation he was to receive, appear as agent or attorney of such company before the Postoffice Department, or any of its officers charged with any duty or having any authority over such fraud order proceeding, for the purpose or with the intent of influencing or obtaining action on their part favorable to such company in said proceeding, whether by way of stopping the investigation or ultimately preventing the issuance of a fraud order,-then I charge you that the agreement of the defendant was violative of the statute; otherwise it was not. The offense prescribed in the statute consists in the agreement to receive compensation for the rendition of such services. The mere agreement to render the services is not an offense. It is the agreement to receive compensation for the rendering of them \n\n[202 U.S. 344, 376]\n\u00a0\n which constitutes the offense. It should be carefully observed that the actual rendition of services is not a necessary element of this offense. The offense is complete and the defendant's guilt is established if the evidence shows that he made an agreement to render such services for compensation.'\n Coming then to the questions referring exclusively to the counts charging defendant with having received from the Rialto Company compensation for services rendered by him to it, the court said to the jury: 'Did he render any service for the Rialto Grain & Securities Company before the Postoffice Department in the proceeding named? On that question I charge you that if he appeared as agent or attorney of such company before the Postoffice Department, or any of its officers charged with any duty or having any authority over such fraud order proceeding, for the purpose or with the intent of influencing or obtaining action on their part favorable to such company in said proceeding, and did then, by any statement or representation respecting the business in which that company was engaged, or the manner in which it was conducting such business, endeavor to obtain any action favorable to such company on the part of the Postoffice Department, or any of its officers, in such fraud order proceeding, then he rendered service for said company within th meaning of the statute. And I further charge you that if he appeared as agent or attorney of such company before the Postoffice Department, or any of its officers charged with any duty or having any authority over such fraud order proceeding, for the purpose or with the intent of influencing them in respect of their action in said proceeding, and did then arrange with the Department, or any of its officers, that a hearing should be had in respect of such matter, and then also assured the Department, or any of its officers, that it was the purpose of said company to comply strictly with the law, and then also arranged that no action should be taken against said company in said proceeding without his being first notified thereof, that would constitute services within the meaning of the statute. Did he, at St. Louis, \n\n[202 U.S. 344, 377]\n\u00a0\n Missouri, on the 26th day of March, 1903, receive from the Rialto Grain & Securities Company any payment of money as compensation for such services?' Here the court gave instructions, seven in number, asked by the defendant. They were not objected to by the government and need not be set out.\n\n 4. \nAnother point made by defendant is that he could not legally be indicted for two separate offenses, one for agreeing to receive compensation in violation of the statute, and the other for receiving such compensation. This is an erroneous interpretation of the statute, and does violence to its words. It was certainly competent for Congress to make the agreement to receive, as well as the receiving of, the forbidden compensation, separate, distinct offenses. The statute, in apt words, expresses that thought by saying: 'No Senator . . . shall receive or agree to receive any compensation whatever, directly or indirectly, for any services rendered or to be rendered,' etc. There might be an agreement to receive compensation for services to be rendered without any compensation ever being in fact made, and yet that agreement would be covered by the statute as an offense. Or, compensation might be received for the forbidden services without any previous agreement, and yet the statute would be violated. In this case, the subject-matter of the sixth count, which charged an agreement to receive $2,500, was more extensive than that charged in the seventh count, which alleged the receipt of $500. But Congress intended to place its condemnation upon each distinct, separate part of every transaction coming within the mischiefs intended to be reached and remedied. Therefore an agreement to receive compensation was made an offense. So the receiving of compensation in violation of the statute, whether pursuant to a previous agreement or not, was made another and separate offense. There is, in our judgment, no escape from this interpretation consistently with the established rule that the intention of the legislature must govern in the interpretation of a statute. 'It is the legislature, not \n\n[202 U.S. 344, 378]\n\u00a0\n the court, which is to define a crime, and ordain its punishment.' United States v. Wiltberger, 5 Wheat. 76, 95, 5 L. ed. 37, 42; H. Hackfield & Co. v. United States, \n197 \nU.S. 442, 450\n, 49 S. L. ed. 826, 829, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 456.\n\n 5. \nThe defendant invokes the protection of that clause of the Constitution of the United States which declares that no person 'shall be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.' The question arose in this way:\n The first and second counts of the indictment in the former case charged that the defendant, in violation of the statute, and on March 26th, 1903, unlawfully, knowingly, wilfully, and corruptly took, accepted, and received $500 'from the Rialto Grain & Securities Company,' for services rendered in its behalf in a matter before the Postoffice Department in which the United States was interested. Those two counts differed only as to the interest, whether direct or indirect, of the United States in that matter. The third count in the former indictment charged that on March 26th, 1903, the defendant unlawfully, knowingly, wilfully, and corruptly took, accepted, and received $500 'from one W. D. Mahaney' (described as an officer and employee of the Rialto Company), as compensation for services rendered by defendant to that company in a matter before the Postoffice Department in which the United States was directly interested. The jury in the former case convicted the defendant on the first and second counts and acquitted him on the third count; in other words, they found, in effect, that he received money from the company, but not from Mahaney. Upon writ of error sued out by defendant this court reversed the judgment and sent the case back with directions for a new trial. Whether that reversal, upon defendant's own writ of error, had the effect, within the principle of Trono v. United States (recently decided) \n199 U.S. 521\n, 50 L. ed. --, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 121, to take from him the benefit of his acquittal on the third count in the former case, we need not decide. It may be assumed, for the purposes of this discussion, that it did not.\n The defendant pleaded the judgment of acquittal on the third count in the former indictment in bar of this prosecution \n\n[202 U.S. 344, 379]\n\u00a0\n as based on the third and seventh counts in the present indictment. In its answer to that plea the government alleged that, while the third and seventh counts of the present indictment are identical in legal effect with counts one and two of the former indictment, 'the offense charged against the defendant in said counts three and seven of the indictment herein is not identical in legal effect with said count three of said original indictment.' The defendant, as we have seen, demurred to the answer. The demurrer having been overruled, and the defendant declining to plead further, the plea in bar was overruled and denied.\n As no issue was taken upon the answer, by replication, the question presented is whether, upon the face of the record, as matter of law simply, the offense charged in the third and seventh counts of the present indictment is the same as that charged in the third count of the former indictment. This question must be answered in the negative, unless the charge, in the present indictment, that the money in question was received by the defendant 'from the Rialto Grain & Securities Company,' is the same, in law, as the charge, in the former indictment, that he received it 'from one W. D. Mahaney,' mentioned as an officer and employee of the Rialto Grain & Securities Company. We could not so hold, for the reason that the two charges do not necessarily import, in law, the same thing. The only support for the contrary view is found in the words, added after Mahaney's name, describing him to be an officer and employee of the Rialto Company. But those words are to be taken only as descriptive of the person, or as identifying the person from whom, it was charged, the defendant, in fact, received the money. It was not alleged in the former indictment that Mahaney paid the money to the defendant in behalf of, or by direction of, the company. This distinction was manifestly in the mind of the jury in the former case; for, while they found the defendant guilty of having received forbidden compensation from the company, they found him not guilty of having received such compensation from Mahaney. \n\n[202 U.S. 344, 380]\n\u00a0\n The defendant may have received such compensation from Mahaney, but it may not have been paid by direction of the company. So, in a legal sense, it may have been received from the company, although paid by the hands of Mahaney. It cannot be held otherwise, as matter of law, upon the face of the two indictments, apart from any evidence. And there was no evidence in support of the plea or in refutation of the answer. The defendant simply demurred to the answer, thereby admitting its averments of fact; and, without a replication, and without any evidence, rested his defense of former jeopardy upon the face of the two indictments. As the effect of the reversal of the judgment in the former case was to set aside the judgment of conviction on the first and second counts of the original indictment, the way was opened for another trial on those counts. But the government elected not to proceed under that indictment, but to have a new one embodying the same charge as to the $500 that was made in the former case. Its right to adopt that course cannot be questioned. In our judgment, the defendant cannot plead his acquittal upon the charge of having received forbidden compensation from Mahaney in bar of a prosecution upon the charge of having received such compensation from the company. A plea of autrefois acquit must be upon a prosecution for the same identical offense. 4 Bl. Com. 336. It must appear that the offense charged, using the words of Chief Justice Shaw, 'was the same in law and in fact. The plea will be vicious if the offenses charged in the two indictments be perfectly distinct in point of law, however nearly they may be connected in fact.' Com. v. Roby, 12 Pick. 502. Looking, as we must, only at the face of the original and the present indictments, the two charges must be regarded as separate and distinct. The plea of former jeopardy in this case presents a technical defense, and cannot be allowed for the reason that the offense of which the defendant was heretofore acquitted does not plainly appear, as matter of law, upon the face of the record, to be identical with the one of which he has been convicted in this case. \n\n[202 U.S. 344, 381]\n\u00a0\n If, at the trial below, under the present indictment, proof had been made that the $500 was paid by Mahaney, and that he was an officer and employee of the Rialto Company,-if the proof had gone no farther,-the jury would not have been authorized to find that the money was received from the company; whereas, the same proof would have sustained the charge in the third count of the original indictment. This shows that the two charges were not identical, in law, and that the same evidence would not have sustained each. It is well settled that 'the jeopardy is not the same when the two indictments are so diverse as to preclude the same evidence from sustaining both.' 1 Bishop, Crim. Law,  1051; Wilson v. State, 24 Conn. 57, 63, 64. For these reasons we hold that the court below properly sustained the answer to the plea, and, the defendant not pleading further, the plea in bar was properly overruled and denied.\n\n 6. \nAn important point remains to be considered. It relates to the jurisdiction of the court below to try the defendant for the crime alleged.\n The Constitution requires that the trial of all crimes against the United States shall be held in the state and the district where such crimes shall have been committed. Const. art. 3,  2, 6th Amendment. The contention of the accused is that, in no view of the evidence, can he be said to have committed any offense in the state of Missouri; consequently, the Federal court, holden at St. Louis, was without jurisdiction, under the Constitution, to try him. The contention of the government is that the alleged offense was committed at St. Louis, and that it was proper to try the defendant in the district embracing that city.\n The circuit court thus instructed the jury: 'If there was an agreement on the part of the defendant to receive compensation for services to be rendered by him in such a fraud order proceeding, was the agreement made within the jurisdiction of this court? In other words, was it made in St. Louis, Missouri? Upon this question I charge you that if such an agreement was \n\n[202 U.S. 344, 382]\n\u00a0\n negotiated or tentatively effected at some other place, but with the understanding on the part of the defendant that it should be communicated to the Rialto Grain & Securities Company at St. Louis, Missouri, to be there accepted or ratified by that company before it should become effective, and if thereafter, in pursuance of such understanding, the proposed or tentative agreement was communicated to the Rialto Grain & Securities Company at St. Louis, Missouri, and was there accepted and ratified by that company without any change in its terms, then the agreement was made at St. Louis, Missouri, and within the jurisdiction of this court. The fact that the defendant was notified of such acceptance or ratification by telegram or letter sent to him at Washington would not alter this result, if the circumstances under which the negotiations were had and the tentative agreement was made were such that it can be reasonably inferred that he contemplated and assented to notice of the acceptance of his proposition being communicated to him through that medium.'\n The jury found that the alleged agreement was consummated, that is, completed, at St. Louis. This finding was clearly justified by the evidence. There was proof that on the 17th day of November, 1902, the general counsel of the Rialto Company-while he and the accused were in Illinois, traveling together from St. Louis to Chicago-explained to the latter the affairs and condition of the company, and invited the defendant to become counsel with him for the company; that, as the result of that conference and invitation, the defendant, being in Illinois at the time, proposed or offered to become such counsel on the basis of an employment for not less than five months at a monthly salary of $500; that he was then informed that only the company could conclude an arrangement as to compensation; that he contemplated, at the time, that his offer as to employment and compensation would be submitted for him to the company at St. Louis; that, upon the return of the company's counsel to St. Louis, on the morning of November 18th, 1902, he at once communicated to the \n\n[202 U.S. 344, 383]\n\u00a0\n Rialto Company at that city, the above offer or proposal of the defendant; that the company promptly accepted the offer, of which fact the defendant was immediately informed by telegram of November 18th, 1902, sent from St. Louis, and addressed to him at Washington, by the representative of the company; that such acceptance was confirmed by a letter written and duly mailed at St. Louis on the same day, in which letter counsel, speaking for the company, said: 'I hope you received my message to the effect that this company accepts your terms to act as counsel at a salary of $500 per month, and service to begin immediately, that is, of this date, November 18, 1902;' that under date of November 20th, 1902, by letter addressed to the Rialto counsel at St. Louis, the defendant acknowledged receipt by due course of mail of the above letter of November 18th, and stated that he had called that morning at the Department, on behalf of the company, and had found that two complaints had been filed there against it, which had been sent out on November 7th for investigation; that the letter last referred to thus concluded: 'I have arranged with the Department to be advised in case any complaints are made against your company, and have arranged for a hearing if any hearing should become necessary. I have assured the Department that it is the purpose of your company to comply strictly with the law, and that it is your desire to remain at all times in perfect harmony with the Department. No action of any kind will be taken against you without my first being notified, and every opportunity for a full explanation or hearing will be had. In return, if agreeable, you may make remittance for my first month's pay.'\n The evidence further tended to show that during the five months following the acceptance of his offer at St. Louis, the defendant acted as counsel for the Rialto Company before the Postoffice Department when requested or when it was necessary, and received from the company a salary of $500 per month for his services to it,-the salary for each of the first four months being paid by the company's check, drawn at \n\n[202 U.S. 344, 384]\n\u00a0\n St. Louis upon a St. Louis bank, and made payable to the defendant's order, which check was sent from St. Louis to the defendant at Washington. The last month's salary of $500 was paid in cash to defendant at St. Louis, in the company's office, on March 26th, 1903, on which date, with his own consent he was discharged as the company's attorney, his services being no longer required. The evidence also tended to show that during the whole period of the defendant's employment and service as the company's attorney he relied or counted upon the acceptance of his offer on the 18th day of November, 1902, as evidencing an agreement then concluded between him and the company in respect of compensation. He received the letter of November 18th by due course of mail, and does not deny having received the telegram previously sent to him, the same day, on the same subject. Nothing was said or done by him during the whole period of his service as the company's counsel that was inconsistent with the agreement established by the evidence. All that he did, said, or wrote was consistent with the idea that he regarded the acceptance at St. Louis, of his offer, as completing the agreement between him and the company. From the time of such acceptance he was entitled, so far as the agreement was concerned, to demand, and he in fact received, the stipulated salary.\n In view of the evidence and of all the circumstances, was the jury warranted in finding that the alleged agreement was concluded at St. Louis? Manifestly so, we think. Although this is a criminal prosecution, that question must be determined by the principles recognized in the general law of contracts as to the time when an agreement between parties takes effect and becomes binding upon them. It is to be taken as settled law, both in this country and in England, in cases of contracts between parties distant from each other, but communicating in modes recognized in commercial business, that, when an offer is made by one person to another, the minds of the parties meet and a contract is to be deemed concluded, when the offer is accepted in reasonable time, either by tele- \n\n[202 U.S. 344, 385]\n\u00a0\n gram, duly sent in the ordinary way, or by letter, duly posted to the proposer, provided either be done before the offer is withdrawn, to the knowledge of, or upon notice to, the other party. A leading authority on the general subject is Tayloe v. Merchants' F. Ins. Co. 9 How. 390, 399, 400, 13 L. ed. 187, 190, 191. It appeared in that case that a fire insurance company made an offer by mail to insure property upon certain terms. The offer was accepted in a letter promptly mailed to the proper address of the company. The inquiry arose as to the time when the contract of insurance was to be deemed completed. This court held that, according to the settled principles of law governing contracts entered into by correspondence between parties distant from each other, the contract became complete when the letter accepting the offered terms was mailed, the offer not having been then withdrawn. The court said: 'We are of opinion that an offer under the circumstances stated, prescribing the terms of insurance, is intended, and is to be deemed, a valid undertaking on the part of the company, that they will be bound, according to the terms tendered, if an answer is transmitted in due course of mail, accepting them; and that it cannot be withdrawn, unless the withdrawal reaches the party to whom it is addressed before his letter of reply announcing the acceptance has been transmitted.'\n In Patrick v. Bowman, \n149 \nU.S. 411, 424\n, 37 S. L. ed. 790, 794, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 811, 866, the court, referring to the Tayloe Case, again held that when an offer is made and accepted by the posting of a letter of acceptance, the contract is complete according to the terms of the offer.\n Kent says: 'In creating the contract, the negotiation may be conducted by letter, as is very common in mercantile transactions; and the contract is complete when the answer containing the acceptance of a distinct proposition is despatched by mail or otherwise, provided it be done with due diligence, after the receipt of the letter containing the proposal, and before any intimation is received that the offer is withdrawn. Putting the answer by letter in the mail containing the acceptance, and thus placing it beyond the control of the party, is \n\n[202 U.S. 344, 386]\n\u00a0\n valid as a constructive notice of acceptance. An offer by letter, or by special agent, is an authority revocable in itself, but not to be revoked without notice to the party receiving it, and never after it has been executed by an acceptance. There would be no certainty in making contracts through the medium of the mail, if the rule were otherwise.' 2 Kent, Com. 477.\n The authorities to the same effect are too numerous to be cited, but we refer particularly to Vassar v. Camp, 11 N. Y. 441, 445; Mactier v. Frith, 6 Wend. 103, 21 Am. Dec. 262; Adams v. Lindsell, 1 Barn. & Ald. 681; Re Imperial Land Co. L. R. 7 Ch. 587; Household Fire & Carriage Acci. Ins. Co. v. Grant, L. R. 4 Exch. Div. 218; Perry v. Mt. Hope Iron Co. 15 R. I. 380, 381, 2 Am. St. Rep. 902, 5 Atl. 632; Wheat v. Cross, 31 Md. 103, 1 Am. Rep. 28; Averill v. Hedge, 12 Conn. 424; Chiles v. Nelson, 7 Dana, 281; Washburn v. Fletcher, 42 Wis. 152; Minnesota Linseed Oil Co. v. Collier White Lead Co. 4 Dill. 434, Fed. Cas. No. 9,635; Maclay v. Harvey, 32 Am. Rep. 40 note and authorities cited (90 Ill. 525); Levy v. Cohen, 4 Ga. 1, 13; Falls v. Gaither, 9 Port. (Ala.) 605, 612; 2 Redf. Railways, 338, 339; Pom. Contr. 95; 1 Parsons, Contr. 9th ed. 483; 2 Parsons, Contr. 257, note; Metcalf, Contr. 17; Thompson, Electricity,  425-478; Scott & J. Telegraphs,  295 et seq.; Addison, Contr. 16, 17. Whether the acceptance by the Rialto Company of the defendant's offer is to be regarded as effectively made by the telegram duly sent to him, or only when the letter addressed to him by the Rialto counsel was duly mailed at St. Louis, or in both ways, in any event, the acceptance promptly and adequately occurred on the 18th of November, 1902, at St. Louis, on which day and at which place it is to be deemed that the minds of the parties met, the agreement becoming complete the moment of the acceptance of defendant's offer, without the necessity of formal notice to the company that Burton had received information of its acceptance of his offer.\n But this, the defendant insists, is not enough to show that \n\n[202 U.S. 344, 387]\n\u00a0\n the alleged offense was committed at St. Louis. Counsel would seem to contend that the physical absence of the accused from St. Louis, when the offer was received by the company and when the agreement was concluded, rendered it impossible that he could have committed the alleged offense at that city. In substance, the contention is that an individual could not, in law or within the meaning of the Constitution, commit a crime within a state in which he is not physically present at the time the crime is committed.\n The constitutional requirement is that the crime shall be tried in the state and district where committed; not necessarily in the state or district where the party committing it happened to be at the time. This distinction was brought out and recognized in Re palliser (Palliser v. United States) \n136 \nU.S. 257, 265\n, 34 S. L. ed. 514, 517, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1034. Palliser was indicted in the district court of the United States for the district of Connecticut for violating certain statutes relating to the disposal of postage stamps, and forbidding postmasters not only to dispose of postage stamps in the payment of debts or in the purchase of commodities, or to pledge them, but also to sell or dispose of them except for cash. By letter written and mailed at New York and addressed to a postmaster in Connecticut, Palliser made to that officer an offer of contract which could not have been accepted by the latter without violating the above statutes. This court held that the offer in Palliser's letter was a tender of a contract with the intent to induce the postmaster to sell postage stamps for credit, in violation of his duty, and that the case, therefore, came within  5451 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3680), providing that 'every person who promises, offers, or gives, or causes or procures to be promised, offered, or given, any money or other thing of value, or makes or tenders any contract, undertaking, obligation, gratuity, or security for the payment of money, or for the delivery or conveyance of anything of value to any officer of the United States, . . . with intent to influence him to commit or aid in committing, or to collude in or allow any fraud, or make opportunity for the commission of any fraud on the United States, \n\n[202 U.S. 344, 388]\n\u00a0\n or to induce him to do or omit to do any act in violation of his lawful duty, shall be punished' by fine and imprisonment.\n The question arose whether Palliser, who did not go into Connecticut, could be punished in that state for the offense alleged against him. This court, speaking by Mr. Justice Gray, said: 'The petitioner relies on those provisions of the Constitution of the United States which declare that in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall have the right to be tried by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been conmmitted. Art. 3,  2; Amendments, art. 6. But the right thereby secured is not a right to be tried in the district where the accused resides, or even in the district in which he is personally at the time of committing the crime, but in the district 'wherein the crime shall have been committed.' . . . When a crime is committed partly in one district and partly in another, it must, in order to prevent an absolute failure of justice, be tried in either district, or in that one which the legislature may designate; and Congress has accordingly provided, that 'when any offense against the United States is begun in one judicial district and completed in any other it shall be deemed to have been committed in either, and may be dealt with, inquired of, tried, determined, and punished in either district, in the same manner and as if it had been actually and wholly committed therein.' Rev. Stat.  731, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 585.' In that case the court said it was universally admitted that when a shot fired in one jursidiction strikes a person in another jurisdiction, the offender may be tried where the shot takes effect.\n If the sending by the defendant to the Rialto Company from Chicago to St. Louis of the offer above referred to was the beginning of negotiations for an agreement in violation of  1782, the agreement between the parties was completed at the time of the acceptance of the defendant's offer at St. Louis on November 18th, 1902. Then the offense was committed, and it was committed at St. Louis, notwithstanding the defendant was not personally present in Missouri when his offer was accepted and the agreement was completed. \n\n[202 U.S. 344, 389]\n\u00a0\n The principle announced in Palliser's case was reaffirmed in Horner v. United States, \n143 U.S. 207\n, 36 L. ed. 126, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 407, in which it was held that the district court of the United States in Illinois had jurisdiction to try one charged with having violated the statute relating to the sending of lottery matter in the mails, in that he had unlawfully caused to be delivered to a certain person in that district lottery circulars conveyed by mail in a sealed letter that he had deposited in the mail at New York, addressed to and to be delivered to such person in Illinois. The fact that the accused was in New York when the lottery circulars were mailed, and not personally present in Illinois when the offense was completed by the delivery there of the lottery circulars to the person to whom they were sent, was held to be immaterial, and not to defeat the jurisdiction of the Federal court in Illinois to try the accused.\n It cannot be maintained, according to the adjudged cases, that the personal absence of the defendant Burton from St. Louis, at the time his offer was accepted, and when the agreement between him and the company was completed and became binding, as between the parties, deprived the Federal court there of jurisdiction. He sent his offer to St. Louis with the intent that it should be there accepted and consummated. Having been completed at that city in conformity with the intention of both parties, an offense was, in the eye of the law, committed there; and when the court below assumed jurisdiction of this case it did not offend the constitutional requirement that a crime against the United States shall be tried in the state and district where it was committed.\n Other questions were discussed by counsel, but we have alluded to all involving the substantial rights of the accused that are mentioned in their briefs of points and authorities, and which we deem it necessary to notice.\n Mr. Justice McKenna concurs in the judgment based on the count charging the receipt of forbidden compensation, but does not concur in the judgment on the count charging simply an agreement to receive compensation. He is of opinion that \n\n[202 U.S. 344, 390]\n\u00a0\n the agreement to receive and the receipt of compensation constitute, under the circumstances of this case, but one offense.\n Judgment affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer, dissenting:\n A conviction of plaintiff in error on an indictment charging substantially the same offenses as are charged in the present case was reversed by this court. \n196 U.S. 283\n, 49 L. ed. 482, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 243. In the opinion then filed it was stated that four Justices of this court ( the writer of this being among the number) were of the opinion that the matters charged against the defendant were not made offenses by the statute under which the indictment was found. Nothing was said in that opinion in respect to this matter beyond the simple statement of the conclusions of the several Justices. As one of the four, I think the importance of the case justifies me in stating the reasons which led to that conclusion, and which induces belief that the present conviction is wrongful.\n The statute (Rev. Stat.  1782, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1212) forbids a Senator or other official of the government to 'receive or agree to receive any compensation whatever, directly or indirectly, for any services rendered, or to be rendered, to any person, either by himself or another, in relation to any proceeding, contract, claim, controversy, charge, accusation, arrest, or other matter or thing in which the United States is a party, or directly or indirectly interested, before any department, courtmartial, bureau, officer, or any civil, military, or naval commission whatever.' It was charged in the indictment that there was pending in the Postoffice Department a proceeding to inquire whether the Rialto Grain & Securities Company was conducting a scheme for obtaining money by false pretenses through the mails of the United States, and whether a fraud order, as it is called, should be issued against said company, and that the defendant, as a Senator of the United States, unlawfully agreed to \n\n[202 U.S. 344, 391]\n\u00a0\n receive from the said corporation compensation for services rendered by him in relation to such proceeding before that Department. It was not charged that the United States was a party to the proceeding, nor that it would either make or lose any money or property, whatever might be the result, but only that it was directly and indirectly interested. The question is therefore distinctly presented whether a proceeding in one of the departments of the government, in which it does not appear that the United States is pecuniarly interested in the result, will neither make nor lose by the issue of the proceeding, whatever it may be, is one in which it is 'directly or indirectly interested.' Unless the statute, by clear intendment, includes the transaction, any extension beyond its meaning so as to include the transaction would be, under the elementary rule governing the interpretation of criminal statutes, simply judicial legislation, as it would be, by judicial construction, making that a crime which Congress has not so made, and thereupon imposing punishment. United States v. Wiltberger, 5 Wheat. 77, 5 L. ed. 37; Sarlls v. United States, \n152 U.S. 570\n, 38 L. ed. 556, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 720;United States v. Harris, \n177 U.S. 305\n, 44 L. ed. 780, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 609. There is a certain broad sense in which the word 'interest' is sometimes used, which describes the relation which the government has to the acts of all its officials, to all proceedings in courts or in departments, and, indeed, to the conduct of all its citizens. It is interested in seeing justice and righteousness obtain everywhere. It is interested in seeing that no wrongful conduct shall prevail. But so is every official and every citizen interested. It is not an interest which separates and distinguishes the government from the citizens, but it is that interest which all have, whether government or citizens, in the orderly and just management of affairs, in honorable and right living. It is that interest which a father or head of a family has in the good conduct of all the members of his family. But the word 'interest' as found in the law books refers to pecuniary profit and loss, and that Congress used the word 'interested' in its common legal acceptation is as clear and certain as anything can be. \n\n[202 U.S. 344, 392]\n\u00a0\n It is well to inquire in the first place whether the word 'interest' or 'interested' has a settled legal meaning. A leading case is that of Northampton v. Smith, 11 Met. 390, in which was involved the construction of a statute of Massachusetts which provided that, when a judge of probate was interested in any case within his jurisdiction, the case should be transferred to the most ancient adjoining county. The probate judge transferred the case on the ground that he was one of the inhabitants of the town of Amherst, and that there were in the will which was offered for probate many bequests to charitable purposes for the benefit of persons described as dwelling in the eight towns enumerated, of which Amherst was one. Mr. Chief Justice, Shaw, delivering the opinion of the court, said (p. 394):\n'If the term 'interest' were used in the loose sense it sometimes is, consisting in a strong and sincere desire to promote all enterprises for the advancement of learning, philanthropy, and general charity, or a similar interest, with all good men, to repress and put down pernicious and mischievous schemes, no man could be found fit to be intrusted with the administration of justice; for no man can be exempt from such interests.'\n\n And again (p. 395):\n'2. It must be a pecuniary or proprietary interest, a relation by which, as a debtor or creditor, an heir or legatee, or otherwise, he will gain or lose something by the result of the proceedings, in contradistinction to an interest of feeling, or sympathy or bias, which would disqualify a juror. Smith v. Bradstreet, 16 Pick. 264.\n\n'3. It must be certain, and not merely possible or contingent. Hawes v. Humphrey, 9 Pick. 350, 20 Am. Dec. 481; Wilbraham v. Hampden County, 11 Pick. 322, Danvers v. Essex County, 2 Metc. 185. It must be direct and personal, though such a personal interest may result from a relation which the judge holds as the member of a town, parish, or other corporation, \n\n[202 U.S. 344, 393]\n\u00a0\n where it is not otherwise provided by law, if such corporation has a pecuniary or proprietary interest in the proceedings.\n\n'It may be, and probably is, very true, as the human mind is constituted, that an interest in a question or subject-matter, arising from feeling and sympathy, may be more efficacious in influencing the judgment than even a pecuniary interest; but an interest of such a character would be too vague to serve as a test by which to decide so important a question as that of jurisdiction; it would not be capable of precise averment, demonstration, and proof; not visible, tangible, or susceptible of being put in issue and tried; and therefore not certain enough to afford a practical rule of action.'\n\n In McGrath v. People, 100 Ill. 464, it was held that:\n'The state is not 'interested, as a party or otherwise,' in a proceeding in the nature of a quo warranto to try the title of a person to an office into which it was alleged he had intruded, in any such sense as would give to the supreme court jurisdiction to hear an appeal in such a proceeding directly from the trial court, under  88 of the practice act. The interest which the state must have in a cause, within the meaning of this section, in order to entitle either party to bring it directly to the supreme court from the trial court, is a substantial interest,-as, a monetary interest.'\n\n In Evans v. Eaton, 7 Wheat. 356, 5 L. ed. 472, a patent case, the question was whether a certain witness was competent, the alleged objection being that he was interested, because he might use the alleged invention if the patent was adjudged void, and Mr. Justice Story, speaking for the court, said (p. 425, L. ed. p. 489):\n'The special notice in this case asserts matter which, if true, and found specially by the jury, might authorize the court to adjudge the patent void; and it is supposed that this constitutes such an interest in Frederick in the event of the cause that he is thereby rendered incompetent. But, in this respect, Frederick stands in the same situation as every other person in the community. If the patent is declared void, the in- \n\n[202 U.S. 344, 394]\n\u00a0\n vention may be used by the whole community, and all persons may be said to have an interest in making it public property. But this results from a general principle of law, that party can take nothing by a void patent; and, so far as such an interest goes, we think it is to the credit, and not to the competency, of the witness.'\n\n In State v. Sutton, 74 Vt. 12, 52 Atl. 116, the case and the ruling is disclosed by the following quotation from the opinion:\n'This is an indictment under  5072 of the Vermont statutes, for defaming this court and a judgment thereof, and the judges of the court as to said judgment. It is objected that Judge Watson, who sat below, was disqualified by reason of interest in the event of the cause or matter, for that he is one of the judges alleged to have been defamed. It is a pecuniary interest that disqualifies, and Judge Watson is no more interested in this case in that respect than he is in every other criminal case that he tries, and that interest is too small for the law's notice. State v. Batchelder, 6 Vt. 479. It is said that a judge defamed would be deeply interested to have the respondent convicted, not only that he might be severely punished, but also for the aid it might afford him in the prosecution and maintenance of a civil action for damages. But such an interest does not disqualify.'\n\n In Foreman v. Marianna, 43 Ark. 324, it was held that a judge who was a taxpayer in a town was not disqualified from sitting in a case relating to the annexation of certain territory to the town, the court saying (p. 329):\n'A general interest in a public proceeding, which a judge feels in common with a mass of citizens, does not disqualify. If it did, we might chance to have to go out of the state at times for a judge. The 'interest' which disqualifies a judge under the Constitution is not the kind of interest which one feels in public proceedings or public measures. It must be a pecuniary or property interest, or one affecting his individual rights, and the liability or pecuniary gain or relief to the judge must occur upon the event of the suit, not result re- \n\n[202 U.S. 344, 395]\n\u00a0\n motely, in the future, from the general operation of laws and government upon the status fixed by the decision.'\n\n In Taylor v. Highway Comrs. 88 Ill. 526, the question was who had the right to appeal from the decision of the commissioners of highways in laying out a new road or vacating an old one, and the court said:\n'The word 'interested' must receive a reasonable construction, such as will, on the one hand, protect those who have a direct and substantial interest in the matter, and, on the other hand, protect the commissioners missioners of highways from unnecessary litigation in defending their action as such, at the suit of persons who may imagine they have an interest, when in fact they have no such interest as was contemplated by the legislature. Every citizen of a county, in one sense, has an interest in the public highways. So, too, it may be said, and properly, that every citizen of the state has an interest in the highways in the different counties of the state. If, therefore, the language of the statute is to be interpreted literally, an appeal might be taken by any citizen of the state. But we apprehend it was not the intention of the legislature that the word 'interested' should receive such a liberal construction. It was, doubtless, intended to give the right of appeal to those persons who had a direct and pecuniary interest, not shared by the public at large,-such as owned land adjoining the new road laid out or the old one vacated.'\n\n In Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Kellogg, 54 Neb. 138, 74 N. W. 403, in deciding whether a trial judge was disqualified, this was the ruling:\n\"A judge . . . is disqualified from acting as such . . . in any case wherein he is . . . interested.' But the word 'interested,' found in this section of the statute, probably means pecuniarily interested, ested, or at least it means that a judge, to be disqualified from hearing a case, must be in such a situation with reference to it or the parties that he will gain or lose something by the result of the action on trial. It is not claimed that Judge Beall will gain or lose anything from the result of \n\n[202 U.S. 344, 396]\n\u00a0\n this action. It is not pretended that he has any pecuniary interest in the matter. The argument seems to be that, because he rendered the law judgment, he would naturally be desirous that the same should be sustained, and that, therefore, his inclination would be to defeat this suit. It can never be presumed that a judge will permit his desires or inclinations to control his decision in any manner, and that he tried the case and rendered the judgment which is sought to be vacated by this action does not render him interested and disqualified, within the meaning of said section of the statute.'\n\n See also Com. v. O'Neil, 6 Gray, 343; Sauls v. Freeman, 24 Fla. 209, 12 Am. St. Rep. 190, 4 So. 525; Bowman's Case 67 Mo. 146.\n In Bouvier's Law Dictionary, vol. 1, p. 651, 'interest' is defined:\n'The benefit which a person has in the matter about to be decided and which is in issue between the parties. By the term 'benefit' is here understood some pecuniary or other advantage, which, if obtained, would increase the witness's estate, or some loss which would decrease it.'\n\n In Black's Law Dictionary the definition is (p. 636):\n'A relation to the matter in controversy, or to the issue of the suit, in the nature of a prospective gain or loss, which actually does, or presumably might, create a bias or prejudice in the mind, inclining the person to favor one side or the other.'\n\n If the word 'interested' was not used in this section in this ordinary legal sense, the words 'in which the United States is a party or directly or indirectly interested' are surplusage, because, in respect to every proceeding before a department or other tribunal, the United States as parens patrioe has an interest, in what Chief Justice Shaw calls the 'loose' sense of the term. Indeed, what significance is there in inserting the words from 'contract' to 'interested,' inclusive, unless some distinct limitation was intended? If the language was 'in relation to any proceeding before any department, court-martial,' etc., it would express the intent to exclude \n\n[202 U.S. 344, 397]\n\u00a0\n Senators from appearance for compensation in any and all matters before the departments. Inserting the clause above referred to obviously means a limitation, and no other limitation is suggested except that which limits it to matters in which the government is pecuniarly interested. Neither do the words 'or any other matter or thing' enlarge the scope of the prohibition so as to take in matters of a different nature. The rule of construction regarding the effect of such words when following an enumeration of subjects is that they are to be held as meaning any other matter or thing of a like or similar nature to those already named, so that all subjects of that kind may be included, and none escape by reason of not being specially named. They do not open the statute to all kinds of matters or things not of the same nature as those already named. Otherwise there would be no sense in the prior enumeration. Hermance v. Ulster County, 71 N. Y. 481; People v. New York & M. B. R. Co. 84 N. Y. 565; Thames & M. Marine Ins. Co. v. Hamilton, L. R. 12 App. Cas. 484.\n Doubtless the government is charged with the supervision of the action of all its officials, but that supervision does not, of itself, create a pecuniary interest. This court has a supervising control of the lower Federal judicial tribunals. We are interested in seeing that full justice is done in all cases therein. But that duty of supervision and review creates no pecuniary interest, and does not disqualify a single one of us from participating in the consideration of this case.\n If it be said that the government is pecuniarily interested in the postage the amount of which might be affected by the issue of a fraud order, it is enough to say that there is no proof of any such interest. Further, postage is received in payment for services rendered in transportation . If no services are rendered no postage is received. The issue of a fraud order does not put a stop to the carrying of letters. It simply stops the delivery. It may be that when knowledge of the issue of a fraud order becomes widespread, the number of letters may be \n\n[202 U.S. 344, 398]\n\u00a0\n diminished, but, as heretofore said, diminishing the amount of mail matter diminishes likewise the cost thereof. The government is no more interested in an increase or diminution of the amounts received by railroad and other carriers for transporting the mails, or those received by stamp contractors for the manufacture of stamps, than it is in the fees received by marshals, clerks, and other officers for services rendered to individuals. In any event, opposing a fraud order would not, in the language of the chairman of the House Committee on the Judiciary, hereinafter quoted, be a suit against the government.\n Again, the history of the passage of the bill which culminated in this statute emphasizes the views already expressed. The bill was introduced into the Senate December 23, 1863, by Senator Wade. As prepared, it forbade the appearance of a Senator or member of the House of Representatives in any court as well as department, etc. On February 10, 1864, the Committee on the Judiciary reported in favor of striking out the following words (p. 555):\n'No member of the Senate or of the House of Representatives of the United States shall, during his continuance in office, hereafter appear or act as counsel, attorney, or agent in any cause or proceeding, civil or criminal, in any court-civil, criminal, military, or naval-or before any commission, in which the United States is a party or directly or indirectly interested, or receive any compensation of any kind, directly or indirectly, for services of any description rendered by himself or another in relation to any such cause or proceeding;'-and they were stricken out.\n\n On page 561 is this statement by Senator Trumbull, the chairman of the committee:\n'This is not a bill to prevent attorneys from practising in courts of law, but it is a bill to prevent Representatives and Senators in Congress and officers of the government, who are paid for their services, from receiving a compensation for advocating claims in the departments and before the bureaus \n\n[202 U.S. 344, 399]\n\u00a0\n of the government, and before courts-martial. That is the particular question that is pending.'\n\n On p. 2773 in the proceedings of the House it appears:\n'Mr. Wilson, from the Committee on the Judiciary, reported back Senate bill No. 28, relating to members of Congress, heads of departments, and other officers of the government. The bill was read. It prescribes penalties for members of Congress, heads of departments, or other officers engaging as attorneys or counselors in suits against the government. The bill was ordered to a third reading; and was accordingly read the third time and passed.'\n\n While much weight must not be given to the declarations of individual Senators, those which are embodied in the reports of the chairmen of the judiciary committees are certainly entitled to consideration, and they show clearly that the intent of Congress in this enactment was to prevent Senators and other officials of the government from receiving compensation for assisting in the prosecution of claims against the government. It would be the height of absurdity to suppose anyone believed that a Senator should be debarred from the right of appearing in any court in cases in which the government is without a pecuniary interest, and yet, that was the scope of the bill as originally presented, if the present construction of the statute is sustained.\n Further, while it may be true that executive officers are apt to give undue weight to the wishes of Senators, yet, there is nothing in this statute to prevent a Senator from exerting all his influence over them. He may prosecute any claims in behalf of his constituents or others, even though the government is directly and largely pecuniarily interested. He may appear in any matter or proceeding pending before one of the departments, and there is nothing in the statute to prohibit it. The only restriction is that he must himself have no pecuniary interest in the matter. The denunciation is against his receiving, or agreeing to receive, compensation for his services. Is it not reasonable to believe that, if pecuniary interest on his \n\n[202 U.S. 344, 400]\n\u00a0\n part is the only bar to his action, a like pecuniary interest on the part of the government is that interest on the other side intended by the statute?\n It is said the language of the section is 'directly or indirectly interested,' but that does not change the fact that the Government must be interested; and interested, as I have shown, refers to some pecuniary interest. It is directly interested when, as the result of the proceeding, it may make or lose some of its property, as, where a claim is prosecuted in the department for a tract of land, or for the allowance of a contract to a higher rather than to a lower bidder. It is indirectly interested when the effect of the ruling may result in pecuniary loss to the government in some other case to be thereafter presented to the department. It may be that, in a pending case, the government is guaranteed against loss, and yet, if a certain ruling is established as the ruling of the department, it may affect future cases in which there is no such indemnity to the government, and in those cases it would be indirectly interested. But whatever the line of demarcation between 'direct' and 'indirect' results, the statute is clear that the government must be 'interested.'\n Other matters of moment have been discussed by counsel, but as this is fundamental, and upon it rests the whole prosecution, I have preferred to express my views on this matter alone. It seems clear to my mind that the construction now given writes into the statute an offense which Congress never placed there. It is a criminal case, and, in such a case above all, judicial legislation is to be deprecated.\n I am authorized to say that Mr. Justice White and Mr. Justice Peckham concur in these views. \n\n\n\n","18":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBUSH v. ELLIOTT(1906)\nNo. 245\nArgued: Decided: May 21, 1906\n\n\n\n Messrs. James H. Beal, George D. Lancaster, John P. Tillman, Williams & Lancaster, Tillman, Grubb, Bradley, & Morrow, and Reed, Smith, Shaw, & Beal for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. Amos E. Goodhue for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n These cases were heard together, and concern the same question, upon practically the same facts. They involve the jurisdiction of the circuit court of the United States to entertain a suit to recover upon an alleged cause of action for moneys due the bankrupt at and prior to the adjudication in bankruptcy, where one of the trustees in bankruptcy is a citizen of the same state with the defendant, and the bankrupt a citizen of another state.\n The suits were brought by the plaintiffs as trustees in bankruptcy of the Southern Car & Foundry Company, a corporation organized under the laws of New Jersey and a citizen of \n\n[202 U.S. 477, 478]\n\u00a0\n that state, against the Elliott Car Company, a corporation and a citizen of the state of Alabama, and against J. M. Elliott, Jr., a citizen of the same state. They were to recover certain sums of money alleged to have been lent by the bankrupt, for goods sold and delivered to the defendants, and upon an account stated and for money paid for them by the bankrupt. In both cases motions to dismiss were filed upon the ground that the circuit court of the United States had no jurisdiction because Thomas G. Bush, one of the trustees in bankruptcy, is and was, at the time of the beginning of the suit, a citizen of the state of Alabama, the same state of which the defendants were citizens, and the defendants had not consented to be sued in the circuit court of the United States, in which the action was brought. The circuit court held that it had no jurisdiction and dismissed the suit.\n The correctness of the decision of the court below depends upon the construction of  23 of the bankruptcy act of 1898. [30 Stat. at L. 552, chap. 541, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3431.] This section, entitled 'Jurisdiction of the United States and State Courts,' prior to the amendment of February 5, 1903 [32 Stat. at L. 798, chap. 487, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1905, p. 686], read as follows: 'a. The United States circuit courts shall have jurisdiction of all controversies at law and in equity, as distinguished from proceedings in bankruptcy, between trustees, as such, and adverse claimants, concerning the property acquired or claimed by the trustees, in the same manner and to the same extent only as though bankruptcy proceedings had not been instituted, and such controversies had been between the bankrupts and such adverse claimants. b. Suits by the trustee shall only be brought or prosecuted in the courts where the bankrupt whose estate is being administered by such trustee might have brought or prosecuted them if proceedings in bankruptcy had not been instituted, unless by consent of the proposed defendant.' By the amendment of February 5, 1903, the following words were added to clause b: 'Except suits for the recovery of property under section sixty, subdivision b, and section sixty-seven, subdivision e.' The excepted suits, for the recovery of property, covered by the \n\n[202 U.S. 477, 479]\n\u00a0\n amendment of 1903, pertain to actions to recover property conveyed by the bankrupt in fraud of the act, and do not concern actions of the character of those now under consideration.\n Both sides cite and rely upon the case of Bardes v. First Nat. Bank, \n179 U.S. 524\n, 44 L. ed. 1175, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1000, in which case it was held that a district court of the United States had no jurisdiction of an action brought by the trustee to set aside an alleged fraudulent transfer made by the bankrupt within four months before the proceedings in bankruptcy. That case pertained to an action to set aside a fraudulent conveyance of property which had not come into the control of the bankruptcy court. In later cases it has been held that the decision did not extend to cases wherein the bankrupt court had acquired jurisdiction over the subject-matter of the property as that of the bankrupt, as to which the bankrupt courts have been held to have jurisdiction under the power conferred in subd. 7,  2, of the act. White v. Schloerb, \n178 U.S. 542\n, 44 L. ed. 1183, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1007; Bryan v. Bernheimer, \n181 U.S. 188\n, 45 L. ed. 814, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 557 (in which case the opinion was given by Mr. Justice Gray, who also delivered the opinion in the Bardes Case); and Whitney v. Wenman, \n198 U.S. 539\n, 49 L. ed. 1157, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 778.\n While the Bardes Case involved only the jurisdiction of the district court, we think the principles announced in the opinion of Mr. Justice Gray in that case, when applied to the one now under consideration, are decisive in favor of the jurisdiction of the circuit court to entertain these suits. The elaborate consideration of the history of  23 of the present bankruptcy act, given in the Bardes Case, renders it unnecessary to do more than epitomize from the opinion so much thereof as is necessary to an understanding of the question now made as to the jurisdiction of the circuit court.\n The bankruptcy act of 1898, in respect to the matters now under consideration, was a radical departure from the act of 1867 [14 Stat. at L. 517, chap. 176], in the evident purpose of Congress to limit the jurisdiction of the United States courts in respect to controversies which did not come simply within the jurisdiction of the Federal courts as bankruptcy courts, and to preserve, to a \n\n[202 U.S. 477, 480]\n\u00a0\n greater extent than the former act, the jurisdiction of the state courts over actions which were not distinctly matters and proceedings in bankruptcy. Under the act of 1867 the jurisdiction of the district and circuit courts of the United States was concurrent with the state courts of suits in law or in equity brought by or against the assignee in reference to property of the bankrupt or to claims alleged to be due from or to him. Lathrop v. Drake, \n91 U.S. 516\n, 23 L. ed. 414; Bardes v. First Nat. Bank, \n178 \nU.S. 531, 532\n, 44 S. L. ed. 1179, 1180, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1000. The intention of Congress to prevent actions not strictly proceedings in bankruptcy from coming within the jurisdiction of the United States courts, except in certain cases, was enacted into law in the section of the statute now under consideration. Of clause a, Mr. Justice Gray, speaking for the court in the Bardes Case, said:\n'The first clause provides that 'the United States circuit courts shall have jurisdiction of all controversies at law and in equity, as distinguished from proceedings in bankruptcy' (thus clearly recognizing the essential difference between proceedings in bankruptcy on the one hand, and suits at law or in equity, on the other), 'between trustees, as such, and adverse claimants, concerning the property acquired or claimed by the trustees;' restricting that jurisdiction, however, by the further words, 'in the same manner and to the same extent only as though bankruptcy proceedings had not been instituted and such controversies had been between the bankrupt and such adverse claimants.' [30 Stat. at L. 552, chap. 541,  23, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3431.] This clause, while relating to the circuit courts only, and not to the district courts of the United States, indicates the intention of Congress that the ascertainment, as between the trustee in bankruptcy and a stranger to the bankruptcy proceedings, of the question whether certain property claimed by the trustee does or does not form part of the estate to be administered in bankruptcy, shall not be brought within the jurisdiction of the national courts solely because the rights of the bankrupt and of his creditors have been transferred to the trustee in bankruptcy.'\n\n Clause a thus construed gives jurisdiction to such a con- \n\n[202 U.S. 477, 481]\n\u00a0\n troversy as the present one, for the jurisdiction is not attempted to be enlarged because of a title in the trustee derived under the bankruptcy proceedings, which it was the purpose of this clause to prevent. Loveland, Bankr. 2d ed. 105.\n The suit concerns the right to recover a money debt which is property ( Pirie v. Chicago Title & T. co. \n182 U.S. 438\n, 45 L. ed. 1171, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 906), and, in the sense of the law, is with an adverse claimant 'concerning property acquired or claimed by the trustee,' and is a controversy of which the circuit court had jurisdiction, as between the bankrupt and the claimant, but for the bankruptcy proceedings.\n The act of 1841 ( 8) gave the circuit court concurrent jurisdiction with the district court of suits at law and in equity 'which may and shall be brought by any assignee of the bankrupt against any person or persons claiming an adverse interest, or by such person against such assignee touching any property or rights of property of said bankrupt, transferable to or vested in such assignee.' [5 Stat. at L. 446, chap. 9.] It was held that the circuit court had jurisdiction to recover a debt due the bankrupt at the suit of the assignee, and that the debtor was a party claiming an adverse interest within the sense of the act. Mitchell v. Great Works Mill . & Mfg. Co. 2 Story, 648, Fed. Cas. No. 9,662; Pritchard v. Chandler, 2 Curt. C. C. 488, Fed. Cas. No. 11,436. While the phraseology of the present act is somewhat different, its provisions come to practically the same thing in this respect.\n Of clause b, in the Bardes Case, it was said:\n'But the second clause applies both to the district courts and to the circuit courts of the United States, as well as to the state courts. This appears not only by the clear words of the title of the section, but also by the use, in this clause, of the general words, 'the courts,' as contrasted with the specific words, 'the United States circuit courts,' in the first and in the third clauses.\n\n'The second clause positively directs that suits by the trustee shall only be brought or prosecuted in the courts where \n\n[202 U.S. 477, 482]\n\u00a0\n the bankrupt whose estate is being administered by such trustee might have brought or prosecuted them if proceedings in bankruptcy had not been instituted, unless by consent of the proposed defendant.'\n\n'Had there been no bankruptcy proceedings, the bankrupt might have brought suit in any state court of competent jurisdiction; or, if there was a sufficient jurisdictional amount, and the requisite diversity of citizenship existed, or the case arose under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States, he could have brought suit in the circuit court of the United States. Act of August 13, 1888, chap. 866 (25 Stat. at L. 434). He could not have sued in a district court of the United States, because such a court has no jurisdiction of suits at law or in equity between private parties, except where, by special provision of an act of Congress, a district court has the powers of a circuit court, or is given jurisdiction of a particular class of civil suits.'\n\n And after pointing out that the bankruptcy act of 1898 did not intend to confer the jurisdiction given under the former bankruptcy acts, the opinion continues:\n'Congress, by the second clause of  23 of the present bankrupt act, appears to this court to have clearly manifested its intention that controversies, not strictly or properly part of the proceedings in bankruptcy, but independent suits, brought by the trustee in bankruptcy to assert a title to money or property as assets of the bankrupt against strangers to those proceedings, should not come within the jurisdiction of the district courts of the United States 'unless by consent of the proposed defendant,' of which there is no pretense in this case.'\n\n Applying the principles thus announced, remembering that we are dealing with an action which might have been brought by the bankrupt, but for the bankruptcy proceedings, in a circuit court of the united States, we think it is apparent that this action comes within the provisions of  23 of the act of 1898. The effect of clause a, as pointed out by \n\n[202 U.S. 477, 483]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Justice Gray, is to prevent the jurisdiction of the United States circuit court from attaching because of the appointment of a trustee in bankruptcy. In other words, the jurisdiction of the United States courts was not to be extended, as had been done under the former acts, because of the institution of the proceedings in bankruptcy. Under clause b the jurisdiction of all courts is affected, and this clause pertains to suits begun by the trustee, and he is not (prior to the amendment of February 5, 1903) permitted to prosecute suits unless by the consent of the defendant, except where the bankrupt might have brought or prosecuted them if proceedings in bankruptcy had not been instituted. That is, while the jurisdiction of the courts was not to be extended because of the bankruptcy proceedings or the citizenship of the trustee, it was preserved to the trustee, in the jurisdiction where the bankrupt might have brought or prosecuted the suit but for the bankruptcy proceedings. While this section preserves the jurisdiction of the United States circuit courts over cases coming within clause a, in clause b the right of suit by the trustee is limited to courts wherein the bankrupt might have brought or prosecuted the action had the bankruptcy proceedings not been instituted.\n The case of Spencer v. Duplan Silk Co. \n191 U.S. 526\n, 48 L. ed. 287, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 174, relied upon by the counsel for defendant in error, does not militate against this construction. In that case the question was as to the right to appeal directly to this court where an action had been begun in the state court by the trustee and was removed, on the ground of diverse citizenship, to the Federal court. It was held that the jurisdiction of the circuit court was acquired because of diverse citizenship, and not under  23 of the bankruptcy act, and consequently the judgment was final in the circuit court of appeals. The same principle was recognized in Cochran v. Montgomery County, \n199 U.S. 260\n, 50 L. ed . --, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 58, decided at this term.\n The action in the present case was to recover a sum of money alleged to have been due, prior to the bankruptcy proceedings, \n\n[202 U.S. 477, 484]\n\u00a0\n to the Southern Car & Foundry Company, which was a citizen of the state of New Jersey. The amount involved and the diverse citizenship of the parties were such that the car company might have sued the defendant, a citizen of the state of Alabama, in the circuit court of the United States independently of the bankruptcy proceedings. We think, by the terms of this section, it was intended to preserve this right to the trustee in bankruptcy, and that the citizenship of the trustee is wholly immaterial to the jurisdiction of such a case.\n The Circuit Court erred in reaching the contrary conclusion, and its judgment is reversed. \n\n\n\n","19":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nC H NICHOLS LUMBER CO. v.

We pass to the merits of the case without stopping to review the grounds of the motion, as we think they will be substantially disposed of by the views which we shall hereafter express.\n By this writ of error the C. H. Nichols Lumber Company seeks the reversal of a judgment obtained by Charles Franson in the circuit court of the United States for the western district of Washington. Considering the record alone, and putting out of view for the moment the effect of statements contained in a certificate made by the court below on the allowance of the writ of error, the case is this: The action was brought to recover for personal injuries alleged to have been sustained while in the employ of the defendant. The jurisdiction of the court below was invoked solely upon the ground of diversity of citizenship, it being alleged in the first paragraph of the complaint that the defendant was a corporation organized under the laws of the state of Washington, and doing business in the state of Washington, and that the plaintiff was, at the time of the filing of the complaint, and had been for more than a year prior thereto, 'a resident of Washington and a citizen of Sweden.' Admitting its incorporation, and that it was doing business in the state of Washington, the defendant, by its answer, specifically denied each and every other allegation of the first as well as other specified paragraphs of the complaint.\n The cause was tried to a jury, and, after verdict and remittitur of a portion thereof, a judgment was entered in favor of plaintiff. The record does not contain a bill of exceptions, and in the brief of counsel for plaintiff in error it is stated that none was prepared.\n This writ of error, upon the ground solely of a want of jurisdiction in the trial court, was prayed and allowed, and a \n\n[203 U.S. 278, 281]\n\u00a0\n formal certificate was made by the judge, reciting to the time when and how the question of jurisdiction was raised and decided, accompanied with a statement of the pleadings and of the court's impression of certain testimony given at the trial by the plaintiff, deemed by the court pertinent to the elucidation of the question of jurisdiction. The certificate concludes with the statement of enumerated 'questions of jurisdiction,' which the court was of opinion arose for decision, all of them being based upon the overruling by the court of a motion to dismiss the action for want of jurisdiction, which motion, it is recited in the certificate, was made between verdict and judgment. And the only ground here assigned as error is predicated upon the action of the court in denying such motion to desmiss.\n As the circuit court was without power to make a certificate containing a statement of facts as the basis for legal propositions upon which it desired the guidance of this court (Mexican C. R. Co. v. Eckman, \n187 U.S. 432\n, 47 L. ed. 246, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 211; United States v. Rider, \n163 U.S. 132\n, 41 L. ed. 101, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 983), it follows, speaking in a general sense, that our right to review on a direct proceeding concerning the jurisdiction of that court must depend upon the record, and not upon the mere statement of facts made in the certificate prepared by the trial court. Applying this general rule, as it nowhere appears from the record that the issue as to jurisdiction presented by the motion to dismiss, the overruling of which is the sole ground for reversal relied upon in the assignment of error, was made or passed upon by the court, we should be constrained to dismiss this writ of error on the ground that the record did not disclose the presence in the case of the question of jurisdiction which is made the basis of the assignment of error. As, however, under the judiciary act of 1891 [26 Stat. at L. 826, chap. 517, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 488], on a direct review of a question of jurisdiction, the trial judge is authorized to certify as to the existence of such question, we think we may look at his certificate for the purpose of ascertaining when and how the question of jurisdiction was raised, although, for the purpose of deciding the question \n\n[203 U.S. 278, 282]\n\u00a0\n shown to have been thus raised, we may not resort to the statements in the certificate for the purpose of supplying elements of decision which we could not properly consider in an action at law without a bill of exceptions. We have said that we may resort to the certificate, in the absence of a proper showing on the record as to when and how the question of jurisdiction was raised and decided, for the limited purpose stated, because the power to do so is implied in a previous decision of the court ( North American Transp. & T. Co. v. Morrison, \n178 U.S. 262\n, 44 L. ed. 1061, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 869), and because of the general rule that it would be our duty, without action of the trial court or of the parties, to look at the record to determine whether or not the court below had jurisdiction of the action (Thomas v. Ohio State University, \n195 U.S. 211\n, 49 L. ed. 164, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 24). It is apparent, under the rule we have stated, that, whilst we must consider the record for the purpose of determining the question of jurisdiction which the certificate shows adequately to have been raised, we may not consider, in passing upon that question, in the absence of a bill of exceptions, the extraneous matter, such as the testimony of the plaintiff, etc., which forms no part of the record. The question, therefore, for decision under these circumstances is merely this: Does the record show jurisdiction in the court below? This solely depends upon the contention that the allegation in the complaint of the alienage of the plaintiff was insufficient.\n The allegation was as follows: 'That the plaintiff now is, and for more than one year last past has been, a resident of Washington and a citizen of Sweden.' In brief, the argument is that at the time the action was brought Sweden was under a monarchical form of government, being, jointly with Norway, under the rule of the King of Sweden and Norway, and if the plaintiff owed allegiance to the government of Sweden he was not a 'citizen' but a 'subject' of that country. It is not, however, disputed that, although at the time of the bringing of this action Sweden, a limited monarchy, was united to Norway under the same king, and the two countries were \n\n[203 U.S. 278, 283]\n\u00a0\n bound to assist each other in the event of war, they were otherwise wise free and independent. 9 Century Dictionary and Encyclopedia, 969. The allegation that the plaintiff was a resident of the state of Washington clearly shows that the designation 'citizen of Sweden' was not employed to indicate mere residence, and could only have been intended as a statement of the nationality of the plaintiff,-the country to which he bore allegiance. Whether, as contended for the defendant in error, the plaintiff, if he owed allegiance to the ruler of the Kingdom of Sweden, was properly described, in the strictest technical sense, as a citizen instead of as a subject of Sweden, we need not consider. The meaning of the pleader being evident, the objection is without merit. Hennessy v. Richardson Drug Co. \n189 U.S. 25\n, 47 L. ed. 697, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 532.\n Whilst we hold that in a case of direct review under the judiciary act of 1891, when the record does not otherwise show when and how the question of jurisdiction was raised, the certificate of the circuit court may be considered for the purpose of supplying such deficiency when the elements necessary to decide the question are in the record, we deem it the better practice in every case of direct review on a question of jurisdiction to make apparent on the record, by a bill of exceptions or other appropriate mode, the fact that the question of jurisdiction was raised and passed upon, and the elements upon which the decision of the question was based.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","20":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nC. B. & Q RAILWAY v. DRAINAGE COMM'RS.(1906)\nNo. 157\nArgued: December 14, 1905Decided: March 5, 1906\n\n\n\n\n[200 U.S. 561, 562]\n\u00a0\n This is a contest between certain drainage commissioners in Illinois and the Chicago, Burlington, & Quincy Railway Company, as to the validity of a demand made by the former that the latter should remove the bridge and culvert now maintained by it over Rob Roy creek, in Kendall county, Illinois, and, if it continues to maintain a bridge and culvert at the same point, that one be substituted that will meet the requirements of a certain plan of drainage adopted by \n\n[200 U.S. 561, 563]\n\u00a0\n those commissioners. Let us see in what way the dispute arises.\n This suit or proceeding is based in part on what is known as the farm drainage act of Illinois, in force July 1st, 1885, entitled, 'An Act Provided for Drainage for Agricultural and Sanitary Purposes, etc.' Hurd's Rev. Stat. (Ill.) 1901, p. 712. By that act the commissioners of highways in each town, in the several counties under township organization, are constituted drainage commissioners for all drainage districts in their respective towns, with power as a body politic to sue and be sued, contract and be contracted with.  1. Owners of lands are authorized to 'drain the same in the general course of natural drainage, by constructing open or covered drains, discharging the same into any natural water course, or into any natural depression, whereby the water will be carried into some natural water course, or into some drain on the public highway, with the consent of the commissioners thereto; and when such drainage is wholly upon the owner's land, he shall not be liable in damages therefor to any person or persons or corporation.'  4.\n The act also provided: 'When the case involves a system of combined drainage in one town, and it is proposed that the cost shall be borne proportionately by the several parties benefited, a petition addressed to the drainage commissioners shall be presented to the town clerk, signed by a majority in number of the adult owners of land lying in a proposed district, and they shall be the owners in the aggregate of more than one third of the lands lying in the proposed district, or by the owners of the major part of the land and who constitute one third or more of the owners of the land in the proposed district, setting forth the boundaries, or a description of the several tracts of land thereof or fractions as usually designated: . . . Said petition shall state that the lands lying within the boundaries of said proposed district require a combined system of drainage or protection from wash or overflow; that the petitioners desire that a drainage district may be \n\n[200 U.S. 561, 564]\n\u00a0\n organized, embracing the lands therein mentioned, for the purpose of constructing, repairing, or maintaining a drain or drains, ditch or ditches, embankment or embankments, grade or grades, or all or either, within said district, for agricultural and sanitary purposes, by special assessments upon the property benefited thereby.'  11. Again: 'Upon the organization of a drainage district, the commissioners shall go upon the land and determine upon a system of drainage, which shall provide main outlets of ample capacity for the waters of the district, having in view the future contingencies, as well as the present. . . . The maps and papers showing the final determination as to the system of drainage shall be filed in the clerk's office and be recorded in the drainage record.'  17. Hurd's Rev. Stat. (Ill.) 1901, pp. 713, 714, 717.\n Section 40 1\/2 has, however, a more special application to the present case. It is in these words: 'The commissioners shall have the power and are required to make all necessary bridges and culverts along or across any public highway or railroad which may be deemed necessary for the use or protection of the work, and the cost of the same shall be paid out of the road and bridge tax, or by the railroad company, as the case may be: Provided, however, notice shall first be given to the road or railroad authorities to build or construct such bridge or culvert, and they shall have thirty days in which to build or construct the same, such bridges or culverts shall, in all cases, be constructed so as not to interfere with the free flow of water through the drains of the district. Should any railroad company refuse or neglect to build or construct any bridge or culvert as herein required, the commissioners constructing the same may recover the cost and expenses therefor in a suit against said company before any justice of the peace or any court having jurisdiction, and reasonable attorney's fees may be recovered as part of the cost. The proper authorities of any public road or railroad shall have the right of appeal the same as provided for individual landowners.'  40 1\/2. Ibid., 723. \n\n[200 U.S. 561, 565]\n\u00a0\n It is contended by the defendants in error that  56 of what is known as the levee act has a bearing on the case. That section need not, however, be set out, as the supreme court of the state adjudged in this case that a district organized under the farm drainage act was subject only to the provisions of that act, and that the drainage commissioners could not claim any authority under the other act. 212 Ill. 103, 72 N. E. 219. See also Gauen v. Moredock & I. L. Drainage Dist. No. 1, 131 Ill. 446, 23 N. E. 633; Drainage Comrs. v. Volke, 163 Ill. 243, 45 N. E. 415; McCaleb v. Coon Run Drainage & Levee District, 190 Ill. 549, 60 N. E. 898.\n The present proceeding was instituted in the circuit court of Kendall county, Illinois, by the defendants in error as drainage commissioners for the Bristol drainage district in that county, against the Chicago, Burlington, & Quincy Railway Company. It is a petition for mandamus.\n Besides a general demurrer, the railway company demurred specially upon the ground that a judgment in favor of the commissioners would take its property for public use without compensation, and therefore without due process of law, as well as deny to it the equal protection of the laws, in violation of the Constitution of the United States. The demurrer was overruled. The defendant having elected to stand by its demurrer, judgment was rendered ordering a writ of mandamus as prayed for in the petition. That judgment was affirmed by the supreme court of Illinois, 212 Ill. 103, 72 N. E. 219, and hence the present writ of error.\n As the case was determined upon the demurrer, the facts are to be taken as alleged in the petition. The case, thus presented, is as follows:\n The drainage district in question was organized under the farm drainage act above referred to and contains about 2,000 acres of land on both sides of Rob Roy creek, across which are the road and right of way of the railway company. For more than fifty years before the district was established, that creek had been, as it now is, a natural water course. Prior \n\n[200 U.S. 561, 566]\n\u00a0\n to June 24th, 1903, the commissioners located a ditch or drain on the line of the creek for the purpose of enlarging its channel or water course, and thereby enabling the lands in the drainage district to be better drained and made more tillable.\n The railway company operated and maintained its road across Rob Roy creek, not under any specific grant of authority, but under its general corporate power to construct, operate, and maintain a railroad. It placed a bridge or culvert 12 by 30 feet at the point where the road crosses the creek. In constructing a foundation for the bridge or culvert the company sank or placed in the creek at the point of crossing huge wooden timbers and stones, thereby preventing the deepening and enlarging of the creek by the commissioners, unless they removed such timber and stones; and if that be done the result will be the destruction of the bridge or culvert. The present channel or water way of the creek, under the bridge or culvert is 3 feet in depth and 12 feet in width. It is insufficient to allow the natural flow of water in the ditch or drain proposed to be constructed by the commissioners. The estimated cost of this ditch or open drain is $20, 000. The present bridge across the creek does not exceed $8,000 in value, and a new bridge, conforming to the plan of the Commissioners, will cost not exceeding $13,000.\n On the 24th of June, 1903, the drainage commissioners notified the railway company in writing that a bridge was necessary at the point where the company's right of way would be crossed or intersected by the proposed ditch; that it was necessary to enlarge the opening under the present bridge; that the proposed improvement was to be the water way of a combined system of drainage established in the vicinity under the charge and direction of the drainage commissioners of the district; that the mainditch of the drainage, where it will intersect the company's right of way, must be of the width of 23 feet and of the depth of 9 1\/2 feet, the bridge constructed to be of the width of 23 feet \n\n[200 U.S. 561, 567]\n\u00a0\n in the clear at the surface or level of land, and to permit at least sixteen feet in the clear at the bottom of the ditch. The notice stated that the company was required, in pursuance of the statute in such case made and provided, to build and construct such bridge within thirty days from the date of the notice, in default whereof the commissioners would construct the same at the cost and expense of the company.\n The company disregarded the notice and failed to build and construct the required bridge or culvert at the point of intersection with the creek, in accordance with the dimensions specified in the notice, and so as to permit such enlargement of the channel under the bridge as would be sufficient for the natural flow of water in the proposed ditch or drain.\n The petition averred that a majority of the lands of the drainage district were swamp or slough lands, and in their present condition were not subject to cultivation, but by means of the proposed deepening and enlarging of Rob Roy creek, and as a result of the removal of the timbers and stones in the creek and the enlargement and deepening of the creek, all the lands in the drainage district would be 'greatly improved, and made good, tillable land, subject to cultivation;' that the proposed location of the ditch or drain along the creek was the best route or means for drainage of the district, constituting the only natural water course of the drainage district, and affording the only natural outlet or way of drainage of the lands to make them tillable; that if said improvement and enlargement of the ditch was made and the timbers and stones removed from the creek at the point of crossing, all of the lands of the district would be made good, tillabel lands for general farming purposes; and that the proposed construction of a ditch or drain along Rob Roy creek, when completed in accordance with said plans, would 'not divert or carry waters which by nature of force of gravity would flow or drain into any other natural water course in said drainage district or the vicinity thereof.'\n The commissioners allege in their petition that the neglect, \n\n[200 U.S. 561, 568]\n\u00a0\n failure, and refusal of the railway company to remove the timbers and stones it had placed in the creek, and to construct and enlarge the opening under its bridge or culvert, had prevented them from completing the construction of the ditch or drain in accordance with the plans adopted by them; that it was necessary for the use and protection of the proposed drainage work that the opening underneath the bridge or culvert be constructed and enlarged in the manner indicated in order that the lands in the district might be drained in accordance with said plans; which plans 'are reasonable for the suitable and proper drainage of said district.'\n The relief asked was a writ of mandamus commanding the railway company to forthwith enlarge, deepen, and widen the water way over and across the company's right of way across Rob Roy creek.\n Messrs. Albert J. Hopkins, Robert Bruce Scott, and Chester M. Dawes for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[200 U.S. 561, 573]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John K. Newhall and John M. Raymond for defendants in error.\n\n\n[200 U.S. 561, 579]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan delivered the opinion of the court:\n\n 1. \nThe first question is one of the authority of this court to review the judgment below. As we have seen, the railway company insisted in the court of original jurisdiction that the statute under which the drainage commissioners proceeded \n\n[200 U.S. 561, 580]\n\u00a0\n could not be applied in this case without taking its property for public use without compensation, and therefore depriving it of property without due process of law, or without denying to it the equal protection of the laws, guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States. The judgment of the trial court was adverse to that view. In the supreme court of the state the railway company, by its assignments of error, preserved its objection based on constitutional grounds. That court did not, in words, refer to the Constitution of the United States, and its opinion concluded: 'Entertaining the views above expressed, and founding our conclusion upon the rights and duties of the parties as found in the common law, we deem it unnecessary to pass upon the constitutionality of  40 1\/2 of the farm drainage act.' [212 Ill. 120, 72 N. E. 225.]\n The contention is that as the state court based its judgment on the common-law duty of the railway company, and not expressly on any Federal ground, it cannot be said that there was any denial of the Federal right claimed by the company; consequently, it is argued, this court is without jurisdiction to re-examine the final judgment. Rev. Stat.  709, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 575.\n Undoubtedly, the general rule is that where the judgment of the state court rests upon an independent, separate ground of local or general law, broad enough or sufficient in itself to cover the essential issues and control the rights of the parties, however the Federal question raised on the record might be determined, this court will affirm or dismiss, as the one course or the other may be appropriate, without considering that question. But it is equally well settled that the failure of the state court to pass on the Federal right or immunity specially set up, of record, is not conclusive, but this court will decide the Federal question if the necessary effect of the judgment is to deny a Federal right or immunity specially set up or claimed, and which, if recognized and enforced, would require a judgment different from one resting upon some ground of local or general law. And such plainly was the effect of the judgment in this case. If, as the railway company contended, the pro- \n\n[200 U.S. 561, 581]\n\u00a0\n posed action of the drainage commissioners would deprive it of property without due process of law and also deny to it the equal protection of the laws, then a judgment should have been rendered for the company. And that result could not be avoided merely by silence on the Federal question, and by placing the judgment on some principle of the common law. The constitutional grounds relied on must, if sustained, displace or supersede any principle of general or local law which, but for such grounds, might be sufficient for the complete determination of the rights of the parties. The claim of a Federal right or immunity specially set up from the outset went to the very root of the case and dominated every part of it. If that claim be valid, then the law is for the railway company; for the supreme law of the land must always control. Therefore a failure to recognize such Federal right or immunity, and the decision of the case on some ground of general or local law, necessarily has the same effect as if the claim of Federal right or immunity had been expressly denied. That claim having, then, been distinctly set up by the company, and being broad enough to cover the entire case, it may not be ignored, and this court cannot refuse to determine whether the alleged Federal right exists and is protected by the Constitution of the United States. If the case had been decided in favor of the railway company on some ground of local or general law, then the claim of a Federal right would have become immaterial, and we could not have re-examined the judgment. But the decision was otherwise, and was, in law, a denial of the claim of a Federal right.\n For these reasons we are of opinion that this court has jurisdiction to re-examine the final judgment of the state court so far as it involved the Federal right or immunity specially set up by the railway company.\n\n 2. \nThe concrete case arising upon the petition and the demurrer is this: A public corporation, charged by law with the duty of causing a large body of lands, principally swamp and slough lands, to be drained and made capable of cultivation, \n\n[200 U.S. 561, 582]\n\u00a0\n has, under direct legislative authority, adopted a reasonable and suitable plan to accomplish that object. That plan requires the enlarging and deepening of the channel of a natural water course running through the district, which is the only natural outlet or way of drainage of the lands of the district,-the best and only practicable mode by which the lands can be made tillable. But that plan cannot be carried out unless the timbers and stones in the creek-placed there by the railway company when it constructed the foundation for its present bridge-are removed. The timber and stones referred to cannot, however, be removed without destroying the foundations of the present bridge and rendering it necessary (if the railway company continues to operate its road, which we assume it intends to do) to construct another bridge with an opening underneath wide enough to permit a channel sufficient to carry off the waters of the creek as increased in volume under the drainage system adopted by the commissioners.\n The contention of the railway company is that, as its present bridge was lawfully constructed, under its general corporate power to build, construct, operate, and maintain a railroad in the county and township aforesaid, and as the depth and width of the channel under it were sufficient, at the time, to carry off the water of the creek as it then flowed, and now flows,-the foundation of the bridge cannot be removed and its use of the bridge disturbed unless compensation be first made or secured to it in such amount as will be sufficient to meet the expense of removing the timbers and stones from the creek and of constructing a new bridge of such length and with such opening under it as the plan of the commissioners requires. The company insists that to require it to meet these expenses out of its own funds will be, within the meaning of the Constitution, a taking of its property for public use without compensation, and, therefore, without due process of law, as well as a denial to it of the equal protection of the laws.\n The importance of these questions will justify a reference to some of the adjudged cases; referring first to those recog- \n\n[200 U.S. 561, 583]\n\u00a0\n nizing the distinction between an incidental injury to rights of private property resulting from the exercise of governmental powers, lawfully and reasonably exerted for the public good, and the taking, within the meaning of the Constitution, of private property for public use.\n In Northern Transp. Co. v. Chicago, \n99 \nU.S. 635, 642\n, 25 S. L. ed. 336, 338, which involved a claim for damages directly resulting from the construction by the city of Chicago of a tunnel under Chicago river, whereby for a very long time the plaintiff was prevented from using its dock and other property for purposes of its business; in Mugler v. Kansas, \n123 \nU.S. 623, 669\n, 31 S. L. ed. 205, 213, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 273, which related in part, to the lawful prohibition by the state of the use of private property in a particular way, whereby its value was materially diminished, if not practically destroyed; in New York & N. E. R. Co. v. Bristol, \n151 \nU.S. 556, 557\n, 571 S., 38 L. ed. 269, 272, 274, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 437, which involved the question whether a railroad company could be required, at its sole expense, to remove a grade crossing which it had lawfully established and used, and to establish another crossing at a different place; in Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Chicago, \n166 \nU.S. 226, 252\n, 41 S. L. ed. 976, 990, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 581, in which one of the questions was whether it was a condition of the exercise by the state of its authority to regulate the use of property owned by individuals or corporations, that the owner should be indemnified for the damage or injury resulting from the exercise of such authority for legitimate public purposes; Gibson v. United States, \n166 \nU.S. 269, 271\n, 276 S., 41 L. ed. 996, 998, 1002, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 578, in which the owner of a farm on an island in the Ohio river, at which there was a landing, sought to recover compensation for the injury done to the farm by reason of the construction by the United States of a dike for the purpose of concentrating the waterflow in the main channel of the river; and in Scranton v. Wheeler, \n179 \nU.S. 141, 164\n, 45 S. L. ed. 126, 137, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 48, which involved the question whether the United States was required to compensate an owner of land fronting on a public navigable river, when his access from the shore to the navigable part of such river was permanently obstructed by a pier erected in the river under \n\n[200 U.S. 561, 584]\n\u00a0\n the authority of Congress for the purpose of improving navigation;-in each of those cases this court recognized the principle that injury may often come to private property as the result of legitimate governmental action, reasonably taken for the public good and for no other purpose, and yet there will be no taking of such property within the meaning of the constitutional guaranty against the deprivation of property without due process of law, or against the taking of private property for public use without compensation. To this class belongs the recent, and, as we think, decisive case of New Orleans Gaslight Co. v. Drainage Commission, \n197 U.S. 453\n, 49 L. ed. 831, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 471, to be hereafter adverted to in another connection. In this class may also be placed Mills v. United States, 12 L. R. A. 673, 46 Fed. 738. That was the case of an improvement by the United States of the navigation of Savannah river, which resulted in so raising the water in that river as to make it impossible to prevent the flooding of adjacent rice fields that were ordinarily and naturally drained into the river, and rendering it necessary that expense be incurred in order to provide new drainage from those fields into a back river, where the water levels were suitable. In commenting upon that case, this court said, in United States v. Lynah, \n188 U.S. 445\n, 47 L. ed. 539, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 349: 'Obviously there was no taking of the plaintiff's lands, but simply an injury which could be remedied at an expense, as alleged, of $10,000, and the action was one to recover the amount of this consequential injury. The court rightfully held that it could not be sustained.' See also Bedford v. United States, \n192 U.S. 217\n, 48 L. ed. 414, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 238, and Manigault v. Springs, \n199 U.S. 473\n, 50 L. ed. --, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 127.\n We refer also, as having direct application here, to some of the cases, familiar to the profession, that recognize the possession by each state of the power, never surrendered to the government of the Union, of guarding and promoting the public interests by reasonable police regulations that do not violate the Constitution of the state or the Constitution of the United States.

New York, \n165 U.S. 628\n-631, 41 L. ed. 853, 854, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 418.\n We assume that the drainage statute in question is entirely consistent with the Constitution of Illinois. It is so regarded by the supreme court of the state, and that is all-sufficient in this case. We assume, also, without discussion-as from the decisions of the state court, we may properly assume-that the draining of this large body of lands so as to make them fit for human habitation and cultivation is a public purpose, to accomplish which the state may, by appropriate agencies, exert the general powers it possesses for the common good. By the removal of water from large bodies of land, the state court has said, and by 'the subjection of such lands to cultivation, they are made to bear their proper proportionate burden to the support of the inhabitants and the commerce of the state. Their value is increased, and thereby their contribution in taxes to the state and local governments is increased.' 212 Ill. 103, 119, 72 N. E. 219. It is conceded that this public purpose cannot be certainly and effectively attained except through the plan adopted by the drainage commissioners. Further, the regulations against which the railway company invokes the Constitution have a real, direct, and obvious relation to the public objects sought to be accomplished by them; in no sense are they arbitrary or unreasonable. Indeed it is admitted that the plan of the commissioners, is appropriate and the best that can be devised for draining the lands in question. But the railway company, in effect, if not in words, insists that the rights which it asserts in this case are superior and paramount to any that the public has to use the water course in question for the purpose of draining the lands in its vicinity, although such water course was in existence, for the benefit of the public, long before the railway company constructed its bridge. This contention cannot, however, be sustained, except upon the theory that the acquisition by the railway company of a right of way through the lands in \n\n[200 U.S. 561, 586]\n\u00a0\n question, and the construction on that right of way of a bridge across Rob Roy creek at the point in question, carried with it a surrender by the state of its power, by appropriate agencies, to provide for such use of that natural water course as might subsequently become necessary or proper for the public interests. If the state could part with such power, held in trust for the public,-which is by no means admitted,-it has not done so in any statute, either by express words or by necessary implication. When the railway company laid the foundations of its bridge in Rob Roy creek, it did so subject to the rights of the public in the use of that water course, and also subject to the possibility that new circumstances and future public necessities might, in the judgment of the state, reasonably require a material change in the methods used in crossing the creek with cars. It may be-and we take it to be true-that the opening under the bridge as originally constructed was sufficient to pass all the water then or now flowing through the creek. But the duty of the company, implied in law, was to maintain an opening under the bridge that would be adequate and effectual for such an increase in the volume of water as might result from lawful, reasonable regulations established by appropriate public authority from time to time for the drainage of lands on either side of the creek. Angell, Water Courses, 6th'ed.  465b, p. 640.\n The supreme court of Illinois said in this case: 'The right of drainage through a natural water course or a natural water way is a natural easement, appurtenant to the land of every individual through whose land such natural water course runs, and every owner of land along such water course is obliged to take notice of the natural easement possessed by other owners along the same water course.' Again, in the same case: 'Where lands are valuable for cultivation, and the country, as this, depends so much upon agriculture, the public welfare demands that the lands shall be drained; and, in the absence of any constitutional provision in relation to such laws they have been sustained. upon high authority, as the exercise of the \n\n[200 U.S. 561, 587]\n\u00a0\n police power.' Further: 'A natural water course, being a natural easement, is placed upon the same ground, in many respects as to the public right, as is a public highway. At the common law, if a railroad or another highway crosses a natural water course or a public highway, such highway or railroad must be so constructed across the existing highway or waterway, and so maintained, that said highway or waterway, as the case may be, shall not only subserve the demands of the public as they exist at the time of crossing the same, but for all future time. . . . The great weight of authority is, that where there is a natural water way, or where a highway already exists and is crossed by a railroad company under its general license to build a railroad, and without any specific grant by the legislative authority to obstruct the highway or water way, the railroad company is bound to make and keep its crossing, at its own expense, in such condition as shall meet all the reasonable requirements of the public as the changed conditions and increased use may demand.' The court said that the implied authority of the company to build its present bridge was coupled with its common law duty 'to build its bridge over the natural water course with a view of the future as well as the present contingencies and requirements of such water course, and with the further implied provision that there remained in the state, whenever the public welfare required it, the right to regulate its use.' Still further: 'The subject [the draining of lands] was deemed of such importance that the people, by  31 of article 4 of the Constitution of 1870, conferred upon the general assembly plenary powers in making provision for drainage for agricultural and sanitary purposes, and pursuant to that power the general assembly passed the act under which the appellees are proceeding, declaring that the organization should be for agricultural and sanitary purposes. The drainage districts organized as are the appellees, under that law are invested with the right of eminent domain and the power of taxation, upon the theory that they are public utilities and are held to be quasi public corporations. In their organic character \n\n[200 U.S. 561, 588]\n\u00a0\n they do not represent merely the individual property owners or themselves, but they represent the state in carrying out its policy, as found in the common law and declared by its Constitution and statutes. It has been so often said that it need only be adverted to here, that corporations such as appellant do not hold their property and exercise their franchises strictly in a private right, but that from the nature of their business and their relation to society they are public corporations in a sense, and are subject to public control and regulation, though with their grant of power to traverse the state with their lines of railroad it cannot be said that their right of private property attaches to every highway and water course over which their roads may be constructed. To so hold would render such enterprises, which are designed for the benefit of the state, obstacles to its progress and a menace to its general welfare. . . . Of course, in the exercise of the right of the public interest, as against such corporations, the demand must be reasonable, and must clearly appear to be for the public welfare. In this case it is not questioned that the inprovement of Rob Roy creek, as proposed, is necessary for the proper drainage of the lands comprising the drainage district. The petition alleges that such enlargement is necessary and that the same cannot be carried on with the obstructions placed in the bed of said creek by appellant. This the appellant does not deny.' 212 Ill. 109-111, 114, 118, 72 N. E. 219.\n In Ohio & M. R. Co. v. McClelland, 25 Ill. 140, 144, it was said- indeed, all the cases hold-that 'the power to enact police regulations operates upon all alike;' that that power 'is incident to and a part of government itself, and need not be expressly reserved, when it grants rights or property to individuals or corporate bodies, as they take subservient to this right.'\n A case quite in point is that of Kankakee & S. R. Co. v. Horan, 131 Ill. 288, 23 N. E. 621. That was an action against a railroad company to recover for damage from the backing of water upon plaintiff's land by reason of an insufficient culvert con- \n\n[200 U.S. 561, 589]\n\u00a0\n structed by it for the passage of water from a certain natural water course. The contention of the company was that the culvert when constructed was sufficient for the flow of water at the time, and that it was not bound to make such provision as was necessary for an increase of water in the slough subsequently arising from the drainage into it of the lands along its course. Upon this point the supreme court of Illinois said: 'We do not subscribe to this doctrine. The Parker slough was a water course, and it was the legal right of anyone along its line for miles above the railroad, where the water naturally shed toward the slough, to drain into it, and no one below, owning land along the slough, would have any legal remedy against such person so draining water into the slough above him, for any damage done to his inheritance by means of an increased flow of water caused thereby. In other words, the slough was a legal water course for the drainage of all the land the natural tendency of which was to cast its surplus water, caused by the falling of rain and snow into it; and this whether the flow was increased by artificial means or not. It would seem legitimately to follow that the railroad company, in providing a passageway for the slough, was bound to anticipate and provide for any such legal increase of the water flow. If it did not, it was doing a wrong and legal injury to any one situated like the appellee, who received injury in consequence of a failure on its part to do its duty.' See also the following Illinois cases: People ex rel. Bloomington v. Chicago & A. R. Co. 67 Ill. 118; Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co. v. Moffitt, 75 Ill. 524; Chicago & N. W. R. Co. v. Chicago, 140 Ill. 309, 29 N. E. 1109; Ohio & M. R. Co. v. Thillman, 143 Ill. 127, 36 Am. St. Rep. 359, 32 N. E. 529; Frazer v. Chicago, 186 Ill. 480, 486, 51 L. R. A. 306, 78 Am. St. Rep. 296, 57 N. E. 1055\n\n\n Many cases in other courts are to the same general effect. They negative the suggestion of the railway company that the adequacy of its bridge and the opening under it for passing the water of the creek at the time the bridge was constructed determines its obligations to the public at all subsequent periods. In Cooke v. Boston & L. R. Corp. 133 Mass. 185, 188, \n\n[200 U.S. 561, 590]\n\u00a0\n it appeared that a railroad company had statutory authority to cross a certain highway with its road. The statute provided that if the railroad crossed any highway it should be so constructed as not to impede or obstruct the safe and convenient use of the highway. And one of the contentions of the company was that the statute limited its duty and obligation to provide for the wants of travelers at the time it exercised the privilege granted to it. The court said: 'The legislature intended to provide against any obstruction of the safe and convenient use of the highway, for all time; and if, by the increase of population in the neighborhood, or by an increasing use of the highway, the crossing which at the outset was adequate is no longer so, it is the duty of the railroad corporation to make such alteration as will meet the present needs of the public who have occasion to use the highway.' In Lake Erie & W. R. Co. v. Cluggish, 143 Ind. 347, 42 N. E. 743, the court said (quoting from Lake Erie & W. R. Co. v. Smith, 61 Fed. 885): 'The duty of a railroad to restore a stream or highway which is crossed by the line of its road is a continuing duty; and if, by the increase of population or other causes, the crossing becomes inadequate to meet the new and altered conditions of the country, it is the duty of the railroad to make such alterations as will meet the present needs of the public.' So, in Indiana ex rel. Muncie v. Lake Erie & W. R. Co. 83 Fed. 287, which was the case of an overhead crossing lawfully constructed on one of the streets of a city, the court said: 'If, by the growth of population or otherwise, the crossing has become inadequate to meet the present needs of the public, it is the duty of the railroad company to remedy the defect by restoring the crossing so that it will not unnecessarily impair the usefulness of the highway.'\n The cases to which we have referred are in accord with the declarations of this court in the recent case of New Orleans Gaslight Co. v. Drainage Commission, \n197 U.S. 453\n, 49 L. ed. 831, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 471. That case would seem to be decisive of the question before us. It there appeared that a gas company had acquired an exclusive right \n\n[200 U.S. 561, 591]\n\u00a0\n to supply gas to the city of New Orleans and its inhabitants through pipes and mains laid in the streets. In the exercise of that right it had laid its pipes in the streets. Subsequently a drainage commission, proceeding under statutory authority, devised a system of drainage for the city, and in the execution of its plans it became necessary to change the location in some places of the mains and pipes laid by the gas company. The contention of that company was that it could not be required, at its own cost, to shift its pipes and mains so as to accommodate the drainage system; that to require it to do so would be a taking of its property for public use without compensation, in violation of the Constitution of the United States. This court said: 'The gas company did not acquire any specific location in the streets; it was content with the general right to use them; and when it located its pipes it was at the risk that they might be, at some future time, disturbed, when the state might require, for a necessary public use, that changes in location be made. . . . There is nothing in the grant to the gas company, even if it could legally be done, undertaking to limit the right of the state to establish a system of drainage in the streets. We think whatever right the gas company acquired was subject, in so far as the location of its pipes was concerned, to such further regulations as might be required in the interest of the public health and welfare. These views are amply sustained by the authorities. National Waterworks Co. v. Kansas City, 28 Fed. 921, in which the opinion was delivered by Mr. Justice Brewer, then circuit judge; Columbus Gaslight & Coke Co. v. Columbus, 50 Ohio St. 65, 19 L. R. A. 510, 40 Am. St. Rep. 648, 33 N. E. 292; Jamaica Pond Aqueduct Corp. v. Brookline, 121 Mass. 5; Re Deering, 93 N. Y. 361; Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Chicago, \n166 \nU.S. 226, 254\n, 41 S. L. ed. 979, 990, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 581. In the latter case it was held that uncompensated obedience to a regulation enacted for the public safety under the police power of the state was not taking property without due compensation. In our view, that is all there is to this case. The gas company, by its grant from the city, acquired no exclusive right to the location of its pipes in the streets, as chosen \n\n[200 U.S. 561, 592]\n\u00a0\n by it, under a general grant of authority to use the streets. The city made no contract that the gas company should not be disturbed in the location chosen. In the exercise of the police power of the state, for the purpose highly necessary in the promotion of the public health, it has become necessary to change the location of the pipes of the gas company so as to accommodate them to the new public work. In complying with this requirement at its own expense none of the property of the gas company has been taken, and the injury sustained is damnum absque injuria.'\n The learned counsel for the railway company seem to think that the adjudications relating to the police power of the state to protect the public health, the public morals, and the public safety are not applicable, in principle, to cases where the police power is exerted for the general well-being of the community apart from any question of the public health, the public morals, or the public safety. Hence, he presses the thought that the petition in this case does not, in words, suggest that the drainage in question has anything to do with the health of the drainage district, but only avers that the system of drainage adopted by the commissioners will reclaim the lands of the district, and make them tillable or fit for cultivation. We cannot assent to the view expressed by counsel. We hold that the police power of a state embraces regulations designed to promote the public convenience or the general prosperity, as well as regulations designed to promote the public health, the public morals, or the public safety. Lake Shore & M. S. R. Co. v. Ohio, \n173 \nU.S. 285, 292\n, 43 S. L. ed. 702, 704, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 465; Gilman v. Philadelphia, 3 Wall. 713, 729, 18 L. ed. 96, 100; Pound v. Turck, \n95 \nU.S. 459, 464\n, 24 S. L. ed. 525, 527; Hannibal & St. J. R. Co. v. Husen, \n95 U.S. 470\n, 24 L. ed. 529. And the validity of a police regulation, whether established directly by the state or by some public body acting under its sanction, must depend upon the circumstances of each case and the character of the regulation, whether arbitrary or reasonable, and whether really designed to accomplish a legitimate public purpose. Private property cannot be taken without compensation for public use under a police regulation relating \n\n[200 U.S. 561, 593]\n\u00a0\n strictly to the public health, the public morals, or the public safety, any more than under a police regulation having no relation to such matters, but only to the general welfare. The foundations upon which the power rests are in every case the same. This power, as said in Carthage v. Frederick, 122 N. Y. 268, 10 L. R. A. 178, 19 Am. St. Rep. 490, 25 N. E. 480, has always been exercised by municipal corporations, 'by making regulations to preserve order, to promote freedom of communication, and to facilitate the transaction of business in crowded communities. Compensation has never been a condition of its exercise, even when attended with inconvenience or pecuniary loss, as each member of a community is presumed to be benefited by that which promotes the general welfare.' The constitutional requirement of due process of law, which embraces compensation for private property taken for public use, applies in every case of the exertion of governmental power. If, in the execution of any power, no matter what it is, the government, Federal or state, finds it necessary to take private property for public use, it must obey the constitutional injunction to make or secure just compensation to the owner. Cherokee Nation v. Southern Kansas R. Co. \n135 \nU.S. 641, 659\n, 34 S. L. ed. 295, 303, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 965; Sweet v. Rechel, \n159 \nU.S. 380, 399\n, 402 S., 40 L. ed. 188, 196, 197, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 43; Monongahela Nav. Co. v. United States, \n148 \nU.S. 312, 336\n, 37 S. L. ed. 463, 471, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 622; United States v. Lynah, \n188 U.S. 445\n, 47 L. ed. 539, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 349. If the means employed have no real, substantial relation to public objects which government may legally accomplish,-if they are arbitrary and unreasonable, beyond the necessities of the case,-the judiciary will disregard mere forms, and interfere for the protection of rights injuriously affected by such illegal action. The authority of the courts to interfere in such cases is beyond all doubt. Minnesota v. Barber, \n136 \nU.S. 313, 320\n, 34 S. L. ed. 455, 458, 3 Inters. Com. Rep. 185, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 862. Upon the general subject there is no real conflict among the adjudged cases. Whatever conflict there is arises upon the question whether there has been or will be in the particular case, within the true meaning of the Constitution, a 'taking' of private property for public use. If the injury complained of is only incidental to the legitimate exercise of governmental powers for the public good, then there is \n\n[200 U.S. 561, 594]\n\u00a0\n no taking of property for the public use, and a right to compensation, on account of such injury, does not attach under the Constitution. Such is the present case. There are, unquestionably, limitations upon the exercise of the police power which cannot, under any circumstances, be ignored. But the clause prohibiting the taking of private property without compensation 'is not intended as a limitation of the exercise of those police powers which are necessary to the tranquillity of every well-ordered community, nor of that general power over private property which is necessary for the orderly existence of all governments. It has always been held that the legislature may make police regulations, although they may interfere with the full enjoyment of private property, and though no compensation is given.' Sedgw. Stat. & Const. Law, 434.\n It remains to deal with a particular aspect of the case. The opening under the present bridge, we assume from the record, was sufficient, when the bridge was constructed, to pass all the water naturally flowing in the creek from lands in that locality. It is sufficient if the channel of the river be left as it is now. The commissioners demand, however, as they may rightfully do in the public interest, a larger, deeper, and wider channel in order to accommodate the increased volume of water in the creek that will come from the proposed plan of the commissioners. But that is a matter which concerns the public, not the railway company. The duty of the company will end when it removes the obstructions which it has placed in the way of enlarging, deepening, and widening of the channel. It follows, upon principles of justice, that while the expense attendant upon the removal of the present bridge and culvert and the timbers and stones placed by the company in the creek, as well as the expense of the erection of any new bridge which the company may elect to construct in order to conform to the plan of the commissioners, should be borue by the railway company, the expense attendant merely upon the removal of soil in order to enlarge, deepen, and widen the channel must be borne by the district. The expense to be borne by the district and the rail- \n\n[200 U.S. 561, 595]\n\u00a0\n way company, respectively, can be ascertained by the state court in some appropriate way, and such orders made as will be necessary to facilitate the execution of the plan of the commissioners.\n Without further discussion, we hold it to be the duty of the railway company, at its own expense, to remove from the creek the present bridge, culvert, timbers, and stones placed there by it, and also (unless it abandons or surrenders its right to cross the creek at or in the vicinity of the present crossing) to erect at its own expense and maintain a new bridge for crossing that will conform to the regulations established by the drainage commissioners, under the authority of the state; and such a requirement if enforced will not amount to a taking of private property for public use within the meaning of the Constitution, nor to a denial of the equal protection of the laws.\n Leaving it to the state court to give effect to these views by appropriate orders, and subject to the above qualifications, the decree of the state court is affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes, concurring:\n I concur in the main with the judgment of the court. I agree that the public authority has a right to widen or deepen a channel if it sees fit, and that any cost that the railroad is put to in rebuilding a bridge the railroad must bear. But the public must pay for the widening or deepening, and I think that it does not matter whether what it has to remove is the original earth or same other substance lawfully put in the place of the original earth. Very likely in this case the distinction is of little importance; but it may be hereafter. I suppose it to be plain, as my brother Brewer says, that, if an expense is thrown upon the railroad unlawfully, its property is taken for public use without due compensation. Woodward v. Central Vermont R. Co. 180 Mass. 599, 62 N. E. 1051. \n\n[200 U.S. 561, 596]\n\u00a0\n I am authorized to say that my brothers White and McKenna agree with my view.\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer, dissenting:\n The question in this case is a narrow one, yet of profound importance, and, involving, as in my judgment it does, a grievous wrong to owners of private property, I am constrained to dissent. Conceding the regularity of the proceedings and the power of the state to drain the lands in the drainage district, and, if necessary therefor, to compel the building of a new and enlarged bridge over Rob Roy creek, I dissent from the conclusion that the state may cast the entire cost of such rebuilding upon the railroad company.\n It appears from the petition, which was demurred to, and whose allegations of fact must therefore be taken as true, that the drainage district consists of about 2,000 acres on both sides of Rob Roy creek; that a majority of the lands of said drainage district are swamp or slough lands, and, under natural conditions, not subject to cultivation, but by drainage will all be greatly improved and made good tillable lands. The railroad company has for forty years maintained a bridge or culvert over Rob Roy creek which has answered and does answer all its purposes and necessities. The cost of the ditches and drains in the drainage district in accordance with the plans adopted by the commissioners is estimated at $ 20,000. The railroad bridge or culvert across the creek does not exceed in value $8,000, and a new bridge or culvert can be constructed at a cost of not exceeding $13,000. The drainage act provides for an appraisement of the damage done to any tract by the construction of the proposed work, and a judgment in favor of the owner against the commissioners of the district for that amount. It also provides for an assessment of the benefits to the different tracts, upon the basis of which assessments taxes are to be levied to pay for the construction and maintenance of the drainage system. In other words, any damage done to \n\n[200 U.S. 561, 597]\n\u00a0\n any particular tract by the construction of the drainage system is to be paid to the owner of that tract, if a private individual, and the tracts which are benefited are to be charged with the cost in proportion to the amount of benefit received. Section 40 1\/2 of the drainage act then provides:\n'The commissioners shall have the power and are required to make all necessary bridges and culverts along or across any public highway or railroad which may be deemed necessary for the use or protection of the work, and the cost of the same shall be paid out of the road and bridge tax, or by the railroad company, as the case may be: Provided, however, notice shall first be given to the road or railroad authorities to build or construct such a bridge or culvert, and they shall have thirty days in which to build or construct the same, such bridges or culverts shall, in all cases, be constructed so as not to interfere with the free flow of water through the drains of the district. Should any railroad company refuse or neglect to build or construct any bridge or culvert as herein required, the commissioners constructing the same may recover the cost and expenses therefor in a suit against said company before any justice of the peace or any court having jurisdiction, and reasonable attorney's fees may be recovered as part of the cost. The proper authorities of any public road or railroad shall have the right of appeal the same as provided for individual landowners.'\n\n According to this, if any bridge or culvert on any public highway is needed in order to perfect the drainage system, the cost of it is to be paid out of the public funds; but if a bridge or culvert is required on a railroad, the cost of it must be paid by the railroad company. And this is arbitrary, without any appraisement of benefits or damages.\n Now, the property of a railroad company is private property. It cannot be taken for public uses without just compensation. True, it is used by the owners in performing the quasi public work of transportation, but it is not given up to public uses generally. It is not devoted to education or the improvement of farm lands, or, indeed, any other use than that of transpor- \n\n[200 U.S. 561, 598]\n\u00a0\n tation. If taken therefrom and devoted to other public uses it is the taking of private property for public uses. That this can be done may be conceded, but only upon just compensation.\n When private property is taken for public uses compensation must be paid. That is the mandate of the Federal Constitution and of that of nearly every state in the Union. Independently of such mandate, compensation would be required. In 2 Kent, Com. 12th ed. p. 339, it is said:\n'A provision for compensation is a necessary attendant on the due and constitutional exercise of the power of the lawgiver to deprive an individual of his property without his consent; and this principle in American constitutional jurisprudence is founded in natural equity, and is laid down by jurists as an acknowledged principle of universal law.' See also cases cited in the note; especially Gardner v. Newburgh, 2 Johns. Ch. 162, 166, 7 Am. Dec. 526.\n\n In Sinnickson v. Johnson, 17 N. J. L. 129, 145, 34 Am. Dec. 184, referred to approvingly by this court in Pumpelly v. Green Bay & M. Canal Co. 13 Wall. 166, 178, 20 L. ed. 557, 560; and Monongahela Nav. Co. v. United States, \n148 \nU.S. 312, 324\n, 37 S. L. ed. 463, 467, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 622, 625, it was said:\n'This power to take private property reaches back of all constituted provisions; and it seems to have been considered a settled principle of universal law that the right to compensation is an incident to the exercise of that power; that the one is so inseparably connected with the other that they may be said to exist, not as separate and distinct principles, but as parts of one and the same principle.'\n\n If this be true when the taking is for that which is solely a public use, how much more true is it when the taking is largely for the benefit of private individuals, and at best only incidentally for the benefit of the public? Now the sole purpose of this proceeding, as admitted by the demurrer, was the transformation of these swamp and untillable lands into good tillable lands; in other words, to that extent, increasing the value of the farms in the hands of their private owners. While the stat- \n\n[200 U.S. 561, 599]\n\u00a0\n ute under which these proceedings were had contemplates drainage for agricultural and sanitary purposes, there is nothing in this record to show that any sanitary result was contemplated, and the only object disclosed is the direct beneficial result to the owners of these swamp lands. There is not the slightest intimation that the health, morals, or safety of the community will be promoted, or is intended to be promoted, by the drainage. I quote the exact language of the petition:\n'And the petitioners aver that the aforesaid location of the ditch or drain along the said Rob Roy creek was for the purpose of enlarging the channel or water course of the aforesaid Rob Roy creek, and thereby enabling the land in said drainage district to be better drained and render the soil in said district more tillable.\n\n ... * *\n'And your petitioners aver that a majority of the lands of said drainage district are what is known as swamp or slough land, and under the present condition are not subject to cultivation, but by means of the proposed deepening and enlarging of said Rob Roy creek, as herein described, and as a result of the removal of said timbers and stones in said Rob Roy creek, at the place aforesaid, and of the enlargement of and deepening of said Rob Roy creek, all of the lands in said drainage district will be greatly improved, and made good, tillable land, subject to cultivation.'\n\n If it be a principle of natural justice that private property shall not be taken for public purposes without just compensation, is it not equally a principle of antural justice that no man shall be compelled to pay out money for the benefit of the public without any reciprocal compensation? What difference in equity does it make whether a piece of land is taken for public uses or so many dollars for like purposes? Cary Library v. Bliss, 151 Mass. 364, 378, 379, 7 L. R. A. 765, 25 N. E. 902; Woodward v. Central Vermont R. Co. 180 Mass. 599, 603, 62 N. E. 1051.\n But it is said that this is done under the police power of the state, and that that can be exercised without any provision for \n\n[200 U.S. 561, 600]\n\u00a0\n compensation. It seems to me the police power has become the refuge of every grievous wrong upon private property. Whenever any unjust burden is cast upon the owner of private property which cannot be supported under the power of eminent domain or that of taxation, it is referred to the police power. But no exercise of the police power can disregard the constitutional guaranties in respect to the taking of private property, due process, and equal protection, nor should it override the demands of natural justice. The question in the case is not how far the state may go in compelling a railroad company to expend money in increasing its facilities for transportation, but how far it can go in charging upon the company the cost of improving farms along the line of its road.\n Again, it will be perceived that by the section quoted, if, in consequence of the drainage, a bridge or culvert is required on any public highway, its cost is paid out of the public funds; but whenever a bridge or culvert is required along or across a railroad the company is charged with the cost. In the one case the public pays, and in the other a private owner. It is not pretended that the railway is in any way benefited by the drainage. Its property is not improved, its revenues are not increased. The reconstruction of the bridge or culvert is not needed by it in its work of transportation. It has used this present bridge for over forty years, meeting in that time all the demands of the public for transportation. So that, receiving no benefit, it is charged with the cost of reconstruction,-about $13,000,-in order to improve the value of the lands belonging to private owners in this drainage district, when if a highway crossed at the same place and a new bridge or culvert was required, the cost of it would be paid out of the public funds. I cannot conceive how this can be looked upon as 'the equal protection of the laws.'\n Further, even under the conclusion reached by the court, the plaintiff in error should recover its cost, and in accord with the common practice in this court, the order should be that the judgment be reversed and the case remanded for further proceed- \n\n[200 U.S. 561, 601]\n\u00a0\n ings not inconsistent with our opinion. Stanley v. Schwalby, \n162 \nU.S. 255, 282\n, 40 S. L. ed. 960, 969, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 754. Why should it be compelled to pay two or three hundred dollars in costs when it has shown that the decision below placed an improper charge upon it, the amount of which is not disclosed, and which may be a very substantial sum?\n I am, therefore, constrained to dissent from both the opinion and judgment. \n\n\n\n","21":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCAHEN v. BREWSTER(1906)\nNo. 91\nArgued: November 9, 1906Decided: December 24, 1906\n\n\n\n\n[203 U.S. 543, 544]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles Rosen and Gustave Lemle for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n\n[203 U.S. 543, 546]\n\u00a0\n Mr. F. C. Zacharie for defendants in error.\n\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n The case involves the validity, under the Constitution of the United States, of a burden imposed under the inheritance tax law of the state of Louisiana, passed June 28, 1904\n\n\n Mathias Levy, a resident of New Orleans, died in that city May 26, 1904. He was unmarried and left no ascendants, and was, therefore, without forced heirs. He left a last will and testament of the date of December 23, 1903, in which he named executors and made sundry particular bequests to charitable institutions. He bequeathed the balance of his estate, in equal shares, to his two nieces, Camille Cahen and \n\n[203 U.S. 543, 547]\n\u00a0\n Julie Kahn, constituting them thereby his universal legatees and instituted heirs.\n The will was duly probated in the civil district court for the parish of Orleans, May 30, 1904. An inventory of his estate was taken June 9, 1904, and a supplementary inventory August 3, 1904. The inventories showed the total appraised value of the estate to be $64,676.05. Of this amount, after deducting the debts and charges of the estate and particular legacies, there was left, as the portion going to the universal legatees, $ 42,927.94.\n The final accounting and tableau of distribution was filed August 3, 1904, and approved and homologated by judgment August 16, and the funds ordered to be distributed.\n October 16 a motion was made for a rule on the executors to show cause why they should not pay over the legacies as ordered. In answer to which the executors replied that they were willing to do so, but that it was announced to them by the president of the school board of the parish that he intended to claim in behalf of said board a tax under the inheritance tax law of the state on the funds in their hands 'and the shares coming to said movers.' The executors also alleged the unconstitutionality of the tax and prayed that the school board of the parish, through its president, Andrew H. Wilson, be made a party to the proceedings. Wilson appeared and averred that the taxes were due the state, and not to the school board, and were collectible by the state tax collector, and 'that this suit and the matters at issue herein should be litigated contradictorily with the state tax collector for the district in which the deceased resided when he departed this life.'\n The tax collector appeared. The agents and attorneys in fact of the legatees answered the demand of the school board to be paid the tax that $ 10,000 of the estate was in United States bonds, and not subject to taxation by the state, and averred that an inheritance tax was not due 'to said board for the reason that said act has no application to the property \n\n[203 U.S. 543, 548]\n\u00a0\n under this succession or the legacies due to said movers in the motion aforesaid; that to give it such application would be to make said act retroactive and devest the vested rights of the said movers in said rule, which would be in violation of the Constitution of this state, and especially article 166 thereof, and in violation of the Constitution of the United States of America, and especially  9 of article 1, and the 5th and 14th Amendments thereof, and in violation of the laws of the state and of the land; that it would be a deprivation of property without due process of law and a denial of the equal protection of the laws, in violation of the 5th and 14th Amendments of the Constitution of the United States of America.'\n Judgment was rendered in favor of the tax collector, condemning the executors to pay the tax, less the amount of United States bonds, and less the charitable and religious bequests. The judgment was affirmed by the supreme court of the state.\n The law imposes a tax of 3 per cent 'on direct inheritances and donations to ascendants or descendants,' and 10 per cent upon donations or inheritances to collaterals or strangers. It is provided that the tax is 'to be collected on all successions not finally closed and administered upon, and all successions hereafter opened.' \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[203 U.S. 543, 549]\n\u00a0\n It will be observed that when Levy died, May 26, 1904, and when the will was probated, May 30, 1904, there was no inheritance tax in Louisiana. The act in controversy was passed June 28, 1904.\n In support of the attack made upon the law, it is contended that an inheritance tax is not a tax on property, but on the right or privilege of inheriting, and that the right in the case at bar had been exercised at the moment of the testator's death under the then-existing law, and 'to pass a law exacting such a tax and make it retroactive so as to devest a right previously acquired under then-existing laws is a deprivation of property already acquired, without due process of law, prohibited by the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.'\n To sustain their propositions the plaintiffs in error cite certain articles of the Louisiana Civil Code. \n1\n And it is urged\n___ 1 Article 940. A succession is acquired by the legal heir, who is called by law to the inheritance, immediately after the death of the deceased person to whom he succeeds.\n This rule applies also to testamentary heirs, to instituted heirs, and universal legatees, but not to particular legatees.\n Article 941. The right mentioned in the preceding article is acquired by the heir, by the operation of the law alone, before he has taken any step to put himself in possession, or has expressed any will to accept it.\n Thus, children, idiots, those who are ignorant of the death of the deceased, are not the less considered as being seised of the succession, though they may be merely seised of right, and not in fact.\n Article 942. The heir being considered seised of the succession from the moment of its being opened, the right of possession which the deceased had continues in the person of the heir as if there had been no interruption, and independent of the fact of possession.\n Article 944. The heir being considered as having succeeded to the deceased from the instant of his death, the first effect of this right is that the heir transmits the succession to his own heirs, with the right of accepting or renouncing, although he himself have not accepted it, even in case he was ignorant that the succession was opened in his favor.\n Article 945. The second effect of this right is to authorize the heir to institute all the actions, even possessory ones, which the deceased had a right to institute, and to prosecute those already commenced. For the heir, in everything, represents the deceased, and is of full right in his place, as well for his rights as his obligations.\n Article 1609. When, at the decease of the testator, there are no heirs to whom a proportion of his property is reserved by law, the universal legatee, by the death of the testator, is seised of right of the effects of the succession without being bound to demand the delivery thereof. \n\n[203 U.S. 543, 550]\n\u00a0\n as indubitable that, under the law of Louisiana, a succession is acquired by the legal heir immediately after the death of the deceased, and, by the express terms of the Code, this rule applies to testamentary heirs, to instituted heirs, and universal legatees. In other words, that the acquisition of the succession by plaintiffs in error was at the very moment of Levy's death, and, therefore, necessarily before the act imposing inheritance taxes was passed. To sustain their view plaintiffs in error cite a number of cases decided prior to the decision of the case at bar, and the case of Tulane University v. Board of Assessors, 115 La. 1026, 40 So. 445, decided since the decision in the case at bar. Having established, as it is contended, that by operation of law the property is transmitted immediately from the testator to the heirs, it is also contended that from the very definition of an inheritance tax none could be imposed on plaintiffs in error as legatees of Levy.\n For definitions of an inheritance tax plaintiffs in error adduce United States v. Perkins, \n163 U.S. 625\n, 41 L. ed. 287, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1073; Magoun v. Illinois Trust & Sav. Bank, \n170 U.S. 283\n, 42 L. ed. 1037, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 594; Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 U.S. 41\n, 44 L. ed. 969, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 747. The tax was defined in the Perkins Case to be 'not a tax upon the property itself, but upon its transmission by will or descent;' and in the Magoun Case, 'not one on property, but one on the succession.' In Knowlton v. Moore it was said that such taxes 'rest in their essence upon the principle that death is the generating source from which the particular taxing power takes its being, and that it is the power to transmit, or the transmission from the dead to the living, on which such taxes are more immediately rested.' But these definitions were intended only to distinguish the tax from one on property, and it was not intended to be decided that the tax must attach at the instant of the death of a testator or \n\n[203 U.S. 543, 551]\n\u00a0\n intestate. In other words, we defined the nature of the tax; we did not prescribe the time of its imposition. To have done the latter would have been to prescribe a rule of succession of estates, and usurp a power we did not and do not passess. There is nothing, therefore, in those cases which restrains the power of the state as to the time of the imposition of the tax. It may select the moment of death, or it may exercise its power during any of the time it holds the property from the legatee. 'It is not,' we said in the Perkins Case, 'until it has yielded its contribution to the state that it becomes the property of the legatee.' See also Carpenter v. Pennsylvania, 17 How. 456, 15 L. ed. 127.\n We must turn back, therefore, to the law of Louisiana for the solution of the questions presented in the case at bar. But we are not required to reconcile the Louisiana decisions. We accept that in the case at bar as a correct interpretation of the Code of the state. Nor may we regard Tulane University v. Board of Assessors as irreconcilable with it. That case was brought to enjoin the collection of state and city taxes which had been assessed against the succession of A. C. Hutchinson. The plaintiff university was the universal legatee of Hutchinson, and its property was exempt from taxation under the Constitution of the state. It is true the court said that the Code of the state 'leaves no room whatever for doubt or surmises as to the fact of the property of a deceased person being transmitted directly and immediately to the legal heir, or, in the absence of forced heirs, to the universal legatee, without any intermediate stage, when it would be vested in the successive representative or in the legal abstract called 'succession.\"\n But the decision in the case at bar was not overruled, but distinguished as follows: 'The case of Levy's Succession, 115 La. 377, 39 So. 37, was decided from considerations peculiar to an inheritance tax, and which can have no application in the instant case. This inheritance tax was held to be due notwithstanding that, under the provisions of the Code, the ownership of the prop- \n\n[203 U.S. 543, 552]\n\u00a0\n erty passed to the heirs. The maxim, Le mort saisit le vif, was expressly recognized.' Both decisions, therefore, must be considered as correct interpretations of the Code of the state. It is not our province to pronounceone more decisive than the other, or to pronounce a contradiction between them, which the court which delivered both of them has declared does not exist. We must assume that the Tulane Case approved the view expressed in the case at bar of the rights of legatees, as follows: 'Furthermore, we have said, the legatees acquired no vested right to the property bequeathed which could enable them to successfully defend their inheritance against the demand of the state for the inheritance tax. It was property within the limits of the state, which the state could tax, for purposes mentioned, until it had passed out of the succession of the testator.'\n Plaintiffs in error also contended that the statute denied them the equal protection of the laws. This contention is based on the following provision of the statute: 'This tax to be collected on all successions not finally closed and administered upon, and on all successions hereafter opened.'\n Successions which have been closed, it is said, are exempt from the tax, and a discrimination is made between heirs whose rights have become fixed and vested on the same day. Counsel say: 'The closing of the succession cannot affect the question as to when the right of the heirs vested; and cannot be cause for differentiation among the heirs; and such a classification is purely arbitrary. Besides, such a classification rests on the theory that the tax is one on property, when in fact it is one on the right of inheritance.' But, as we understand, the supreme court made the validity of the tax depend upon the very fact which counsel attack as an improper basis of classification. The court decided the property bequeathed was property the state could tax, 'until it had passed out of the succession of the testator.' It was certainly not improper classification to make the tax depend upon a fact without which it would have been invalid. In \n\n[203 U.S. 543, 553]\n\u00a0\n other words, those who are subject to be taxed cannot complain that they are denied the equal protection of the laws because those who cannot legally be taxed are not taxed.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 1.

STATE OF CALIFORNIA(1906)\nNo. 70\nArgued: Decided: January 2, 1906\n\n\n\n Messrs. Charles H. Garoutte, William N. Goodwin, and Curtis H. Lindley for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n[200 U.S. 87, 89]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. U. S. Webb, E. B. Power, Lewis F. Byington, and I. Harris for defendant in error. \n\n[200 U.S. 87, 90]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n In 1893 a law was enacted in California, imposing a charge on collateral inheritances and on bequests and devises. Cal. Stat. 1893, p. 193. The burdens which the law imposed were not laid upon inheritances, bequests, or devises in favor of the father, mother, husband, wife, children, brother, or sister of a decedent, or wife or widow of a son, or the husband of the daughter of the decedent, adopted children, and certain public and charitable corporations. In the year 1899 the law of 1893 was amended. The amendment caused the charge imposed by the prior act to become applicable in the case of brothers and sisters of a decedent. This resulted because the amendment omitted brothers and sisters from the enumeration made in the act of 1893 of persons to whom the act was not to apply. Cal. Stat. 1899, p. 10.\n In December, 1900, Cornelia E. Campbell died intestate in the city of San Francisco, and her estate was administered upon by the appropriate court. In December, 1901, a final decree was entered, apportioning the estate remaining, after the payment of certain specified amounts, among three brothers and a sister, who are of the plaintiffs in error in this court. One of the sums directed by the decree to be paid before distribution was a collateral inheritance charge of $488.70, under the act of 1893, as amended in 1899\n\n\n The brothers and sister appealed to the supreme court of California from that portion of the decree directing the payment of the charge just mentioned. The validity of the law imposing the burden was assailed upon various grounds of a local nature, and upon the Federal ground that the amendatory act of 1899, in so far as it purported to impose a charge on inheritances, bequests, or devises to brothers and sisters, denied the equal protection of the laws, and was hence repugnant to the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. The supreme court of California affirmed the decree. In doing so it held that the contentions of a local nature were without merit, \n\n[200 U.S. 87, 91]\n\u00a0\n and the act of 1893, as amended by the act of 1899, was not in conflict with the 14th Amendment. 143 Cal. 627, 77 Pac. 674.\n With the questions of a local nature decided by the state court we are not concerned, and shall therefore confine our attention to the Federal question, that is, the alleged repugnancy to the 14th Amendment, imposing the burden in question on brothers and sisters.\n The asserted repugnancy of the statute to the Constitution of the United States, as elaborately argued at bar, rests upon the proposition that the statute denied to brothers and sisters of a decedent the equal protection of the laws, because the statute embraced an inheritance, bequest, or devise in favor of a brother or sister, and did not include bequests or devises in favor of a wife or widow of a son or the husband of a daughter of the decedent.\n Before coming to consider this subject we must notice a wholly independent question, which the plaintiffs in error assert renders a reversal necessary, irrespective of the merits of the contention based upon the Federal question.\n In March, 1905, since the record on this writ of error was filed in this court, the state of California enacted a new inheritance tax law. Cal. Stat. 1905, p. 341. This act differs from the act of 1893, as amended in 1899, in many particulars. It includes within the classes subjected to the burdens imposed persons not embraced in the act of 1893 as amended, and whilst it does not except from its operation persons embraced in the prior act as amended, creates as to some of such persons a different rate, and carves out exemptions as to designated amounts of property, not found in the earlier act. Besides, by the act, brothers and sisters or a descendant of such brothers and sisters, and the wife or widow of a son or a husband of a daughter of a decedent, are made subject to a like charge, less, however, in rate than the one theretofore imposed upon a brother or sister. The act of 1905, as declared in its title, and as manifested by its provisions, was intended to cover generally the subject of inheritance taxes, and by necessary effect operated to amend and \n\n[200 U.S. 87, 92]\n\u00a0\n re-enact the prior laws on the subject. In the body of the act was contained a section (27), expressly repealing the act of 1893 and the amendments thereto, without embodying a clause saving the right of the state in respect to the charges which had accrued to the state under the prior acts.\n The proposition is that the act of 1905 relieved the plaintiffs in error from the duty to pay resulting from the prior laws, even if those laws were not repugnant to the 14th Amendment, and, therefore, the contention is that it becomes our duty to so decide, and hence to reverse the judgment without passing upon the Federal question. The plaintiffs in error do not suggest that the writ of error be dismissed because, by the California statute, upon which they rely, the constitutional question has become merely a moot one, but their contention is that we should maintain jurisdiction and reverse upon the ground previously stated. We cannot assent to the proposition. The statute upon which it is based was enacted subsequently to the decision of the supreme court of California, and if that statute had the effect, as asserted, of depriving the state of power to enforce the judgment below rendered, the right to claim relief, based upon the action of the state, taken since the supreme court of California decided the case, will, we assume, be open to investigation in the state courts, if in deciding the Federal question adversely to the plaintiffs in error, we do not conclude the question referred to. Under these conditions we think it is our duty to decide the Federal question upon which the writ of error was prosecuted, and leave open the purely local question, which has arisen since the decision by the lower court.\n Of course, of our own motion we must determine whether the enactment of the subsequent statute so obviously had the effect of relieving the plaintiffs in error from the burden imposed by the judgment below as to cause the Federal question to become merely a moot one. In view of the general and continuing nature of the legislation contained in the state of 1905 (Bear Lake & River Waterworks & Irrig. Co. v. Garland, \n164 \nU.S. 1, 11\n, 41 S. L. ed. 327, 331, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 7; Pacific Mail S. S. Co. v. Joliffe, 2 Wall. 450, 17 L. ed. 805), we are clearly of the opinion that it cannot \n\n[200 U.S. 87, 93]\n\u00a0\n be said that this case has become a moot one. Especially is this true when the ruling of the supreme court of California in Re Stanford, 126 Cal. 112, 45 L. R. A. 788, 54 Pac. 259, 58 Pac. 462, is considered. In that case, in 1897, while an appeal was pending in the supreme court of California from a decree directing the payment by the estate of Stanford of a charge or charges imposed by authority of the act of 1893, the legislature of California amended the act, and established certain exemptions, which it declared should apply to all property, which had passed by will, succession, or transfer after the approval of the act of 1893, except in those cases where the tax had been paid to the treasurer of the proper county. As to enforce the proper amendatory act would have relieved the estate of Stanford from the burdens of which complaint was made, the question presented to the supreme court of California was whether, if the burdens were authorized by the act of 1893, it was the duty of the court to apply the provisions of the amendatory act, and reverse the judgment pending before it, because the right to enforce the impositions had terminated by the effect of the amendatory act. After deciding that the act of 1893 authorized the burdens complained of, the court, in considering the terms of that statute, the nature and character of an inheritance tax, and the power of the state over the disposition of property in case of death, held that it was its duty to affirm the decree because of the vested right existing in the state under the act of 1893, and because the act of 1897, in attempting to abrogate such vested right, was repugnant to specified provisions of the Constitution of California. Putting aside, then, all question as to the operation of the statute of 1905, and reserving from any decree which we may render all rights, if any, in favor of the plaintiffs in error which may have arisen from the passage of that statute, we are brought to a consideration of the merits of the Federal question.\n The contention is that the assailed law of California was repugnant to the 14th Amendment because it subjected to the burdens of an inheritance tax or charge brothers and sisters of a decedent, and did not subject to any burden such \n\n[200 U.S. 87, 94]\n\u00a0\n strangers to the blood as the wife or widow of a son or the husband of a daughter of a decedent. We do not stop to refer in detail to the many forms of argument by which the contention is sought to be sustained, but content ourselves with stating that, whatever be the form in which the propositions relied on are advanced, they all reduce themselves to and must depend upon the soundness of the contention that the 14th Amendment compels the states, in levying inheritance taxes, and, a fortiori, in regulating inheritances, to conform to blood relationship. That is to say, in their last analysis all the arguments depend upon the proposition that the 14th Amendment has taken away from the states their power to regulate the passage of property by death or the burdens which may be imposed resulting therefrom, because that amendment confines the states absolutely, both as to the passage of such property and as to the burdens imposed thereon, to the rule of blood relationship. To state the proposition is to answer it. Its unsoundness is demonstrated by previous decisions of this court. Magoun v. Illinois Trust & Sav. Bank, \n170 U.S. 283\n, 42 L. ed. 1037, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 594; Orient Ins. Co. v. Daggs, \n172 \nU.S. 557, 562\n, 43 S. L. ed. 552, 554, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 281. It is true that in the first of the cited cases it was expressly declared or impliedly recognized that in the exercise by a state of its undoubted power to regulate the burdens which might be imposed on the passage of property by death, a case might be conceived of where a burden would be so arbitrary as to amount to a denial of the equal protection of the laws. But this suggestion did not imply that the effect of the 14th Amendment was to control the states in the exercise of their plenary authority to regulate inheritances and to determine the persons or objects upon which an inheritance burden should be imposed. In this case there can be no doubt, if the right of a state be conceded to select the persons who may inherit, or upon whom the burden resulting from an inheritance may be imposed, the complaint against the statute is entirely without merit. The whole case, therefore, must rest upon the assumption that because the state of California has not followed the rule of blood relation- \n\n[200 U.S. 87, 95]\n\u00a0\n ship, but, as to particular classes, has applied the rule of affinity by marriage, therefore the constitutional provision guaranteeing the equal protection of the laws was violated. But, unless the effect of the 14th Amendment was inexorably to limit the states in enacting inheritance laws to the rule of blood relationship, such a 'regulation plainly involved the exercise of legislative discretion and judgment, with which the 14th Amendment did not interfere. Such a regulation cannot in reason be said to be an exercise of merely arbitrary power. To illustrate. It assuredly would not be an arbitrary exercise of power for a state to put in one class, for the purpose of inheritance or the burdening of the privilege to inherit, all blood relatives to a designated degree, excluding brothers and sisters, and to place all other and more remote blood relatives, including brothers and sisters, in a second class, along with strangers to the blood. This being true it cannot, without causing the equality clause of the 14th Amendment to destroy the powers of the states on a subject of a purely local character, be held that a classification which takes near relatives by marriage and places them in a class with lineal relatives is so arbitrary as to transcend the limits of governmental power. If this were not true, state legislation preferring a wife in the distribution of the estate of her husband to a brother or sister of the husband would be void as repugnant to the 14th Amendment. So also would be the provision in the California statute we are considering, preferring an adopted child of a decedent to a brother or sister. With the motives of public policy which may induce a state to prefer near relatives by affinity to collateral relatives, we are not concerned, since the 14th Amendment does not deprive a state of the power to regulate and burden the right to inherit, but at the most can only be held to restrain such an exercise of power as would exclude the conception of judgment and discretion, and which would be so obviously arbitrary and unreasonable as to be beyond the pale of governmental authority.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","23":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCARFER v.

Caldwell, a citizen of West Virginia, from custody, taken on the ground that the circuit court was without jurisdiction, as a court of the United States, to issue the writ of discharge the petitioner,-the question of jurisdiction being certified. The case was heard on the petition, the return, and the exhibits attached. It appeared therefrom, in brief, that at a regular biennial session \n\n[200 U.S. 293, 296]\n\u00a0\n of the legislature of West Virginia, the house of delegates passed a resolution instructing the speaker of the house to appoint a committee of three members 'to investigate fully and thoroughly' certain charges and matters set forth therein. The committee was instructed by the resolution to meet as soon as practicable and select one of its members chairman; was given leave to sit after the adjournment of the session; and was empowered 'to compel the attendance of witnesses, and to send for persons and papers, to appoint a sergeant at arms, necessary stenographers and clerks, and to employ such counsel as may be necessary to conduct said investigation.'\n The committee organized, and summoned Charles T. Caldwell to appear before them 'to testify, and the truth to speak, of and concerning the matters and things in said resolution to be inquired of.' He refused to appear, and was taken into custody by W. H. Carfer, sheriff of Wood county, West Virginia, in pursuance of an order of attachment issued by the committee to bring him before them to answer for his contempt for failing to attend and testify. This writ was issued and Caldwell was discharged. 138 Fed. 487.\n The jurisdiction of courts of the United States to issue writs of habeas corpus is limited to cases of persons alleged to be restrained of their liberty in violation of the Constitution or of some law or treaty of the United States, and cases arising under the law of nations.

Rep. 72.\n And it did not appear in this case that petitioner was restrained in violation of the Constitution or any law or treaty of the United States.\n The circuit court held that the house of delegates had no power, under the Constitution of West Virginia, to appoint a committee for the purpose of investigating the matters set forth in the resolution, and to clothe it with power to sit and compel the attendance of witnesses in vacation, but took jurisdiction, nevertheless, on the ground that the condition was \n\n[200 U.S. 293, 297]\n\u00a0\n so 'extraordinary' as to 'warrant the intervention of the first court, state of Federal, applied to.' This view ignored the settled law that a circuit court of the United States has no jurisdiction to issue the writ to release a citizen from imprisonment by another citizen of the same state, merely because the imprisonment is wrongful. The committee was acting under a resolution of the house of delegates, and in pursuance of a law of the state, giving power to committees of either house, authorized to sit during recess, to enforce obedience to summonses issued by them; and if they did not have the power they assumed to exercise, it was because the resolution or law, or both, was or were repugnant to the state Constitution, and the courts of the state are the appropriate tribunals for the vindication of the state Constitution and laws.\n The circuit court was of opinion that the subject which the committee was appointed to investigate was not within the jurisdiction of the legislature, as defined by article 5 of the Constitution of West Virginia, declaring that 'the legislative, executive, and judicial departments shall be separate and distinct, so that neither shall exercise the powers properly belonging to either of the others.' But that objection does not 'present any question under the due process of law clause of the 14th Amendment.' Dreyer v. Illinois, \n187 \nU.S. 71, 83\n, 47 S. L. ed. 79, 85, 23 Sup. Ct.

Peters and \n\n[200 U.S. 255, 256]\n\u00a0\n Fred W.

Hawaii, \n194 U.S. 154\n, 48 L. ed. 916, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 617, and comes here under the same circumstances as that case did. The fishery in question is a sea fishery within the reef in Waialae Iki, island of Oahu, and is claimed by metes and bounds in the complaint. The plaintiffs are owners of the adjacent land under a royal patent following upon an award of the Land Commission, and the only difference between this case and the former one is that in this, the fishery is not described in the royal patent, and that, apart from the question of prescription, upon which we shall say nothing, the plaintiffs have to rely upon the statutes alone. They offered evidence at the trial that, before the action of the King in 1839, those under whom the plaintiffs claim title had enjoyed, from time immemorial, rights similar to those set out in the statutes, and also that they had been in continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession of the konohiki right for sixty years. They offered, in short, to prove that their predecessor in title was within the statutes, and therefore owned the fishery, it not being disputed that if he did, the plaintiffs own it now. The judge rejected the evidence, and entered judgment for the defendant, and, on exceptions, this judgment and that in Damon v. Hawaii were sustained at the same time, in one opinion, by the supreme court. 14 Haw. 465.\n We deem it unnecessary to repeat the ground of our intimation in the former case, that the statutes there referred to created vested rights. We simply repeat that, in our opinion, such was their effect. The fact that they neither identified the specific grantees nor established the boundaries is immaterial when their purport as a grant or confirmation is decided. It is enough that they afforded the means of identification, and that presumably the boundaries can be fixed by reference to existing \n\n[200 U.S. 255, 257]\n\u00a0\n facts, or the application of principles which have been laid down in cases of more or less similar kind.\n The omission of the plaintiffs' predecessor in title to establish his right to the fishery before the Land Commission does not prejudice their case. See Kenoa v. Meek, 6 Haw. 63. That commission was established to determine the title to lands as against the Hawaiian government. In practice it treated the fisheries as not within its jurisdiction, and it would seem to have been right in its view. See Akeni v. Wong Ka Mau, 5 Haw. 91.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","25":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHATTANOOGA FOUNDRY & PIPE WORKS v. CITY OF ATLANTA(1906)\nNo. 94\nArgued: Decided: December 3, 1906\n\n\n\n\n[203 U.S. 390, 391]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Frank Spurlock and Foster V. Brown for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n\n[203 U.S. 390, 395]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George Westmoreland, Churchill P. Goree, Linton A. Dean, and J. L. Foust for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is an action by the city of Atlanta (Georgia) against two Tennessee corporations, members of the trust or combination held unlawful in Addyston Pipe & Steel Co. v. United States, \n175 U.S. 211\n, 44 L. ed. 136, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 96. The object of the suit is to recover threefold damages for alleged injury to the city in its business or property, under  7 of the act of July 2, 1890, chap. 647 (26 Stat. at L. 209, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3202). The alleged injury is that the city, being engaged in conducting a system of waterworks, and wishing to buy iron water pipe, was led, by reason of the illegal arrangements between the members of the trust, to purchase the pipe from the Anniston Pipe & Foundry Company, an Alabama corporation, at a price much above what was reasonable or the pipe was worth. The purchase was made after a simulated \n\n[203 U.S. 390, 396]\n\u00a0\n competition, at a price fixed by the trust, and embracing a bonus to be divided among the members. The plaintiffs in error demurred to the declaration, and pleaded not guilty, and that the action accrued more than one year and more than three years before the suit was brought, relying upon  2772 and 2773 of the Code of Tennessee, the eastern district of Tennessee being the district in which the suit was brought. The demurrer to the declaration was overruled and the plaintiff had a verdict and judgment in the circuit court. The verdict was for the difference between the price paid and the market or fair price that the city would have had to pay under natural conditions had the combination been out of the way, together with an attorney's fee. The judgment trebled the damages. It was affirmed by the circuit court of appeals, the plaintiffs in error having saved their rights at every stage. The discussions of the law took place before the jury trial was reached. They will be found in 64 L.R.A. 721, 61 C. C. A. 387, 127, Fed. 23, and 101 Fed. 900. For our purposes it seems unnecessary to state the case at greater length.\n The facts gave rise to a cause of action under the act of Congress. The city was a person within the meaning of  7 by the express provision of  8. It was Injured in its property, at least, if not in its business of furnishing water, by being led to pay more than the worth of the pipe. A person whose property is diminished by a payment of money wrongfully induced is injured in his property. The transaction which did the wrong was a transaction between parties in different states, if that be material. The fact that the defendants and others had combined with the seller led to the excessive charge, which the seller made in the interest of the trust by arrangement with its members, and which the buyer was induced to pay by the semblance of competition, also arranged by the members of the trust. One object of the combination was to prevent other producers than the Anniston Pipe & Foundry Company, the seller, from competing in sales to the plaintiff. There can be no doubt that Congress had power to give an \n\n[203 U.S. 390, 397]\n\u00a0\n action for damages to an individual who suffers by breach of the law. W. W. Montague & Co. v. Lowry, \n193 U.S. 38\n, 48 L. ed. 608, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 307. The damage complained of must almost or quite always be damage in property, that is, in the money of the plaintiff, which is owned within some particular state. In other words, if Congress had power to make the acts which led to the damage illegal, it could authorize a recovery for the damage, although the latter was suffered wholly within the boundaries of one state. Finally, the fact that the sale was not so connected in its terms with the unlawful combination as to be unlawful (Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co. \n184 U.S. 540\n, 46 L. ed. 679, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 431) in no way contradicts the proposition that the motives and inducements to make it were so affected by the combination as to constitute a wrong. In most cases where the result complained of as springing from a tort is a contract, the contract is lawful, and the tort goes only to the motives which led to its being made, as when it is induced by duress or fraud.\n The limitation of five years in Rev. Stat.  1047, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 727, to any 'suit or prosecution for any penalty or forfeiture, pecuniary or otherwise, accruing under the laws of the United States,' does not apply. The construction of the phrase 'suit for a penalty,' and the reasons for that construction, have been stated so fully by this court that it is not necessary to repeat them. Indeed, the proposition hardly is disputed here. Huntington v. Attrill, \n146 \nU.S. 657, 668\n, 36 S. L. ed. 1123, 1128, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 224; Brady v. Daly, \n175 \nU.S. 148, 155\n, 156 S., 44 L. ed. 109, 112, 113, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 62.\n Thus we come to the main question of the case, namely, which limitation under the laws of Tennessee is applicable, the matter being left to the local law by the silence of the statutes of the United States. Rev. Stat.  721, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 581; Campbell v. Haverhill, \n155 U.S. 610\n, 39 L. ed. 280, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 217. The material provisions of the Tennessee Code are as follows: By article 2769 (Shannon, 4466) all civil actions are to be commenced within the periods prescribed, with immaterial exceptions. By article 2772 (Shannon, 4469) actions, among others, for 'statute penalties, within one year after cause of action accrued.' By 2773 \n\n[203 U.S. 390, 398]\n\u00a0\n (Shannon, 4470) 'actions for injuries to personal or real property; actions for the detention or conversion of personal property, within three years from the accruing of the cause of action.' By 2776 (Shannon, 4473) certain actions enumerated, 'and all other cases not expressly provided for, within ten years after the cause of action accrued.' The circuit court of appeals held that the case did not fall within 2772 or 2773, but only within 2776, and therefore was not barred. Although the decision is appealed from, as this question involves the construction of local law, we cannot but attribute weight to the opinion of the judge who rendered the judgment, in view of his experience upon the supreme court of Tennessee. And although doubts were raised by the argument, we have come to agree with his interpretation in the main.\n As to the article touching actions for statute penalties, notwithstanding some grounds for distinguishing it from Rev. Stat.  1047, which were pointed out, so far as this liability under the laws of the United States is concerned we must adhere to the construction of it which we already have adopted. The chief argument relied upon is that this suit is for injury to personal property, and so within article 2773. It was pressed upon us that formerly the limitations addressed themselves to forms of action; that actions upon the case, such as this would have been, were barred in three years, following Stat. 21 Jac. I. chap. 21,  3, and that when a change was necessitated by the doing away with the old forms of action, it is not to be supposed that the change was intended to affect the substance, or more than the mode of stating the time allowed. Of course, it was argued also that this was an injury to property, within the plain meaning of the words. But we are satisfied, on the whole, and in view of its juxtaposition with detention and conversion, that the phrase has a narrower intent. It may be that it has a somewhat broader scope than was intimated below, and that some wrongs are within it besides physical damage to tangible property. But there is a sufficiently clear distinction between injuries to property \n\n[203 U.S. 390, 399]\n\u00a0\n and 'injured in his business or property,' the latter being the language of the act of Congress. A man is injured in his property when his property is diminished. He would not be said to have suffered an injury to his property unless the harm fell upon some object more definite and less ideal than his total wealth. A trademark, or a trade name, or a title, is property, and is regarded as an object capable of injury in various ways. But when a man is made poorer by an extravagant bill we do not regard his wealth as a unity, or the tort, if there is one, as directed against that unity as an object. We do not go behind the person of the sufferer. We say that he has been defrauded or subjected to duress, or whatever it may be, and stop there. It was urged that the opening article to which we have referred expressed an intention to bar all civil actions, but that hardly helps the construction of any particular article following, since the dragnet at the end, 2776, catches all cases not 'expressly provided for.' On the whole case we agree with the court below.\n Judgment affirmed.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice Peckham dissent. \n\n\n\n","26":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHRISTOPHER v.

Rev. Stat.  5151, 5152, 5234, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 3465, 3507\n\n\n Proceeding under these statutes the receiver of the First National Bank of Florida brought this action against Henrietta S. Christopher (her husband, John G. Christopher, being joined as codefendant) to recover the amount due from her as a shareholder of that bank under an assessment made by the Comptroller of the Currency against the stockholders of that bank in order to pay its debts.\n The case made by the record is this: At the time of the failure \n\n[201 U.S. 216, 222]\n\u00a0\n of the bank, on March 14th, 1903, fifteen shares of its stock stood in the name of Mrs. Christopher. The stock was bequeathed to her by her father in 1886, and his executors caused it to be transferred to her name on the books of the bank. This was done without any request from or direction by her. Although not aware of such transfer until the stock had been issued and delivered to her in November, 1887, since that date she has held the certificate for the fifteen shares. It is shown that in 1894, she joined with other shareholders in securing an amendment of the bank's articles of association, which extended the corporate existence of the bank until the close of business on May 26th, 1914. It further appears that she received several semiannual dividends, from 3 to 5 per cent, on her stock from November, 1887, up to and including February 1st, 1896, at which time the last dividend on the capital stock of the bank was declared and paid to stockholders. The dividends were paid by checks made payable to her order and personally indorsed by her. After the transfer of the stock Mrs. Christopher's name appeared on the registry of shareholders as the owner of the fifteen shares of stock, and the books kept by the bank showed the amount of dividends paid to her from time to time on those shares.\n A personal judgment was rendered in the circuit court against Mrs. Christopher for the amount due on the assessment made by the Comptroller. The judgment was affirmed by the circuit court of appeals, which held that nothing in the law of Florida disabled married women from owning, in their own right, stock in national banking associations, and from incurring the liabilities resulting therefrom. 67 C. C. A. 438, 134 Fed. 842.\n That the Comptroller had authority to make the assessment against stockholders, and that such assessment is conclusive as to the amount to be collected, cannot be questioned. Kennedy v. Gibson, 8 Wall. 498, 19 L. ed. 476; Casey v. Galli, \n94 U.S. 681\n, 24 L. ed. 307; Keyser v. Hitz, \n133 U.S. 138\n, 33 L. ed. 531, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 290; Bushnell v. Leland, \n164 \nU.S. 684, 685\n, 41 S. L. ed. 598, 599, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 209. \n\n[201 U.S. 216, 223]\n\u00a0\n Did the coverture of Mrs. Christopher at the time her name was placed on the books of the bank as a shareholder, as well as when she received the certificate of stock, protect her against a personal judgment at law for the amount due under the assessment made by the Comptroller of the Currency? That is the controlling question in the case.\n This question is, we think, substantially answered by the judgment of this court in Keyser v. Hitz, \n133 U.S. 138\n, 150-152, 33 L. ed. 531, 537, 538, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 290, 294, 295. That was an action at law against Mrs. Hitz, a married woman, who owned shares of stock in a savings bank which was converted into a national bank. The action against her was based on an assessment made by the Comptroller of the Currency. One of the contentions in the case was that the coverture of the defendant at the time she acquired the stock, as well as when the bank failed, protected her against an assessment under the act of Congress. The transaction occurred in the District of Columbia, where the bank was located. It was not contended that the defendant was incapacitated by the laws of the District from becoming the owner of bank stock, and hence the court did not consider what would have been the result if the local statutes had prohibited married women from becoming the owners of bank stock. Upon that basis, the court said: 'Assuming, then, that she was not incapacitated from becoming the owner of stock in a bank, and that she was a shareholder in the savings bank,-she became, upon the conversion of that bank into a national bank, a shareholder in the latter. Rev. Stat.  5154, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3466. In that event she became, by force of the statute, individually responsible to the amount of her stock, at the par value thereof, for the contracts, debts, and engagements of the national bank, equally and ratably with other shareholders. Section 5151, which imposes such individual responsibility upon the shareholders of national banks, makes no exception in favor of married women. The only persons holding shares of national bank stock, whom the statute exempts from this personal responsibility, are executors, administrators, guardians, or trustees.  5152. It is not for \n\n[201 U.S. 216, 224]\n\u00a0\n the courts, by mere construction, to recognize an exemption which Congress has not given.' Again: 'We are of opinion that the coverture of the defendant did not prevent the plaintiff from recovering a judgment against her for the amount of the assessment in question, if she was, within the meaning of the statute, a shareholder in the bank at the time of its suspension. But the question as to what property may be reached in the enforcement of such judgment is not before us, and we express no opinion upon it.'\n The present defendant insists that she was incapacitated under the Constitution of Florida and under the decisions of the supreme court of that state from becoming the owner of the stock bequeathed to her by her father. In support of this proposition we are referred to the following provision in a statute of Florida enacted November 6th, 1829: 'The common and statute laws of England which are of a general, and not of a local, nature, with the exception hereinafter mentioned, down to the 4th day of July, 1776, be and the same are hereby declared to be in force in this state, provided the same be not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States and the acts of the legislature of this state.' Also, to the following provisions of the Constitution of Florida: 'All property, real and personal, of a wife, owned by her before marriage or lawfully acquired afterward by gift, devise, bequest, descent, or purchase, shall be her separate property, and the same shall not be liable for the debts of her husband without her consent, given by some instrument in writing, executed according to the law respecting conveyances by married women.' Art. 11,  1. 'A married woman's real or personal property may be charged in equity and sold or the uses, rents, and profits thereof sequestrated for the purchase money thereof; or for money or things due upon any agreement made by her in writing for the benefit of her separate property, or for the price of any property purchased by her, or for labor and material used with her knowledge or assent in \n\n[201 U.S. 216, 225]\n\u00a0\n the construction of buildings, or repairs, or improvements upon her property, or for agricultural or other labor bestowed thereon with her knowledge or consent.' Art. 11,  2.\n The argument is that at common law a married woman could not make, or bind herself personally by, a contract, and was incapable, by the law of Florida, as at common law, of entering into a contract, at least one that would subject her to personal liability; that the relation of a shareholder to a national banking association was of a contractual character; and consequently, to render a personal judgment against the defendant Mrs. Christopher was, in effect, to hold her personally bound by a contract which, under the laws of Florida, she was incapable of making.\n The vice in this argument is in the assumption that the liability of Mrs. Christopher as a shareholder arises wholly out of contract between herself and the bank or its creditors; whereas, upon becoming a shareholder, she made, strictly, no direct contract with anyone, and became, as was held in Keyser v. Hitz, supra, by force of the statute individually responsible to the amount of her stock, for the contracts, debts, and engagements of the bank equally and ratably with other shareholders. Such statutory liability was created for the protection of creditors, and in order to strengthen the bank in the confidence of the public. The bank, although its shares of stock were private property, was an instrumentality of the general government in the conduct of its affairs. Farmers' & M. Nat. Bank v. Dearing, \n91 \nU.S. 29, 33\n, 23 S. L. ed. 196, 198. In Davis v. Elmira Sav. Bank, \n161 \nU.S. 275, 283\n, 40 S. L. ed. 700, 701, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 502, 503, the court said that 'national banks are instrumentalities of the Federal government, created for a public purpose, and as such necessarily subject to the paramount authority of the United States.' This principle was reaffirmed in Easton v. Iowa, \n188 \nU.S. 220, 237\n, 47 S. L. ed. 452, 459, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 288. See also Pacific Nat. Bank v. Mixter, \n124 U.S. 721\n, 31 L. ed. 567, 8 Sup.

If  5151 had provided that subscribing to stock or taking shares of stock amounted to a promise directly to every creditor, then that liability would have been a liability by contract. But the words of  5151 do not mean that the stockholder promises the creditor as surety for the debts of the corporation, but merely imposes a liability on him as secondary to those debts, which debts remain distinct, and to which the stockholder is not a party. The liability is a consequence of the breach by the corporation of its contract to pay, and is collateral and statutory. . . . But here the right to sue did not obtain until the Comptroller of the Currency had acted, and his order was the basis of the suit. The statute of limitations did not commence to run until assessment made, and then it ran as against an action to enforce the statutory liability, and not an action for breach of contract.'\n In Robinson v. Turrentine, 59 Fed. 554, 555, it was held that the liability of a married woman for an assessment upon national bank stock did not grow out of contract, although it was one of a class of liabilities which may be enforced by an action in from ex contractu. In the same case it was said: 'By the banking laws of the United States all the shares in the stock of national banks are liable to an assessment like the one levied on the stock of plaintiff's bank. To hold that a state law, were there such a law, could except certain shares from the liability, would enable states to defeat the policy of the Federal government in establishing the national banking system. That the Congress has power to establish and legislate for such banks has not, since 1819, been an open question. M'Culloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 4 L. ed. 579. If a purchase of stocks in a national bank by a married woman without the written consent of her husband gives her the ownership of such stock, judgment must be given against the feme de- \n\n[201 U.S. 216, 227]\n\u00a0\n fendant. If she owned the stock at the failure of the bank, she is liable to the assessment; if she did not, she is not liable. While the Federal government exclusively controls the question of the liabilities of stockholders in national banks, it is not doubted but that a state has power to say that, for reasons seeming good to its legislature, and not in conflict with organic law, a particular class of persons shall not be permitted to own particular classes of property.'\n In Kerr v. Urie, 86 Md. 72, 77, 38 L. R. A. 119, 121, 63 Am. St. Rep. 493, 496, 37 Atl. 789, 791, it was held that a married woman residing in Maryland was capable of holding shares of stock in a national bank located in Texas, and as such shareholder was subject to the personal liability imposed by the national banking laws, without regard to the question whether she was entitled, under the laws of the state where the bank was located, to become the owner of such stock. The court said: 'We conclude, therefore, that by virtue of the transfer in Maryland, and without regard to the laws of Texas, Mrs. Urie became the equitable and real holder of the stock in question; and if this be so, no question as to her powers of disposition, or as to whether she is or is not capable under the laws of Texas to make contracts, can arise in this case, for the liability of a stockholder arises not under any law of Texas, which it is contended has not been proven in this case, but under the act of Congress; and the contracts which it is claimed she is liable on are not her contracts, but the contracts of the bank. Witters v. Sowles, 1 L. R. A. 64, 35 Fed. 641; U. S. Rev. Stat.  5152. The righ to be a stockholder is given to her by the law of the state where she resides, and her rights and liabilities as such as are provided by the acts of Congress.'\n Recurring to the provisions in the statute and Constitution of Florida it is clear that they do not incapacitate a married woman in that state from becoming the owner, by request or otherwise, of stock in a national banking association. On the contrary, it seems that all property, real or personal, owned by a married woman before marriage, or lawfully acquired afterward by gift, devise, bequest, descent, or purchase, is her \n\n[201 U.S. 216, 228]\n\u00a0\n separate property. Nevertheless, it is said, by the settled course of decisions in that state a married woman cannot bind herself personally by contract at law or in equity, or by becoming a partner, or by making a promissory note. Dollner v. Snow, 16 Fla. 86; Hodges v. Price, 18 Fla. 342; Goss v. Furman, 21 Fla. 406; De Graum v. Jones, 23 Fla. 83, 6 So. 925, and Randall v. Bourgardez, 23 Fla. 264, 11 Am. St. Rep. 379, 2 So. 310. But those cases are not in point here; for, in each of them, the personal liability attempted to be imposed upon the married woman arose entirely out of contract, express or implied, on her part, and not by force of any statute. The argument made in this case in behalf of Mrs. Christopher assumes that the liability sought to be fastened upon her arises wholly out of contract; that is, out of an implied obligation, at the time her name was placed on the registry of shares and she received dividends, to contribute to the extent of the value of such shares to the payment of the debts of the bank. But that implied obligation, although contractual in its nature, could not, standing alone, be made the basis of this action. Without the statute she could not be made liable individually for the debts of the bank at all. No implied obligation to contribute to the payment of such debts could arise from the single fact that she became and was a shareholder. Her liability for the debts of the bank is created by the statute, although in a limited sense there is an element of contract in her having become a shareholder; and the right of the receiver to maintain this action depends upon, and has its sanction in, the statute creating liability against each shareholder, in whatever way he may have become such. There have been cases in which there appeared such elements of contract as were deemed sufficient, in particular circumstances, to support an action. First Nat. Bank v. Hawkins, \n174 \nU.S. 364, 372\n, 43 S. L. ed. 1007, 1011, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 739; Whitman v. National Bank, \n176 \nU.S. 559, 565\n, 566 S., 44 L. ed 587, 591, 592, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 477; Matteson v. Dent, \n176 U.S. 521\n, 44 L. ed. 571, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 419. But that fact does not justify the contention that an action upon an assessment made by the Comptroller is not based upon the statute. \n\n[201 U.S. 216, 229]\n\u00a0\n In McDonald v. Thompson, \n184 \nU.S. 71, 73\n, 46 S. L. ed. 437, 439, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 297, 298, which was the case of a formal subscription to the capital stock of a national bank, and which also involved the meaning of the words 'contract or promise in writing' in a statute of limitations, the court said: 'There was no contract in writing with the creditors or depositors of the bank, and none with the bank itself, to which the receiver could be said to be a privy, except to pay for the stock as originally issued. Granting there was a contract with the creditors to pay a sum equal to the value of the stock taken, in addition to the sum invested in the shares, this was a contract created by the statute, and obligatory upon the stockholders by reason of the statute existing at the time of their subscription; but it was not a contract within the meaning of the Nebraska act [of limitation], since the writing-that is, the subscription-contained no reference whatever to the statutory obligation, and no promise to respond beyond the amount of the subscription. In none of the numerous cases upon the subject in this court is this obligation treated as an express contract, but as one created by the statute and implied from the express contract of the stockholders to take and pay for shares in the association.' All shareholders of stock in national banks become such, subject to the condition, declared by statute, that liability, to the extent of their shares, is imposed upon them for the contracts, debts, and engagements of the bank. The statute, in effect, says to all who become owners of national bank stock, no matter in what way they become shareholders, that they cannot enjoy the benefits accruing to shareholders, and escape liability for the contracts, debts, and engagements of the bank. In other words, the government that created the bank has prescribed the terms upon which ownership of its shares could be acquired, and individual liability incurred shareholders,-executors, administrators, guardians, or trustees only being exempted from individual liability. No exception is made in favor of married women holding property. If the Constitution or statutes of Florida had expressly incapacitated or forbidden \n\n[201 U.S. 216, 230]\n\u00a0\n a married woman from becoming, under any circumstances, the owner of bank shares,-as counsel for plaintiff in error insists is the case,-a question would be presented that does not arise upon the record of this case; and as the local law does not forbid married women from becoming the owners of bank stock, we do not go beyond what is necessary for the decision of the present case under the national banking law. All that we now decide is that the court below properly interpreted the statute, and did not err in rendering a personal judgment against Mrs. Christopher, as a shareholder in the bank, for the amount due under the assessment of the Comptroller. In what way the plaintiff may proceed in order to obtain satisfaction of the judgment is not a question to be determined in this action.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice White and Mr. Justice McKenna concur in the result. \n\n\n\n","27":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCINCINNATI, N O & T P R.

Yerkes and Robert Harding for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case was considered by this court at the same time with the Alabama G. S. R. Co. v. Thompson (just decided) \n200 U.S. 206\n, 50 L. ed . --, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 161, and we need not repeat the discussion therein had as to the construction of the removal act of 1887 [24 Stat. at L. 552, chap. 373, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901 p. 508], under the decisions of this court. This case has an additional feature which we shall proceed to notice. The action was brought by \n\n[200 U.S. 221, 222]\n\u00a0\n the defendant in error as administrator of Edward Cook, deceased. The petition charged that the plaintiff's intestate was engaged in the yards as a brakeman and switchman and was uncoupling and giving attention to the cars of the defendant company, which cars and an engine attached thereto were in charge of the defendant Milligan, as engineer, engaged in operating, managing, and controlling the same for the defendant company, and, while plaintiff's intestate was thus engaged, the defendant company and the defendant Milligan caught and crushed said Cook's body between the cars of the train, by and through the gross negligence of Milligan and of defendant company, in the operation, management, and control of the engine and train; that the injuries to the plaintiff resulted in his death a few minutes thereafter, and when so caught and crushed said Cook was engaged in discharging his duties as brakeman to the defendant company; the death of said Cook was caused as aforesaid by the gross negligence and carelessness of defendant company and Milligan. The railroad company filed its petition in the state court for the removal of the cause to the United States circuit court for the eastern district of Kentucky, upon the ground that there was a separable controversy between the petitioner, a resident and citizen of Ohio, and the plaintiff below, who was a citizen and resident of Kentucky. The circuit court of Mercer county refused to remove the case, and a verdict and judgment were rendered for the plaintiff below. Upon appeal to the court of appeals of Kentucky, the judgment was reversed for errors occurring at the trial. At a second trial the verdict and judgment were rendered for the plaintiff below, which was again reversed and remanded. On the third trial the verdict and judgment were again rendered for the plaintiff below, which judgment was affirmed by the court of appeals of Kentucky. The sole question argued here is as to the correctness of the state court in refusing to order the removal of the cause, which judgment was affirmed by the Kentucky court of appeals.\n The action for death by negligence is regulated by the Kentucky \n\n[200 U.S. 221, 223]\n\u00a0\n Constitution and statutes. Section 241 of the Constitution provides:\n'Whenever the death of a person shall result from an injury inflicted by negligence or wrongful act, then, in every such case, damages may be recovered for such death from the corporations and persons so causing the same.'\n\n Section 6 of the Kentucky statutes reads as follows:\n'Whenever the death of a person shall result from an injury inflicted by negligence or wrongful act, then, in every such case, damages may be recovered for such death from the person or persons, company or companies, corporation or corporations, their agents or servants, causing the same, and when the act is wilful or the negligence is gross, punitive damages may be recovered, and the action to recover such damages shall be prosecuted by the personal representative of the deceased.'\n\n This statute undertakes to give an action for negligence against the companies or corporations responsible therefor and their agents or servants causing the same. The statute has been before the court of appeals of Kentucky, and in the case of Winston v. Illinois C. R. Co. 111 Ky. 954, 957, 55 L. R. A. 603, 604, 65 S. W. 13, that court said of the state Constitution and this statute:\n'The Constitution and statutes of this state, as construed by the repeated adjudications of this court, make the railroad company liable for the acts of the agents and servants in charge of its trains. If a servant is guilty of such negligence, while acting for his master, as will make the master responsible, then, in such a case, the servant is personally and equally responsible with the master for the damages resulting from the negligent act. The mere fact that the master may be responsible for the wrongful act of the servant does not relieve the servant from a joint liability with the master for the wrongful act which produced the injury and damage.'\n\n In the case under consideration, in the opinion of the court upon the question of right of removal, while it expressed the \n\n[200 U.S. 221, 224]\n\u00a0\n view that the weight of authority was in favor of the right to join the master and servant in actions for negligence, it reiterates its former view of the Kentucky statutes, citing Chesapeake & O. R. Co. v. Dixon, 104 Ky. 608, 47 S. W. 615, and the Winston Case, above referred to, and quoted from that case with approval:\n'By the terms of this section, where death results from the negligent act, a recovery may be had therefor against the person or persons, company or companies, corporation or corporations, their agents or servants, causing the same. . . . The plaintiff has a right to proceed severally or jointly against those who are liable for the injury inflicted resulting in death.'\n\n We then have a case in which the extent of the right to recover damages for negligence is prescribed by the Constitution and statutes of the state of Kentucky, and which the courts of that state have construed to give a joint cause of action against the corporation and its agents or servants causing the same. In a recent case this court had occasion to deal with the question of removal under the separable controversy clause ( Southern R. Co. v. Carson, \n194 U.S. 136\n, 48 L. ed. 907, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 609), on a writ of error to the supreme court of South Carolina. An action had been jointly brought in the state court against the Southern Railway Company, a corporation of Virginia, and Arwood, conductor, and Miller, the engineer, residents of Greenville county, South Carolina, charging the joint and concurrent negligence of the servant and the company, because of a defective coupler and the careless management of the train, and the railroad company claimed to have been deprived of the right of removal by the allegation of a joint and concurrent tort, unless the state court would charge that no recovery could be had unless a joint liability was shown, which it refused to do. After commenting upon the action, the Chief Justice, who delivered the opinion of the court, stated that the right of removal depends upon the act of Congress, that the company, upon the face of the pleadings, did not come within the act, and had made no effort to assert this right, and, citing the passage in Powers v. \n\n[200 U.S. 221, 225]\n\u00a0\n Chesapeake & O. R. Co. \n169 U.S. 92\n, 42 L. ed. 673, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 264, quoted in the Alabama G. S. R. Co. v. Thompson, \n200 U.S. 206\n, 50 L. ed . --, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 161, said:\n'The view thus expressed was reiterated in Chesapeake & O. R. Co. v. Dixon, \n179 U.S. 131\n, 45 L. ed. 121, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 67, where the subject was much considered and cases cited. Reference was there made to the fact that many courts have held the identification of master and servant to be so complete that the liability of both may be enforced in the same action. And such is the law in South Carolina. Schumpert v. Southern R. Co. 65 S. C. 332, 95 Am. St. Rep. 802, 43 S. E. 813. In that case it was held that, under the state Code of Civil Procedure, in actions ex delicto, acts of negligence and wilful tort might be commingled in one statement as causes of injury; that master and servant are jointly liable as joint tort feasors for the tort of the servant, commited within the scope of his employment, and while in the master's service; that the objection that if master and servant were made jointly liable for the negligence of the latter the master could not call on the servant for contribution was without merit, as the rule was, as laid down by Mr. Cooley (Torts, p. 145), that: 'As between the company and its servant, the latter alone is the wrongdoer, and in calling upon him for indemnity, the company bases no claim upon its own misfeasance or default, but upon that of the servant himself.' And see Gardner v. Southern R. Co. 65 S. C. 341, 43 S. E. 816. In Rucker v. Smoke, 37 S. C. 377, 34 Am. St. Rep. 758, 16 S. E. 40, and Skipper v. Clifton Mfg. Co. 58 S. C. 143, 36 S. E. 509, it was decided that in actions such as this exemplary damages may be recovered. The suggestion that the state deprived the company of its property by the rulings of the supreme court calls for no remark.'\n\n While the case did not show an attempt to remove, the discussion of the subject by the Chief Justice strongly intimates that if the action was properly joint in the forum in which it was being prosecuted, it could not be removed as a separable controversy under the act of Congress. We have under consideration an action for tort which, by the Constitution and \n\n[200 U.S. 221, 226]\n\u00a0\n laws of the state, as interpreted by the highest court in the state, gives a joint remedy against master and servant to recover for negligent injuries. This court has repeatedly held that a separable controversy must be shown upon the face of the petition or declaration, and that the defendant has no right to say that an action shall be several which the plaintiff elects to make joint. See cases cited in Alabama G. S. R. Co. v. Thompson, 200 U. S. --, 50 L. ed. --, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 161. A state has an unquestionable right by its Constitution and laws to regulate actions for negligence, and where it has provided that the plaintiff in such cases may proceed jointly or severally against those liable for the injury, and the plaintiff, in due course of law and in good faith, has filed a petition electing to sue for a joint recovery given by the laws of the state, we know of nothing in the Federal removal statute which will convert such action into a separable controversy for the purpose of removal, because of the presence of a nonresident defendant therein, properly joined in the action under the Constitution and laws of that state wherein it is conducting its operations, and is duly served with process.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","28":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCINCINNATI, P B S & P PACKET CO. v.

A judgment in their favor was sustained by the supreme court of the state, although the petition in error to that court set up that the contract was illegal under the act of Congress of July 2, 1890, chap. 647. 26 Stat. at L. 209, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3200. No opinion was delivered, but a certificate that this objection was relied upon, and that it necessarily was considered, was made part of the record by that court. Therefore the present writ of error properly was allowed. The record shows that the question was raised, and the certificate shows that it was not treated as having been raised too late under the local procedure,-a point upon which the state court is the judge. It is enough that the Federal question was raised and necessarily decided by the highest court of the state. Farmers' & M. Ins. Co. v. Dobney, \n189 U.S. 301\n, 47 L. ed. 821, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 565.\n The contract was an indenture between the Portsmouth & Pomeroy Packet Company, George W. and William Bay, of the first part, and the Cincinnati, Portsmouth, Big Sandy, & Pomeroy Packet Company, of the second part. By this instrument the parties of the first part sell to the latter two steamers, two deck barges, two coal flats, and $500 in the stock of the Coney Island Wharf Boat Company, for $30,500, to be paid as therein provided. The party of the second part also agrees to pay to the Bays $3, 600 annually in advance for five years, provided, however, that in case of opposition to its boats by other boats running from Cincinnati to Portsmouth, Ohio, or to points above Portsmouth, not including points above Syracuse, Ohio, causing it to carry freight and passengers at certain exceedingly low rates, the time of payment of the instalments shall be postponed until the opposition has ceased. It is \n\n[200 U.S. 179, 183]\n\u00a0\n further agreed that if the opposition continues for two years without interruption, and no annual payment be made, the Bays may cancel the agreement.\n'It is also agreed as a part of the consideration of this agreement' that for five years the parties of the first part, or either of them, shall not be 'engaged in running or in operating, or in any way be interested in any freight and passenger packet or business, or either of them, at and from Cincinnati, Ohio, to Portsmouth, Ohio, and intermediate points; nor at and from Portsmouth, Ohio, to Cincinnati, Ohio, and intermediate points; nor at and from Syracuse, Ohio, or points between Syracuse and Portsmouth, Ohio, to or for points below Portsmouth, Ohio,' with a qualification as to the towing and barge business, so long as it does not interfere with the other party's freight and passenger business from Portsmouth to Cincinnati. 'It is also understood in this agreement that the party of the second part will maintain the rates charged by the parties of the first part on business above Portsmouth, Ohio, said rates, however, never to exceed railroad rates between said points.' The last- mentioned covenants, set forth in this paragraph, are especially relied upon as making the contract illegal, as in restraint of trade. The previously mentioned suspension of instalments in case of opposition rising to a certain height also is referred to as a combination to aid the purchaser in getting a monopoly of river trade between Portsmouth and Cincinnati, including, it is said, some Kentucky ports.\n\n It might be enough, perhaps, to answer the whole contention, that it does not appear on the record that the contract necessarily contemplated commerce between the states. It would be an extravagant consequence to draw from Hanley v. Kansas City Southern R. Co. \n187 U.S. 617\n, 47 L. ed. 333, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 214,-a case of a state attempting to fix rates over a railroad route passing outside its limits,-that the contract was within the Sherman act because the boats referred to might sail over soil belonging to Kentucky in passing between two Ohio points. It may be noticed further that Ohio equally has jurisdiction on the river. Wedding v. Meyler, 192 \n\n[200 U.S. 179, 184]\n\u00a0\n U. S. 573, 48 L. ed. 570, 66 L. R. A. 833, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 322. A contract is not to be assumed to contemplate unlawful results unless a fair construction requires it upon the established facts. Technically, perhaps, there might be some trouble in saying that the supreme court of Ohio did not decide the case on the ground that the illegality was not made out as matter of fact.\n But we do not like to put our decision upon technical reasoning where there is at least a fair surmise that such reasoning does not meet the realities of the case. We will suppose, then, that the contract does not leave commerce among the states untouched. But even on this supposition it is manifest that interference with such commerce is insignificant and incidental, and not the dominant purpose of the contract, if it actually was thought of at all. The route mentioned is between Ohio ports. The contract, in what it especially contemplates, is a domestic contract, and, so far as it is so, is shown to be valid under the local law by the decision of the Ohio court. The chief and visible object of its provisions has nothing to do with commerce among the states. That which suspends payment of instalments in case of very serious opposition is security against a losing bargain, not a combination to gain a monopoly. The withdrawal of the vendors from opposition for five years is the ordinary incident of the sale of a business and good will.\n It is argued, to be sure, that the lastmentioned covenant is independent and not connected with the sale of the vessels. The contrary is manifest as a matter of good sense, and is proved even technically by the words 'it is also agreed as a part of the consideration of this agreement.' By these words the covenant not to do business between Cincinnati and Portsmouth for five years is imported into the sale of the ships, and made one of the conventional inducements of the purchase. The price is paid not for the vessels alone, but for the vessels with the covenant. So, still mere clearly, the parallel instalments for five years are paid for the covenant, at least in part. It is said that there is no sale of good will. But the covenant makes the sale. Presumably all that there was to sell, beside \n\n[200 U.S. 179, 185]\n\u00a0\n certain instruments of competition, was the competition itself, and the purchasers did not want the vendors' names.\n This being our view of the covenant in question, whatever differences of opinion there may have been with regard to the scope of the act of July 2, 1890, there has been no intimation from anyone, we believe that such a contract, made as part of the sale of a business, and not as a device to control commerce, would fall within the act. On the contrary, it has been suggested repeatedly that such a contract is not within the letter or spirit of the statute (United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Asso. \n166 \nU.S. 290, 329\n, 41 S. L. ed. 1007, 1023, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 540; United States v. Joint Traffic Asso. \n171 \nU.S. 505, 568\n, 43 S. L. ed. 259, 287, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 25), and it was so decided in the case of a patent (E. Bement & Sons v. National Harrow Co. \n186 \nU.S. 70, 92\n, 46 S. L. ed. 1058, 1069, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 747). It would accomplish no public purpose, but simply would provide a loophole of escape to persons inclined to elude performance of their undertakings, if the sale of a business and temporary withdrawal of the seller, necessary in order to give the sale effect, were to be declared illegal in every case where a nice scrutiny could discover that the covenant possibly might reach beyond the state line. We are of opinion that the agreement before us is not made illegal by either of the provisions thus far discussed.\n It only remains to say a word as to the agreement to maintain rates. This is a covenant by the purchaser, the plaintiff in error. It is not the covenant sued upon. It is not declared to enter into the consideration of the sale. If necessary, we should be astute to avoid allowing a party to escape from his just and substantially legal undertaking on such a ground. The argument on the other side requires us to import a subordinate undertaking of the buyer into the consideration for that which was the consideration of his debt, and, in that roundabout way, to make the debt unlawful. We shall not go into such niceties beyond noticing that they are not encouraged by the cases. Oregon Steam Nav. Co. v. Winsor, 20 Wall. 64, 22 L. ed. 315; Bank of Australasia v. Breillat, 6 Moore, P. C. C. 152, 201; Pigot's Case, 11 Coke, 26b, 27b.

CLEVELAND ELECTRIC R CO(1906)\nNo. 183\nArgued: Decided: April 9, 1906\n\n\n\n\n[201 U.S. 529, 530]\n\u00a0\n Bill in equity to enjoin the enforcement of an ordinance of the city of Cleveland, passed January 11, 1904, purporting to grant to the Forest City Railway Company the right to maintain and operate a street railroad upon streets alleged to be covered by grants to the appellee, not yet expired, and which, it is contended, constitute contracts, the obligation of which is impaired by the ordinance of January 11, 1904, in violation of the contract clause of the Constitution of the United States.\n A preliminary injunction was granted, which, upon final hearing, was made perpetual. 135 Fed. 368. And this appeal was taken. The case was heard upon bill and answer, and an outline of the facts is as follows:\n The Cleveland Electric Railway Company is a consolidated company, organized under the laws of Ohio in 1893. None of its constituent companies had at that time any rights in the streets in controversy. In 1903 the company acquired by purchase the lines of railway and the rights, privileges, and franchises of the Cleveland City Railway Company. The latter company was constituted of the Woodland Avenue & West Side Street Railway Company and the Cleveland City Cable Railway Company, each of these companies being itself a consolidated company.\n The Woodland Avenue Railway Company, before its consolidation with the West Side Street Railroad Company, was the successor by purchase, in 1885, of the Kinsman Street Railroad Company, its rights, property, and franchises, which, by the terms of the consolidation of the Woodland Avenue and West Side Companies, in 1886, vested in the Woodland Avenue & West Side Railroad Company.\n The rights, privileges, and franchises of the Kinsman Street Railroad were derived from the city by an ordinance dated August 25, 1879, which granted to the company and to its successors and assigns the right to maintain and operate a double track street railroad in the city of Cleveland, 'commencing on Superior street, at the intersection of Water street, thence through Superior street and around the southwest corner of \n\n[201 U.S. 529, 531]\n\u00a0\n Monumental square to Ontario street; thence through Ontario street to and through a portion of Broadway and Woodland avenue (formerly Kinsman street ); thence through said Woodland avenue to Madison avenue.'\n It was provided that 'the authority, privileges, and franchises . . . granted and renewed to said company, its successors and assigns,' should continue for a period of twenty-five years from the 20th day of September, 1879. The expiration of the grant was, therefore, fixed at September 20, 1904. The ordinance was accepted by the Kinsman Company.\n On May 14, 1883, the city passed an ordinance entitled 'An Ordinance to Permit the Woodland Avenue Railway Company to Extend its Lines of Railway on Woodland Avenue from the Cleveland and Pittsburgh Crossing to Corwin Street.' The ordinance was accepted and the line built as an extension of the tracks built by the Kinsman Company.\n Prior to the year 1885 the two companies which formed the Woodland Avenue & West Side Street Railroad Company were independent lines, with independent franchises from the city, one operating on the west side of Cuyahoga river, the other upon the east side, and running to the southeasetrly portion of the city. There was no interchange of traffic between them, and, at the time of the consolidation, the West Side Company had the right by ordinance from the city to operate its road for twenty- five years from February, 1883,-namely, to February, 1908\n\n\n Under the laws of Ohio the city council had the power to fix the terms and conditions upon which railways might be consolidated, and in pursuance of the statute the companies notified the council of their proposed consolidation, and thereupon the council passed an ordinance February 1, 1885, giving the consent of the city to the consolidation upon the following conditions:\n'The said consolidated company is to carry passengers through, without change of cars, by running of the cars through from the workhouse on the line of the Woodland Avenue Rail- \n\n[201 U.S. 529, 532]\n\u00a0\n way Company to the point on the West Side Railroad where Gordon avenue crosses Lorain street; and, when practicable in the judgment of the council, to do likewise on the branches of the consolidated lines; and that for a single fare from any point to any point on the lines and branches of the consolidated road no greater charge than 5 cents shall be collected; and that tickets at the rate of eleven for 50 cents or twenty- two for $1 shall at all times be kept for sale on cars by conductors.'\n\n It was provided that the ordinance should take effect after its legal publication and the filing of the written acceptance by the companies of the terms thereof. The written acceptance was filed and the terms of the ordinance complied with.\n The line fixed in the ordinance covers the lines of the Kinsman Street Railroad Company and the lines referred to in the ordinance of January 11, 1904, sought to be enjoined.\n No date for the expiration of the grant was fixed, but it was provided that the consolidated company should be liable to all the liabilities, conditions, and penalties to which the several companies were liable.\n On April 8, 1887, an ordinance was passed authorizing the consolidated company to lay an additional track on Franklin avenue between Pearl street and the westerly line of Franklin circle, and to occupy and operate said extension as therein provided, but on the express condition that no increase of fare should be charged by said railroad company or any part of its main line or said extension, and so that but one fare, not to exceed 5 cents, should be charged between any points on said company's main line or extensions. The ordinance contained the following provision: 'And the grant here granted shall terminate with the present grant of the main line, to wit, 10th day of February, 1908.' And it is alleged that the 'main line' referred to includes the line operated on Woodland avenue ( formerly Kinsman street) and originally granted to the Kinsman Street Railroad Company by the ordinance of August, 1879. \n\n[201 U.S. 529, 533]\n\u00a0\n On August 12, 1887, an ordinance was passed authorizing the consolidated company to lay and extend a track in Franklin avenue, from Kentucky street to Waverly avenue. In this ordinance there was a prohibition of increase of fare 'between any points on said company's main line or extension,' and that the right granted should 'terminate with the present grant of the main line, to wit, on the 10th day of February, 1908.'\n Prior to March, 1889, the lines of the railway of the Woodland Avenue & West Side Street Railway Company were operated by horse power, and there came a demand for more rapid means of transit afforded by electrical equipment, and on March the 22d, 1889, and, it is alleged, to secure such means of transit, the city granted to the consolidated company the right to use electricity in operating its entire line of street railroad, as the same then existed, with any and all extensions that might thereafter be made thereto. It was provided that the grant should be in force from the time of its legal publication and written acceptance by the company. The ordinance recited that 'said company shall have the right to maintain and operate its present line and any and all extensions until the expiration of the present grant of said company, to wit, the 10th of February, 1908.' The written acceptance was filed, and, it is alleged, through and by compliance with its terms the consolidated company, and the Cleveland Electric Railway Company as its successor, acquired the absolute right by contract to continue to maintain and operate its line of road as it then existed and all extensions thereof up to the 10th day of February, 1908. This is denied. It is alleged that the appellee expended not less than the sum of $700,000 in equipping its road with electricity as a motive power.\n On June 20, 1892, the city passed an ordinance authorizing the consolidated company to lay an additional track on Kinsman street, thereby making its line on said street a double-track railway. The point of beginning was designated to be 'at the intersection of its main tracks.' There was a provision for termination on the 10th of February, 1908, as in the \n\n[201 U.S. 529, 534]\n\u00a0\n other ordinances. And there was the same provision in an ordinance passed August 1, 1892, authorizing an extension of tracks on Lorain street. Again, in an ordinance of the 22d of August, authorizing the construction and maintenance of a suitable and necessary line of feed wires upon certain streets. An ordinance of October 17, 1892, empowering the company to lay an additional track on Woodland avenue between certain streets, contained the same provision. On July 17, 1893, an ordinance was passed authorizing the Cleveland City Railway Company, which had become the owner of the rights of the Woodland Avenue & West Side Street Railroad Company, to lay an additional track upon South Woodland avenue. This ordinance contained a provision as to the operation of the tracks in connection with the other lines, the kind and number of cars to be used and the manner of running and intervals of time to be run, and the sprinkling of tracks. The grant was to remain in force until the 26th of January, 1910. February 19, 1894, an ordinance was passed granting permission to the Cleveland Electric Railway and the Cleveland City Railway Company to build a cross-town road on Willson avenue. It was provided that the grant was to continue in force until the 1st day of July, 1914.\n Of this ordinance the bill alleges:\n'This grant shall be in force until the first day of July, 1914.\n\n'Your orator shows that the grant under which the Cleveland Electric Railway Company was, at the time of the passage of the last-mentioned ordinance, operating, as to several of its lines, expires on the first of July, 1914, and that the obligations imposed upon the Cleveland City Railway Company by virtue of said ordinance, in this paragraph set forth, are continuing obligations, requiring of your orator the performance of all and singular the conditions of said ordinance, including the issuing of transfers from its other lines and accepting transfers from its said Willson avenue line, up to the first day of July, 1914, whereby your orator submits that the council thereby not only granted, but required, of said the Cleveland City Railway Com- \n\n[201 U.S. 529, 535]\n\u00a0\n pany, the operation of its entire system of railway up to the first day of July, 1914.\n\n'Your orator further shows that Willson avenue and the lines of road therein constructed are intersected by both Kinsman street and Woodland avenue (formerly Kinsman street).'\n\n Messrs. Newton D. Baker, D. C. Westenhaver, and Garfield, Howe, & Westenhaver for appellants. \n\n[201 U.S. 529, 536]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Andrew Squire, John W. Warrington, and William B. Sanders for appellee. \n\n[201 U.S. 529, 537]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n The system of railways operated by the appellee comprises about 236 miles of track. The lines in controversy are but 7 miles of this aggregate, and rest for their initial grant on th ordinance of the 25th of August, 1879, to the Kinsman Street Railroad Company. This \n\n[201 U.S. 529, 538]\n\u00a0\n grant expired on the 20th of September, 1904, unless extended by subsequent ordinances. That it was so extended is the contention of the appellee, and that it has the right to operate its railways on the streets in controversy until February, 1908, under the contracts constituted by those ordinances and their acceptance. A special reliance is based on the ordinance authorizing a change to electricity as a motive power, in compliance with which it is alleged that the appellee expended a sum not less than $700,000. The city takes issue with these contentions. It asserts that the original grant to the Kinsman Company was not extended as a matter of fact and could not be extended as a matter of law, the city not having the power to prolong the life of the original grant. The argument advanced is somewhat roundabout. Its ultimate reliance is upon certain sections of the Revised Statutes of Ohio, from which it is deduced that it was incompetent for the council to authorize an extension to expire at a different time from the main grant. To hold otherwise, it is said, would be to hold that the council would have power to grant extensions in perpetuity, while by  2502 of the Revised Statutes of Ohio there can be no grant or a renewal of a grant for a greater period than twenty-five years.\n Ordinarily it would be more orderly to consider the power of the city before considering its exercise or the intention to exercise it. For our purposes, however, it becomes convenient to consider first the intention of the city by the ordinances in question.\n The purpose of the ordinances, we think, presents no insolvable doubts. Indeed, we think it is clear that the city intended to secure, and did secure, for its citizens, valuable transportation facilities, and intended to extend that part of the system of railways consisting of the Kinsman street line and its extension until February, 1908. There can be no other reasonable meaning of what the city did or of the language it used. It recognized a main line, not in one ordinance, but many ordinances, and the purpose was to join the initial grant and its \n\n[201 U.S. 529, 539]\n\u00a0\n extensions together, and continue it and those combined until 1908. There could have been no mistake in the language used or misunderstanding of it. We might suppose a mistake in one ordinance, but we cannot suppose a mistake in four ordinances. The matters dealt with were important, and it is a reasonable presumption that no provision concerning them escaped attention or was misunderstood. The situation must be kept in mind. The Woodland Avenue Railway Company (successor to the right of the Kinsman Street Company) operated a road on the west side of the Cuyahoga river; the West Side Street Railroad Company opeerated on the east side. They were independent companies, and the interchange of traffic between them was obviously a public advantage. This was accomplished by the consolidation of the companies and the ordinance fixing the terms and conditions of the consolidation. By that ordinance through cars were provided for and a single fare was established 'from any point to any point on the lines and branches of the consolidated road.' This imposed duties on the companies and it also secured to them rights. The grants of the constituent companies expired at different times, respectively 1904 and 1908, and it is contended that by the mere union of the lines the duties and rights of the companies continued for the longer term. This, however, we are not required to determine.\n In April, 1887, an ordinance was passed to authorize the consolidated company to lay a double track in Franklin avenue. In this ordinance the words upon which the controversy turns as to the extension of the grant to 1908 occur for the first time. The grant was on the express condition that no increase of fare should be charged by the company 'on any part of its main line or said extension, so that but one fare, not to exceed 5 cents, shall be charged between points on said company's main line or extension . . . and the right herein shall terminate with the present grant of the main line, to wit, on the 10th day of February, 1908.' This language is substantially repeated in the three other ordinances. We think there can be \n\n[201 U.S. 529, 540]\n\u00a0\n no doubt of its purpose, and if it were any part of our function to pass upon the wisdom of actions we might say it was a wise purpose, certainly had much reason to commend it. Why break up, or risk the breaking up, of a union of lines and the interchange of their traffic in a continuous carriage of passengers at one rate of fare? The extension was not for an unreasonable time. One of the grants did not expire until 1908, and it was reasonable to continue the other till that time. What policy or purpose could be urged against it? The suggestion of counsel for appellants does not commend itself. The suggestion is that possibly it was the purpose of the city to preserve different dates for the expiration of the grants. so that, the company coming to the city with its line in fragments, the city could consider whether concessions in the public interest might not be required as a condition of the renewal of rights. To adopt the suggestion we must suppose a situation more difficult than that presented. Forethought of the public interests must be attributed to the city council when it passed the consolidation and other ordinances. There was an immediate public benefit to be considered, and the time of extension was not so long as to cause a dread of unforeseen conditions or to make necessary a provision for them. Besides. inducement to the company had to be offered and secured. However, a discussion of policies is unnecessary. We find the ordinances plainly written, and we turn to the construction of the power of the city to grant the extension.\n The question of the intention of the ordinances being settled, the question of the power of the city council is settled, in so far as this case can be distinguished from Cleveland v. Cleveland City R. Co. \n194 U.S. 517\n, 48 L. ed. 1102, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 756. In the latter case we had occasion to consider the power of the city to pass the ordinances relied on by the appellee in the case at bar, and their effect as contracts between the city and the companies. The suit was brought to enjoin the enforcement of an ordinance passed October 17, 1898, reducing the fare on the Kinsman Street Railroad to 4 cents, under a right reserved to 'i- \n\n[201 U.S. 529, 541]\n\u00a0\n ncrease or diminish the rate of fare on said road as the city might 'deem justifiable and expedient.' The Cleveland City Railway Company, successor of the Kinsman Street Company, contended that the power had been given up in subsequent ordinances, and the decision sustained the contention. The sections of the Revised Statutes of Ohio were quoted and by them it was said 'there was lodged by the legislature of Ohio in the municipal council of Cleveland comprehensive power to contract with street railway companies in respect to the terms and conditions upon which such roads might be constructed, operated, extended, and consolidated, the only limitation upon the power being that in case of an extension or consolidation no increase in the rate of fare should be allowed.' This extract leaves nothing to be said as to the power of the city, and the rest of the opinion leaves little to be said as to the question of the ordinances constituting contracts with the company. All the considerations which could be urged against them as such were discussed and passed on, and the ordinances involved were those relied on by the appellee in the present case, to wit, the ordinance making the grant to the Kinsman Street Company of August, 1879, the ordinance consolidating the West Side Railroad Company and the Woodland Avenue Railroad Company, and the ordinances of April 8, 1887, and August 12, 1887. There was a reference to the provision of the ordinance of April 8 and its repetition in the ordinance of August 12, making the time of the termination of the grants that 'of the main line, to wit, on the 10th day of February, 1908.' The reference was not casual. The provision was regarded as an element in the purpose of the extension of the roads and as a means of securing the public advantages of the union of the lines and one rate of fare over all of them.\n Another contention was noticed which was pressed there and it is again pressed here, based on  2502 of the Revised Statutes of Ohio, that a municipal corporation could not, during the term of the grant or the renewal thereof, release the grantee from any obligation or liability imposed by the grant. \n\n[201 U.S. 529, 542]\n\u00a0\n This provision was urged as preventing a surrender by the city of the power reserved in the grant to the Kinsman Street Railway Company, because the reservation was an obligation and liability imposed upon the railroad corporation. Section 2501 was urged as precluding any attempt to treat the consent of the city to extensions, consolidations, or change of motive power as of renewals of the rights renewed by the ordinance of 1879, because it was contended that the positive provisions of that section permitted such renewals only at the expiration of original grants. Both contentions were rejected. Of  2502 it was said that the laws of Ohio permitted a modification of a contract between a municipality and the owner of a street railroad, and  2501 had been held to authorize renewals to be made before the expiration of the original grant. To support the latter conclusion we cited State ex rel. Hadden v. East Cleveland R. Co. 6 Ohio C. C. 318, affirmed by the supreme court of Ohio. Appellants concede the authority of that case, but say the ordinance it passed upon left no doubt of the intention of the city, whereas in the case at bar, considering the provisions of the statutes and the ordinances, all intendments must be held to be against an intention to renew the original grant. In other words, the contention is that while 'no set form of words is necessary,' it is yet urged that 'such result can only be effected by apt words evincing a plain and unmistakable purpose to make a renewal.' It is not a question of power, therefore, to pass the ordinances, but of the intention of the city in passing them, and the latter we have sufficiently considered. It is only necessary to add that we do not find uncertainty in them, and cannot, therefore, yield to the conclusion deduced from its supposed existence. The situation was plain and the city council met it with a definite and reasonable plan. It must not be overlooked that if the city gave rights it secured benefits, and that the rights could not be exercised without large expenditures of money, or be of any value unless assured of stability. Seven hundred thousand dollars, the appellee urges, it expended on the change to elec- \n\n[201 U.S. 529, 543]\n\u00a0\n trical power, and the allegation is hardly made doubtful by the answer. We cannot believe that the expenditure of that sum was unworthy of consideration by the city, or that the city intended to exact it as an obligation that could be imposed on the company, or regarded it as anything but a benefit to the city, to be recompensed and secured by the ordinance which was passed.\n It is urged by the appellee that the roads operated by it constituted a unified system, and by virtue of the ordinance of July 17, 1893, fixing the time of the expiration of the grant thereby made the 26th of January, 1910, and the ordinance of February, 1894, in which the date of the expiration of the grant there provided for was the 1st day of July, 1914, extended the time of all the grants composing the system until 1914. We do not think this question properly arises on the record, and we, therefore, do not pass upon it.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","30":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCITY OF MONTEREY v. JACKS(1906)\nNo. 27\nArgued: Decided: December 3, 1906\n\n\n\n Mr. Hamilton Gay Howard for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. W. I. Brobeck, John Garber, and Frederic D. McKinney for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n Action to quiet title, brought by plaintiff in error (and, being plaintiff in the court below, we will so designate it) in the superior court of the county of Monterey to 1,635.03 acres of land, situate in Monterey county, state of California. Plaintiff alleged title in fee simple, and contends that such title has come to it as successor of the pueblo of Monterey of Upper California. There is no dispute that the land was part of the pueblo of Monterey, and that, after proper proceedings had in pursuance of acts of Congress, the title of the city of Monterey was confirmed by a decree of the board of land commissioners, and a patent issued to the city November 19, 1891. \n\n[203 U.S. 360, 361]\n\u00a0\n The defendant gets his title through one D. R. Ashley, who was the attorney for the city, to present and prosecute its claim to the land before the board of land commissioners. To pay the indebtedness incurred for his services the land was sold under the authority of certain acts of the legislature of the state, and purchased by him. The validity of the title so derived, as against the title of the city as successor of the pueblo of Monterey, free from the control of the legislature, makes the question in the case. Judgment passed for the defendant in the trial court and was affirmed by the supreme court. 139 Cal. 542, 73 Pac. 436. This writ of error was then allowed.\n The city of Monterey was incorporated by an act of the legislature of the state of California, March 30, 1850, and became thereby successor of the former pueblo to its pueblo lands. In 1857 the charter of the city was amended, and by  7 thereof the trustees were empowered to pay off the expenses of prosecuting the title of the city before the United States land commissioners and before the United States courts, and for that purpose pose sell and transfer any property, right, or franchise upon such terms and for such price as might by them be deemed reasonable. It was found by the lower courts (and we quote from the opinion of the supreme court) that--\n On January 24, 1859, said Ashley presented to the trustees of the city of Monterey a claim amounting to $991.50 for services as its attorney in presenting such pueblo claim to the commissioners. The claim was approved and allowed, and there being no funds in the treasury to pay it, the board of trustees passed a resolution directing that a sale of all the pueblo lands of the city, or so much of them as might be necessary to pay the claim of said Ashley, be made at public auction on the 9th day of February, 1859. Due notice of the time for holding said sale was given, and the same was held at the time and in accordance with the notice, at which sale the entire pueblo tract was bid in by the said D. R. Ashley and the defendant, David Jacks, for the sum of $1,002.50, being \n\n[203 U.S. 360, 362]\n\u00a0\n the amount of the indebtedness and the necessary expenses of sale; no one offering to purchase less than the whole, or bid a higher amount. Thereafter said trustees made, executed, and delivered a conveyance of said lands, dated February 9, 1859, but acknowledged February 12, 1859, in favor of said D. R. Ashley and the defendant, David Jacks, and in the conveyance the proceedings taken by the trustees in the matter of such sale were recited. This conveyance was recorded in the county recorder's office of the county of Monterey on June 11, 1859. On April 2, 1866, the act to incorporate the city of Monterey was amended to read as follows: 'Sec. 2. All sales and conveyances made by the corporate authorities of said city since the 8th day of February, 1859, and which conveyances purport to have been recorded in the county recorder's office of Monterey county, purporting to convey public lands, or lands confirmed to said city of Monterey, in pursuance of the act of Congress of March 3, 1851 (9 Stat. at L. 631, chap. 41), and entitled 'An Act to Ascertain and Settle the Private Land Claims in the State of California,' are hereby ratified and confirmed.' . . . On September 4, 1869, Ashley conveyed all his interest in the land in controversy to the defendant.'\n The contentions of the parties are in part made to turn upon the kind of right the city of Monterey derived as the successor of the pueblo of Monterey, whether proprietary or in trust, and, because in trust, subject to the disposition of the legislature of the state. This distinction was expressed by the supreme court and the case determined by it, and the court supported its action by a citation of prior decisions. It was said: 'There is a marked difference, however, between lands which are held by a municipality in trust for public, municipal purposes, such as pueblo lands, and lands acquired by a municipality through purchase or special grant, and held in proprietary right.' Of the latter class it was said: 'That it is beyond the power of the state to control its disposition without the consent of the municipality.' In the other case, 'the lands, being simply ancillary to the execution of the public trust,-lands in which \n\n[203 U.S. 360, 363]\n\u00a0\n the pueblo never had an indefeasible proprietary interest, and which were subject to the supreme political dominion of the former Mexican government,- became equally subject to the sovereignty of the state of California through its legislature upon the change of government.'\n Plaintiff attacks this conclusion, and contends that the title to the lands vested, not in the state of California as succeeding sovereign, but in the United States, and the United States, having the title, passed it by the patent of November 19, 1891, to the plaintiff. And this contention, plaintiff asserts, presents the Federal question to be decided. At one time this might have been regarded as a serious question, but it is no longer so. Whatever of legal power the state of California may exercise over its municipalities has received decisive definition in many decisions. The cases are quoted by the supreme court in the case at bar. Whatever power the United States may exercise, or, by refraining from exercising, yield to the state of California to exercise, has long been decisively settled. We need not review the cases. An exposition of them can be found in United States v. Santa Fe, \n165 U.S. 675\n, 41 L. ed. 874, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 472.\n If the United States was, as contended, a paramount sovereign, and, as such, possessed the power to direct the trust to which pueblo lands were subject, it did not do so, but conveyed land to the 'city of Monterey, its successors and assigns.' In other words, the conveyance was made to a municipality of the state of California,-a creature of the laws of the state and subject to the state. Payne v. Treadwell, 16 Cal. 220; San Francisco v. Canavan, 42 Cal. 541. See also Atty. Gen. ex rel. Kies v. Lowrey, \n199 U.S. 233\n, 50 L. ed. 167, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 27. And we may observe that the United States, by an act passed June 15, 1906, has designated the city of Monterey as trustee of the original grant, and confirmed the land to the city as patented. 34 Stat. at L. 267.\n We do not think, however, that the Federal question presented is so far unsubstantial as to justify a dismissal of the writ of error, and the motion to dismiss is denied.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","31":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCLARK v.

The summons in the action was returned \n\n[203 U.S. 164, 169]\n\u00a0\n September 22, 1904, with the indorsement by the sheriff that Clark could not be found in his county.\n An attachment was sued out under the statutes of Montana (Code of Civil Procedure,  890 et seq.), and, on September 22, 1904, was levied upon all the right, title, and interest of the defendant Clark in certain lots in Butte, Silver Bow county, Montana.\n On October 18, 1904, Clark, appearing for the purpose of obtaining an order of removal, and no other, and reciting that he waived no right to object to the jurisdiction of the court over his person or property, filed his petition in the district court of Lewis and Clark county for the removal of the cause to the circuit court of the United States for the district of Montana, upon the ground that he was a resident of San Mateo, California, and a citizen of that state, plaintiff being a citizen of Montana.\n Upon bond filed such proceedings were had that the cause was ordered, on October 18, 1904, to be removed to the United States circuit court for the district of Montana.\n After the filing of the record in the United States court an affidavit was filed on November 3, 1904, in the office of the clerk of the United States circuit court for an order for service by publication upon Clark as a nonresident, absent from the state, who could not be found therein. An order was thereupon made by the clerk of the United States court for service upon Clark by publication in a newspaper in the city of Helena, Lewis and Clark county, and the mailing of a notice to San Mateo, California, the alleged place of residence of the defendant. This method of procedure is in conformity with the Code of Civil Procedure of Montana ,  637, 638. Publication was made, and a copy of the summons and complaint was served upon Clark at San Mateo, California, by the United States marshal in and for the northern district of California. Mont. Code Civ. Proc.  637, 638.\n On December 6, 1904, Clark, appearing solely for that pur- \n\n[203 U.S. 164, 170]\n\u00a0\n pose, filed a motion to quash the service of summons upon two grounds:\n'1. That the said summons has never at all or in any manner been served upon the defendant herein personally in the state and district of Montana, nor has the defendant ever at any time waived service of summons or voluntarily entered his appearance in this cause.\n\n'2. That the publication of service herein, wherein and whereby the said summons has been published in a newspaper, does not give the court any jurisdiction over the said defendant, nor is such service by publication permissible or in accordance with the rules of procedure in the United States court, nor is the same sanctioned or authorized by any law of the United States, and the said pretended service of summons by publication is wholly and absolutely void under the laws of the United States.'\n\n The court overruled the motion and proceeded to render a judgment in personam against Clark for the amount of the note and costs.\n It is contended by the plaintiff in error that inasmuch as the removal was made to the Federal court before service of a summons upon the defendant, and, as there was no personal service after the removal, there could be no valid personal judgment in that court for want of service upon the defendant. And it is insisted that the service by publication, if proper in such cases, could not be made under the state statute, but under the act of March 3, 1875 (18 Stat. at L. 472, chap. 137, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 513), permitting the court to make an order for publication upon nonresident defendants in suits begun in the circuit court of the United States to enforce any legal or equitable lien upon a claim to real or personal property within the district where suit is brought.\n It must be taken at the outset as settled that no valid judgment in personam can be rendered against a defendant without personal service upon him in a court of competent jurisdiction, or waiver of summons, and voluntary appearance therein. \n\n[203 U.S. 164, 171]\n\u00a0\n Pennoyer v. Neff, \n95 U.S. 715\n, 24 L. ed. 565; Caledonian Coal Co. v. Baker (New Mexico ex rel. Caledonian Coal Co. v. Baker) \n196 \nU.S. 432, 444\n, 49 S. L. ed. 540, 545, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 375, and cases cited.\n Nor did the petition for removal in the form used in this case have the effect to submit the person of the defendant to the jurisdiction of the state court, or, upon removal to the Federal court, deprive him of the right to object to the manner of service upon him (Goldey v. Morning News, \n156 U.S. 518\n, 39 L. ed. 517, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 559), and the exercise of the right of removal did not have the effect of entering the general appearance of the defendant, but a special appearance only for the purposes of removal (Wabash Western R. Co. v. Brow, \n164 U.S. 271\n-279, 41 L. ed. 431-434, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 126).\n But we cannot agree with the contention of counsel for plaintiff in error, that, as a personal judgment can only be rendered upon personal service, and service by publication under the state statutes cannot be made in the Federal court, and that the United States statute (act of March, 1875, 18 Stat. at L. 472, chap. 137, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 513) is inapplicable to the case, the effect of the removal is to render nugatory the attachment proceedings in the state court.\n The purpose not to interfere with the lien of the attachment in the state court is recognized and declared in the statute ( 4 of the removal act, 18 Stat. at L. 471, chap. 137, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 511) providing that, when any suit is removed from a state court to the circuit court of the United States, an attachment of the goods or estate of the defendant, had in the suit in the state court, shall hold the goods or estate attached to answer the final judgment or decree in the same manner as by law it would have been held to answer the final judgment or decree had it been rendered by the court in which the suit was commenced, and preserving the validity of all bonds or security given in the state court.\n The transfer of the cause to the United States court gave the latter court control of the case as it was when the state court was deprived of its jurisdiction. The lands were still held by the attachment to answer such judgment as might be rendered against the defendant.\n The defendant had a right to remove to the Federal court, \n\n[203 U.S. 164, 172]\n\u00a0\n but it is neither reasonable nor consonant with the Federal statute preserving the lien of the attachment, that the effect of such removal shall simply be to dismiss the action wherein the state court had acquired jurisdiction by the lawful seizure of the defendant's property within the state.\n When the jurisdiction of the state court was terminated by the removal, that court had seized upon the attached property, with the right to hold it to answer such judgment as might be rendered. In the absence of personal service the state statute provided for publication of notice of the pendency of the suit. If the defendant failed to appear the court might proceed to render a judgment, which would permit the attached property to be sold for its satisfaction. To render such a judgment in the absence of an appearance and defense the state court had only to require the statutory notice to the defendant, when its proceedings were interrupted by the removal to the Federal court on the application of the defendant.\n The Federal court thus acquired jurisdiction of a cause of which the defendant had notice, as appears by his petition for removal and the action of the state court invoked by him. The defendant, it is true, had not been personally served with process or submitted his person to the jurisdiction of either the state or Federal court. But he did not attack the validity of the attachment proceedings, which appear to be regular and in conformity to the law of the state. There was no necessity of publication of notice in the Federal court in order to warn the defendant of the proceeding; he knew of it, and to a qualified extent had appeared in it.\n Without further notice to him, the court had jurisdiction to enter a judgment enforcible against the attached property. The judgment purported to be rendered as upon personal service and after a finding by the court 'that the so-called special appearance for the removal hereinbefore recited was an absolute and unqualified submission to the jurisdiction of this [the Federal] court.' \n\n[203 U.S. 164, 173]\n\u00a0\n There are expressions in the opinion of the learned judge of the circuit court to the effect that the judgment rendered was intended to be effectual only to subject the attached property (136 Fed. 462), and it seems to be in the form used in some jurisdictions, which recognize that the property attached is all that is reached by the judgment rendered. But the judgment is absolute upon its face, and entered after a finding of full jurisdiction over the person of the defendant. It is in such form as can be sued upon elsewhere and be pleaded as a final adjudication of the cause of action set forth in the petition, and be executed against other property of the defendant, whereas the court had only jurisdiction to render a judgment valid against the property seized in attachment.\n We hold that, to the extent that it rendered a personal judgment absolute in terms, the court exceeded its jurisdiction in the case, not having, by service or waiver, personal jurisdiction of the defendant.\n The judgment to that extent is therefore modified and made collectible only from the attached property. So modified, the judgment is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","32":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOM. OF KENTUCKY v. POWERS(1906)\n\nArgued: Decided: March 12, 1906\n\n\n\n No. 15, Original, argued January 22, 1906\n\n\n Decided March 12, 1906.\n Messrs. N. B. Hays and Lawrence Maxwell, Jr., for appellant in No. 393. \n\n[201 U.S. 1, 2]\n\u00a0\n These cases arise out of a criminal prosecution begun in one of the courts of Kentucky, and, after several trials, removed on the petition of the accused, Caleb Powers, into the circuit court of the United States for the eastern district of Kentucky.\n The principal question to be determined is whether the prosecution was removable from the state court.\n After referring to the indictment and to the transfer of the prosecution into the circuit court of the United States, the petition for removal alleged that the accused was within the jurisdiction of the United States and of the commonwealth of Kentucky; that he was, and all of his life had been, a citizen of the United States, and of that commonwealth, and as such citizen was entitled to enforce in the judicial tribunals of Kentucky, \n\n[201 U.S. 1, 3]\n\u00a0\n on the trial and final disposition of said prosecution, all equal civil rights and equal protection of laws secured to him by that part of the Amendment providing that 'no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.' [Art. 14,  1.] He also claimed the rights secured by  1977 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1259), providing, 'all persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every state and territory to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and property as is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be subject to like punishment, pains, penalties, taxes, licenses, and exactions of every kind, and to no other;' as well as those secured by the act of Congress of March 1st, 1875. (18 Stat. at L. 335, chap. 114, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1260), the preamble of which declares that: 'Whereas, it is essential to just government we recognize the equality of all men before the law, and hold that it is the duty of government in its dealings with the people to mete out equal and exact justice to all, of whatever nativity, race, color or persuasion, religious or political; and it being the appropriate object of legislation to enact great fundamental principles into law.'\n The petition then refers to the arrest of the accused on the 9th of March, 1900, upon the charge of being an accessory before the fact to the wilful murder of Wiliam Goebel, and alleges that on the 10th of March, 1900, and prior to the finding and reporting of the indictment against the accused, 'William S. Taylor, who was then the duly and legally elected, qualified, actual, and acting governor of the state of Kentucky, and had in his actual possession and under his actual control the office and executive mansion prepared by said state for its governor, and all the books, papers, records, and archives belonging thereto, in due form of law duly and legally granted and delivered \n\n[201 U.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n to your petitioner, and your petitioner, accepted from him, a full, complete, absolute, and unconditional pardon, release, and acquittance of the identical charge against him in said indictment, and the charge now pending in said prosecution against your petitioner in said Scott circuit court, and under which your petitioner is now in custody; that said Taylor, at the time he granted said pardon, had the right and authority, under the Constitution and the laws of Kentucky, to grant same; that your petitioner accepted said pardon, and from the time same was granted he claimed, and he now claims, the full benefit and effect thereof and his liberty thereunder. That on the day said pardon was granted him it was, by said Taylor, as governor aforesaid, duly entered on the executive journal kept in his office, and a certificate thereof was duly and in due form of law, and as required by law, issued and delivered to him, duly executed by said governor and the secretary of said state, and placed in your petitioner's possession, and same was by your petitioner accepted. Your petitioner further states that at the time the said pardon was granted to him by his Excellency, the said William S. Taylor, and subsequent thereto, the said William S. Taylor was, and prior thereto he had been recognized, regarded, and treated as the duly elected, actual, and acting governor of the state of Kentucky by the executive power and executive departments, of the United States government, including the President, the Attorney General, and the Postmaster General, and by the postmaster at Frankfort, Kentucky;' that 'for said state to hold him in custody, or to try or to require him to be tried in any one of its courts for the offense alleged against him in and by said indictment, since the granting and acceptance of said pardon and the issuance and acceptance of the certificate thereof, is a denial to him of the equal protection of the laws and the equal civil rights to which he is entitled under and as provided for in and by the portions of said amendment to the Constitution of the United States above copied, and by said section of said Revised Statutes, and by said act of Congress;' and, that 'notwithstanding the granting and acceptance \n\n[201 U.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n of said pardon, the issuance and acceptance of said certificate, the fact that the said William S. Taylor was the governor of Kentucky when said pardon was granted and when said certificate was issued, and was then recognized as such governor by said executive officers of the United States, that he cannot enforce in the said Scott circuit court in which said prosecution is pending, or in that part of the state in which said Scott county is located, or in any court, judicial tribunal, or place of the said state, the equal civil rights and the equal protection of the laws secured to him by each and all of the three portions of said amendment copied above, and by said section of the Revised Statutes of the United States, and by said act of Congress for the reasons now set forth.'\n The accused here refers to the three trials to which he was subjected, and after stating that he was confined in the county jail, without bail, and awaiting trial, proceeds in his petition: 'That at each of said trials your petitioner presented to said Scott circuit court said certificate of pardon, and pleaded and offered in evidence said pardon and said certificate as a bar and complete defense to said prosecution and the trial and conviction of your petitioner under said indictment, but at each of said trials the said trial court overruled said pleas and refused to admit said pardon and certificate as evidence, and held and adjudged that said pardon and certificate were null and void and of no effect whatever, and in each of said trials the said holding of the trial court in reference to said pardon and certificate was duly excepted to and made one of the grounds which was presented and on which a reversal was asked by said court of appeals on the trial of each on said appeals heretofore mentioned, and on each one of said appeals your petitioner conteded that said pardon and certificate entitled him to an acquittal of the charge contained in said indictment, but the said court of appeals, on the trial and final disposition of each one of said appeals, failed and refused to hold that said pardon and certificate authorized your petitioner's acquittance of said charge; instead, that court, as the said trial court had \n\n[201 U.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n done, held that said pardon and certificate were and are null and void and of no effect whatever. The holding of said court of appeals on the trial of each of said appeals was reduced to writing, and each holding, as prepared and ordered by said court of appeals, has been, by the official reporter of that court, under the court's direction, caused to be printed in, and is now a part of, the official printed reports of said court, and all of said holdings are now in full force and effect as, and they in fact are, the laws of said state in this case, and are binding upon and will have to control this honorable court. That the instances named are the only instances in which said court of appeals or any trial court of said state ever held any pardon and certificate thereof, granted, entered, and issued by any governor of Kentucky, to be void and of no effect. That in consequence of the action and holdings of said trial court and said court of appeals, above stated, this honorable court, cannot, and should this case be retried in this honorable court, could not, allow your petitioner to plead or introduce said pardon and certificate as evidence as a defense to the said charges contained in said indictment against him, and could not allow your petitioner his liberty and acquittal under and by virtue of said pardon and certificate, or allow said pardon and certificate to have any effect whatever in your petitioner's behalf, but instead is and will be bound in consequence of said laws to hold said pardon and certificate null and void and of no effect whatever.'\n In the second paragraph of his petition for removal the accused states that he is a citizen of the United States and of Kentucky, and as such is entitled to enforce in the judicial tribunals of the state the equal civil rights and the equal protection of the law secured to him by the above constitutional provisions and statutes.\n His petition then alleges: 'But your petitioner states that he is denied and cannot enforce in the judicial tribunals of this state and in the part of the state where this action is pending, the rights secured to him by said laws and each of said laws, \n\n[201 U.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n because the said state of Kentucky has enacted a law which has not been repealed nor abrogated, and which is now in full force and effect, to wit ,  281 of the Criminal Code of Practice of said state, which section reads as follows: 'The decisions of the court upon challenges to the panel and for cause, upon motions to set aside an indictment, and upon motions for a new trial, shall not be subject to exception;' and because of the decisions of the court of appeals of Kentucky, the highest judicial tribunal in this state, rendered in this action. . . . upholding the validity of said law, notwithstanding its plain contravention of the said provisions of the Constitution of the United States.\n ... * *\n'Your petitioner states that the death of said Goebel occurred during the existence of intense political excitement following the election of a governor and other state officers in November, 1899; that said Goebel had been the Democratic candidate for the office of governor, and was, at the time of his death, contesting the right of said William S. Taylor to the office of governor, said Taylor, who was a Republican candidate for that office, having been actually elected governor and declared elected governor by the duly and legally constituted authorities, and inducted into said office; that this petitioner was, at said election, the Republican candidate for the office of secretary of state, and had been actually elected and declared elected to said office, and had been inducted into said office; and there was pending at the time of said Goebel's death a contest for the said office of secretary of state, against this defendant, inaugurated by one C. B. Hill, who had been a Democratic candidate for said office; that the public mind was, by said election and said contest for the office of governor, lieutenant governor, secretary of state, and the other state offices greatly inflamed, and bitter and intense political animosities were excited and fostered by reason thereof, and that such feelings existed at all of the trials of this petitioner hereinafter referred to, and such feelings still exist against him on the part of said \n\n[201 U.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n adherents of said Goebel throughout the state of Kentucky, and particularly in Scott county.\n\n'Your petitioner further states that he was first put on trial under said charge on the 9th day of July, 1900, at a special term of the Scott circuit court begun and holden on said date; that said trial resulted in a verdict of conviction, and he was sentenced to confinement in the state penitentiary during his natural life; that the jury in said trial was selected from a large number of the citizens of said county, and that, with three or four exceptions, all of the venire men were purposely summoned because of their known party affiliations, which were different from the known party affiliations of your petitioner; that by the laws of Kentucky in such cases made and provided the prosecution has a right to five, and the defense of fifteen, peremptory challenges, and that with the exception of three or four Republicans and Independent Democrats, all of those summoned were known to be partisan Goebel Democrats, while your petitioner was and is a Republican, and was known to belong to the Republican party; that from venire men so summoned a trial jury was selected that was composed almost if not entirely, of Goebel Democrats, and no Repubilcans, although there were then residing in said county many hundreds of citizens qualified for jury service who were Republicans and Independent Democrats, and not supporters of said Goebel in his candidacy or contest for the office of governor of Kentucky, nor in sympathy with him; but your petitioner avers and charges that all of such citizens, with the exceptions named, were intentionally passed by in summoning said venire men, in order that your petitioner should not have a fair trial by a jury of his peers, impartially selected, but to the end that such jury might be selected to convict him.\n\n'Your petitioner further respectfully represents that the sheriff of Scott county, to whom is assigned the duty of selecting all jurors whose names are not drawn from the jury wheel, is a Goebel Democrat, as are also the deputy sheriffs of said county. \n\n[201 U.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n 'Your petitioner further states that at said first trial hereinbefore mentioned the judge of the Scott circuit court, when the original list of names drawn from the jury wheel for jury service had been exhausted, although requested by counsel for this petitioner, and while there remained in said jury wheel about one hundred names, to draw the names remaining in said jury wheel therefrom, refused to do so, but directed the sheriff to summon one hundred men for jury service, and explicitly directed him to summon no men for jury service from the city of Georgetown, but to go out into the county for that purpose. Your petitioner states that the said one hundred names that remained at said time in said jury wheel had been placed there by impartial and unbiased jury commissioners prior to the election in November, 1899, and prior to the killing of said Goebel. Your petitioner states that on the morning following the order of the court to the sheriff to summon the one hundred men for jury service from the county, and when said one hundred men so summoned had appeared in court, they were seated on one side of the court room, separate and apart from the spectators and other persons; that the judge of said court, without notice to your petitioner or any of his counsel, and without making any request of any of his counsel or of this petitioner to accompany him, left the bench and went to the side of the court room wherein said parties summoned for jury service were assembled, and without swearing said parties, so far as this petitioner saw, heard, or has information, as to their excuses for not serving as jurors, if any they had, called them up to him one at a time, not in the hearing of this petitioner, or his counsel, and excused such of them from jury service as he saw fit, without any knowledge on the part of this petitioner or his counsel as to why such parties were thus excused, and on the following day the same proceeding was had as to forty additional men that had been summoned for jury service in this case.\n\n'Your petitioner further states that an appeal was taken from the judgment of said court to the Kentucky court of appeals, and that at the January term, 1901, of said court, the \n\n[201 U.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n judgment of the trial court was reversed; that your petitioner was again tried in the Scott circuit court at its October, 1901, term, and a verdict of guilty returned again, fixing the punishment of your petitioner at confinement in the state penitentiary for life; that in summoning the venire men from whom the jury was selected at the second trial, the same unjust and unlawful discrimination was practised, and that of one hundred and twenty-five venire men summoned in Scott county, all were partisan Goebel Democrats except three, and of one hundred and sixty-eight venire men summoned in the adjoining county of Bourbon, all were partisan Democrats except three, so that of the aggregate of two hundred and ninety summoned, two hundred and eighty-four were Goebel Democrats and six were Republicans, notwithstanding the fact that there were many hundreds of citizens in each of said counties qualified for jury service who were Republicans, or Independent Democrats, and not Goebel partisans.\n\n'Your petitioner states that at said second trial he objected to the formation of a jury from the venire men summoned as hereinbefore stated, and moved to discharge the entire venire on the ground that he could not obtain a fair trial before a jury selected therefrom, and filed in support of said objection an affidavit.'\n\n The affidavit referred to is given in full in the margin. \n\n The affiant states that he ought not to be required to go to trial before a jury drawn as a panel for service at the present term of this court or already summoned from the county of Bourbon, for the following reasons, namely: that the political canvass in this state in 1899, in which the late William Goebel was candidate for the office of governor, was a heated and angry one, and tended to create great antagonism in the minds of his political adherents against those who opposed; that this canvass was followed by a contest before the state legislature for said office, in which the deepest and fiercest passions were stirred in the minds of his followers in this county, as well as in other counties of the state, including the county of Bourbon; that during that contest the said Geobel was killed, which killing tended still further to deepen and intensify the political passions of his friends and admirers in this county and in the county of Bourbon and throughout the state, against this affiant, who was a candidate for a state office on the Republican ticket in the said year of 1900. The passions thus created have since that time been stimulated and fed by the political contests which have since followed, and are still in existence, in this county and Bourbon county. Affiant says that, at a special term of this court in July, 1900, he was put on trial in this county, charged with being an accessory before the fact to the killing of said William Goebel, and was by the jury found guilty. From the judgment of the court at that term, the affiant appealed to the appellate court, the appeal being taken in the early part of September in said year; that at the subsequent October term of said court, jury commissioners for this county were selected whose duty it was to select a large number of names and place them in the jury wheel for service during the year 1901.\n The three commissioners appointed were John Bradford, Ben Mallory, and H. H. Haggard, all three of whom were partisan supporters and allies, in the \n\n[201 U.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n The petition then proceeds: 'Your petitioner states that although the statements in said affidavit were true and known to be true by the court, he was forced to submit to trial before a jury composed entirely of Goebel Democrats, your petitioner \n\n[201 U.S. 1, 12]\n\u00a0\n always having been a Republican in politics, as hereinabove stated; and, as hereinabove stated, your petitioner was at said trial found guilty and sentenced to imprisonment for life by the judgment of said Scott circuit court; that your petitioner took an appeal from the judgment so rendered, which judgment was \n\n[201 U.S. 1, 13]\n\u00a0\n reversed by the court of appeals of Kentucky at the September, 1902, term; that your petitioner was again and for the third time tried at a special term of the Scott circuit court under the charge hereinabove mentioned, which trial was begun and holden on the 3d day of August, 1903, and that of the number of one hundred and seventy-six venire men summoned from Bourbon county, from which the jury was selected, three only, or possibly four, were Republicans, and the remaining one hundred and seventy-three ( two) were Gobel Democrats and were summoned for Goebel Democrats and were summoned for from your petitioner, whereas there were many hundreds of Republicans and Independent Democrats in said county qualified for jury service, but your petitioner states they were purposely avoided and passed by in summoning said venire men, and that said trial jury was not selected impartially, as required by law; that in the year 1896 there were over twenty-six hundred votes in said county for William McKinley, Republican candidate for President of the United States, and about twenty-two hundred votes cast for William J. Bryan, his Democratic opponent; that in the year 1899 William S. Taylor, Republican candidate for governor of Kentucky, received twenty-seven more votes in said county than were cast for said William Goebel, his Democratic opponent, and that a jury impartially selected could not have been and would not have been, as it was, composed entirely of Goebel Democrats,-on his said third trial one juror, a Goebel supporter, but of doubtful politics, excepted.\n'Your petitioner further represents that at the third and last trial of this petitioner in said Scott circuit court, the judge thereof entered an order directing the sheriff of said Scott county to summon two hundred men from Bourbon county for jury service; that this petitioner's attorneys asked the court to admonish the sheriff to summon an equal number of men of each political party; that this request was refused, and thereupon counsel for this petitioner asked the court to instruct the sheriff to summon the talesmen as he came to them \n\n[201 U.S. 1, 14]\n\u00a0\n regardless of political affiliation. This the court also refused to do.\n\n'Your petitioner further states that said trial resulted in a verdict of guilty, affixing the death sentence, and a judgment was thereupon entered, from which judgment an appeal was taken to the court of appeals of Kentucky, and on December 6th, 1904, the judgment of conviction was for the third time reversed by said court, and that it is the purpose and intention of the Commonwealth of Kentucky to subject this petitioner to a fourth trial under said charge, within a short time, in said Scott circuit court.\n\n'Your petitioner further respectfully states that at each of said three trials the facts in relation to the jurors given or hereinbefore recited were embraced in affidavits filed in support of challenges to the panel and the venire and objections to the formation of the jury from the men summoned as hereinabove mentioned, and were also embraced in the motions and grounds for new trial prepared and filed on behalf of this petitioner at each of said trials, but that they were disregarded by the court and your petitioner's challenge to the panels, to the venire, and the motions for new trials in each instance overruled; that by reason of  281 of the Criminal Code of the state, hereinbefore quoted, this petitioner was and is denied the right of any exception on said grounds, and the court of appeals of Kentucky, on each of the three appeals hereinbefore set forth, have decided that no irregularity in the summoning or impaneling of the jury is a reversible error, and they are powerless to reverse any judgment of said court by reason of such facts, and have held said law to be valid, and such law is not the law of this case, and said court of appeals of Kentucky are powerless upon any future appeal to reverse any judgment of said court by reason of a repetition of the acts hereinbefore set forth, or for any other irregularity or improper conduct in the formation of a jury, no matter how prejudicial to the substantial rights of your petitioner they may be, and must be followed and cannot be disregarded by this honorable court. \n\n[201 U.S. 1, 15]\n\u00a0\n 'Your petitioner therefore prays this honorable court that the said indictment and the prosecution pending thereunder in this honorable court against your petitioner be removed into the circuit court of the United States for the eastern district for trial at the next ensuing term of said circuit court, and your petitioner will ever pray.'\n\n Messrs.

Clay Howard, James C. Sims, E. L. Worthington, R. C. Kinkead, and R. D. Hill for appellee.\n Messrs. E. L. Worthington, Frank S. Black, Richard Yates, R. D. Hill, James C. Sims, and H. Clay Howard for respondent.\n\n\n\n[201 U.S. 1, 22]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan delivered the opinion of the court:\n Powers, the accused, was indicted in the circuit court of Franklin county, Kentucky, for the crime of having been an accessory before the fact to the murder of William Goebel, who was assassinated in that county on the 30th day of January, 1900. The prosecution was removed by change of venue to the circuit court of Scott county. In the latter court the accused was found guilty and his punishment fixed by the jury at confinement in the state penitentiary for life. Upon appeal \n\n[201 U.S. 1, 23]\n\u00a0\n to the court of appeals of Kentucky the judgment was reversed and a new trial ordered. 110 Ky. 386, 53 L. R. A. 245, 61 S. W. 735. At the second trial the verdict was guilty, and the punishment was again fixed at confinement in the penitentiary for life. Upon appeal, that judgment was reversed and a new trial ordered. 114 Ky. 239, 70 S. W. 644, 1050, 71 S. W. 494. A third trial occurred, which resulted in a verdict of guilty, with the punishment fixed at death. This judgment was also reversed and the case sent back for a new trial. 26 Ky. L. Rep. 1111, 83 S. W. 146.\n When the case came on for trial the fourth time the accused tendered and offered to file in the state court his petition praying, upon grounds therein stated (and which appear in the above statement), that the prosecution be removed for trial into the circuit court of the United States for the eastern district of Kentucky. But the state court would not allow the petition to be filed. Subsequently, a partial transcript of the record was filed in the Federal court, and the case was docketed in that court. The commonwealth objected to the filing of the transcript from the state court and to the docketing of the case in the Federal court, and moved to vacate the order of filing and docketing. That motion was overruled.\n Thereupon the accused, by his counsel, presented to the Federal court an application for a writ of habeas corpus, in order that he might be discharged from the custody of the state authorities. For the reasons set forth in the opinion of that court the application was granted and a writ ordered to issue, commanding the jailer of Scott county, who held the accused in custody for the state, to deliver him into the custody of the marshal of the Federal court, which was done, that officer being directed to keep the accused confined in the county jail of Campbell county, Kentucky, until the further order of the Federal court. 139 Fed. 452. From that order the commonwealth of Kentucky has prosecuted the above appeal ( No. 393), the sole ground of such appeal being that the Federal court was without jurisdiction to make the \n\n[201 U.S. 1, 24]\n\u00a0\n order allowing the writ of habeas corpus and taking the accused from the custody of the state authorities. The accused has moved to dismiss the appeal because the remedy of the commonwealth was by a writ of mandamus.\n The commonwealth also asked leave to file a petition for mandamus to compel the Federal court to remand the case to the state court and to restore the custody of the accused to the state authorities. Leave to file was granted and the Federal judge, having made his return, submitted the rule upon the record of the case, including the opinion filed by the court below when the writ of habeas corpus was awarded to take the accused from the custody of the state authorities. This is case No. 15, Original.\n The fundamental question to be determined is whether the removal of this criminal prosecution from the state court into the Federal court was authorized by any statute of the United States. We say, by any statute, because the subordinate judicial tribunals of the United States can exercise only such jurisdiction, civil and criminal, as may be authorized by acts of Congress. Chief Justice Marshall, speaking for this court, has said that 'courts which originate in the common law possess a jurisdiction which must be regulated by their common law, until some statute shall change their established principles; but courts which are created by written law, and whose jurisdiction is defined by written law, cannot transcend that jurisdiction.' Ex Parte Bollman, 4 Cranch, 75, 93, 2 L. ed. 554, 560; United States v. Hudson, 7 Cranch, 32, 33, 3 L. ed. 259, 260; Cary v. Curtis, 3 How. 236, 245, 11 L. ed. 576, 581; M'Intire v.

United States, \n137 \nU.S. 202, 211\n, 34 S. L. ed. 691, 695, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 80.\n The adjudged cases make it clear that whatever the nature of a civil suit or criminal proceeding in a state court, it cannot be removed into a Federal court unless warrant therefor be found in some act of Congress. \n\n[201 U.S. 1, 25]\n\u00a0\n We are now to enquire whether the case was removable from the state court, in virtue of any act of Congress.\n The removal of this prosecution into the Federal court was rested on  641 and 642 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 520, 521), which are as follows:\n' 641. When any civil suit or criminal prosecution is commenced in any state court, for any cause whatsoever, against any person who is denied or cannot enforce in the judicial tribunals of the state, or in the part of the state where such suit or prosecution is pending, any right secured to him by any law providing for the equal civil rights of citizens of the United States, or of all persons within the jurisdiction of the United States, . . . such suit or prosecution may, upon the petition of such defendant, filed in said state court at any time before the trial or final hearing of the cause, stating the facts and verified by oath, be removed, for trial, into the next circuit court to be held in the district where it is pending. Upon the filing of such petition all further proceedings in the state courts shall cease and shall not be resumed except as hereinafter provided. But all bail and other security given in such suit or prosecution shall continue in like force and effect as if the same had proceeded to final judgment and execution in the state court. . . .\n\n' 642. When all the acts necessary for the removal of any suit or prosecution, as provided in the preceding section, have been performed, and the defendant petitioning for such removal is in actual custody on process issued by said state court, it shall be the duty of the clerk of said circuit court to issue a writ of habeas corpus cum causa, and of the marshal, by virtue of said writ, to take the body of the defendant into his custody, to be death with in said circuit court according to law and the orders of said court, or, in vacation, of any judge thereof; and the marshal shall file with or deliver to the clerk of said state court a duplicate copy of said writ.'\n\n The contention of the commonwealth is that the decisions of this court wholly preclude the suggestion that  641 authorized the removal of this case into the Federal court. In review of this contention we must see what has been heretofore decided. \n\n[201 U.S. 1, 26]\n\u00a0\n Among the cases to which our attention has been called, the first one, in point of time, involving the construction of  641, is Ex parte Wells, 3 Woods, 128, 132, Fed. Cas. No. 17,386, determined in the circuit court of the United States for the district of Louisiana, Mr. Justice Bradley presiding. The accused there sought to remove the prosecution from the state court, upon the ground, among others, that such vindictive prejudice existed against them on the part of the lawmaking and law-administering authorities of the state that they would be denied their rights as citizens in the state court, as well as before any jury that might be impaneled therein under the then-existing jury law of the state; consequently, they would not be able to enforce their rights in said court. It was also alleged that the state court and its officers had so manipulated the local law as to deprive the accused of an impartial jury, and that they would be deprived of the full and equal benefit of the laws and proceedings for the security of their persons. The court, having found that there was nothing in the Constitution or laws of the state that was hostile to the equal rights of the accused, in any particular, said: 'The allegations with regard to the manipulation of the law in such manner as to secure a jury inimical to the petitioners, and with regard to the existence of a general prejudice against them in the minds of the court, the jurors, the officials, and the people, are not within the purview of the statute authorizing a removal. The 14th Amendment to the Constitution, which guarantees the equal benefit of the laws, on which the present application is based, only prohibits state legislation violative of said right; it is not directed against individual infringements thereof. The civil rights bill of 1866 was broader in its scope, undertaking to vindicate those rights against individual aggression; but, still, only when committed under color of some 'law, statute, ordinance, regulation, or custom.' [14 Stat. at L. 27, chap. 31,  1.] And when that provision in this law, which is transferred to  641 of the Revised Statutes, gave the right to remove to the United States courts a cause commenced in a state court, against a person who is denied or cannot enforce any \n\n[201 U.S. 1, 27]\n\u00a0\n of the rights secured by the act, it had reference to a denial of those rights or impediments to their enforcement, arising from some state law, statute, regulation, or custom. It is only when some such hostile state legislation can be shown to exist, interfering with the party's right of defense, that he can have his cause removed to the Federal court.'\n In Strauder v. West Virginia, \n100 \nU.S. 303, 309\n, 312 S., 25 L. ed. 664, 666, 667, which was an indictment in a court of West Virginia against a person of the African race for the crime of murder, the accused, before the trial commenced, presented his petition for the removal of the case into the United States court upon the ground that the laws of the state, in relation to both grand and petit juries, discriminated against colored citizens, because of their race, in violation of the Constitution and the laws of the United States. The petition for removal was denied, and the accused was forced to a trial in the state court, found guilty, and sentenced. That judgment was affirmed by the supreme court of appeals of the state, and the case was brought here upon writ of error. This court held the state statute to be unconstitutional, as making an illegal discrimination against negroes, because of their race. After referring to what was said in United States v. Reese, \n92 U.S. 214\n, 23 L. ed. 563, to the effect that rights and immunities created by or dependent upon the Constitution of the United States can be protected by Congress, and that the form and manner of the protection may be such as Congress, in the legitimate exercise of its legislative discretion, shall provide, the court said; 'There is express authority to protect the rights and immunities referred to in the 14th Amendment, and to enforce observance of them by appropriate congressional legislation. And one very efficient and appropriate mode of extending such protection and securing to a party the enjoyment of the right or immunity is a law providing for the removal of his case from a state court, in which the right is denied by the state law, into a Federal court, where it will be upheld. This is an ordinary mode of protecting rights and immunities conferred by the Federal Constitution and laws. Section 641 is \n\n[201 U.S. 1, 28]\n\u00a0\n such a provision.' Adverting to the act from which  1977 and 1978 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 1259-1262) were taken, the court further said: 'This act puts in the form of a statute what had been substantially ordained by the constitutional amendment. It was a step towards enforcing the constitutional provisions. Section 641 was an advanced step, fully warranted, we think, by the 5th section of the 14th Amendment.' Observe that this was the case of a state statute held to prevent the enforcement in the judicial tribunals of the state of rights secured to the accused by the Constitution of the United States. Upon that point this court said: 'That the petition of the plaintiff in error, filed by him in the state court before the trial of his case, made a case for removal into the Federal circuit court, under  641, is very plain, if, by the constitutional amendment and  1977 of the Revised Statutes, he was entitled to immunity from discrimination against him in the selection of jurors, because of their color, as we have endeavored to show that he was. It set forth sufficient facts to exhibit a denial of that immunity, and a denial by the statute law of the state. There was error, therefore, in proceeding to the trial of the indictment against him after his petition was filed, as also in overruling his challenge to the array of the jury, and in refusing to quash the panel.'\n In Virginia v. Rives (Ex parte Virginia), \n100 \nU.S. 313, 321\n, 25 S. L. ed. 667, 670, which was an indictment in a court of Virginia against colored persons charged with the crime of murder, the accused moved that the venire, which was composed entirely of white men, should be modified so as to allow one third of the jury to be composed of colored men. That motion was overruled. Thereupon the defendants, before the trial, sought by petition to have the prosecution removed into the Federal court, upon the ground that the right secured to them by the act of Congress providing for the equal civil rights of all citizens of the United States was denied to them in the judicial tribunals of the county in which the prosecution was pending; also, upon the ground that the grand jury finding the indictment had been organized in discrimination against the \n\n[201 U.S. 1, 29]\n\u00a0\n colored race because of their race. The application to remove the case was denied, and the defendants were tried in the state court and convicted. The case at that stage of the trial was docketed, at the motion of the accused, in the Federal court, and, upon writ of habeas corpus sued out from that court. they were taken from the custody of the state, and placed in the custody of the United States marshal. The commonwealth of Virginia obtained from this court a rule against the judge of the Federal court to show cause why the accused should not be redelivered to the authorities of the state, to be dealt with according to the laws of that commonwealth. The judge made his return to the rule, averring that the indictments were removed into the Federal court by virtue of  641 of the Revised Statutes. It is important to notice that there was no claim in that case that either the Constitution or laws of Virginia denied the civil rights of colored people, or stood in the way of their enforcing the equal protection of the laws. The law, this court said, made no discrimination against them because of their color, nor any discrimination at all. And further, referring to the officer charged with the duty of selecting jurors, this court said: 'He made himself liable to punishment at the instance of the state and under the laws of the United States. In one sense, indeed, his act was the act of the state, and was prohibited by the constitutional amendment. But, inasmuch as it was a criminal misuse of the state law, it cannot be said to have been such a 'denial or disability to enforce in the judicial tribunals of the state,' the rights of colored men, as is contemplated by the removal act.  641. It is to be observed that act gives the right of removal only to a person 'who is denied, or cannot enforce, in the judicial tribunals of the state, his equal civil rights.' And this is to appear before trial. When a statute of the state denies his right, or interposes a bar to his enforcing it, in the judicial tribunals, the presumption is fair that they will be controlled by it in their decisions; and in such a case a defendant may affirm on oath what is necessary for a removal. Such a case is clearly within the provisions of  641. But \n\n[201 U.S. 1, 30]\n\u00a0\n when a subordinate officer of the state, in violation of state law, undertakes to deprive an accused party of a right which the statute law accords to him, as in the case at bar, it can hardly be said that he is denied, or cannot enforce, 'in the judicial tribunals of the state' the rights which belong to him. In such a case it ought to be presumed the court will redress the wrong. If the accused is deprived of the right, the final and practical denial will be in the judicial tribunal which tries the case, after the trial has commenced. If, as in this case, the subordinate officer, whose duty it is to select jurors, fails to discharge that duty in the true spirit of the law; if he excludes all colored men solely because they are colored; or if the sheriff to whom a venire is given, composed of both white and colored citizens, neglects to summon the colored jurors only because they are colored; of if a clerk whose duty it is to take the twelve names from the box rejects all the colored jurors for the same reason,-it can with no propriety be said the defendant's right is denied by the state, and cannot be enforced in the judicial tribunals. The court will correct the wrong, will quash the indictment or the panel, or, if not, the error will be corrected in a superior court. We cannot think such cases are within the provisions of  641. Denials of equal rights in the action of the judicial tribunals of the state are left to the revisory powers of this court.'\n The question as to the scope of  641 of the Revised Statute again arose in the subsequent cases of Neal v. Delaware, \n103 \nU.S. 370, 386\n, 26 S. L. ed. 567, 570; Bush v. Kentucky, \n107 \nU.S. 110, 116\n, 27 S. L. ed. 354, 356, 1 Sup. Ct. Rep. 625; Gibson v. Mississippi, \n162 \nU.S. 565, 581\n, 584 S., 40 L. ed. 1075, 1078, 1079, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 904, and Smith v. Mississippi, \n162 \nU.S. 592, 600\n, 40 S. L. ed. 1082, 1085, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 900. In each of these cases it was distinctly adjudged, in harmony with previous cases, that the words in  641-'who is denied or cannot enforce in the judicial tribunals of the state, or in the part of the state where such suit or prosecution is pending, any right secured to him by any law providing for the equal civil rights of citizens of the United States, or of all persons within the jurisdiction of the United States'-did not give the right of removal, unless \n\n[201 U.S. 1, 31]\n\u00a0\n the Constitution or the laws of the state in which the criminal prosecution was pending denied or prevented the enforcement in the judicial tribunals of such state of the equal rights of the accused as secured by any law of the United States. Those cases, as did the prior ones, expressly held that there was no right of removal under  641, where the alleged discrimination against the accused, in respect of his equal rights, was due to the illegal or corrupt acts of administrative officers, unauthorized by the Constitution or laws of the state, as interpreted by its highest court. For wrongs of that character the remedy, it was held, is in the state court, and ultimately in the power of this court, upon writ of error, to protect any right secured or granted to an accused by the Constitution or laws of the United States, and which has been denied to him in the highest court of the state in which the decision, in respect of that right, could be had.\n In Gibson v. Mississippi, supra, the words of this court as to the scope of  641 were very emphatic. In that case there was a conviction in a state court of a negro for the crime of murder, and in which one of the questions, upon writ of error to the highest court of that state, was as to the action of the trial court in denying a petition for the removal of the prosecution to the Federal court. This court said: 'When the Constitution and laws of a state, as interpreted by its highest judicial tribunal, do not stand in the way of the enforcement of rights secured equally to all citizens of the United States, the possibility that during the trial of a particular case the state court may not respect and enforce the right to the equal protection of the laws constitutes no ground, under the statute, for removing the prosecution into the circuit court of the United States in advance of a trial. We may repeat here what was said in Neal v. Delaware, namely, that in thus construing the statute 'we do not withhold from a party claiming that he is denied, or cannot enforce in the judicial tribunals of the state, his constitutional equality of civil rights, all opportunity of appealing to the courts of the United States for redress \n\n[201 U.S. 1, 32]\n\u00a0\n of his wrongs. For if not entitled, under the statute, to the removal of the suit or prosecution, he may, when denied, in the subsequent proceedings of the state court, or in the execution of its judgment, any right, privilege, or immunity given or secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States, bring the case here for review.' . . . We therefore held in Neal v. Delaware that Congress had not authorized a removal of the prosecution from the state court, where jury commissioners or other subordinate officers had, without authority derived from the Constitution and laws of the state, excluded colored citizens from juries because of their race.' Again: 'The application was to remove the prosecution from the state court, and a removal, as we have seen could not be ordered upon the ground simply that citizens of African descent had been improperly excluded, because of their race, and without the sanction of the Constitution and laws of the state, from service on previous grand juries, or from service on the particular grand jury that returned the indictment against the accused. We do not overlook in this connection the fact that the petition for the removal of the cause into the Federal court alleged that the accused, by reason of the great prejudice against him on account of his color, could not secure a fair and impartial trial in the county, and that he prayed an opportunity to subpoena witnesses to prove that fact. Such evidence, if it had been introduced, and however cogent, could not, as already shown, have entitled the accused to the removal sought; for the alleged existence of race prejudice interfering with a fair trial was not to be attributed to the Constitution and laws of the state. It was incumbent upon the state court to see to it that the accused had a fair and impartial trial, and to set aside any verdict of guilty based on prejudice of race.'\n The cases to which we have adverted had reference, it is true, to alleged discriminations against negroes because of their race. But the rules announced in them equally apply where the accused is of the white race. Section 641, as well as the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, is for the benefit of all \n\n[201 U.S. 1, 33]\n\u00a0\n of every race whose cases are embraced by its provisions, and not alone for the benefit of the African race.\n We have not overlooked the suggestion, earnestly pressed upon our attention, that it is impossible for the accused to obtain a fair trial in the locality where the prosecution is pending. Indeed, the suggestion is, in effect, that there was a deliberate purpose on the part of those charged with the administration of justice in that locality to take his life, under the forms of law, even if the facts did not establish his guilt of the crime charged. It is true that, looking alone at the petition for removal, the trials of the accused disclose such misconduct on the part of administrative officers connected with those trials as may well shock all who love justice and recognize the right of every human being, accused of crime, to be tried according to law. The case, as made by the record, it must be conceded, tends to show, if it does not justify the belief, that administrative officers having connection with the trial of the accused had it in mind, at each trial, to exclude from the jury, so far as it was possible to do so, every person, however competent, who belonged to the same political party as the accused. In his separate opinion, in 26 Ky. L. Rep. 1111, 1117, 83 S. W. 146, 149, Judge Barker, of the court of appeals of Kentucky, referring to the third trial of the accused, said: 'It is clear that the trial judge was of opinion that it was not an offense against the 14th Amendment or a denial of the equal protection of the laws to the defendant to exclude Republicans [the accused being a Republican in politics] from the jury, solely because they were Republicans, provided the selected Democrats [the deceased Goebel being a Democrat in politics] were possessed of the statutory qualifications required for jury service.'\n It is appropriate here to recall that the circuit court, referring to the petition for removal, said: 'The commonwealth of Kentucky has not filed a reply to said petition for removal, or in any way taken issue with the defendant as to any of the allegations thereof. Said allegations must, therefore, be accepted as true, save in so far as they may contradicted by thetranscript \n\n[201 U.S. 1, 34]\n\u00a0\n on file herein. In the case of Dishon v. Cincinnati, N. O. & T. P. R. Co. 66 C. C. A. 345, 133 Fed. 471, Judge Richards, in discussing the affirmative allegations of a petition for removal in a civil suit under the jurisdictional acts of 1887, 1888, (24 Stat. at L. 552, chap. 373, 25 Stat. at L. 433, chap. 866, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 508), said: 'If these averments were not true, the plaintiff should have denied them, and an issue would then have been made for the court below to try and determine. No answer was filed; no issue in any other way was taken. The plaintiff contented himself with making a motion to remand, and which only raised a legal question, namely, whether, upon the facts stated in the petition for removal, taken in connection with the record, a case for removal was made out.' In the case of Whitten v. Tomlinson, \n160 U.S. 231\n, 40 L. ed. 406, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 297, Justice Gray, in referring to a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, under  751-755, U. S. Rev. Stat. ( U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 592, 593), said: 'In a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, verified by oath of the petitioner, as required by U. S. Rev. Stat.  754, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 593, facts duly alleged may be taken to be true, unless denied by the return, or controlled by other evidence. But no allegation of fact in the petition can be assumed to be admitted, unless distinct and unambiguous.' The allegations of the petition for removal are not borne out by the transcript in all their detail. They are, however, borne out to a substantial degree, and are not contradicted in any substantial particular. It establishes the discrimination complained of in the selection of the jurors by the subordinate officers having to do therewith on the second and third trials, and that on both trials the Scott circuit court held that such discrimination was not illegal and the defendant had no right to complain thereof, it not being claimed that the jurors selected did not possess the statutory qualifications. As to the first trial, all that the transcript shows is that it was one of the grounds of defendant's motion for new trial that the circuit judge, after the regular panel was exhausted, had refused to draw from the wheel the names of the jurors placed there in the fall of 1899, before any motive for discrimination had arisen, concerning which Judge Du Relle had this to say in the opinion delivered by him on behalf of the majority of the court of appeals \n\n[201 U.S. 1, 35]\n\u00a0\n on the first appeal: 'In the grounds relied on in the motion for new trial it is stated that the court overruled the motion of appellant, after the regular panel was exhausted, to draw the remaining names necessary to complete the jury from the jury wheel. It is to be regretted that, in a case concerning which so much feeling existed, the simple and easy mode was not adopted, which would have put beyond cavil the question of the accused having a trial by jury impartially selected. This will doubtless be done upon the succeeding trial.\"\n Taking, then, the facts to be as represented in the petition for removal, still the remedy of the accused was not to have prosecution removed into the Federal court, that court not being authorized to take cognizance of the case upon removal from the state court. It is not contended, as it could not be, that the Constitution and laws of Kentucky deny to the accused any rights secured to him by the Constitution of the United States or by any act of Congress. Such being the case, it is impossible, in view of prior adjudications, to hold that this prosecution was removable into the circuit court of the United States by virtue of  641 of the Revised Statutes. Such a case as the one before us has not been provided for by any act of Congress; that is, a circuit court of the United States has not been authorized to take cognizance of a criminal prosecution commenced in a state court for an alleged crime against the state, where the Constitution and laws of such state do not permit discrimination against the accused in respect of such rights as are specified in the first clause of  641. This court, while sustaining the subordinate courts of the United States in the exercise of such jurisdiction as has been lawfully conferred upon them, must see to it that they do not usurp authority not affirmatively given to them by acts of Congress. In Mansfield C. & L. M. R. Co. v. Swan, \n111 \nU.S. 379, 382\n, 28 S. L. ed. 462, 463, 4 Sup. Ct. Rep. 510, 511, we said that 'the rule, springing from the nature and limits of the judicial power of the United States, is inflexible and without exception, which requires this court, of its own motion, to deny its own jurisdiction, and, in the exercise of its appellate power, that of \n\n[201 U.S. 1, 36]\n\u00a0\n all other courts of the United States, in all cases where such jurisdiction does not affirmatively appear in the record on which, in the exercise of that power, it is called to act. On every writ of error or appeal the first and fundamental question is that of jurisdiction,-first, of this court, and then of the court from which the record comes. This question the court is bound to ask and answer for itself, even when not otherwise suggested, and without respect to the relation of the parties to it.' This principle has been again and again reaffirmed. Great Southern Fire Proof Hotel Co. v. Jones, \n177 \nU.S. 449, 453\n, 44 S. L. ed. 842, 843, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 690, and authorities there cited.\n Now, it affirmatively appears of record that the circuit court has taken jurisdiction of this case on removal from the state court, when, as we hold, no act of Congress authorized it do so. We cannot, in fidelity to the law, as declared in former cases, overlook this defect of jurisdiction in the court below or fail to express our inability to concur in the views of the learned court below upon this point.\n The circuit court said: 'I, therefore, conclude that the prior action of the Scott circuit court denying the defendant the equal protection of the laws is a real hindrance and obstacle to his asserting his right thereto in a future trial therein,-just as real as an unconstitutional statute would be,-and that the defendant is denied the equal protection of the laws in said court, within the meaning of said section, and entitled to a removal on account thereof. He is denied in said court the equal protection of the laws because he has been denied, and such denial has never been set aside, but remains in full force and effect. . . . By an 'inability to enforce in the judicial tribunals of the state' is meant, as I construe the statute, any judicial tribunal of the state that may have jurisdiction of the prosecution.' This view is met by what has been said in former cases, namely, that the words in  641-'who is denied or cannot enforce in the judicial tribunals of the state'-have no application to any case where the rights secured to an accused 'by any law providing for the equal civil rights of citizens of the United States, \n\n[201 U.S. 1, 37]\n\u00a0\n or of all persons within the jurisdiction of the United States,' are recognized or are not denied by the Constitution or laws of the state in which the prosecution is pending.\n Under this holding, the accused is not deprived of opportunity to have his rights, of whatever nature, which are secured or guaranteed to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States, fully protected by a Federal court. But, it is said that the action of the trial court in refusing to quash the indictment or the panel of petit jurors, although the motion to quash was based on Federal grounds, cannot, under the laws of Kentucky, be reviewed by the court of appeals, the highest court of that commonwealth. If such be the law of Kentucky, as declared by the statutes and by the court of appeals of that commonwealth, then, after the case is disposed of in that court by final judgment, in respect of the matters of which, under the local law, it may take cognizance, a writ of error can run from this court to the trial court as the highest court of Kentucky in which a decision of the Federal question could be had; and this court in that event, upon writ of error, reviewing the final judgment of the trial court, can exercise such jurisdiction in the case as may be necessary to vindicate any right, privilege, or immunity specially set up or claimed under the Constitution and laws of the United States, and in respect of which the decision of the trial court is made final by the local law; that is, it may re-examine the final judgment of the trial court so far as it involved and denied the Federal right, privilege, or immunity asserted. This must be so, else it will be in the power of a state to so regulate the jurisdiction of its courts as to prevent this court from protecting rights secured by the Constitution, and improperly denied in a subordinate state court, although specially set up and claimed. What we have said is clear from  709 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 575), which declares that 'a final judgment or decree in any suit in the highest court of a state, in which a decision in the suit could be had, . . . where any title, right, privilege, or immunity is claimed under the Constitution, . . . and the decision is against the title, right, privilege, or immunity \n\n[201 U.S. 1, 38]\n\u00a0\n specially set up or claimed, by either party, under such Constitution , . . . may be re-examined and reversed or affirmed in the Supreme Court upon a writ of error.' Looking at the object of that section it must be held that this court has jurisdiction, upon writ of error, to re-examine the final judgment of a subordinate state court denying a Federal right, specially set up or claimed, if, under the local law, that court is the highest court of the state entitled to pass upon such claim of Federal right. The great case of Cohen v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 5 L. ed. 257, which was a criminal prosecution for a misdemeanor, was brought to this court, upon writ of error, from the quarterly session court for the borough of Norfolk, Virginia, and our jurisdiction was sustained upon the ground that such court was the highest court of the state in which, under the laws of Virginia, that case was cognizable. In Downham v. Alexandria, 9 Wall. 659, 19 L. ed. 807, which was a suit for taxes against a dealer in liquors, the court said: 'The legislature, then, having thought fit to make the judgment of the district court in this case final and without appeal, that court is, for this case, the highest court in which the decision could be made; and the writ of error is, therefore, warranted by the act of Congress, and regular.' In Gregory v. McVeigh, 23 Wall, 294, 306, 23 L. ed. 156, 157, which was a writ of error to the corporation court of Alexandria, Virginia, and in which there was a motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction, this court, said: 'The court of appeals is the highest court in the state of Virginia. If a decision of a suit could be had in that court, we must wait for such a decision before we can take jurisdiction, and then can only examine the judgment of that court. If, however, the suit is one of which that court cannot take jurisdiction, we may re-examine the judgment of the highest court which, under the laws of the state, could decide it. . . . We think, therefore, that the judgment of the corporation court of the city of Alexandria is the judgment of the highest court of the state in which a decision of the suit could be had, and that we may re-examine it upon error.' In Bergemann v. Backer, \n157 \nU.S. 655, 659\n, 39 S. L. ed. 845, 848, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 727, 728, a criminal prosecution for murder \n\n[201 U.S. 1, 39]\n\u00a0\n in a subordinate court of New Jersey, this court said: 'If the proceedings in the court of oyer and terminer could not, under the laws of New Jersey, be reviewed in a higher court of that state, except upon the allowance of a writ of error by such court or by some judge, and if such allowance was refused, then the judgment of the court of original jurisdiction was, within the meaning of the acts of Congress, the judgment of the highest court of the state in which a determination of the case could be had, and such judgment could have been, upon writ of error re-examined here, if it had denied any right, privilege, or immunity specially set up and claimed under the Constitution of the United States.' So, in Missouri, K. & T. R. Co. v. Elliott, \n184 \nU.S. 530, 539\n, 46 S. L. ed. 673, 678, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 446, in which the defendant made a claim of immunity in virtue of an authority exercised under the United States, it was held that our writ of error ran, not to the supreme court of Missouri, but to the Kansas City court of appeals,-the highest court in which, under the law of that state, the question as to that immunity could be decided.\n It is necessary to notice one other point made in behalf of the accused. At each of the trials he pleaded in bar of the prosecution a pardon granted to him on the 10th day of March, 1900, by William S. Taylor, who was alleged to have been, at the time, the duly elected, qualified, actual, and acting governor of Kentucky, having in his possession and under his control all the books, papers, records, and archives, as well as the executive mansion, belonging to the office of governor. That pardon, it is alleged, was accepted by the accused. It is further alleged that at the time said pardon was issued Taylor had been recognized, regarded, and treated as the lawful governor of Kentucky by the executive power and executive department of the government of the United States, including the President, the Attorney General, and the Postmaster General, and by the postmaster at Frankfort, the capital of Kentucky. The petition for removal alleged that the court in which the accused was tried, as well as the court of appeals of Kentucky, had refused to recognize said pardon as having any legal effect, and had \n\n[201 U.S. 1, 40]\n\u00a0\n thereby denied to him the equal civil rights and the equal protection of the laws secured to him by the above provisions of the Constitution and laws of the United States; consequently, it was contended, he was denied, and could not enforce, in any judicial tribunal of Kentucky, the rights which said pardon gave him.\n Manifestly, in view of what has already been said, this question as to the pardon of the accused does not make a case of removal on the ground of the denial or inability to enforce in the judicial tribunals of Kentucky of a right secured to the accused 'by any law providing for the equal civil rights of citizens of the United States or of all persons within the jurisdiction of the United States.' Whether the non-recognition by the courts of the state of the validity of the alleged pardon involved a denial of any right secured to the accused by any other law or by the Constitution of the United States, we need not now consider. As the circuit court could not, in virtue of  641, take cognizance of this prosecution or removal, we cannot properly pass upon the merits of any question of Federal right which might arise in the case. It is sufficient to say that if the accused, by reason of the Taylor pardon, acquired any right under the Constitution or laws of the United States, and if, at the next trial of his case, that right, having been specially set up and claimed, should be denied by the highest court of the state in which a decision of that question could be had, such action of that court, in respect of that pardon, can be reviewed here upon writ of error. We do not perceive that any question arising out of the pardon could make a case under  641 for the removal of the prosecution from the state court.\n We are all of opinion that the order awarding the writ of habeas corpus cum causa must be reversed, with directions to set aside that order as well as the order docketing the case in the circuit court of the United States; also, that the rule in relation to mandamus must be made absolute, the prosecution remanded to the state court, and the custody of the accused surrendered to the state authorities.\n It is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n contest referred to, of the said William Goebel, deceased. The said jury commissioners discharged the work assigned to them by placing in said jury wheel the names of two hundred citizens of Scott county, for purposes of said jury service; that at the February term, 1901 of the circuit court of this county, and at the May term of the said year, seventy-five or more names were drawn from the jury wheel for said service; that at the present term there were drawn from the said jury wheel for the purpose of securing a jury in this case about one hundred and twenty-five names, that being the entire number of names placed in the wheel. Affiant further states that at the regular state election of 1900, in the county of Scott, there were cast for the Democratic candidate, in round numbers, 2,500 votes, and for the Republican candidate 2,100 votes; that of these 2,100 votes not less than 1,300 were white voters of equal character, standing, and intelligence with the white voters who cast their votes for the Democratic party at said election.\n Affiant says that, despite these conditions, which were shown to exist in this county, that of the 200 names placed in the jury wheel by the aforesaid commissioners and drawn out as herein described, only five were supporters of the Republican party, and the other 195 being active partisan friends and supporters of the party with which William Goebel was identified as its leader, and whose minds and passions had been inflamed against this affiant by continued political agitation.\n The affiant further says that of the five Republicans whose names were placed in the jury wheel for jury service by said commissioners, as before stated, one man drawn for service at the February term of this court, 1901, and another at the May term; of the remaining three, two of them at the present term disqualified themselves herein by previously formed opinions, and the fifth and last, after qualification and acceptance on the voir dire, was peremptorily challenged by the commonwealth. The affiant says that it will be impossible under these circumstances for him to avoid being tried at this term of this court except by a jury composed entirely of his political opponents, and exclusively made up of those who were the adherents and admirers of said Goebel, and it will be impossible for him to obtain a fair and impartial trial before any jury so constituted and formed.\n The affiant further states that the officers of this county who went to Bourbon county to summon the men for jury service sent directly to the sheriff of Bourbon county, who, together with his deputies, were earnest and ardent adherents, supporters, and friends of the said William Goebel, and opposed politically to this affiant; that the officers of this county consulted and advised with the said officers of Bourbon county as to the selection of the men summoned, and that Wallace Mitchell, deputy sheriff of said county, James Burke, another deputy sheriff of said county, Joseph Williams, a constable of Bourbon county, and James A. Gibson, a guard for county prisoners in Bourbon county, all of whom are the political adherents of said Goebel and politically opposed to this affiant, acted with them in making the selection and summoning said men. \n He says that the political complexion of Bourbon is almost equally Democratic and Republican, there being a slight majority in favor of the Democratic party; that of the Republicans, about three fifths are colored, but there are many conscientious, fairminded and respectable citizens of Bourbon county, qualified for jury service, of the same political faith of this affiant, a great many of whom could have been as readily and conveniently summoned, and who would give to both sides herein a fair and impartial trial; but that none of such persons were summoned with the exception of two men, and with these exceptions ninety-one of the ninety- three names appearing upon the list furnished this affiant as a correct list of the men summoned from Bourbon county are the names of the supporters and adherents of said Goebel, and opposed politically to this affiant, and were summoned for jury service herein by reason of such fact, as this affiant believes.\n Affiant further states that said Wallace Mitchell the deputy sheriff of Bourbon county, is now a candidate for sheriff of said county, seeking an election at the hands of the supporters and adherents of said William Goebel, and is their nominee for said office. Said Mitchell, in the fall of 1900, acted in summoning for jury service in this court in the case of the Com. v. Youtsey, indicted for the same offense as this affiant, and in making the selection of men to serve as jurors therein, made the statement that he would not summons a single Brown Democrat or Republican for such service, and he did not summons any such. \n\n\n\n\n","33":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCONBOY v.

Wilson for appellee.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is an appeal from a final order of the circuit court of \n\n[203 U.S. 141, 143]\n\u00a0\n appeals for the second circuit affirming an order of the district court of the United States for the southern district of New York, filed June 7, 1904, affirming an order of a referee in bankruptcy, 'In the matter of Phillip Semmer Glass Company, Limited, Bankrupt,' dated May 7, 1904, allowing the claim of the First National Bank of Jersey City against the bankrupt's estate.\n The final order of the circuit court of appeals was entered January 23, 1905. The trustee petitioned that court, April 25, to recall its mandate and vacate the order therefor, and the application was denied. On May 8 a petition for rehearing was filed, which was denied May 17, and an order to that effect entered May 24. A petition, dated the same day, was thereupon presented to a justice of this court, praying an appeal 'from the whole of the said order of affirmance of the circuit court of appeals for the second circuit, dated the 23d day of January, 1905, and from the whole of the said order of the circuit court of appeals for the second circuit, dated the 25th day of April, 1905, denying the motion of your petitioner to recall the mandate of said court and cancel the order for same, and from the whole of the said order of the circuit court of appeals for the second circuit, dated the 24th day of May, 1905, denying the petition of the said trustee for a rehearing;' and for the reversal of 'said orders and decrees, etc., and every part thereof.'\n Appeal was allowed and certificate granted under  25b, par. 2, of the bankruptcy act [30 Stat. at L. 553, chap. 541, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3432], May 27, 1905. Thereafter and on June 14, 1905, findings of fact and conclusions of law were filed by the circuit court of appeals, 'nunc pro tunc, as though the same were made and filed at the time of entry of the judgment of this court on the 23d day of January, 1905.'\n The following provisions of the bankruptcy act are applicable:\n'Sec. 25b. From any final decision of a court of appeals, \n\n[203 U.S. 141, 144]\n\u00a0\n allowing or rejecting a claim under this act, an appeal may be had under such rules and within such time as may be prescribed by the Spreme Court of the United States in the following cases and no other:\n\n ... * *\n'2. Where some justice of the Supreme Court of the United States shall certify that, in his opinion, the determination of the question or questions involved in the allowance or rejection of such claim is essential to a uniform construction of this act throughout the United States.'\n\n Paragraphs 2 and 3 of general orders in bankruptcy, 36, read:\n'2. Appeals under the act to the Supreme Court of the United States from a circuit court of appeals, or from the supreme court of a territory, or from the supreme court of the District of Columbia, or from any court of bankruptcy whatever, shall be taken within thirty days after the judgment or decree, and shall be allowed by a judge of the court appealed from, or by a justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.\n\n'3. In every case in which either party is entitled by the act to take an appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, the court from which the appeal lies shall, at or before the time of entering its judgment or decree, make and file a finding of the facts, and its conclusions of law thereon, stated separately; and the record transmitted to the Supreme Court of the United States on such an appeal shall consist only of the pleadings, the judgment or decree, the finding of facts, and the conclusions of law.'\n\n The law provides that appeals shall be taken 'within such time as may be prescribed by the Supreme Court of the United States,' and by general order 36 this court prescribed the time and limited it to thirty days, in harmony with the policy of the bankruptcy act, requiring prompt action and the avoidance of delay.\n The limitation has the same effect as if written in the stat- \n\n[203 U.S. 141, 145]\n\u00a0\n ute, and the allowance of an appeal on certificate cannot operate as an adjudication that it is taken in time.\n The present appeal was allowed four months 'after the judgment or decree' appealed from and three months after the time to appeal had expired.\n But it is said that the limitation should be referred to the date of the order denying the petition for rehearing, and the trustee prayed an appeal from that order as well as from the judgment of January 23.\n No appeal lies from orders denying petitions for rehearing, which are addressed to the discretion of the court and designed to afford it an opportunity to correct its own errors. Brockett v. Brockett, 2 How. 238, 11 L. ed. 251; Wylie v. Coxe, 14 How. 1, 14 L. ed. 301. Appellant might have made his application for rehearing and had it determined within the thirty days, and still have had time to take his appeal. But he let the thirty days expire, as it did February 22, 1905, and did not file his petition until May 8, 1905. The right of appeal had then been lost and appellant could not reinvest himself with that right by filing a petition for rehearing.\n The cases cited for appellant, in which it was held that an application for a rehearing, made before the time for appeal had expired, suspended the running of the period for taking an appeal, are not applicable when that period had already expired. 'When the time for taking an appeal has expired, it cannot be arrested or called back by a simple order of court. If it could be, the law which limits the time within which an appeal can be taken would be a dead letter.' Credit Co. v. Arkansas C. R. Co. \n128 \nU.S. 258, 261\n, 32 S. L. ed. 448, 449, 9 Sup. Ct.

Whether it could have been granted in view of the terms and spirit of the bankruptcy act, or the effect, if it had been, we are not called upon to discuss.\n Appeal dismissed. \n\n\n\n","34":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOVINGTON & C BRIDGE CO. v.

Ray, and C. H. Morris for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n In this case an original action in mandamus was begun in the circuit court of the United States for the eastern district of Kentucky. It was brought by the bridge company to compel the auditor of public accounts for the state to issue his warrant on the state treasury for the amount of a franchise tax collected under authority of  4079 and 4080 of the Kentucky statutes. The return of the tax was asked upon the ground that it levied a burden on the interstate commerce business of the bridge company, pertaining exclusively to commerce between Kentucky and Ohio, and was therefore repugnant to the Federal Constitution.\n The auditor appeared by counsel, and, by general demurrer, raised the question of the sufficiency of the allegations of the petition, and by special demurrer challenged the jurisdiction of the court to entertain the action. The circuit court, passing the question of jurisdiction, held that levying the tax in question did not violate the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution, as it was a tax upon property, and not upon the business of the company, sustained the general demurrer, and dismissed the petition.\n We are of opinion that the court below had no jurisdiction of this action. It has been too frequently decided in this court to require the citation of the cases that the circuit courts of the United States have no jurisdiction in original cases of mandamus, and have only power to issue such writs in aid of their jurisdiction in cases already pending, wherein jurisdicton has been acquired by other means and by other process. \n\n[203 U.S. 109, 111]\n\u00a0\n Many of the cases are collected in 4 Fed. Stat. Annotated, 503.\n The question was before this court recently in Knapp v. Lake Shore & M. S. R. Co. \n197 U.S. 536\n, 49 L. ed. 870, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 538, an action by the Interstate Commerce Commission, by petition for mandamus in the circuit court of the United States for the northern district of Ohio, against the Lake Shore & Michigan Southern Railroad Company, to compel it to file reports required by the act to regulate interstate commerce. It was argued for the government that while decisions of this court under the judiciary act of 1789 (1 Stat. at L. 73, chap. 20) and the act of 1875 (18 Stat. at L. 470, chap. 137, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 508) had been construed to confer no original jurisdiction in mandamus in the United States courts, yet the act of March 3, 1887 (24 Stat. at L. 552, chap. 373, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 508), in view of the modern development in proceedings by mandamus, should be held to confer the jurisdiction upon the circuit courts to entertain original suits in mandamus. The contention was rejected and the prior cases adhered to.\n We deem it settled beyond controversy, until Congress shall otherwise provide, that circuit courts of the United States have no power to issue a writ of mandamus in an original action brought for the purpose of securing relief by the writ, and this result is not changed because the relief sought concerns an alleged right secured by the Constitution of the United States.\n It follows that the circuit court should have dismissed the case for want of jurisdiction instead of determining it upon the merits. The judgment dismissing the petition is therefore modified so as to show that the case was dismissed for want of jurisdiction, and, as thus modified, the judgment is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","35":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOX v. STATE OF TEXAS(1906)\nNo. 266\nArgued: Decided: May 21, 1906\n\n\n\n Messrs. J. C. McReynolds, F. E. Albright, E. C. Orrick, J. C. Terrell, Jr., and Dewey Langford for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n[202 U.S. 446, 447]\n\u00a0\n\n Messrs. Charles K. Bell, R. V. Davidson, and Claude Pollard for defendants in error.\n\n\n\n[202 U.S. 446, 448]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n These are two suits upon a statutory bond executed by the plaintiffs in error as principal and sureties. There were ver- \n\n[202 U.S. 446, 449]\n\u00a0\n dicts and judgments against the plaintiffs in error, whereupon motions were made for new trials, setting up that the act under which the bond was given was contrary to the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, as denying to persons within the jurisdiction the equal protection of the law. The motions were overruled, and an appeal was taken to the court of civil appeals. That court affirmed the judgments below (85 S. W. 1199; 85 S. W. 34), a motion for a rehearing was overruled, an application for a writ of error was refused by the supreme court of the state, and thereupon the cases were taken to this court.\n The bond in suit was given by a liquor seller, and was conditioned, among other things, against selling intoxicating liquors to minors, or allowing minors to enter and remain in the obligor's place of business. The breaches found were breaches of the conditions recited. These suits were brought by the defendants in error respectively, the state of Texas and the parent of the minor. They seem to have been tried together, and the records are so similar that they properly have been treated by counsel as one.\n The statutes of Texas provide for taxes on sellers of spirituous, vinous, or malt liquors, or medicated bitters. Rev. Civ. Stat. 1895, arts. 5060a, 5060b. They require an application for a license, giving details a payment of the annual tax as a condition of obtaining the same, and the giving of a bond like the one in suit. Arts. 5060c-5060g. See amendments, Stat. 1897, chap. 158; 1901, chap. 136. They also enact, however, that 'the provisions of this chapter shall not apply to wines produced from grapes grown in this state, while the same is in the hands of the producers or manufacturers thereof.' Art. 5060i. This article is thought to invalidate those which precede. The matters of discrimination relied upon are the tax and the requirement of the bond. It may be proper to add that there was a demurrer, setting up generally that the statute was unconstitutional because of this article, but, until the motion for a new trial was made, there was no sufficient setting up of a \n\n[202 U.S. 446, 450]\n\u00a0\n defense under the Constitution of the United States. Kipley v. Illinois, \n170 U.S. 182\n, 45 L. ed. 998, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 550; Layton v. Missouri, \n187 U.S. 356\n, 47 L. ed. 214, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 137.\n The main argument addressed to us was rested on the notion that the statutes discriminate unconstitutionally between two classes of persons in the state, naturally existing there, as in Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co. \n184 U.S. 540\n, 46 L. ed. 679, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 431, there was a discrimination with regard to trusts in favor of producers and raisers of agricultural products and live stocks. This argument seems to us a fallacy. Farmers and stock raisers are classes naturally existing in the community, carrying on distinct callings, and not likely to be engaged in any thing else. Hence, although farmers and stock raisers equally with others were prohibited from forming trusts for other purposes, to permit then to form trusts in their regular business was practically, and in fact, to discriminate between two classes and others. The case was discussed throughout on the footing of classification. But, so far as we know, there is no natural distinction of classes among liquor sellers,-one class selling their own domestic wines alone, another selling all intoxicants except domestic wines. The statutes regulate the doing of certain things, which, presumably, all liquor sellers would prefer to be free to do. Therefore, whatever other objections there may be to them, they do not deny the equal protection of the laws by forbidding, without justification, to one what they permit to another class.\n There is one slight qualification necessary to what we have said. It is true that there is granted to the producers and manufacturers of wine from grapes grown in Texas an immunity in respect of that wine which is not granted to other sellers of the same wine. To that extent, but to that extent alone, favor is shown to a class. But this is not the class discrimination put forward and insisted upon. The attack is not mainly on the distinction between producers and other sellers of domestic wine, but upon that between those producers and the sellers of other wine. The latter, as we have said, is not a true class distinction. Whether there is a difference in the scope of a state's general power to legislate and its power to tax or \n\n[202 U.S. 446, 451]\n\u00a0\n not (Kidd v. Pearson, \n128 \nU.S. 1, 26\n, 32 S. L. ed. 346, 352, 2 Inters. Com. Rep. 232, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 6; Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co. \n184 \nU.S. 540, 562\n, 563 S., 46 L. ed. 679, 690, 691, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 431), the former does not need an extended defense so far as the 14th Amendment alone is concerned. See American Sugar Ref. Co. v. Louisiana, \n179 U.S. 89\n, 45 L. ed. 102, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 43; Reymann Brewing Co. v. Brister, \n179 U.S. 445\n, 45 L. ed. 269, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 201; St. John v. New York, \n201 U.S. 633\n, 50 L. ed. --, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 554.\n That part of the 14th Amendment which forbids the abridgment of the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States was not referred to or relied upon in the motion for a new trial or in the assignment of errors before the court of civil appeals. It is mentioned for the first time in the assignment of errors before this court. Chicago I. & L. R. Co. v. McGuire, \n196 \nU.S. 128, 132\n, 49 S. L. ed. 413, 417, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 200. In view of the decisions, we hardly suppose that the omission was by mistake. Bartemeyer v. Iowa, 18 Wall. 129, 21 L. ed. 929; Crowley v. Christensen, \n137 U.S. 86\n, 34 L. ed. 620, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 13; Giozza v. Tiernan, \n148 U.S. 657\n, 37 L. ed. 599, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 721; Cronin v. Adams, \n192 U.S. 108\n, 48 L. ed. 365, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 219. The truth is that the 14th Amendment does not touch the case, standing alone, and, if so, other provisions of the Constitution which were not invoked cannot be brought in now, under cover of the reference to the 14th Amendment, to give the latter a more extensive application to the case than it would have when taken by itself. If the states were restricted by the 14th Amendment only, and saw fit to encourage domestic production, or thought to promote temperance, or to help to secure pure wine, by statutes such as those before us, there would be nothing to hinder them. If the statutes are open to objection as improperly interfering with commerce among the states (Tiernan v. Rinker, \n102 U.S. 123\n, 26 L. ed. 103; Walling v. Michigan, \n116 U.S. 446\n, 29 L. ed. 691, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 454), the right which springs from art. 1,  8, of the Constitution cannot be used to enlarge, for the purposes of this case, the privileges and immunities or the equal protection of the laws secured by the 14th Amendment. Dewey v. Des Moines, \n173 \nU.S. 193, 198\n, 43 S. L. ed. 665, 666, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 379. The converse case of a right set up under art. 1,  8, and an attempt to support it by the 14th Amendment, was decided in Keokuk & H. Bridge Co. v. Illinois, \n\n[202 U.S. 446, 452]\n\u00a0\n \n175 \nU.S. 626, 633\n, 44 S. L. ed. 299, 302, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 205. See further, Harding v. Illinois, \n196 \nU.S. 78, 86\n, 49 S. L. ed. 394, 396, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 176.\n It is proper to say that art. 1,  8, is referred to in the assignments of error before the court of civil appeals and before this court. But it does not appear that the court of civil appeals dealt with the point, and probably it refused to do so on the ground that the section was not relied upon before the trial court. We cannot say that it erred, even if it did, unless that ground is excluded. Jacobi v. Alabama, \n187 U.S. 133\n, 47 L. ed. 106, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 48; Erie Railroad v. Purdy, \n185 U.S. 148\n, 46 L. ed. 847, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 605. The case was argued before us on the 14th Amendment alone, and although there is some slight reference to interference with commerce in one of the briefs, it is rather in aid of the argument based on Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co. \n184 U.S. 540\n, 46 L. ed. 679, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 431, than as an independent point. At all events, the question is not open here.\n We believe that we have said enough to dispose of the cases. Whether, even if the statute is invalid as to wines made in other states, the bond may be valid, in view of the applications having extended to the sale of spirituous liquors (Tiernan v. Rinker, supra), or otherwise, it is unnecessary to inquire.\n Judgments affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan, dissenting:\n I do not understand that the court modifies the principles announced in Walling v. Michigan, \n116 U.S. 446\n, 29 L. ed. 691, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 454, or in Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co. \n184 U.S. 540\n, 46 L. ed. 679, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 431. In my judgment, those cases are applicable to and control this case, and require a reversal of the judgment below upon the ground that the statute of Texas is in violation of the Constitution of the United States. I therefore dissent from the opinion and judgment of the court.\n Mr. Justice Brewer and Mr. Justice Brown concur in this dissent. \n\n\n\n","36":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCRANE v. BUCKLEY(1906)\nNo. 58\nArgued: Decided: December 3, 1906\n\n\n\n Messrs. Charles S. Cushing and William Grant for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[203 U.S. 441, 442]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Delphin Michael Delmas for defendants in error.\n\n\n\n[203 U.S. 441, 443]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n This was an action upon a supersedeas bond, brought by the plaintiff in error, Henry A. Crane, against defendants in error, Cornelius F. Buckley, as principal, and Rudolph Spreckles and Timothy Hopkins, as sureties.\n The bond was given in an action brought by Crane against Buckley in the superior court of Tulare county, California, removed to the United States circuit court of the southern district of California.\n Crane brought suit to foreclose a contract for the sale of certain lands to Buckley and for the recovery of possession thereof. Upon answer and cross bill Buckley made the defense that the sale was procured by false and fraudulent statements and misrepresentations. The court found for complainant, Crane; that the charges of fraud were not sustained; that the rights, interests, and claims of Buckley in and to the property should be foreclosed, subject to the equitable privilege that if Buckley should pay to Crane prior to January 1, 1899, the unpaid portion of the purchase price and the interest thereon, with taxes and costs, Crane should convey to Buckley all the said real estate, pursuant to the agreement of purchase, and it was provided in said decree:\n'And unless said respondent shall place of file herein some sufficient and satisfactory evidence that he has paid, or has tendered, and is able, ready, and willing to pay, to said complainant, Henry A. Crane, the amounts of money hereinbefore provided to be paid for the purchase of said property, on or \n\n[203 U.S. 441, 444]\n\u00a0\n before the 1st day of January, A. D. 1899, it is ordered, adjudged, and decreed that the clerk of this court do, on request of said complainant, Henry A. Crane, or of his counsel, issue a suitable and sufficient order or writ to the marshal of this court, and under the seal thereof, to remove said respondent, Cornelius F. Buckley, from the possession, use, and occupation of said real property, water ditches, water rights, and rights of way, and to place complainant, Henry A. Crane, or his legal representatives, in the exclusive possession, use and occupation thereof.'\n\n This decree was entered on November 16, 1898; on December 16, 1898, Buckley appealed from the decree to the circuit court of appeals, and a supersedeas bond in the sum of $8,000, being the one in suit, was given. This bond is as follows:\n'Whereas, the said respondent and cross-complainant is desirous of staying the execution of the said judgment so appealed from in so far as it relates to the possession of the land and premises involved therein, and is desirous of staying the execution of said judgment or decree, so appealed from, in so far as it relates to the costs awarded to complainant therein:\n\n'Now, the condition of the above obligation is such that if the said C. F. Buckley shall prosecute his appeal to effect, and shall answer all damages and costs that have been and shall be awarded against him, if he fails to make his appeal good, and if he shall answer all damages that shall accrue to the said respondent by reason of the value of the use and occupation of the land and premises from the time of said appeal until the delivery of possession thereof to said Henry A. Crane, and for all waste committed thereon, then the above obligation to be void, else to remain in full force and effect.'\n\n October 2, 1899, the circuit court of appeals affirmed the decree. On October 19, 1899, Buckley having filed a petition for rehearing as to a part of the judgment given October 2, 1899, or for such modification thereof as would allow him until November 1, 1899, within which to make the payments required, the circuit court of appeals found: \n\n[203 U.S. 441, 445]\n\u00a0\n 'The record does show that the appellant made large payments under the contract, and that he has made other large expenditures in the improvements of the property which was the subject of the contract. It is also true that the sums remaining due from the appellant under the contract were large. These payments, the decree of the court below, which was entered on the 16th day of November, 1898, required to be made prior to January 1, 1899, in order that the rights and interests of the appellant in the property be saved, which were by the decree otherwise forever foreclosed and ended. Under the circumstances appearing in the record this court is of the opinion that it is equitable and just to allow the appellant until the 1st day of November, 1899, within which to make the payments required by the decree from which the appeal is taken, and, accordingly, it is ordered that the judgment of this court entered herein on the 2d day of October, 1899, be, and hereby is, so modified as to read: 'Cause remanded to the court below, with directions to substitute for the 1st day of January, 1899, the 1st day of November, 1899, within which the payments therein provided for are permitted to be made, and, as so modified, the decree is affirmed.\" 38 C. C. A. 688, 97 Fed. 980.\n Upon mandate from the circuit court of appeals, this modification was entered in the circuit court.\n Possession of the property was not in fact delivered till November 4, 1899. After the proceedings above recited, action was commenced on the bond to recover $8,000, the penalty thereof, for the alleged value of the use and occupation of the premises by Buckley, between January 1 and November 1, 1899, and waste.\n On the first trial of the case in the circuit court a verdict of $5, 000 was rendered against the present defendant in error, afterwards reduced to $3,000.\n This judgment was reversed upon writ of error to the circuit court of appeals. 59 C. C. A. 109, 123 Fed. 29.\n Upon a subsequent trial of the case, upon instructions following the ruling of the circuit court of appeals, a verdict and \n\n[203 U.S. 441, 446]\n\u00a0\n judgment were rendered in favor of the defendant in error. Another writ of error being taken to the circuit court of appeals, this judgment was affirmed, and the plaintiff in error brought the case here.\n The question in this case as presented here is briefly this: Can the plaintiff in error recover upon the supersedeas bond for the value of the use and occupation of the premises in question from January 1, 1899, to November 1, 1899? This was the period for which the circuit court of appeals, upon the application for rehearing, modified the decree so far as to extend the right of Buckley, one of the defendants in error, and the principal in the bond, to remain in possession of the premises, postponing the foreclosure of his rights therein until the end of the period named in the extension. The bond was given under cover of  1000 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 712), which provides:\n'Every justice or judge signing a citation on any writ of error shall, except in cases brought up by the United States or by direction of any department of the government, take good and sufficient security that the plaintiff in error or the appellant shall prosecute his writ or appeal to effect, and, if he fail to make his plea good, shall answer all damages and costs where the writ is a supersedeas and stays execution, or all costs only where it is not a supersedeas as aforesaid.'\n\n The object and purpose of this section and the bond given in pursuance thereof is to indemnify the party prevailing in the original suit against loss in the respects stated in the bond, by reason of an ineffectual attempt to reverse the holding of the trial court. The successful party in this case, the plaintiff, could not have the decree executed, so far as the possession of the property was concerned, after the supersedeas bond was given, and the purpose of that instrument was to secure him from loss during the time and to the extent that his hand was stayed from action. In order to keep the obligation of the bond it was necessary that the plaintiff in error should substantially reverse the judgment or decree in the respects in \n\n[203 U.S. 441, 447]\n\u00a0\n which the bond was indemnity. As was said by Mr. Chief Justice Waite, in Gay v. Parpart, \n101 \nU.S. 391, 392\n, 25 S. L. ed. 841:\n'If, on the final disposition of a writ of error or appeal, the judgment or decree brought under review is not substantially reversed, it is affirmed, and the writ of error or appeal has not been prosecuted with effect.'\n\n It is elementary that the obligation of sureties upon bonds is strictissimi juris and not to be extended by implication or enlarged construction of the terms of the contract entered into. What, then, was the attitude of the case when this appeal bond was given? The action had been brought to foreclose a contract of purchase. The defense had proved unavailing. The decree had provided that unless Buckley made the payments required by January 1, 1899, his right and interest in the property should be forever foreclosed, and a writ should issue to put the plaintiff in possession of the property.\n From this decree Buckley appealed, and, in order to prevent its execution, gave the bond in suit, which recites that he is desirous of staying the execution of the judgment appealed from in so far as it relates to the possession of the lands and premises involved, and as to costs, which are not now in controversy. Then comes the condition of the obligation, that the appellant shall prosecute his appeal to effect, and the undertaking that if he fails to make his appeal good he shall answer in damages which shall accrue by reason of the value of the use and occupation of the premises until the delivery of the possession thereof, and for waste committed thereon. The effect of this bond was to permit Buckley to remain in possession, and to require him to prosecute his appeal to effect; in default of which he and his sureties may be subjected to liability upon the bond.\n What is meant by prosecuting his appeal to effect? It is an expression substantially equivalent to prosecuting his appeal with success; to make substantial and prevailing his attempt to reverse the decree or judgment awarded against him.\n It is to be remembered that there is not involved in this suit \n\n[203 U.S. 441, 448]\n\u00a0\n any right to recover for use and occupation other than that between the dates of January 1, 1899, and November 1, 1899. This is the very time during which, by the modified decree entered by virtue of the order of the circuit court of appeals, the foreclosure of the contract was postponed and the defendant in error, Buckley, permitted to remain in possession of the premises.\n As we have said, the appeal bond was to secure the plaintiff from loss in the use and possession of the premises, unless Buckley prosecuted his appeal to effect. It is manifest that the effect of the decree in the circuit court of appeals was to extend the time of rightful possession for the period covered in this suit. This right of possession, withheld from the plaintiff in error by the extension awarded in the court of appeals, was the essence of the thing for which the plaintiff in error was indemnified by the terms of the obligation. We cannot think it makes any legal difference in the liability of the sureties upon the bond that Buckley did not pay the balance of the purchase money within the time of the extension. The effect of the decree was to extend the right of possession and to prevent a foreclosure of his rights after January 1, 1899, until the date named,-November 1, 1899. This extended right of possession and post-ponement of foreclosure to November 1, 1899, Buckley gained by the appeal, which, in our view, he thus prosecuted to effect; or, what is another way of saying the same thing, to a successful issue upon the very thing-the wrongful possession of the property-against which the plaintiff in error was indemnified by the terms of the obligation sued upon. In this view of the case the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","37":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCRUIT v. OWEN(1906)\nNo. 51\nArgued: Decided: December 3, 1906\n\n\n\n Mr. E. H. Thomas for appellant.\n Messrs. Chapin Brown and J. P. Earnest for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n This suit involves the construction of the will of Robert \n\n[203 U.S. 368, 369]\n\u00a0\n Cruit, deceased, and, as dependent thereon, the liability of appellant to account to the appellees for the rents of certain real estate located in the city of Washington and in the state of Virginia. Decree in the supreme court passed for appellees, which was affirmed by the court of appeals. 25 App. D. C. 514.\n The will was executed September 1, 1858, and was duly admitted to probate. \n1\n The testator left surviving him a wife \n\n[203 U.S. 368, 370]\n\u00a0\n and four daughters,-Catherine E., then the wife of Samuel Owen, Susan, Ann ( appellant), and Louisa. The widow of the deceased died May 13, 1876; Louisa died January 2, 1876, Susan died December 31, 1900, and Catherine E. Owen died May 14, 1901. Susan and Louisa never married, nor has Ann up to the present time. Catherine E. Owen left surviving her three daughters, Evania F. Mackall and the appellees, Kate D. Owen and Jessie Owen Cugle. The property produces an income of $11,000 or $12,000.\n The question in the case is whether appellant succeeded to the whole estate upon the death of Catherine E. Owen, or whether the children of the latter, appellees, were the successors of their mother.\n The will gives small legacies to two hephews, and disposes of 'all the rest and residue and remainder of the testator's estate to Susan Cruit in trust (1) for his wife for and during her life, and to permit her to take and receive the whole income thereof; (2) in trust, as to testator's real estate, to his daughters equally, share and share alike, for and during their respective lives, . . . and from and after their death in trust for the child or children of each of my said daughters, then alive, in fee simple, such child or children, respectively, to take the share to which his, her or their parent was entitled. And if any of my said daughters shall die without having been married, her share shall pass to her or their surviving sisters or sister for life equally, and upon her or their death the same shall vest in her or their child or children in the same manner and for the same estate and pass on her or their death, as her or their original share or shares.'\n We do not think it is difficult to discern the intention of the testator. There is very little ambiguity in the will. If ambiguity exist it is in the pronoun 'their' in the provision 'and from and after their death in trust for the child or children of each of my said daughters then living in fee simple, such \n\n[203 U.S. 368, 371]\n\u00a0\n child or children respectively to take the share to which his, her or their parent was entitled.' It is contended by appellant that it is manifest from these words and others in the will that it was drawn by a skilful hand, to create a joint tenancy in the daughters of the testator, and cases are cited in which wills containing such words have been construed, it is contended, as giving such effect. We might review these cases and those cited in opposition by appellees if the will in controversy were less clear in its meaning. Provision for his daughters and equality between them were clear and definite in the mind of the testator. One daughter was married and that the others might be was contemplated, and that children might result therefrom. This idea is especially prominent and is carefully expressed, and provision is made for such children. The contention of appellant militates against this idea. It would leave grandchildren unprovided for. If such had been the intention of the testator, we think he would have explicitly expressed it. It was not so natural an intention as the other. It is not the first impression of the will, and can only be made out by rigidly giving plurality to the pronoun 'their' in the provision 'and from and after their death in trust for the child or children of each of my said daughters, then living, in fee simple.' But the word is qualified and made several by what precedes it. The devise is to his daughters 'for and during their respective lives.' It is qualified also by what follows it. One of the daughters of the testator was married, the others were not, and might not be, and anticipating this possibility the testator provided that, if any of his daughters should die without having been married, her share should pass to the survivors. In other words, it was only upon the death of a daughter 'without having been married' (and without issue possibly), that her share was to pass to her sisters or sister. We also agree with the courts below that the trust continues.\n The concluding paragraph of the will is:\n'And lastly I appoint my said daughter Susan Cruit sole \n\n[203 U.S. 368, 372]\n\u00a0\n executrix of this my last will and testament. And if my said daughter shall die or from any cause should become unable to act in the trust, I direct that a trustee shall be appointed by the circuit court so that the trusts hereby created shall be at all times preserved and carried into effect.'\n\n Decree affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] This is the last will and testament of me Robert Cruit of the city of Washington in the District of Columbia.\n First I give to my two nephews Edwin Cruit the son of George, and Henry the son of John L. Cruit, the legacy of one hundred dollars, to each of them, to be paid as soon after my death as may be. And all the rest residue and remainder of my estate, real, personal and mixed, whatsoever and wheresoever situated, I give, devise and bequeath unto my dear daughter Susan Cruit her heirs executors and administrators upon the following trusts to wit: In trust for my dear wife Catherine for and during her life, and to permit her to receive and take the whole income thereof after paying taxes repairs and insurance, and to apply and dispose of such income as she my said wife may think proper and from and after her decease, in trust, as to my real estate for my dear daughters Catherine E. the wife of Samuel Owens, Ann Cruit, Louisa Cruit, and herself the said Susan Cruit, equally share and share alike, for and during their respective lives, for their own sole and separate benefit free from the control of the husband of my said daughter Catherine and any husband or husbands she or my said other daughters or any of them may hereafter happen to marry, and not to be liable in any way for the debts of any such husbands, the receipts of my said daughters alone being a valid discharge. And from and after their death in trust for the child or children of each of my said daughters then living in fee simple, such child or children respectively to take the share to which his, her or their parent was entitled. And if any of my said daughters shall die without having been married, her share shall pass to her or their surviving sisters or sister for life equally; and upon her or their death the same shall vest in her or their child or children in the same manner, and for the same estate and pass on her or their death, as her or their original shares or share. And as to my personal property, also given in trust as above expressed. I direct that the same shall, after the death of my said wife, be divided equally among all my said children, Catherine, Susan, Ann and Louisa share and share alike, and I accordingly give the same to them as aforesaid for their own sole and separate use.\n And lastly I appoint my said daughter Susan Cruit sole executrix of this my last will and testament. And if my said daughter shall die or from any cause should become unable to act in the trust, I direct, that a trustee shall be appointed by the circuit court so that the trusts hereby created shall be at all times preserved and carried into effect. \n\n\n\n\n","38":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDANIEL RED BIRD v. U S(1906)\nNo. 125\nArgued: Decided: November 5, 1906\n\n\n\n\n[203 U.S. 76, 77]\n\u00a0\n The subject-matter of this suit consists of 4,420,406 acres of land in the Cherokee country about to be allotted among the Cherokee people entitled to participate in the distribution of the common property of the Cherokee Nation. The case was transmitted to the court of claims by the Secretary of the Interior, on the 24th of February, 1903, the nature of the controversy being thus stated:\n'A controversy has arisen as to the rights of white persons intermarried with Cherokee citizens, and a protest has been filed with this Department on behalf of a large number of citizens of the Cherokee Nation by blood against the enrolment of intermarried persons, 'so as to recognize their right to participate in the distribution of any of the common property of the Cherokee Nation of whatever kind or character.' It is asserted, on the one hand, that the Cherokee laws have never recognized the right of 'intermarried citizens' to share in the distribution of the property of the Nation, and, on the other hand, that the Cherokee laws as well as the laws of Congress recognize those persons who have been married to Cherokee citizens in accordance with the laws of the Cherokee Nation relating to marriage as full citizens of such nation, entitled to share equally with full-blooded citizens in the property of the tribe.'\n\n Thereafter, Congress, by the act of March 3, 1905 (33 Stat. at L. 1048, 1071, chap. 1479), provided as follows:\n'That in the case entitled 'In the Matter of Enrolment of Persons Claiming Rights in the Cherokee Nation by Intermarriage against the United States, Departmental, Numbered Seventy-six,' now pending in the court of claims, the said court is hereby authorized and empowered to render final judgment in said case, and either party feeling itself aggrieved by said judgment shall have the right of appeal to the Supreme Court of United States within thirty days from the filing of said judgment in the court of claims. And the said Supreme Court of the United States shall advance said case on its calendar for early hearing.' \n\n[203 U.S. 76, 78]\n\u00a0\n The court of claims filed its opinion May 15, 1905, and on May 18 findings of fact and conclusions of law, and on that day entered its decree as follows:\n\n'This case having been transmitted to this court by the Secretary of the Interior by letter dated February 24, 1903, for the findings and opinion of the court in accordance with the provisions of  2 of the act of Congress of March 3, 1883, entitled 'An Act to Afford Assistance and Relief to Congress and the Executive Departments in the Investigation of Claims and Demands against the Government' (22 Stat. at.

Stat. 1901, p. 748), and Congress, by the act of March 3, 1905, entitled 'An Act Making Appropriations for the Current and Contingent Expenses of the Indian Department and for Fulfilling Treaty Stipulations with Various Indian Tribes for the Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 1906, and for Other Purposes,' having made the following enactment:\n\n\"That in the case entitled 'In the Matter of Enrolment of Persons Claiming Rights in the Cherokee Nation by Intermariage against the United States, Departmental, Numbered Seventy-six,' now pending in the court of claims, the said court is hereby authorized and empowered to render final judgment in said case, and either party feeling itself aggrieved by said judgment shall have the right of appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States within thirty days from the filing of said judgment in the court of claims. And the said Supreme Court of the United States shall advance said case on its calendar for early hearing;'\n\n'And the cause coming on to be heard upon the petition, answers, agreed facts, proofs, and arguments submitted by the attorneys of the parties to the cause, respectively, and the court having heard and fully considered the same;\n\n'And it appearing to the court that all those white persons who married Cherokee Indians by blood subsequently to the enactment of the Cherokee law which became effective November 1, 1875, and which declared that such persons by intermarriage acquired no rights of soil or interest in the \n\n[203 U.S. 76, 79]\n\u00a0\n vested funds of the Nation, had due notice of the limitations set upon their rights and privileges as citizens; and that those white persons who married Cherokee citizens by blood prior to said date acquired rights as citizens in the lands belonging to the Nation and held and owned as national lands, except such of these intermarried persons as lost their rights as Cherokee citizens by abandoning their Cherokee wives or by marrying other white or nontribal men or women having no rights of citizenship by blood in said Cherokee Nation:\n\n'It is by the court ordered, adjudged, and decreed that such white persons residing in the Cherokee Nation as became Cherokee citizens under Cherokee laws by intermarriage with Cherokees by blood prior to the 1st day of November, 1875, are equally interested in and have equal per capita rights with Cherokee Indians by blood in the lands constituting the public domain of the Cherokee Nation, and are entitled to be enrolled for that purpose; but such intermarried whites acquired no rights and have no interest or share in any funds belonging to the Cherokee Nation except where such funds were derived by lease, sale, or otherwise from the lands of the Cherokee Nation conveyed to it by the United States by the patent of December, 1838; and that the rights and privileges of those white citizens who intermarried with Cherokee citizens subsequent to the 1st day of November, 1875, do not extend to the right of soil or interest in any of the vested funds of the Cherokee Nation, and such intermarried persons are not entitled to share in the allotment of the lands or in the distribution of any of the funds belonging to said Nation, and are not entitled to be enrolled for such purpose; that those white persons who intermarried with Delaware or Shawnee citizens of the Cherokee Nation, either prior or subsequent to November 1, 1875, and those who intermarried with Cherokees by blood, and, subsequently, being left a widow or widower by the death of the Cherokee wife or husband, intermarried with persons not of Cherokee blood, and those white men who having married Cherokee women and subsequently aban- \n\n[203 U.S. 76, 80]\n\u00a0\n doned their Cherokee wives, have no part or share in the Cherokee property, and are not entitled to participate in the allotment of the lands or in the distribution of the funds of the Cherokee Nation or people, and are not entitled to be enrolled for such purpose.'\n\n Cherokee citizens by blood took an appeal to this court from so much of that decree as adjudged that persons intermarrying with Cherokee citizens prior to November 1, 1875, were entitled to share in the Cherokee property, which appeal is numbered in this court 125; and the Cherokee Nation prosecuted a similar appeal, numbered 126. Then certain intermarried whites appealed from the decree except that portion which held that the whites who intermarried prior to November 1, 1875, were entitled to share, numbered 127. And thereafter other intermarried whites appealed generally, numbered 128.\n The case is reported in 40 Ct.

E. Leckie for appellants in No. 128.\n\n Statement by Mr. Chief Justice Fuller:\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n Article 1 of the treaty of 1846 declared 'that the lands now occupied by the Cherokee Nation shall be secured to the \n\n[203 U.S. 76, 81]\n\u00a0\n whole Cherokee people for their common use and benefit' [9 Stat. at L. 871 ]; and article 4, that these lands 'shall be and remain the common property of the whole Cherokee people.'\n Section 2 of article 1 of the Cherokee Constitution (1839) provided that 'the lands of the Cherokee Nation shall remain common property.'\n The amendments of 1866 (art. 1,  2) declared that the lands of the Cherokee Nation 'shall remain common property until the National Council shall request the survey and allotment of the same, in accordance with the provisions of article 20 of the treaty of 19th of July, 1866 [14 Stat. at L. 799], between the United States and the Cherokee Nation.' This request was subsequently duly made and an allotment is taking place accordingly.\n The intermarried whites have not acquired the right to share in the lands or funds of the Cherokee Nation by grant in express terms, but that right is claimed in virtue of an alleged citizenship in the Cherokee Nation derived from intermarriage under Cherokee laws.\n The Nation, under the treaties, possessed the right of local self- government with authority to make such laws as it deemed necessary for the government and protection of persons and property within the country, belonging to its people, 'or such persons as have connected themselves with them.' Treaty, Dec. 29, 1835, art. 5, 7 Stat. at L. 478. And  14 of article 3 of the Cherokee Constitution provided: 'The National Council shall have power to make all laws and regulations which they shall deem necessary and proper for the good of the Nation, which shall not be contrary to this Constitution.'\n Prior to 1855 certain white persons had married Cherokees, which had given rise to serious questions respecting the status of these persons and the jurisdiction of the Nation over them. The act of Congress of June 30, 1834 [4 Stat. at L. 729, chap. 161] (carried forward into  2134, 2135, 2147, and 2148 of the Revised Statutes), provided that a citizen of the United States should not go \n\n[203 U.S. 76, 82]\n\u00a0\n into the Indian country without a passport, and that he might be removed therefrom as an intruder. The promise of the United States to remove unauthorized citizens from the Nation appears in the treaties, and even as late as 1893, in the convention by which the Cherokee outlet was ceded to the United States. But the Council could permit certain white persons to reside in the Nation, subject to its laws, though free from the laws relating to intruders.\n In these circumstances the Cherokee act of 1855 'regulating intermarriage with white men' was passed. Its purpose is plain and is disclosed by the preamble in these words: 'Whereas the peace and prosperity of the Cherokee people require that, in the enforcement of the laws, the jurisdiction should be exercised over all persons whatever who may, from time to time, be privileged to reside within the territorial limits of this Nation, therefore,' etc., etc. The act was administrative and aimed at subjecting the intermarried whites to the control and dominion of the Cherokee laws instead of leaving them responsible solely to the laws and authorities of the government of the United States. It contains nothing indicating the intention to confer property rights on intermarried whites. But in respect of the public domain, the court of claims, in the present case, because of the opinion in Cherokee Nation v. Journeycake, \n155 U.S. 196\n, 39 L. ed. 120, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 55, assumed that the acquisition of citizenship under Cherokee laws carried the right to share therein, unless forbidden by such legislation. And Mr. Chief Justice Nott, speaking for the court, said: 'In 1874 the rapidly growing value of the Cherokee lands was becoming perceptible. On the one hand there were white men who desired to marry into the tribe, and, marrying and residing in the Nation, desired the rights and privileges of citizens; on the other hand, there were white adventurers desiring to share in the wealth of the Nation, soon, it was believed, to become available to individual citizens. The public welfare might be benefited by allowing the one, and most certainly would be conserved by excluding the \n\n[203 U.S. 76, 83]\n\u00a0\n other. No restriction appeared to exist in the Constitution which would forbid the National Council from admitting white men to citizenship upon the condition that they should not acquire an estate or interest in the communal or common property of the Nation.'\n Accordingly, in 1874, the Cherokee National Council adopted a new code containing sections relating to intermarriage, which became effective November 1, 1875, and carried a provision in article XV.,  75, reading as follows:\n'Provided, also, that the rights and privileges herein conferred shall not extend to right of soil or interest in the vested funds of this Nation, unless such admitted citizen shall pay into the general funds of the national treasury a sum of money, to be ascertained and fixed by the National Council, equal to the 'pro rata' share of each native Cherokee in the lands and vested wealth of the Nation, estimated at $500, and thereafter conform to the Constitution of the Nation, and the laws made or to be made in pursuance thereof, in which case he shall be deemed a Cherokee to all intent, and be entitled to all the rights of other Cherokees.'\n\n On November 28, 1877, the Council amended this proviso by striking out all after the words 'this Nation' in the second line thereof, so that the proviso read:\n'Provided, also, that the rights and privileges herein conferred shall not extend to right of soil or interest in the vested funds of this Nation.'\n\n The court of claims found that the Cherokee law remained unchanged, in this particular, from 1877 to the date of the decree. Something is said about certain compilations of the Cherokee laws of 1880 and 1892, which omitted this part of  75, but we agree that this omission did not operate to change the existing law, as the acts providing for the compilations did not provide that they should be effective as laws of the Nation, and, where an error was committed by the compiler, the original law, as duly passed and approved, must prevail. \n\n[203 U.S. 76, 84]\n\u00a0\n Thus it is seen that the privilege of paying $500 into the Cherokee treasury and becoming thereby entitled to 'all the rights of other Cherokees' existed only from November 1, 1875, to November 28, 1877. Assuming that the National Council had authority, under the Cherokee Constitution of 1839 and the amendments of 1866, to confer on white intermarried citizens the privilege of purchasing a right in the soil and funds of the Nation, that privilege was withdrawn in two years, and, according to the facts found, was only availed of by two persons, neither of whom was an individual party to the suit. No right in the Nation's property flowed from the Cherokee citizenship act, which merely subjected the white man to the jurisdiction of the Nation, but that right resulted from express grant and the payment of a price. As to the Delawares and Shawnees, their participation was specifically provided for by convention, approved by the United States, and depended upon payments made. As to the freedmen, their participation in property distribution was secured by the terms of the treaty of 1866 (the result of the Civil War), and of the constitutional amendments thereupon adopted. The court of claims referred to them thus: 'These constitutional amendments were brought about by the action of the United States at the close of the Civil War in dictating that the slaves or freed persons of color in the Cherokee country should not only be admitted to the rights of citizenship, but to an equal participation in the communal or common property of the Cherokees. The Cherokees seem to have veiled their humiliation by these general declarations of the persons who should be taken and deemed to be citizens; but be that as it may, the overthrow of the Cherokee Nation and the treaty of peace, 1866, and the terms dictated by the United States, whereby their former slaves were made their political equals, and the common property of the Cherokees was to be shared in with their servants and dependents, was in effect a revolution. The constitutional amendment quoted was simply declaratory of the new order \n\n[203 U.S. 76, 85]\n\u00a0\n of things. It is not necessarily prospective, and does not impose limitations upon the legislative power with regard to the naturalization or future adoption of aliens as citizens. Under the polity of the Cherokees, citizenship and communal ownership were distinct things. The citizen who annually received an annuity derived from the communal fund held by the United States, and the citizen who never received a dollar from the fund, or never so much as thought of receiving it, form a concrete object lesson in constitutional law not easily effaced from the common mind.'\n Section 5 of article 3 of the Constitution of 1839 was as follows:\n'Sec. 5. No person shall be eligible to a seat in the National Council but a free Cherokee male citizen, who shall have attained to the age of twenty-five years.\n\n'The descendants of Cherokee men by all free women, except the African race, whose parents may have been living together as man and wife according to the customs and laws of this Nation, shall be entitled to all the rights and privileges of this Nation, as well as the posterity of Cherokee women by all free men. No person who is of negro or mulatto parentage, either by the father's or mother's side, shall be eligible to hold any office of profit, honor, or trust under this government.\n\n'Sec. 6. The electors and members of the National Council shall in all cases, except those of treason, felony, or breach of the peace, be privileged from arrest during their attendance at elections and at the National Council in going to and returning.'\n\n The amendment of  5, in 1866, reads:\n'Sec. 5. No person shall be eligible to a seat in the National Council but a male citizen of the Cherokee Nation, who shall have attained to the age of twenty-five years and who shall have been a bona fide resident of the district in which he may be elected at least six months immediately preceding such election. All native-born Cherokees, all Indians and whites legally members of the Nation by adoption, and all freedmen \n\n[203 U.S. 76, 86]\n\u00a0\n who have been liberated by voluntary act of their former owners, or by law, as well as free colored persons who were in the country at the commencement of the Rebellion and are now residents therein, or who may return within six months from the 19th day of July, 1866, and their descendants who reside within the limits of the Cherokee Nation, shall be taken and deemed to be citizens of the Cherokee Nation.'\n\n We cannot accept the view that this amendment amounted to a grant of property rights, or operated to enlarge the authority of the National Council in respect of the readmission of former members of the Nation.\n The amendment (found in that part of the Constitution in respect to offices and elections) must be taken as a whole, and related to eligibility to a seat in the National Council, and not to property rights. The contention that the words 'citizens of the Cherokee Nation' should be construed as relating to the constitutional provision of 1839, that the lands of the Nation should be common property, is without merit in view of the provisions themselves.\n By  2 of article 1 of the Constitution of 1839 it was provided that 'whenever any citizen shall remove with his effects out of the limits of this Nation, and becomes a citizen of any other government, all his rights and privileges as a citizen of this Nation shall cease; provided, nevertheless, that the National Council shall have power to readmit, by law, to all the rights of citizenship, any such person or persons who may, at any time, desire to return to the Nation, on memorializing the National Council for such readmission.' By its terms this referred to those who had been citizens, and their readmission gave no rights not originally possessed, and this was true under the amendments of 1866. Many special Cherokee laws demonstrate that the Council did not venture to assume, nor desire to assume, the power to impart to the white adopted citizen other than civil and political rights.\n For instance, the acts of 1878, readmitting Greenway and his children and Allen and his family 'to all the rights and \n\n[203 U.S. 76, 87]\n\u00a0\n privileges of citizens of the Cherokee Nation' specifically provided that no rights should be acquired except such as attach to white men, 'adopted citizens of the Cherokee Nation.'\n The acts relating to intermarriage with whites contained many restrictions, but by the act in respect of the intermarriage of Cherokees with other Indians no such restrictions were imposed. Cherokee act of Nov. 27, 1880. That act provided that the marriage should be contracted according to the law regulating marriages between 'our own citizens,' and declared that such Indian 'shall be and is hereby deemed a Cherokee to all intents and purposes, and entitled to the rights of other Cherokees.' There is no such language in the acts relating to intermarried whites.\n The treaty of 1866, between the United States and the Cherokee Nation, provided as to the former slaves, that they should be free and they 'and their descendants shall have all the rights of native Cherokees.' [Art. 9.]\n Article 15 of the same treaty, after providing for the settlement of friendly Indians amongst the Cherokees and the manner in which the latter shall be paid therefor, then stipulates that 'they shall be incorporated into and ever after remain a part of the Cherokee Nation on equal terms in every respect with native citizens.' When the Delawares were about to be moved into the Cherokee country as friendly Indians, it was stipulated in the agreement that 'on the fulfilment by the Delawares of the foregoing stipulations, all the members of the tribe registered as above provided, shall become members of the Cherokee Nation, with the same rights and immunities and the same participation (and no other) in the national funds as native Cherokees . . . And the children hereafter born of such Delawares so incorporated into the Cherokee Nation shall in all respects be regarded as native Cherokees.' Later, when an agreement was made with the Shawnees, after the amount of money to be paid was provided for, the rights of Shawnees were defined as follows: 'and that \n\n[203 U.S. 76, 88]\n\u00a0\n the said Shawnees shall be incorporated into and ever after remain a part of the Cherokee Nation, on equal terms in every respect and with all the privileges and immunities of native citizens of said Cherokee Nation.'\n These intermarried whites show no grant of equal rights as members of the Cherokee Nation by treaty or otherwise, nor have they (excepting the two individuals heretofore referred to) paid any sum into the Nation's treasury for a pro rata share of its money and lands.\n The Delawares, the Shawnees, and the freedmen acquired their property rights by the express words of treaties, but the intermarried whites cannot point out any such in their favor. Doubtless because of this they have heretofore asserted no claim, although the Cherokee courts were open to them to do so, and have allowed repeated payments of money to be made to every other citizen without question.\n The distinction between different classes of citizens was recognized by the Cherokees in the differences in their intermarriage law, as applicable to the whites and to the Indians of other tribes; by the provision in the intermarriage law that a white man intermarried with an Indian by blood acquires certain rights as a citizen, but no provision that if he marries a Cherokee citizen not of Indian blood he shall be regarded as a citizen at all; and by the provision that if, once having married an Indian by blood, he marries the second time a citizen not by blood, he loses all of his rights as a citizen. And the same distinction between citizens as such and citizens with property rights has also been recognized by Congress in enactments relating to other Indians than the Five Civilized Tribes. Act August 9, 1888, 25 Stat. at L. 392, chap. 818; act May 2, 1890, 26 Stat. at L. 96, chap. 182; act June 7, 1897, 30 Stat. at L. 90, chap. 3.\n In Whitmire v. Cherokee Nation, 30 Ct. Cl. 138, 152, the court of claims said: 'Here it should be noted that when the treaty was made there had long been a peculiar class of citizens in the Cherokee country,-white men who became \n\n[203 U.S. 76, 89]\n\u00a0\n citizens by intermarriage.' And, after quoting the proviso to  75, art. 15, of the Cherokee Code of 1874, the court added: 'The idea, therefore, existed both in the mind and in the laws of the Cherokee people, that citizenship did not necessarily extend to or invest in the citizen a personal or individual interest in what the Constitution termed the 'common property,'-'the lands of the Cherokee Nation.\"\n In Stephens v. Cherokee Nation, \n174 \nU.S. 445, 488\n, 43 S. L. ed. 1041, 1056, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 722, 738, this court, in respect of certain acts of Congress, observed:\n'It may be remarked that the legislation seems to recognize, especially the act of June 28, 1898 [30 Stat. at L. 495, chap. 517], a distinction between admission to citizenship merely and the distribution of property to be subsequently made, as if there might be circumstances under which the right to a share in the latter would not necessarily follow from the concession of the former.'\n\n Referring to this, the court of claims said in its opinion in the present case, 40 Ct. Cl. 411, 442:\n'It cannot be supposed for a moment that Congress intended by this legislation to take away from some of the Cherokee people property which was constitutionally theirs, or to confer upon white citizens property which they were not legally entitled to have. The term 'citizens' in these statutes of the United States must be construed to mean those citizens who were constitutionally or legally entitled to share in the allotment of the lands.'\n\n The doctrine is familiar that the language of a statute is to be interpreted in the light of the particular matter in hand and the object sought to be accomplished, as manifested by other parts of the act, and the words used may be qualified by their surroundings and connections.\n In accepting the conclusion of the court of claims in this regard we, nevertheless, deem it proper to somewhat consider the congressional legislation relied on by the claimants.\n The act of Congress of July 1, 1902 (32 Stat. at L. 716, chap. 1375), ratified by the Cherokee Nation, August 7, 1902, and often called the Cherokee agreement, contained these sections: \n\n[203 U.S. 76, 90]\n\u00a0\n 'Sec. 25. The roll of citizens of the Cherokee Nation shall be made as of September first, nineteen hundred and two, and the names of all persons then living and entitled to enrolment on that date shall be placed on said roll by the Commission to the Five Civilized Tribes.\n'Sec. 26. The names of all persons living on the first day of September, nineteen hundred and two, entitled to be enrolled as provided in section twenty-five hereof, shall be placed upon the roll made by said Commission, and no child born thereafter to a citizen, and no white person who has intermarried with a Cherokee citizen since the sixteenth day of December, eighteen hundred and ninety-five, shall be entitled to enrolment or to participate in the distribution of the tribal property of the Cherokee Nation.\n\n'Sec. 27. Such rolls shall, in all other respects, be made in strict compliance with the provisions of section twenty-one of the act of Congress approved June twenty-eighth, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight ( 30 Stat. at L. 495, chap. 517), and the act of Congress approved May thirty-first, nineteen hundred (31 Stat. at L. 221, chap. 598).\n\n'Sec. 28. No person whose name appears upon the roll made by the Dawes Commission as a citizen or freedman of any other tribe shall be enrolled as a citizen of the Cherokee Nation.\n\n'Sec. 29. For the purpose of expediting the enrolment of the Cherokee citizens and the allotment of lands as herein provided, the said Commission shall, from time to time, and as soon as practicable, forward to the Secretary of the Interior lists upon which shall be placed the names of those persons found by the Commission to be entitled to enrolment. The lists thus prepared, when approved by the Secretary of the Interior, shall constitute a part and parcel of the final roll of citizens of the Cherokee tribe, upon which allotment of land and distribution of other tribal property shall be made. When there shall have been submitted to and approved by the \n\n[203 U.S. 76, 91]\n\u00a0\n Secretary of the Interior lists embracing the names of all those lawfully entitled to enrolment, the roll shall be deemed complete. The roll so prepared shall be made in quadruplicate, one to be deposited with the Secretary of the Interior, one with the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, one with the principal chief of the Cherokee Nation, and one to remain with the Commission to the Five Civilized Tribes.\n\n'Sec. 30. During the months of September and October, in the year nineteen hundred and two, the Commission to the Five Civilized Tribes may receive applications for enrolment of such infant children as may have been born to recognized and enrolled citizens of the Cherokee Nation on or before the first day of September, nineteen hundred and two, but the application of no person whomsoever for enrolment shall be received after the thirty-first day of October, nineteen hundred and two.\n\n'Sec. 31. No person whose name does not appear upon the roll prepared as herein provided shall be entitled to in any manner participate in the distribution of the common property of the Cherokee tribe, and those whose names appear thereon shall participate in the manner set forth in this act: Provided, That no allotment of land or other tribal property shall be made to any person, or to the heirs of any person, whose name is on said roll and who died prior to the first day of September, nineteen hundred and two. The right of such person to any interest in the lands or other tribal property shall be deemed to have become extinguished and to have passed to the tribe in general upon his death before said date, and any person or persons who may conceal the death of any one on said roll as aforesaid for the purpose of profiting by said concealment, and who shall knowingly receive any portion of any land or other tribal property or of the proceeds so arising from any allotment prohibited by this section, shall be deemed guilty of a felony, and shall be proceeded against as may be provided in other cases of felony, and the penalty for this offense shall be confinement at hard \n\n[203 U.S. 76, 92]\n\u00a0\n labor for a period of not less than one year nor more than five years, and in addition thereto a forfeiture to the Cherokee Nation of the lands, other tribal property, and proceeds so obtained.'\n\n It thus appears that the roll of citizens of the Cherokee Nation was to be made up as of September 1, 1902, of the persons then living and entitled to enrolment on that date; that all such persons should be placed upon the roll, and that ( 29) on the lists to be finally approved by the Secretary of the Interior there should be placed only the names of those persons found to be entitled to enrolment. In all other respects the roll was to be made in compliance with  21 of the Act of Congress of June 28, 1898, and of the Act of Congress of May 31, 1900\n\n\n Section 21 provided: 'That in making rolls of citizenship of the several tribes, as required by law, the Commission to the Five Civilized Tribes is authorized and directed to take the roll of Cherokee citizens of eighteen hundred and eighty (not including freedmen) as the only roll intended to be confirmed by this and preceding acts of Congress, and to enroll all persons now living whose names are found on said roll, . . . with such intermarried white persons as may be entitled to citizenship under Cherokee laws.' The roll of 1880, made by the Cherokees, was a census roll, and its confirmation was not intended to create any rights which citizens of the Cherokee Nation had not before enjoyed, but merely to furnish the basis for making up the roll of citizens. Section 21 was in reality a statement that no previous act of Congress was intended to confirm any other roll of the Cherokee Nation.\n The act of May 31, 1900 (31 Stat. at L. 221, 236, chap. 598), provided: 'That said Commission shall continue to exercise all authority heretofore conferred on it by law. But it shall not receive, consider, or make any record of any application of any person for enrolment as a member of any tribe in Indian territory who has not been a recognized citizen thereof, and duly and lawfully enrolled or admitted as such, and its refusal \n\n[203 U.S. 76, 93]\n\u00a0\n of such application shall be final when approved by the Secretary, of the interior.' Section 31 of the act of July 1, 1902, says that no person whose name does not appear on the roll made by the Commission to the Five Civilized Tribes 'shall be entitled to in any manner participate in the distribution of the common property of the Cherokee tribe, and those whose names appear thereon shall participate in the manner set forth in this act.' In other words, the roll must be made up of citizens who, under the lasw of the Cherokee Nation, were entitled to participation in the distribution of the common property of the Cherokee tribes.\n The concluding words of  21, 'with such intermarried white persons as may be entitled to citizenship under Cherokee laws,' emphatically indicate that Congress had the Indian citizen in mind in all that went before and limited enrolment of white persons to such as might be entitled to citizenship under Cherokee laws.\n Counsel for claimants speak of the act of 1902 as a 'treaty,' but it is only an act of Congress, and can have no greater effect. It is a singular commentary on the situation that the majority of the native Cherokees voted against its acceptance, which was carried by the vote of the whites. The suggestion is wholly inadmissible that they could vote themselves an interest in the property of the Cherokee people, including a share in the money paid in by the Delawares and the Shawnees, and become thereby wards of this government.\n Referring to  26 of the act of 1902, which declares that no white person intermarried since December 16, 1895, shall be entitled to enrolment or to participate in the distribution of the tribal property of the Cherokee Nation, and to an act of the Cherokee Council to the same effect, approved December 16, 1895, counsel contend that the act of Congress shows that there was a class of persons who, having married prior to December 16, 1895, were to be enrolled, embracing all lawfully married according to the law of the Nation, and were to participate in the distribution of the tribal property. \n\n[203 U.S. 76, 94]\n\u00a0\n The doctrine that the denial of a right is the grant of a right is a poor basis for a grant of land. Not a single word of the act intimates that these intermarried persons have or are to have any interest in the property of the Nation, and to hold that because the act of 1902 declares that white persons intermarrying after 1895 should acquire no property rights the Indians, in accepting the act, conceded property rights to all who intermarried prior thereto, would put a construction on the act utterly inconsistent with the settled rule that, as between the whites and the Indians, the laws are to be construed most favorably to the latter.\n After the decision in Journeycake's Case, \n155 U.S. 196\n, 39 L. ed. 120, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 55, and in that of Whitmore v. Cherokee Nation, 30 Ct. Cl. 138, 180, the Cherokee National Council passed the act of December 16, 1895, amending certain sections of the compiled laws, from which the provisions of the act of November, 1877, which denied intermarrying whites any right in Cherokee property, had been erroneously omitted, by re- enacting the same, but this only evidenced the determination to prevent the encroachment of the whites upon the property rights of the Cherokee people. The act was clearly passed out of abundant caution, and was quite unnecessary in view of the fact that the act of 1877 remained in force, as was found by the court of claims.\n We are dealing with the right of enrolment so as to entitle the persons enrolled to participate in the distribution of the lands and vested funds of the Cherokee Nation, and not with questions arising in respect of improvements on the public domain. As to improvements, they seem to have been treated as those of a tenant who had made them under an agreement that they should remain his. Any citizen of the Nation could use the public domain, and it is not asserted that the intermarried whites failed to obtain their share of such use, but because they have enjoyed that benefit, free from tax or burden, is no reason for giving them a share in the lands and vested funds, which has never been granted to them, and for which they have never paid. \n\n[203 U.S. 76, 95]\n\u00a0\n We concur in the conclusions of the court of claims, including the disposition of the particular contention presented in appeal No. 128.\n This involved certain claimants, before the court, known as 'married out and abandoned whites,' who alleged that they became citizens of the Cherokee Nation by intermarriage, but conceded that they had since married persons having no rights of Cherokee citizenship by blood, or had abandoned their Cherokee wives. They contended that they could not be deprived of the rights and privileges acquired by intermarriage save by proceedings in the nature of office found. As to this the court of claims said:\n'These intermarried whites are not grantees or devisees seised and in possession of land, occupying the position of defendants. They occupy the contrary position-of plaintiffs seeking to recover money-and it is obligatory upon them to establish their right to it. To say that a white man can share in the property of the Cherokees for the reason that at one time in his life he was the husband of a Cherokee woman, and to say that this court or the Secretary of the Interior must hold that he is still the husband of a Cherokee woman because the contrary has not been established in another proceeding, is an appeal to technicality which the court cannot uphold. These claimants, like other plaintiffs, must prove their case; asserting a present right, they must establish present conditions. The laws and usages of the Cherokees, their earliest history, the fundamental principles of their national policy, their Constitution and statutes, all show that citizenship rested on blood or marriage; that the man who would assert citizenship must establish marriage; that when marriage ceased ( with a special reservation in favor of widows or widowers), citizenship ceased; that when an intermarried white married a person having no rights of Cherokee citizenship by blood, it was conclusive evidence that the tie which bound him to the Cherokee people was severed and the very basis of his citizenship obliterated. \n\n[203 U.S. 76, 96]\n\u00a0\n 'The Cherokee statute which has been cited (Laws of 1892,  669) gives a proceeding in the nature of office found, but, nevertheless, is confirmatory of the views hereinbefore expressed. It relates to cases where the Cherokee government takes the initiative to accomplish a purpose. That is to say, where an intermarried white man has forfeited his rights of citizenship in the Nation by acts which declare such forfeiture 'and the Nation requires his removal beyond the limits of its territory,' this proceeding must be resorted to, to be followed by a call on the United States Indian agent 'to remove such a white man.' It is in principle precisely like the common-law procedure of office found, and exists for the same reason,-that the government may exercise a right dependent upon only the alienage of a person living within its territory, presumably a citizen.'\n\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","39":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDARLINGTON v. TURNER(1906)\nNo. 196\nArgued: Decided: May 14, 1906\n\n\n\n\n[202 U.S. 195, 196]\n\u00a0\n In June, 1898, Philip A. Tracy died in the city of Washington, where he was domiciled. His will, executed in Washington on March 2, 1894, was duly probated in August, 1898. The will directed the executors to build a family monument, to cause to be inscribed thereon the names and the dates of the birth and death of the deceased, of his father and mother and of a brother and sister, in accordance with minute directions contained in a memorandum accompanying the will. A bequest of $1,000 was made to the Oak Hill Cemetery Company to perpetually care for the lot and the monument. In addition, after making several minor bequests, one of which was a gift of $ 100 to the Home for Incurables, $2,000 was given for a Sunday school building for the Trinity Episcopal Church in the city of Washington. The residue of the estate was bequeathed 'to the trustees of the Epiphany Church Home in this city, to pay for the enlargement of the building now used as the home, or for the erection of another building for the same use and purpose.' George W. Gray and J. J. Darlington, the executors named in the will, qualified.\n Within one year, and before receiving notice of the claim which is the subject of this suit, the executors of Tracy had paid the debts, had discharged the minor legacies above referred to, and had in hand, to be applied to the other provisions of the will, $47,000 in money and securities and two unimproved lots in the city of Washington, of small value. The further execution of the will was prevented by a demand to pay the claim which forms the basis of this suit, and upon refusal to do so, on June 10, 1899, this bill in equity was filed to establish and enforce the claim. The complainants were Erle H. Turner and Wilmer Turner and Ashby \n\n[202 U.S. 195, 197]\n\u00a0\n and Lunette Turner; the last two, being minors, were represented by Wilmer Turner as their next friend.\n It was in substance averred in the bill that Silas H. Turner, a paternal uncle of the complainants, died in Fauquier county, Virginia, on September 21, 1888, leaving a will by which he bequeathed equally to complainants, who were the children of Thomas M. Turner, all the property of which the testator died possessed, the will being as follows:\n Washington, D. C., April 30, 1888\n\n\n I hereby give and bequeath to the four children of my brother Thomas M. Turner of Minden, Louisiana, all property, real and personal, owned by me, or in which I have any interest at the time of my death, and appoint Philip A. Tracy to distribute the proceeds of the said property equally between them.\n S. H. Turner.\n Witness: Philip A. Tracy. George G. Fenton.\n It was also alleged that this will was admitted to probate in Fauquier county, Virginia, on or about November 28, 1888. It was then alleged that Philip A. Tracy was the confidential agent and trustee of Turner, deceased, and in that capacity had in his possession money which, as agent and trustee, Tracy had invested for the benefit of said Turner. It was charged that shortly before the death of Turner, Tracy had given Turner a memorandum or list, entirely in the handwriting of Tracy, stating the dates and amounts of the promissory notes held by Tracy, belonging to said Turner, and the names of the makers thereof, and that the said notes aggregated $28,972.10. This memorandum or list, alleged to be wholly in the handwriting of Tracy, was copied in the bill, and it was averred that after the death of Turner, Tracy had admitted the accuracy of said list and his possession of the notes which it embraced. It was then averred that the land records of the District of Columbia \n\n[202 U.S. 195, 198]\n\u00a0\n disclosed that all the notes mentioned in the alleged memorandum or list and the accrued interest had been paid after the death of Silas H. Turner. It was averred that, with the exception of a sum of about $1,400, alleged to have been paid by Tracy to Erle H. Turner, no account had been rendered or distribution made by Tracy of the aforesaid property or of the proceeds thereof, and that, excluding the payment alleged to have been made, as above stated, to Erle H. Turner, 'the entire trust fund, principal and interest and profits, had come into the possession of the defendants as executors of Tracy.'\n The paragraph of the bill immediately preceding the prayer was as follows:\n'21. That the domicil and citizenship of the parents of complainants have always been, since the birth of these complainants, either in the state of Louisiana, which was their domicil until about the-day of August, 1889, or in the state of Texas, which has been since and is now the domicil of said parents and of all complainants, except complainant Erle H. Turner, whose domicil is now Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Complainants are informed and believe and therefore aver that by the laws of Louisiana and of Texas the parents of minor children are not of right guardians of the estate of such minors, and no person is authorized to receive or demand the estate of any minor domiciled in either of said states, except such persons as shall be duly appointed by a court of the states having competent jurisdiction; and that neither the father nor the mother of any of these complainants nor any other person has ever been appointed by any court guardian of either the person or estate of any one of these complainants, and no one of these complainants has now or has ever had a legal guardian of the person or estate, and at no time has there been any person in being competent in law to demand or receive, in their behalf, any estate for any of these complainants, until, by reason of reaching their majority, two of these complainants have become sui juris.' \n\n[202 U.S. 195, 199]\n\u00a0\n Discovery was prayed of a paper which had been written and left by Tracy, containing representations regarding the claim of complainants. In substance the prayer was for a discovery and account in the premises, and for a decree distributing among the complainants the sum which might be found due upon the account. There was also a prayer for general relief.\n\n The answer of the executors of Tracy was in substance as follows: That Silas H. Turner and Tracy had business relations was admitted; but in the main all the material averments of the bill were alleged not to be within the knowledge of the executors, and proof of such averments was demanded. It was expressly averred, however, that Tracy, after the death of Silas H. Turner, had fully accounted for any property which he had in his possession, by a transfer and payment made to Thomas M. Turner, the father of the complainants, as their natural tutor and agent, they being then minors, as evidenced by a receipt signed by Thomas M. Turner, and dated November 30, 1888, which receipt was copied in the answer. Answering the paragraph of the bill calling for the discovery in respect to the paper left by Tracy regarding the claim of complainants, the defendants set forth that there came into their possession the following paper:\n Washington, D. C., ___ 1898. To the executors of my last will and testament:\n Some time in 1871, Silas H. Turner, of Virginia, whom I had known for a long time, of his own volition, and without solicitation from me, came to the city and asked me to aid him in investing some twelve thousand dollars ($12,000) in real estate notes. I consented, and in a few weeks the whole amount was invested, and he took the notes home with him. The interest was payable semiannually, and, for a time, he sent me notes by mail about the time the interest was due, so that it could be credited on the notes to satisfy the maker. This became irksome and, after a time, he brought me the notes, keeping a list of them, and asked me to keep them to \n\n[202 U.S. 195, 200]\n\u00a0\n save him the trouble of sending them to me by mail whenever the interest was due. I kept the notes in an envelope with his name upon it, and about twice a year sent him a memorandum of interest paid, and when the amount reached several hundred dollars I would buy another note, and send him a memorandum of the same. Also when a note was matured and paid, I would buy another note, unless he needed the money, which he rarely did, and send him a memorandum of it. This condition continued until 1888, when he died in Virginia, leaving his entire estate to the three minor children of his brother then living in Louisana. In his will he named me to settle up the estate and divide the money among the children; but, as the laws of Virginia require two witnesses to a will, and says neither of them shall be an executor, I could not qualify, and, as the father, if appointed, could not have given the bond, I handed him the package of notes, advised him to deposit them in the Second National Bank of Washington, District of Columbia, which he did, and agreed to look after them and have them all paid, he being out of the city. His other relations, a sister-some nephews and nieces, were much displeased with the will, and threatened to attempt to have it set aside, but have not done so. The father, a good, honest man, took the money or most of it, went to Texas and bought a farm, and was doing well until the panic of 1893 came on. Since then they had a hard time, getting little or nothing for their farm products, and have written me some heartrending letters, wishing they had left the money here. The children are of age, but of course the father could not pay them their parts of the estate, and though not a word has been said about it, I thought perhaps after my death, if they hear of it in time, some of them might attempt to hold me responsible, and if they should make such an attempt, I hereby authorize and direct my executors to employ the best counsel in the city to defend my estate in the district courts and in the Supreme Court of the United States, if it be necessary to appeal the case to that court, and to pay all costs and lawyers' fees out of my estate. \n\n[202 U.S. 195, 201]\n\u00a0\n I suppose someone would have to qualify as administrators under the will before any action could be taken. My turning the property over to the father helped to keep it in possession of those to whom it was left, and to discourage and shut out the dissatisfied relatives, for if anyone had qualified, the matter would have been open for a year, and they would undoubtedly have made an attempt to have the will set aside. This is a plain statement of the case, intended for the private ears of my executors.\n Referring to the prayer for discovery in other respects, it was averred that the only papers concerning business dealings between Tracy and Silas H. Turner which had come into the possession of the executors were the receipt given by Thomas M. Turner, as already stated, the memorandum of Tracy addressed to his executors, and various letters and receipts signed by Erle H. Turner. The executors specially alleged that, to their knowledge, none of the proceeds of any of the notes referred to in the alleged memorandum or list averred in the complaint had ever come into the hands of the executors, and that they had no knowledge of any disposition made of any property belonging to Silas H. Turner which might have been in the hands of Tracy, except as shown by the receipt of November 30, 1888, signed by Thomas M. Turner as natural tutor and agent of his minor children. The laches of the complainants was expressly set up as depriving them of the right to any of the relief asked for. Denying knowledge of where Thomas M. Turner was domiciled at the time of the signing of the receipt, or the lawful powers of Turner as to signing the receipt, the court was asked to determine the rights of the executors in the premises.\n After joinder of issue and the taking of general evidence the case was heard in the supreme court of the District.\n In substance, the court in its opinion declared that Tracy and Thomas M. Turner, the father of the complainants, had conspired to despoil them, they being then minors, of their rightful share of their uncle's estate; that the receipt given by \n\n[202 U.S. 195, 202]\n\u00a0\n Turner to Tracy did not protect Tracy or his estate, because Turner had not qualified in accordance with the laws of Louisiana so as to entitle him to represent his minor children, but even if he had so qualified, Tracy had no authority to pay from the fund in his hand except in the due course of administration. The court also observed that the words of the will appointing Tracy to distribute the proceeds of the property bequeathed equally between the four children of Thomas M. Turner imposed the duty upon Tracy of qualifying as executor, or, if he was unable or unwilling to do so, of applying to the court for the appointment of a suitable person. And the fraud and wrong of Tracy in turning over the property to the father was emphasized by the statement that Tracy wrote the will of the deceased and was then informed by the latter that his object was to prevent his estate from coming into the hands of the father of the children because of his spendthrift character. Although the court concluded that the estate of Tracy was liable, it did not fix the amount for which the estate was accountable, but referred the matter to an auditor to state an account and to take further evidence in respect to the expenditures properly chargeable against the share of each of the complainants upon the principles expressed in the opinion.\n The auditor heard additional testimony bearing upon the expenditures made by Thomas M. Turner for the maintenance of his children out of the fund which he had received from Tracy. An account as of February 1, 1894, was stated to the court. On this account the receipt given by Thomas M. Turner was disregarded. The sum in the hands of Tracy and due to the estate of Silas H. Turner was fixed by the alleged list set out in the bill. The ground upon which this was done was thus stated by the auditor in his report:\n'After the death of Silas Turner there was found among his papers an envelope or jacket indorsed 'Notes belonging to S. H. Turner, 1888;' it contained a list, in the handwriting of Tracy, of the notes, giving the date, name of maker, and amount. The date of the last note on the list is given as \n\n[202 U.S. 195, 203]\n\u00a0\n March 12, 1888. The aggregate principal of these notes is $28,972.10.\n\n'Evidently all of these securities were in Tracy's possession as late as March 12, 1888.\n\n ... * *\n'It being conclusively shown that within six months before Turner's death Tracy had nearly $29,000.00 principal of securities in his possession as agent or trustee of Turner, the inevitable presumption of law is that of continued possession and accountability.'\n\n Making certain deductions and additions, which it is unnecessary presently to refer to, the auditor found the amount due from Tracy's estate on February 1, 1904, principal and interest, to be $48,601.44, which was attributed in varying proportions to the complainants, depending upon the amount which the report found each one of them was bound to contribute for maintenance or sums received out of the fund. The report was excepted to, exceptions were overruled, and a decree was entered adjudging the sums found due to the complainants in accordance with the report, giving the right to collect the deficiency out of further assets, if any were discovered. An appeal was prosecuted. The court of appeals affirmed the decree (24 App. D. C. 573) with a slight modification, rendered necessary by the allowance of an increased charge against Erle H. Turner. The court of appeals, in its opinion, in effect expressed views similar to those which had been stated in the opinion of the court below and in the report of the auditor. The receipt of Thomas M. Turner was distrgarded. Taking into consideration the testimony, the paper alleged in the bill as a list was treated as being all in the handwriting of Tracy, and as being but a single document, and, therefore, as fixing the amount for which the estate of Tracy was accountable.\n Messrs. Clarence R. Wilson and Nathaniel Wilson for appellants.\n\n\n[202 U.S. 195, 205]\n\u00a0\n Mr. William G. Johnson for appellees.\n\n\n\n[202 U.S. 195, 206]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice White, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n As no reference was made to the subject in the opinions below, and as we construe the argument at bar as not seriously pressing such question, we assume, for the purposes of the case, the right of the complainants to maintain, under the averments of their bill, a direct action or suit to recover the fund in con- \n\n[202 U.S. 195, 207]\n\u00a0\n troversy. To come to the substantial merits we summarily dispose of certain preliminary contentions. First. We are of opinion that, upon the pleadings and proof, the court of appeals did not err in holding that such fiduciary relation existed between Silas H. Turner and Philip A. Tracy as made a court of equity the proper forum to seek relief. Second. We also think that, under the circumstances of the case, the contention that the bill should be dismissed because of the variance between the allegations and the proof is untenable.\n In proper sequence the questions for decision are threefold: First. Was the transfer of the property of the estate of Silas H. Turner, made as shown on the receipt given to Tracy by Thomas M. Turner, as the representative of his minor children, lawful and binding upon such minors? Second. If the payment referred to was binding, did the receipt and the paper contemporaneously executed by Tracy, in connection with the proof, establish that he or his estate was liable for the value of the investment in real estate shown by the receipt and the paper in question to have been retained in the control of Tracy? Third. Did the receipt, if binding, and the paper in connection with it, embrace all the property held by Tracy as the trustee of Silas H. Turner? or, in other words, did Tracy, at the time the receipt was given, honestly account for the property in his hands, or did he fraudulently retain for his own benefit a large amount of property of the estate which should have been paid over, and for which Tracy or his estate is therefore liable?\n Whilst in logical order the questions for decision are as stated, we shall consider them inversely. In other words, we shall first dispose of the alleged fraudulent retention by Tracy of a large portion of the trust fund at the time he made the payment and transfer of property to Thomas M. Turner as the representative of his minor children. We do this because the charge of conspiracy and fraud as pressed, not only in the argument at bar, but in the opinions below, was treated as affecting the question of the binding nature of the transfer made by Tracy to Turner; and by first disposing of that branch of the case, \n\n[202 U.S. 195, 208]\n\u00a0\n we shall, in a great measure, disentangle the question of the binding efficacy of the transfer and payment to Thomas M. Turner from the alleged fraud.\n It will be useful, before particularly considering the facts upon which the alleged fraud on the part of Tracy immediately depends, to state the antecedents of Tracy and of the two Turners, the dealings between them, and the results which followed therefrom, so far as they are uncontroverted.\n Philip A. Tracy was born in Fauquier county, Virginia, in 1835. He was living in Washington soon after the close of the Civil War, was a bookkeeper in a mercantile house, and later became an employee of the Postoffice Department, and so continued, if not to, at least up to a short time prior to, his death. He never married. As far as it may be inferred from the testimony in the record, taking no present concern of the charges of fraud made in the bill, the conviction is irresistibly conveyed to our minds that Tracy was a reasonably intelligent, moral, industrious, and circumspect person, of a religious tendency of mind, careful in money matters, particular as to details, and of a kindly, though somewhat eccentric, nature.\n Silas H. Turner was also a native of Virginia, and whilst little is shown by the record of his antecedents and character, it is established that he was also a man of thrift and of some business capacity, having been at one time a railroad agent, a dealer in merchandise and cattle, a clerk and an accountant, accustomed to the settlement of estates. Between Tracy and Turner there existed an association and friendship, taking its origin, if not in a boyhood acquaintance, at least one that related back to many years before the death of Turner. As a result of this friendship, Turner, trusting in the capacity and integrity of Tracy, began, in 1871, to confide his savings to the latter for investment. Tracy, loaning money upon the security of real estate, was first in the habit, when a loan was made, of sending the notes of the borrowers to Turner, who, as the interest payments were about to fall due, would send the notes to Tracy, to have payments of interest credited thereon. After \n\n[202 U.S. 195, 209]\n\u00a0\n a time this practice of sending and returning the notes became irksome, and Turner sent the notes to Tracy, who thereafter kept them in his custody. As money came into the hands of Tracy, either from the payments of principal or of interest upon the notes, he reinvested the money in other notes, sending Turner a memorandum of the new investments as made. There is nothing produced either from the papers of Tracy or of Turner showing that formal accounts were ever exchanged between the parties. Certain it is, that on April 30, 1888, Turner was in Washington and in personal communication with Tracy. At the desk of Tracy in the Postoffice Department, at the request of Turner, the will probated as mentioned in the statement of facts was written by Tracy for Turner, and by the latter executed. How long Turner remained in Washington at this time the record does not disclose, nor does it accurately show his movements or exhibit any letters passing between Tracy and Turner from the time of the making of the will up to the death of Turner.\n Some time during the summer of 1888, Turner-an ill man, suffering with Bright's disease-went to the residence of Mrs. Rust, a niece, living in Fauquier county, Virginia near Warrenton, where he remained until his death on September 21, 1888. At his death Turner left surviving him a maiden sister, who lived in Frederick, Maryland,-Miss Henrietta Turner,-a brother, Thomas M. Turner, living in Minden, Louisiana, and various nephews and nieces, children of deceased brothers and sisters.\n Between Thomas M. Turner, the brother living in Louisiana, and Silas H. Turner, it would seem, there had been little or no intercourse for more than thirty years, Thomas having left Virginia when quite a young man. Notified of the serious illness of his brother, Thomas M. Turner, about a month and a half before the death of Silas, came to the house of Mrs. Rust, and there remained until the death. Thomas M. Turner had had at that time quite a varied experience of men and affairs. Leaving Virginia as a youth, he went to Memphis, Tennessee, \n\n[202 U.S. 195, 210]\n\u00a0\n for the purpose of establishing a school. Not succeeding there, he went to Missouri, and became a bookkeeper for a commercial firm. At the outbreak of the war, he joined the Confederate army. At its termination, he established himself at Minden, Louisiana, and began merchandising, and also operated a steamboat landing. He married, bought a farm near the town of Minden, where he lived, and was for a year bookkeeper for a large business house; afterwards became a division superintendent of education; was subsequently a clerk of the state district court,-a court of unlimited general jurisdiction; was the parish treasurer and treasurer of the school board; for a time served as a justice of the peace, worked for lawyers in making up legal accounts, prepared the collectors' tax duplicates, etc.; afterwards became deputy clerk, and held the latter office at the time he was called to Virginia on account of the illness of his brother. At the time he came to Virginia he left at Minden his wife and five children, all minors and the issue of the marriage, the youngest being an infant, who lived but a comparatively short time. The name and date of birth of the other children were as follows: Erle H., born on October 21, 1868; Wilmer, born on October 11, 1875; Ashby, born on February 3, 1880, and Lunette, born on December 19, 1882.\n Omitting reference to the controverted question as to what passed between Silas and Thomas preceding the death of the former, certain it is that after the death of Silas there was found in a trunk belonging to him some few personal effects, the will which was afterwards probated, and an envelope containing papers,-the so-called list set out in the bill and referred to in the report of the auditor and in the opinion of the court of appeals.\n On September 28, 1888, Thomas M. Turner came to Washington, and, in company with Eppa Hunton, Jr., Esq., a member of the Virginia bar, had an interview with Tracy. Whatever took place at this interview forms, we think, one of the principal controversies of the case, and we shall have occasion \n\n[202 U.S. 195, 211]\n\u00a0\n hereafter to fully advert to it. Certain it is upon that day Turner received from Tracy in cash a little over $400, and Turner returned to Virginia. From that time (September 28, 1888) up to November 26, 1888, except a letter written by Tracy to Turner on October 10, 1888, there is nothing in the record showing any relations between Tracy and Turner concerning the property in the hands of Tracy. On the date last named ( November 26, 1888) Mr. Hunton offered the will of Silas H. Turner for probate in the county court of Fauquier county; a commission was issued to take the testimony of Tracy and the other attesting witness to the will, and the commission was executed on November 28, in the city of Washington, immediately taken to Warrenton, and on the same day the will was admitted to probate.\n The next day after the probate of the will, Turner appeared in Washington and called upon Tracy. Tracy handed to Turner a list of the notes, cash, and other property in his possession, which he proposed to turn over as belonging to the estate of Silas H. Turner. Turner took the list and examined it over night, returned the next morning, received the notes and the additional cash mentioned in the receipt, and, as to a piece of real estate specified in the list, received the following certificate from Tracy:\n I hereby certify that I have invested three thousand six hundred dollars ($3,600.00) in ground on Maryland avenue between 9th and 10th streets N. E., at 35 cents per square foot, and that Silas H. Turner is entitled to one half of the proceeds derived from the sale of the same, after deducting the cost of grading, subdividing, and examining titles, etc.\n Philip A. Tracy.\n The entire question of fraud on the part of Tracy depends upon the statements of Turner as to what took place between himself and Tracy when he gave the foregoing receipt, and as to the conduct of the latter concerning the so-called list which \n\n[202 U.S. 195, 212]\n\u00a0\n has been previously referred to. This we shall consider when we come to the controverted questions.\n At the suggestion of Tracy, the notes, covered by Turner's full receipt, were placed in a bank at Washington for collection, Tracy introducing Turner to the bank, and assisting him in opening the account. Turner went to Virginia, with some of the cash received paid the funeral expenses and the debts of his brother, took his sister and a niece with him to Louisiana, and from Louisiana he went to Texas with his family and also with the sister and niece just referred to. In Texas, Turner bought a lot in a town called Vernon, boarded his family until he built and furnished a house, bought and partially paid for a ranch consisting of 640 acres, and equipped it with stock and machinery. In the summer of 1890 he brought his entire family to Virginia, leaving his son Erle H., who had then become of age, on the farm in Texas as manager. He bought, in his own name, a house and lot in Front Royal, Virginia, the possession of which he turned over to his niece, Mrs. Rust, telling her that it was hers, and that it was done in accordance with directions given before his death by his brother Silas. Whilst in Virginia, he visited Washington and saw Tracy. In the fall of 1890 Turner went to Texas, leaving his family in Virginia. He remained in Texas but a short time, coming back to Virginia either in the late fall of 1890 or early winter of 1891. In February, 1891, he drew on the proceeds of the notes which had been deposited a check for the sum of $4,800 and carried the money away on his person, stating in his testimony that one reason why he did so was that he did not want the heirs in Virginia to know where the property was; that he was trying to keep it concealed as much as he could; that he was managing his own affairs, and did not want anybody to know anything about it, and that he was trying to get the money away from Washington entirely. In April, 1891, Erle H. Turner, the son, left the farm in Texas and came to Virginia. He visited Washington with the father, who introduced him to Tracy. The \n\n[202 U.S. 195, 213]\n\u00a0\n father paid the son out of the proceeds of the notes in bank $1,200, and delivered to him two of the notes previously turned over by Tracy, which had not been collected, of the face value of $525. The father testified that this payment to the son was made on account of some small indebtedness which he owed the son for money received for safekeeping from him whilst a boy, and in discharge of a debt which the father declared he owed the son for managing the farm, which it had been agreed was to be compensated for by a half interest in the proceeds of two crops. One of the crops had been harvested and the other was still on the land and ungathered when the settlement was made.\n From the date of the delivery by Tracy to Turner of the notes to the time of the payment made to Erle H. Turner, as just stated, all the notes delivered by Tracy to Turner, and deposited to the credit of the latter, had been paid, principal and interest, except the two which were turned over to Erle H. Turner on the alleged settlement with the father. During this time the record shows letters written by Tracy to Turner of a friendly character, advising Turner concerning the progress of the collections, and suggesting business methods for overcoming difficulties which arose, without the slightest intimation in any of the letters that there was in Tracy's mind even an impression of a difference between himself and Turner, or that Tracy supposed that there was any claim against him resulting from the transfer which had been made to Turner on November 30, 1888, except as indicated on the receipt then signed by Turner, and the accompanying certificate, relative to the Maryland avenue lots.\n As the consequence of the settlement made with Erle H. Turner, practically all that remained of the money coming from the proceeds of the notes delivered by Tracy to Turner had been checked out by Turner, and it is true to say that the record leaves no question that, in effect, substantially all the family living and traveling expenses, the disbursements for the residence lot in Texas, the cost of the erection and the \n\n[202 U.S. 195, 214]\n\u00a0\n furnishing of the dwelling, the cost of the farm and of fencing, and for stock and machinery bought for use thereon, had been defrayed out of the fund transferred by Tracy, as also the cost of the Virginia residence bought for Mrs. Rust, and various gifts of money made by Turner to nieces and nephews.\n Not only during the period whilst the notes were being collected by the bank for the account of Turner, and he was drawing out the proceeds,- indeed, up to shortly before the bringing of this suit,-Turner swore that he intentionally concealed from his wife and children, and from everybody concerned, the fact that his brother's will had been made in favor of the children, or that he had received under that will any property belonging to them. His testimony on this subject is so vital to the cause that we quote it.\n On his direct examination, he was interrogated, and answered as follows:\n Q. You stated the other day that while you were East in the fall of 1888, at the time of your brother's death, you wrote home to your wife during that absence? A. Yes, sir.\n Q. I want to know whether or not you told your wife in any of your letters of the fact that your brother had left an estate? A. I think I did. I am not positive.\n Q. I want you to state whether or not you told her that he had, by his will, left the property to your children? A. I did not tell her that.\n Q. Was that omission intentional or accidental? A. It was intentional, sir.\n Q. After your return to Louisiana, after your brother's death, when did you and your family leave there? A. We left there in the summer of 1889.\n Q. Up to that time had you told anybody of the character and contents of your brother's will? A. No one, sir, except Mr. Hunton.\n On cross examination, the witness testified as follows:\n Q. Did you, within a few days after signing that, write to your wife and tell her that your brother had left his property \n\n[202 U.S. 195, 215]\n\u00a0\n to you? A. I don't think I did, sir. I can't say that I did. I have no memory of writing such a thing. I may have written to her that my brother had left property to us. I don't know what I wrote. It has been a long time, and I can't tell you.\n Q. Did you write to her in such a way as to conceal from her the truth, and intend to do so? A. I didn't intend that my children should know the property was left to them.\n Q. Why? A. Well, sir, it was my opinion that it would not be well for them to know it.\n ... * *\n Q. When did your wife first know the terms of the will of your brother? A. I don't know, sir.\n Q. When did you first communicate to her the fact that you had obtained the property or the estate of your brother? A. I never communicated it to her, sir.\n Q. And she never knew it? A. I don't know whether she knew it or not, but I never told her.\n Q. Do you know that she did know at any time? A. I can't tell you, sir. I don't know that she did.\n Q. Did you intentionally conceal the fact from your wife that you had received the estate of your brother? A. I guess I did sir, intentionally.\n Q. And never up to the present time have you ever told her that you did receive your brother's estate? A. Oh, I don't remember whether I had or not. I couldn't say positively, sir.\n Q. Have you any knowledge yourself as to the time, or any time before the bringing of this suit, when she knew that you had and had received your brother's estate? A. No, sir.\n Q. You cannot say? A. I can't say.\n Erle H. Turner, the son, after his introduction to Tracy, evidently inquired from Tracy concerning the estate of Silas Turner, and he expressly declares that Tracy then informed him that the property had been left to the children, and also told him of the investment in his hands arising from the Maryland avenue lots. It is plainly to be inferred that Erle \n\n[202 U.S. 195, 216]\n\u00a0\n Turner communicated this fact to his mother, and, whilst there is no direct proof as to her consequent interference, it is inferable that both the mother and the son questioned the right of Tracy to make further payments to Thomas M. Turner. Undoubtedly, shortly thereafter, Thomas M. Turner called upon Tracy to pay over the proceeds arising from the Maryland avenue lots investment, which Tracy refused to do because of legal advice which he had received, unless Turner would qualify as an administrator, which he declined to do. It is also inferable that Erle H. Turner at that time made some demand upon the father concerning the estate, since the latter gave to him an order on Tracy for about $2,500, delivering to the son the certificate as to the investment in real estate, which had been made by Tracy and given to Turner at the time of the transfer on November 30, 1888. Erle H. Turner did not return to Texas, but remained East, occasionally visiting Washington and calling upon Tracy, receiving money from him and corresponding with him from time to time in the most friendly way.\n Thomas M. Turner, having exhausted the proceeds of the notes which he had received from Tracy, never again came in personal contact with the latter. He went to Texas, leaving his family in Virginia. In January, 1893, under a power of attorney, he sold the farm near Minden, which he had transferred in 1870 to his wife. The expressed consideration for the sale on behalf of the wife was $1,000. In January, 1894, Turner went to Virginia and took his family back to Texas. In September, 1894, Turner and his wife executed and put of record a deed conveying to Wilmer, Ashby, and Lunette Turner the Texas farm, and reciting as the consideration thereof 'the sum of $6,400 to me in hand paid by Philip A. Tracy, executor of the last will and testament of my deceased brother, Silas H. Turner, in trust for the use and benefit of my children, viz., Wilmer Turner, Ashby Turner, and Lunette Turner, minors, which said trust fund, together with other similar trust funds, was turned over to me without bonds, and \n\n[202 U.S. 195, 217]\n\u00a0\n have been used by me for my own use and benefit, said consideration being in payment of so much of said trust fund.'\n It appears that the land embraced in the farm had originally been acquired by the grantor of Thomas M. Turner as school land from the state of Texas. Turner failing to pay the $60 interest due on deferred payments, the land became forfeited to the state. Subsequently Turner repurchased it from the state at a reduced value, viz., $1 per acre. In August, 1895, having previously mortgaged the dwelling house property in Vernon, Turner and his wife conveyed said property to the mortgage creditor in cancelation of the then-existing indebtedness. At about this time Mrs. Turner wrote Tracy, asking for money. Her letter is not in the record, but the reply of Tracy (copied in the margin 1) clearly shows that the letter was a request from Mrs. Turner to him to pay the proceeds of the Maryland avenue lots referred to in the receipt and embraced by the certificate already referred to. A \n\n[202 U.S. 195, 218]\n\u00a0\n letter written by Tracy to Mrs. Turner five months afterwards manifests his kindly interest in the welfare of the family, and renders greater the certitude that no thought was in Tracy's mind that the parties deemed that he had perpetrated a fraud upon them, or that they had any claim upon him otherwise than in respect of the Maryland avenue lots investment. And this is entirely corroborated by the intimate and friendly letters written by Erle Turner to Tracy up to a short period before his death, which show clearly that Erle Turner considered that Tracy was accountable only for the lots referred to, and that he, Erle Turner, had received more than his share of the same. One of such letters-omitting purely irrelevant matter- is copied in the margin. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n Evidently, in consequence of the legal advice given him at the time objection was made by Erle Turner and his mother to the payment of the proceeds of the Maryland avenue lots to the husband and father, Tracy, as his health became impaired, grew to have an anxiety concerning the technical legality of the transfer of property which he had made to Thomas M. Turner, as shown by the receipt of November 30, 1888; and as a consequence he had prepared the statement on that subject produced by his executors. From 1895 until the death of Tracy in June, 1898, the record does not contain even the slightest proof tending to show any demand made upon Tracy or a suggestion of liability concerning the fraud and wrong charged in bill in this case. That bill, as we have seen, was only filed in 1899, after the death of Tracy.\n In March, 1901, Thomas M. Turner, as shown by his testi- \n\n[202 U.S. 195, 219]\n\u00a0\n mony, sold the Texas farm. The following is a statement made by Turner of the amount claimed to have been realized and the disposition made by him of such proceeds:\n'I sold the place, and the consideration was $5,000. There was a deed of trust for $400 on the property, which the purchaser assumed. I owed the purchaser $205. That from the $5,000 left $4,395. I paid $200 in debts from that, which left $4,195. I owed my wife her home in Louisiana that I sold in 1893, I believe $1,000, and eight years' interest at 10 per cent, which is the legal rate in Texas. That made $1,800. I used of my wife's individual money, about the year 1870, $200. Interest on that to the present time would make altogether $680. That would be $2,480 that I paid my wife, that was due her. That left $1,715. I owe about $100 in small debts there that I will have to pay out of that, which would leave $1,615 now that is community property between myself and my wife. According to the laws of Texas she would be entitled to half of it and I half. I have that much in money.'\n\n Explaining why he appropriated for his own and his wife's benefit the proceeds of the sale, to pay his alleged debt, despite the conveyance of the farm previously made by himself and wife to the minor children, Turner declared that while it was the same farm, yet that it had become forfeited to the state, and he had reacquired it, and regarded it as community property belonging to himself and his wife, although the money which had been originally used in buying and improving the farm had come from the proceeds of the estate of his brother, and belonged to the children.\n With these facts in mind we come more directly to consider the fraud alleged to have been committed by Tracy at the time he made the transfer of property and took the receipt of Thomas M. Turner. The principal ground upon which the auditor and both courts below rested their conclusion that Tracy had been guilty of such fraud was a discrepancy which it was assumed existed between a so-called list in Tracy's handwriting of notes in his hands, which list had been found \n\n[202 U.S. 195, 220]\n\u00a0\n among the effects of Silas H. Turner at his death, and the correctness of which it was concluded was acknowledged by Tracy to Thomas M. Turner after the death of Silas H. Turner. In approaching the question of fraud we bear in mind the rule that where both courts below have found a particular state of facts, we do not disregard them except upon the conviction that the lower courts clearly erred in their conception of the weight of the evidence. Now, coming to consider the evidence in the light of this rule, we are constrained to the conclusion that the premise upon which the courts below acted, that is, the existence of a list of notes left by Tracy, is without any support in the exidence, and, indeed, rests but upon a mere mistaken assumption.\n True it is that an envelope was found among the papers of Silas H. Turner with an indorsement upon it in the handwriting of Tracy, reading as follows: 'Notes belonging to S. H. Turner, 1888.' True also is it that two sheets of paper were produced with memoranda of notes upon each in the handwriting of Tracy. But to assume that these two sheets were one list made by Tracy and possessed as one list by Turner at the time of his death is to disregard the uncontroverted fact that the two separate sheets did not in and of themselves, as they existed at the death of Silas H. Turner, necessarily import that they constituted a single document. To treat them as such a document would oblige us to disregard the uncontradicted testimony of Thomas M. Turner, that he brought the two papers together so as to cause them to appear to be one after the death of Tracy, that he placed on the first sheet the pencil footing and the line above the same and on the second the carrying forward of the same footing, as also the new footing and the line above the same, by which alone on the face of the sheets apparent unity was produced between them. We copy in the margin3 the two sheets, with the \n\n[202 U.S. 195, 221]\n\u00a0\n additions which, as above stated, were made after the death of Silas H. Turner.\n So far as the face of these separate sheets, as they stood at the death of silas H. Turner, indicate, they do not at all exclude the implication that the items on the second sheet were but the statement of reinvestments made by Tracy of money coming into his hands as the result of the payment to him of notes which were enumerated on the first sheet. Nor, on the face of the papers, does the fact that an envelope was produced with the words in the handwriting of Tracy written thereon, 'Notes belonging to S. H. Turner, 1888, necessarily give rise to a contrary deduction. For non constat but that this envelope was marked by Tracy on delivering to Silas H. Turner the second sheet, or, that when it was marked, it contained\n\n\n[202 U.S. 195, 222]\n\u00a0\n the first sheet, exhibiting the property in the hands of Tracy at the beginning of the year 1888. When the course of business between the parties as stated by Tracy in the memorandum addressed to his executors is recalled, the greater probability is not only that the two sheets were not received by Silas H. Turner at one time, but that the second sheet was a mere memorandum of investments of items stated on the first sheet. The mode of dealing, as stated by Tracy, was this: He kept the notes belonging to Turner in an envelope. Periodically he would send a general statement to Turner, and when sufficient money was in his (Tracy's) hands, arising from accumulations of interest or payment of a note, he would reinvest, and send or give Turner a memorandum of the new investment. Now, the condition of the first sheet justifies the presumption that it related to a general statement of the investments in the hands of Tracy at the end of the year 1887. The notes on this sheet, although grouped in disregard of chronological order, include notes dated from 1875 to and including 1887. On the other hand, the second sheet is but an enumeration of three notes executed in 1888, the last dated on March 12. This second sheet in no way corresponded, therefore, to a general statement between the parties, but is exactly responsive to the conception of a memorandum of reinvestments made in accordance with the custom described by Tracy. And, by comparison of some of the items on the separate sheets, cogency is added to the reasonable presumption that the second and separate sheet was but a statement of reinvestments made after January 1, 1888. Thus, on the first sheet is the following item: 'Dec. 30, '85. John L. Carusi, 1350.' Now if this note matured on December 30, 1887, and was paid shortly after its maturity, Tracy, early in January, 1888, would have had that amount for reinvestment. Looking at the second sheet we find upon it an item showing an investment of precisely the amount of the principal of the Carusi note, as follows: 'Jan. 27, 1888. A. H. Nixon (3) 1350.00.' \n\n[202 U.S. 195, 223]\n\u00a0\n As Turner and Tracy met in Washington on April 30, 1888, and in view of the reasonable probability that Turner must have been in possession of prior general statements of the investments made by Tracy, the inference is persuasive that the mamorandum embraced on the second sheet may have been delivered by Tracy to Turner at that time.\n It is insisted that as Thomas M. Turner testified that he exhibited the two sheets as one paper to Tracy, and that Tracy told him that he had all of the notes described on both of the sheets in his possession and that they were 'as good as gold,' therefore the sheets were proven to be one, and the liability of the estate of Tracy to account on that hypothesis was established. But, in view of the state of the uncontroverted proof which we have previously noticed concerning Turner and his acts of omission and commission, we are constrained to the conclusion that he has so discredited himself as to make it impossible for us to accept his uncorroborated statements as establishing the alleged fraud and dishonesty of Tracy; although, in reaching this conclusion, we do not exclude the possibility that Turner may have harbored a suspicion that Tracy had not fully accounted, and communicated his suspicions to others. And even putting out of view the acts of commission and omission of Turner and the consequent inability to rely upon his testimony as to the commission by Tracy of alleged fraud, the unexplained failure of the complainants to make certain proof, and the proof as made, clearly demonstrate that Tracy could not have been guilty of the fraud charged against him, and we, under separate headings, state our reasons for this conclusion.\n\n 1. \nThe interview between Tracy and Turner, at which the alleged admission by Tracy was made concerning the list and his possession of all the notes shown on the two sheets, was the one had a week after the death of Silas H. Turner, at which Thomas M. Turner testifies that Mr. Hunton, his counsel, was present and heard the alleged statement made by Tracy. Yet \n\n[202 U.S. 195, 224]\n\u00a0\n the testimony of Mr. Hunton was not taken. Besides, the bill contained an express averment that the land records of the District of Columbia established that the notes embraced on the first sheet which were omitted from the receipt signed by Turner had been paid after the death of Silas H. Turner, but no proof on that subject was offered. On the contrary, it was stipulated, on the taking of evidence, that five of the notes which were on the first sheet had been paid and the releases of trust executed after March 12, 1888, the date of the oldest executed note shown on the second sheet of the list, and before the death of Silas H. Turner, a fact which clearly rebuts the presumption that Tracy could have admitted to Turner on September 28, 1888, that he possessed notes which were good as gold, although they were not then in existence.\n\n 2. \nThe face of the receipt itself (which is copied in the margin)4 considered in the light of the uncontroverted facts \n\n[202 U.S. 195, 225]\n\u00a0\n which we have stated, and other circumstances to which we shall advert, we think equally rebut the statements of Turner as to the alleged admissions of Tracy. It will be observed that the aggregate of both sheets of the so- called list was $28,972.10. The notes embraced upon the receipt given by Turner aggregated $22,802.50,-a difference between the two footings of $6, 169.60. Now, admitting that the two items of cash payments figuring in the receipt, amounting to $776.89, may be treated as interest, besides the notes, the receipt of Turner specified an investment of $1,800 in the Maryland avenue lots, for which at the time Tracy delivered to Turner the certificate to which we have referred in stating the uncontroverted facts, and which Turner turned over his son Erle. Deducting this $1,800, which Tracy admitted he owed, left only a difference of $4,369.60. How, under this condition of things, it could be found that Tracy admitted he was appropriating for his own benefit more than $6,000 we cannot conceive, since on the face of the transaction, under the most favorable view of the testimony for the complainants, Tracy was paying over or acknowledging his liability for everything but about $4,000 of notes. And yet more incredible does the theory of a fraudulent retention of over $6,000 by Tracy become when it is considered that Tracy permitted Turner to retain what would have been conclusive evidence of has fraud if the theory of the previous admissions of Tracy as to one list and its correctness, propounded by the complainants and found by the courts below, were true. If Tracy was infamous \n\n[202 U.S. 195, 226]\n\u00a0\n enough to conceive the spoliation which is charged to have been committed by him, it would be certainly fair enough to presume that he would have exercised reasonable precautions to destroy the evidence of his wrongdoing.\n Moreover, a comparison of the receipt with the two sheets supports the conviction that the second sheet was but a statement of reinvestments, and therefore that it was impossible that Tracy should have admitted that he was in fact stealing from or denying his liability to the estate of his dead friend in respect to the sum which he was either actually paying over or admitting his responsibility for. Now, the receipt embraced all of the notes mentioned on the second sheet, aggregating $4,850. It embraced certain notes found on the first sheet, aggregating $11,600. The receipt also embraced notes not appearing on the first sheet,-in other words, replacing those omitted (and included the Maryland avenue lots),- indicating by their dates that they were acquired after the date of the last investment appearing on the second sheet of the list, viz., March 12, 1888, and after April 30, 1888, when Silas Turner was in the office of Tracy and made his will. These last items aggregated $8,152.50. The total of the various items footed up $24,602.50. Now, this sum was slightly in excess of the notes shown on the first of the two sheets of the so-called list, going to demonstrate that the settlement between the parties was based not upon any deduction of an impossible sum of $6,000, but upon the fact that the second sheet represented reinvestments of items appearing on the first sheet. And the cogency of this conclusion becomes manifest when it is considered that there is not an iota of evidence tending to show where Tracy could have gotten the money to invest in the notes which he turned over, acquired after March 12, 1888, unless it was from collections of the notes appearing on the first sheet of the so-called list, which, in consequence of their payment, were represented in the receipt by the new investments.\n\n 3. \nThat, at the time the receipt was given, there was some \n\n[202 U.S. 195, 227]\n\u00a0\n conversation on the subject of a probable charge by Tracy for his services rendered to Silas H. Turner, we think persuasively appears. In May, 1892, after the refusal of Turner to qualify as administrator of the estate, and the refusal of Tracy to turn over the proceeds of the Maryland avenue lots to Turner unless he did qualify, Tracy wrote Turner a letter, which is copied in the margin. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n It is true that Turner, in producing the letter, whilst acknowledging its receipt, declared that it was the first he had ever heard of any such charge or intention to charge; but Turner in no way intimates that he took issue with Tracy, by letter or otherwise, concerning the right of Tracy to make the charge,-a line of conduct wholly inexplicable if the theory of a fraudulent retention by Tracy of $6,000 had foundation in fact. Having regard to the context of Tracy's letter, we consider it as implying an intention to deduct, for the benefit of the sister of Silas H. Turner, the sum of the charge which Tracy had made or then proposed to make, from the proceeds of the investment remaining in his hands. And, we \n\n[202 U.S. 195, 228]\n\u00a0\n may remark, in passing, that there is proof tending to show that Tracy subsequently made remittances to the sister in question.\n\n 4. \nAs we have said in stating the uncontroverted facts, Turner came from Louisiana to the house of Mrs. Rust, where his brother Silas was lying dangerously ill, about a month and a half before the death of Silas. The proof leaves no doubt that whilst there he frequently met his niece, Mrs. Rust, and other Virginia relatives, and had ample occasion to be aware of their frame of mind. There is no proof whatever showing that Tracy, whose home was in Washington, had any connection whatever with the Virginia relatives of Silas Turner, or was in a position to form an opinion concerning the probable conduct of those relatives as to a contest of the will of Silas Turner. And yet Turner swears that one of the principal causes of his yielding to the fraud of Tracy was the danger which Tracy persuaded Turner would arise in consequence of the purpose of the Virginia relatives to contest the will. Further, although the first interview between Tracy and Turner after the death of Silas was on September 28, 1888, the settlement between Turner and Tracy was not had until more than two months thereafter, viz., November 30, 1888. Now the only explanation Turner gives for this delay is that Tracy told him at the interview on September 28, 1888, that he was about to absent himself on a two weeks' leave, and upon his return would inform Turner, and they would have a settlement,-a reason wholly inadequate to explain the long delay between that and the next meeting. That Tracy expected to make a settlement, and desired to keep in in touch with Turner, is shown by a letter written to Turner on October 10, 1888, from Old Point Comfort, advising Turner of his (Tracy's) whereabouts. Several of the Virginia relatives who were in contact with Turner during the considerable interval which elapsed between the first visit of Turner to Tracy and the final settlement testified to statements made in their presence by Turner, that he was awaiting the necessary papers from Louisiana showing his authority to represent his children, and that just before Turner \n\n[202 U.S. 195, 229]\n\u00a0\n went to Washington to make the settlement with Tracy, Turner stated to them that he had the required authority. This shows that the matter of Turner's right to represent his children was, in all probability, the cause of the long delay in making the settlement, and is corroborated by a passage contained in a letter written by Turner to his daughter Wilmer, in 1899, in which communication, referring to the occurrences at the final settlement with Tracy, Turner said:\n'Tracy then informed me that, as my brother owed no debts, there was no use to have an administration; that he would not qualify as executor of the will, and that I need not delay to be appointed guardian for my children; that he would turn the notes over to me, and I could place them in bank, to be collected as they matured.'\n\n True it is that Turner testified that the words which he affixed to his name in signing the receipt, describing his representative capacity, viz., 'Natural tutor and agent for my minor children,' were dictated by Tracy, but, in view of the probable ignorance of Tracy of the Louisiana law, and the experience and familiarity which Turner possessed on that subject, the statement cannot be accepted as true.\n Considering all the evidence, our conclusion is that the proof not only completely fails to establish the commission of fraud or wrong by Tracy, but that, on the contrary, it clearly shows honesty and fair dealing on his part. Indeed, so far as concerns the transfer of property made to Thomas M. Turner without provoking an administration either in Virginia or in the District of Columbia, whatever may be its legal consequence, which we shall hereafter consider, we think the clear preponderance of the proof gives rise to the inference that that payment was made without administration because of Tracy's knowledge that there were no debts, and because of the representations made by Turner that he was entitled, under the law of Louisiana, to receive the transfer on behalf of his minor children, and that, if it were not made to him without legal proceedings, there would be much unnecessary expense resulting \n\n[202 U.S. 195, 230]\n\u00a0\n from a contest, and thus the purpose of the testator towards the beneficiaries of his will would be in part frustrated.\n This brings us to consider the proposition of law whether the payment by Tracy to Thomas M. Turner, as the representative of his children, was adequate to prevent the estate of Tracy from being compelled to pay a second time.\n It is undoubted that at the time of Silas H. Turner's death the children, who were the beneficiaries under his will, were minors, and were domiciled with their father and mother, who were both alive and residing in the state of Louisiana. It is at once conceded that, under the law of Louisiana, a father or mother entitled to qualify as natural tutor ( guardian) must be recognized by a court, and, as a condition precedent to such recognition, must have complied with the requirements of the law. Under the law of Louisiana such precedent requirements are the taking of the inventory, the recording of an abstract thereof, and an oath of office. As it is established that Thomas M. Turner performed none of these requirements and was never recognized by a court as the natural tutor of his children, it is insisted that he was wholly without power to represent them or to receive the bequests made to them by the will of Silas H. Turner. But the proposition is inapposite and is based upon a misconception of the law of Louisiana, resulting from the assumption that, under that law, the rules governing the qualification and appointment of natural tutors after the death of one of the spouses applies to the case of a father, during marriage, representing and acting for and on behalf of his minor children.\n In the Civil Code of Louisiana of 1870, title 7, chapter 5, treating of father and child, it is provided as follows:\n'Art. 221. The father is, during the marriage, administrator of the estate of his minor children.\n\n'He is accountable both for the property and revenues of the estates, the use of which he is not entitled to by law, and for the property only of the estates, the usufruct of which the law gives him. \n\n[202 U.S. 195, 231]\n\u00a0\n 'This administration ceases at the time of the majority or emancipation of the children.'\n\n And in the same title and chapter it is further provided:\n'Art. 223. Fathers and mothers shall have, during marriage, the enjoyment of the estate of their children until their majority or emancipation.'\n\n Moreover, in the same chapter, it is also provided:\n'Art. 226. This usufruct shall not extend to any estate which the children may acquire by their own labor and industry, nor to such estate as is given or left them under the express condition that the father and mother shall not enjoy such usufruct.'\n\n These provisions of the Code of 1870 have obtained in that state from an early date. The first of them was in the Code of 1825, as article 267, under the title treating of minors and their tutorship, and under the same title the provision was contained in the Code of 1808, in  2 of chapter 8, article 5. And, as the inevitable result of these provisions of the Code, it has long been settlea in Louisiana that the plenary power of the father as administrator, during marriage, of the estate of his minor children, born of the marriage, was wholly distinct from tutorship, did not depend upon previous judicial recognition, and was not subjected to the precedent requirements essential to give rise to tutorship. In Cleveland v. Sprowl ( 1845) 12 Rob. (La.) 172, the court said (p. 173):\n'Now, it is well known, that no tutorship exists, during the marriage, over the children issued from it, but that a child remains under the authority of his father and mother until his majority or emancipation. Civil Code, art. 234. The father is, during the marriage, administrator of the estate of his minor children; he is accountable both for the property and revenues of the estates, the use of which he is not entitled to by law, and for the property only of the estates, the usufruct of which the law gives him; and such administration ceases at the time of the majority or emancipation of the \n\n[202 U.S. 195, 232]\n\u00a0\n children. Art. 267. The natural tutorship only takes place after the dissolution of the marriage, by the death of either of the spouses, and belongs of right to the surviving one, Art. 268. Thus it is clear that the legal mortgage resulting from the tutorship is not applicable to the administration of the minor's property, given by law to the father, during the marriage. He is not a tutor; his duties and responsibilities are very different; and the law does not appear to have intended that, while the minor's estate remains under his father's administration during the marriage, his child should have a legal mortgage upon his father's property, as a security for the said administration.'\n\n As a result, it was expressly decided that neither the legal mortgage resulting from tutorship nor the security generally required by law from usufructuaries were applicable to a father as administrator of the estates of his minor children during the marriage. Our attention has not been called to, nor have we been able to find, any decision of the supreme court of Louisiana modifying in the slightest degree the principles thus announced. On the contrary, in Gates v. Renfroe (1852) 7 La. Ann. 569, whilst the subject was not directly at issue, the court in its opinion assumed the law of Louisiana concerning the power of the father in administering the estates of his minor children, as previously stated, to be elementary.\n It is certain that the article relating to the power of the father to administer during marriage, which was originally enacted in the Code of 1808, was drawn from the Code Napoleon. We say this is certain, because not only did the article as enacted in the Codes of 1808 and 1825 exist in the Code Napoleon in absolutely identical words, but it was also in that code placed, as it was in the two earlier Louisiana codes, under the heading of minors and their tutorship. Code Napoleon, art. 389.\n The fact that the provision should more properly have been classed under the chapter of the Code treating of paternal \n\n[202 U.S. 195, 233]\n\u00a0\n authority has been recognized in France. In commenting upon this subject Demolombe says (vol. 6, No. 409):\n'It is evident that this article appropriately belongs to the title treating of paternal power, because, during the marriage, tutorship does not exist. It is alone in virtue of the paternal power that the father (or the mother, in the case of the father's incapacity) is charged with the administration of the goods belonging to his minor children.'\n\n The same commentator thus expounds the spirit of the article (ibid. No. 415):\n'During the marriage, the father and the mother are present and co- operating with each other, consulting with each other, supervising, as it were, each other with that instinctive tenderness which is the result of their relation to their offspring. This the law assumes to be an assured and certain security for the children, founded, at the same time, upon both paternal and conjugal affection, of which the children are the pledge, and of which they are the most potent links for the perpetuation of the union. . . . Let us add that the conflicts between interests of the children and those of the parent which often arise from the death of one of the parents do not usually exist whilst both the parents are alive. These are the family considerations upon which the article is founded, and tradition plainly confirms them. Thus, in our ancient jurisprudence the distinction between the legal administration of a father and tutorship was well established. The first rested upon an agency created by law alone, based upon the confidence which the law reposed in paternal affection, from which it resulted that the powers of administration given to the father were broader and more comprehensive than those which the law conferred upon a tutor. Comp. Merlin, Rep. VII., V0 L egitime administration; Coquille, sur l'art. 2, de la Coutume de Nivernais,-de Lauri ere sur Loisel, Inst. Court. livre 1, titre IV., r egle 1.'\n\n And when the genesis of the enactment which passed from the Napoleon Code into the codes of Louisiana is considered, the accuracy of the observations of the commentator just cited \n\n[202 U.S. 195, 234]\n\u00a0\n is made clear. In the draft of the Napoleon Code which was first submitted, the provision subsequently contained in article 389 of that code was not found. The enactment of the article into the Code was the result of a recommendation by the Tribunat, its report on the subject expressly saying ( Locr e, Legislat. Civ. t. VII., p. 215):\n'We think that the first article of the chapter should express in precise terms what, during the marriage, should be the authority of the father over the personal goods of his minor children. . . . Never up to this time has it been exacted that a father should be obliged to qualify as the tutor of his children before the dissolution of the marriage. If, while the marriage exists, the law did not make a distinction between the father and mother and a tutor, in the proper sense of the word, it would follow that the father would be, as to the personal goods of his minor children, subjected during marriage to all the conditions and burdens which the law imposes upon a tutor. The father would then be, as to his minor children, under the supervision of an under tutor, would depend upon the advice of a family meeting, etc., etc., all of which would be repugnant to the accepted conceptions of paternal authority. It seems fitting that up to the dissolution of marriage the only title which the father should have is that of administrator, and it is for this reason that we recommend the adoption of the article.'\n\n And the views which were thus expounded have been substantially applied by the decided cases in France, and are concurred in by the practically unanimous opinion of the theoretical writers. The result of those decisions and the opinions of the writers on the subject adequately portray the plenary power conferred upon the father as the administrator of all the property of his minor children during marriage, and the distinction between that authority and the narrower power as to the natural tutorship arising only after the dissolution of the marriage. The authorities will be found exhaustively collected in the notes to article 389 of the Napoleon Code in \n\n[202 U.S. 195, 235]\n\u00a0\n the Fuzier-Herman edition of that code, published at Paris in 1885.\n Much reliance in argument is placed upon the terms of article 3350 of the Louisiana Code of 1870, which reads as follows:\n'Art. 3350. Before fathers and mothers, who, by law, are entitled to the usufruct of property belonging to their minor children, shall be allowed to take possession of such property and enjoy the fruits and revenues thereof, they shall cause an inventory and appraisement to be made of such property, and cause the same to be recorded in the mortgage book of every parish in the state where they or either of them have immovable property.'\n\n This article was not contained in any of the previous codes. Its origin is this: Prior to the Louisiana Constitution of 1868 the moneyed obligations of natural tutors towards their minor children, of husbands to their wives, and some other pecuniary obligations expressly provided for by law, were secured by what was known to the Louisiana law as legal and tacit mortgages. Those mortgages existed by operation of law, and without registry. No such provision, however, ever obtained, as we have seen, concerning a father administering upon the estate of his minor children during the marriage. The Louisiana Constitution of 1868 (art. 123) provided that all legal, tacit mortgages should cease after a specified date, and expressly imposed upon the legislature the duty of providing by law for a mode of registry in order to preserve existing and future mortgages of that character. By an act passed in 1869, entitled an act to carry out this article of the Constitution and 'to provide for recording all mortgages and privileges,' the legislature sought to comply with this constitutional direction. La. Acts 1869, p. 114. The act in question contained specific directions for recording mortgages of the character referred to, the mode of registry which was adopted as to these mortgages being the making of an abstract of an inventory showing the amount of the minor's property, and the putting of the same of record. Section 12, the last section \n\n[202 U.S. 195, 236]\n\u00a0\n of the act, contained the exact provision subsequently embodied when the Code of 1870 was adopted, in article 3350, except that  12 of the act of 1869, moreover, had these words, which are not found in the article of the Code referred to: 'Which recordation shall operate a mortgage on such property until a final settlement of the administration of said property.' In other words, when the Code of 1870 came to be adopted, the compilers omitted the words of  12 of the act of 1869 just quoted, but placed in the Code the remainder of the section providing for the registry of an abstract of the inventory in the case stated. It is difficult to determine exactly the reason which impelled the compilers of the Code of 1870 to omit the provision as to mortgages found in  12 of the act of 1869, conceding that that provision was constitutional despite the title of the act, and to re-enact the remainder of the section providing for the registering of an abstract of an inventory in the case named, since, by the omission of the provision as to mortgage, no possible security could arise from the recording of an abstract of an inventory in the case provided for. For, certain it is that neither under the codes as they existed prior to 1870, nor in that code, was or is there any provision for a legal mortgage securing the minors against loss resulting from the enjoyment by either parents, during marriage, of a usufruct. The intention of the compilers of the Code of 1870 not to change the powers of administration of the property of his minor children, conferred upon the father by the prior codes, is expressly shown by the re-enactment, without change, of those provisions, and is cogently exemplified by the further fact that, in re-enacting the provisions in question, they were removed from the chapters of the Code referring to tutorship, and were transferred to the chapters of the Code relating to paternal authority. As the full significance to be given to article 3350 is a question of local Louisiana law, which we are not called to decide, except so far as is essential to the determination of the case before us, we content ourselves with saying that we think it is clear that that \n\n[202 U.S. 195, 237]\n\u00a0\n article in no way modifies or controls the full power of the father to administer, during marriage, the estates of his minor children, so well settled under the Louisiana law. In any event, we think that article 3350 simply implies that unless an inventory is made and an abstract recorded, the usufruct which otherwise would exist shall not obtain. But giving this effect to the article in no way modifies the powers of the administration conferred upon the father during marriage, to which we have referred, because, as clearly pointed out by the authorities which we have previously cited, the administration is wholly independent of the usufruct, and applies to the minor's property during marriage, whether or not there be a right of usufruct.\n As, then, by the law of their domicil, the minors were represented by their father as administrator, with full power under that law to receipt for and administer the property for their account, was the transfer of property made by Tracy in the District of Columbia to Thomas M. Turner, as the administrator or representative of his minor children, valid and binding? It is said that it was not, because Turner, the testator, was domiciled in Virginia, and if the property had been administered upon in that jurisdiction, never mind what was the power of the father under the law of Louisiana, he would not have been entitled to receive or remove the property from the jurisdiction without an order made by a Virginia court, and upon the giving of satisfactory security. But the property in question was in the District of Columbia, and, in the absence of all showing that there were creditors in Virginia, the probate court of the District of Columbia would have had power, under the circumstances disclosed, if administration had been had in the District, to direct the delivery of the property to the person lawfully entitled to represent the minors, without compelling the transmission of the funds to Virginia. Under these circumstances, we are of opinion that the payment in the District of Columbia to the father of the complainants as administrator of their estate, fully empowered to collect and \n\n[202 U.S. 195, 238]\n\u00a0\n receive the same by the law of their domicil, is controlled by the cases of Wilkins v. Ellett, \n108 U.S. 256\n, 27 L. ed. 718, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 641, 9 Wall. 740, 19 L. ed. 586. It is, however, urged that although, as a general principle, the cases referred to are decisive of this, the terms of the will and the knowledge which Tracy had of the intentions of the testator made the delivery by Tracy to the father of the children a violation of the terms of the will, and operated a fraud upon the rights of the children, which, it is claimed, takes this case out of the general rule. The unsoundness of the first of these contentions, which rests upon the terms of the will, we think is demonstrated by its mere statement. The proposition is that the words of the will, 'and appoint Philip A. Tracy to distribute the proceeds of said property equally between them' (the minor children of Thomas M. Turner), implied a direction to Tracy to hold and administer the property for the benefit of the children, and not to pay it over to a lawfully appointed administrator or to one legally authorized to receive it. The second contention rests upon the assumption that, as a matter of fact, the proof establishes that Tracy had knowledge that the purpose of Silas H. Turner in making his will was to exclude the administration by Thomas M. Turner of the property bequeathed to his children, because Thomas M. Turner was a spendthrift and the testator lacked confidence in him. And this assumption of fact, as we have seen, was adopted by the trial court. Conceding, for the sake of argument only, that the existence of such knowledge on the part of Tracy would have caused it to be a fraud for him to turn over the property to the lawful administrator of the minors, we can find no reliable proof whatever in the record justifying the premise of fact upon which the contention is based. The sole and only possible basis for such an assumption is a statement made by Erle H. Turner in the course of his examination in chief, where, in purporting to give his recollection of a conversation had with Tracy, he said:\n'Tracy himself wrote the will; and he said that he had suggested to uncle to leave it to my father, and, if I remember, \n\n[202 U.S. 195, 239]\n\u00a0\n his answer was no, he would spend it, or something like that; and then he suggested that he leave it to his children, and that idea suited uncle, and he wrote the will.'\n\n We shall not stop to point out the conflict between this statement made by Erle Turner and the intimate and friendly relations as exhibited by his correspondence, continuing almost up to the time of the death of Tracy, or the conflict between the statements and the various parts of his testimony and his letters. We do not pause to do these things, because, in our opinion, the proof introduced by both parties beyond question establishes that Silas H. Turner entertained no such feeling towards his brother as the quoted testimony of Erle Turner implies. Thus, the complainants' own proof showed that Thomas M. Turner was summoned to the bedside of his dying brother and there remained for a month and a half; that during that time he was in constant and close relation with the brother, without the slightest intimation of any want of confidence between them. On the contrary, Thomas M. Turner made repeated statements and declarations in the course of his testimony, to the effect that his brother referred to the will, and informed him that he expected him to administer the property, etc., etc. That Tracy regarded Thomas M. Turner as honest is demonstrated by his whole course of conduct, and is illustrated by his allusions to Thomas M. Turner in the memorandum which he left for the information of his executors.\n The receipt being binding, the only question remaining for consideration is whether any liability rests upon the estate of Tracy growing out of the investment in real estate referred to therein. From an inspection of the receipt it will be seen that that subject was thus described: Lots on Maryland avenue N. E. $1,800; and, as we have also previously stated, at the time of the giving of the receipt, Tracy delivered to Thomas M. Turner a certificate, which we have heretofore reproduced, and which, as we have said, Turner subsequently turned over to his son Erle. \n\n[202 U.S. 195, 240]\n\u00a0\n The evidence shows that the investment in question was represented by shares of stock of the Mutual Investment Company, which had acquired square 937 in the city of Washington. On September 3, 1888, Tracy subscribed to twenty-five shares of the stock of the par value of $150 per share, making a total liability of $3,750. He had paid assessments aggregating only $85 per share, when, on February 6, 1890, the land was sold at a profit of $60 on each share of stock. It may, of course, be presumed that during the interval between the subscription to the stock and the winding up of the venture Tracy retained possession of the balance, upon which he was liable on the subscription over and above the sums actually paid on assessment calls, so as to be ready to respond to calls up to the par value of the stock. Twelve of the subscribed shares would represent an investment of $1,800, the exact amount stated in the receipt. The profit on the twelve shares amounted to $720. This profit, with the principal of the investment, aggregated, therefore, on February 6, 1890, $ 2,520. Tracy, however, received but a trifling amount in cash, the greater part of the sum due him on the settlement being paid in notes of the purchaser of square 937, secured by trust deed. When the notes were paid, as shown in a letter written by Tracy to T. M. Turner on May 7, 1892, heretofore reproduced in the margin, the investment had realized $2,600. On account of the refusal of Tracy, in the spring of 1891, to pay over this sum to Thomas M. Turner, then living in Texas, unless he qualified as administrator of the estate, Tracy invested the amount in real estate notes, which were in Tracy's possession on May 7, 1892. Thomas M. Turner testified that prior to the spring of 1891 Tracy told him that the estate had realized from the investment in the Maryland avenue lots the sum of $2, 750, although he does not claim to have taken issue with the statement in Tracy's letter that the amount was $2,600. The auditor, however, fixed the amount at $3,069.65, and held the estate of Tracy liable to account for that sum from February 6, 1890. \n\n[202 U.S. 195, 241]\n\u00a0\n It appears from statements in the record that, following the panic of 1893, payments of interest on this loan ceased and the security became impaired, and, from passages in letters of Tracy, it may be conjectured the loan was secured by a second mortgage, and a sale was had under the first mortgage, which failed to realize more than sufficient to pay the primary encumbrance. It being, however, impossible from the record to determine with precision the ultimate fate of the investment in question, and as the sum originally realized therefrom is fixed with sufficient accuracy and has not been accounted for, we think the estate of Tracy should be held liable as of February 6, 1890, for the sum of $2,520, with legal interest. From this amount, however, there is to be deducted the one- fourth proportion of Erle H. Turner, as the sums admitted to have been paid to him by Tracy on account of this asset exceeded his proportion of the principal and interest. In other words, therefore, the estate of Tracy will be held accountable to complainants other than Erle H. Turner in equal proportions for the sum of $1,890, with legal interest thereon from February 6, 1890.\n The decree of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded with directions to reverse the decree of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, and to remand the cause to that court, with directions to enter a decree in conformity with this opinion. The costs in this court as well as in both the courts below are to be paid by the complainants, and before distribution of the sum for which the estate of Tracy is held accountable.\n Mr. Justice Brown took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Washington, D. C., Aug. 21, 1894.\n Dear Mrs. Turner:-- \n[\nFootnote 1\n] was out of the city, and, therefore, did not get your letter until yesterday. I could not comply with your request. There is no money in my bands belonging to the estate of S. H. Turner.\n After you and Erle raised a fuss because he had not gotten his share, I became alarmed and consulted a lawyer, and he advised me not to turn over another dollar of the estate money until Mr. Turner qualified for the full amount of the estate. I informed your husband of the fact, and he declined to qualify (the bond would be over $500,000) and he and Erle agreed that I should invest the money so that it might be earning something while in my hands.\n I then invested the money in what was then good real estate paper, but the panic came on last year, the indorser of the notes failed in business, and the land has depreciated in value, so that if it were sold now I do not think it would bring half the amount of the notes. I have over $1,400 of my money in the same land. If times should ever get good again (which I doubt) the land would be ample security for the notes. I have let Erle have some $600 of my funds since I invested the estate money, but I cannot see my way clear to increase the amount in such times as these. I was surprised at his coming North, without money, in such times as these. He and his father knew the condition of the estate money, and I had twice advised him not to come until times got better. He told me he had over $2,000 loaned out in Vernon, and that after July he would have money.\n Yours truly, etc.\n Philip A.

S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1905, p. 154), a copy of which section is given in the margin. \n Messrs. Frederic C. Coudert and Howard Thayer Kingsbury for appellant.\n\n'Sec. 10. That the Supreme Court of the United States shall have jurisdiction to review, revise, reverse, modify, or affirm the final judgments and decrees of the supreme court of the Philippine Islands in all actions, cases, causes, and proceedings now pending therein, or hereafter determined thereby, in which the Constitution or any statute, treaty, title, right, or privilege of the United States is involved, or in causes in which the value in controversy exceeds twenty-five thousand dollars, or in which the title or possession of real estate exceeding in value the sum of twenty-five thousand dollars, to be ascertained by the oath of either party or of other competent witnesses, is involved or brought in question; and such final judgments or decrees may and can be reviewed, revised, reversed, modified, or affirmed by said Supreme Court of the United States on appeal or writ of error by the party aggrieved, in the same manner, under the same regulations, and by the same procedure, as far as applicable, as the final judgments and decrees of the circuit courts of the United States.' \n\n[201 U.S. 303, 307]\n\u00a0\n No counsel for appellee.\n\n\n\n Mr. Justice Brown delivered the opinion of the court:\n An important question of jurisdiction is presented by the record in this case. It has been a long-established rule that the courts of the United States have no jurisdiction upon the subject of divorce, or for the allowance of alimony, either as an original proceeding in chancery, or an incident of a divorce or separation, both by reason of the fact that the husband and wife cannot usually be citizens of different states so long as the marriage relation continues (a rule which has been somewhat relaxed in recent cases), and for the further reason that a suit for divorce in itself involves no pecuniary value. Barber v. Barber, 21 How. 582, 16 L. ed. 226, and the analogous cases of Kurtz v. Moffitt, \n115 U.S. 487\n, 29 L. ed. 458, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 148; Durham v. Seymour, \n161 U.S. 235\n, 40 L. ed. 682, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 452; and Perrine v. Slack, \n164 U.S. 452\n, 41 L. ed. 510, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 79. \n\n[201 U.S. 303, 308]\n\u00a0\n But the general rule above stated has no application to the jurisdiction of the territorial courts, or of the appellate jurisdiction of this court over those courts. Hence, we held in Simms v. Simms, \n175 U.S. 162\n, 44 L. ed. 115, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 58, that an appeal lies from a decree of the supreme court of a territory dismissing the suit of a husband for a divorce and awarding to a wife alimony and counsel fees, amounting in all to more than $5,000, so far as the decree fixes the alimony. This was an appeal from the supreme court of Arizona, and the court held that the above considerations expressed in Barber v. Barber, 21 How. 582, 16 L. ed. 226, had no application to the appellate jurisdiction of this court over the courts of a territory; that Congress, having entire dominion and sovereignty over territories, 'has full legislative power over all subjects upon which the legislature of a state might legislate within the state; and may at its discretion intrust that power to the legislative assembly of a territory,' citing Cope v. Cope, \n137 U.S. 682\n, 34 L. ed. 832, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 222. It was further held that so far as the question of divorce was concerned, the decree could not be reviewed by this court, 'both because that was a matter the value of which could not be estimated in money; and because the refusal of the divorce involved no matter of law, but mere questions of fact, depending on the evidence, and which this court is not authorized to re-examine.' It was further said: 'The decree for alimony and counsel fees, although in one sense an incident to the suit for divorce, is a distinct and severable final judgment in favor of the defendant for a sum of money of a sufficient jurisdictional amount, and is therefore good ground of appeal.' The appeal in that case did not involve the merits.\n The intimation that this court could not review the refusal of the divorce because it could not re-examine questions of fact was undoubtedly thrown out in view of the territorial practice act of April 7, 1874 (18 Stat. at L. 27, chap. 80,  2), providing that 'on appeal' (from a territorial court), 'instead of the evidence at large, a statement of the facts of the case in the nature of a special verdict, and also the rulings of the court on the admission or \n\n[201 U.S. 303, 309]\n\u00a0\n rejection of evidence, when excepted to, shall be made and certified by the court below, and transmitted to the Supreme Court, together with the transcript of the proceedings and judgment or decree.'\n Since that act was passed we have always held that the jurisdiction of this court on an appeal from the supreme court of a territory did not extend to a re-examination of the facts, but was limited to determining whether the findings of fact supported the judgment, and to reviewing errors in the admission or rejection of testimony, when exceptions have been duly taken to the action of the court in this particular. Stringfellow v. Cain, \n99 U.S. 610\n, 25 L. ed. 421; Eilers v. Boatman, \n111 U.S. 356\n, 28 L. ed. 454, 4 Sup. Ct. Rep. 432; Idaho & O. Land Improv. Co. v. Bradbury, \n132 U.S. 509\n, 33 L. ed. 433, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 177; Mammoth Min. Co. v. Salt Lake Foundry & Mach. Co. \n151 U.S. 447\n, 38 L. ed. 229, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 384; Young v. Amy, \n171 U.S. 179\n, 43 L. ed. 127, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 802.\n This act, however, has no application to the Philippine Islands, appeals from the supreme court of which are regulated by  10 of the act of July 1, 1902, wherein it is declared that apeals from the supreme court of the Philippine Islands shall extend to all actions, cases, causes, and proceedings 'in which the value in controversy exceeds $25,000.' These are reviewable on appeal or writ of error by the party aggrieved, in the same manner as the final judgments and decrees of the circuit courts of the United States. There is no requirement that the facts shall be found. Appeals from the final decrees in these (circuit) courts extend to an examination of the facts as well as the law. While, upon such review, this court will generally accept the concurrent conclusions of the trial and appellate courts, yet, as was said by Mr. Justice Brewer in Beyer v. Le Fevre, \n186 U.S. 114\n-119, 46 L. ed. 1080-1082, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 765: 'There has always been recognized the right and the duty of this court to examine the record, and if it finds that the conclusions are wholly unwarranted by the testimony, it will set the verdict or report aside and direct a re-examination.'\n In this case there was no finding of facts either by the court of first instance, or by the supreme court of the Islands, ex- \n\n[201 U.S. 303, 310]\n\u00a0\n cept as they appear in the opinion. It is doubtful whether this is a finding of facts within the statute (Lehnen v. Dickson, \n148 U.S. 71\n, 37 L. ed. 373, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 481; British Queen Min. Co. v. Baker Silver Min. Co. \n139 U.S. 222\n, 35 L. ed. 147, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 523; Dickinson v. Planters' Bank, 16 Wall. 250, 21 L. ed. 278; Saltonstall v. Birtwell, \n150 U.S. 417\n, 37 L. ed. 1128, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 169; Stone v. United States, \n164 U.S. 380\n, 41 L. ed. 477, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 71), but, in any event, it is not binding upon us in the absence of an authority to make it.\n While, as indicated in Simms v. Simms, the decree for alimony, although in one sense an incident to the suit for divorce, is a distinct and final judgment for a sum of money, and is therefore a good ground for appeal from that part of the decree, yet, where the appeal is from the whole decree (as in this case), or even from a part of the decree, and the denial of alimony or separation of the conjugal property depends upon the evidence which bears upon the right to a divorce, we cannot determine that question without passing upon the sufficiency of the testimony authorizing or refusing the divorce. An appeal from the decree for alimony or other property right would be of no value whatever unless the facts connected with the allowance or refusal of such right were open to review in the appellate court. Although an appeal from a part of a decree does not bring up the part not appealed from, yet, if the whole decree must be reviewed in order to decide the appeal, such appeal brings up the entire record. Kelsey v. Western, 2 N. Y. 500; Union Trust Co. v. Trumbull, 137 Ill, 159, 27 N. E. 24; Walker v. Pritchard, 121 Ill. 227, 12 N. E. 336. The case is even stronger where the appeal is taken from the whole decree.\n The hardship of denying an appeal in this case, as well as review of the testimony upon the subject of divorce, is apparent when the peculiar provisions of the Philippine Code are considered.\n By Article 1315: 'Persons who may be joined in matrimony may, before celebrating it, execute contracts . . . In the absence of contracts relating to property, it shall be understood that the marriage has been contracted under the system of legal conjugal partnership.' \n\n[201 U.S. 303, 311]\n\u00a0\n Article 1401: 'To the conjugal partnership belong:\n'1. Property acquired for a valuable consideration during the marriage at the expense of the partnership property, whether the acquisition is made for the partnership or for one of the spouses only.\n\n'2. That obtained by the industry, salaries, or work of the spouses, or of either of them.\n\n'3. The fruits, income, or interest collected or accrued during the marriage, coming from the partnership property, or from that which belongs to either one of the spouses.'\n\n Article 1392: 'By virtue of the conjugal partnership the earnings or profits indiscriminately obtained by either of the spouses during the marriage shall belong to the husband and the wife, share and share alike, upon the dissolution of the marriage.'\n Article 1407: 'All the property of the marriage shall be considered as partnership property until it is proven that it belongs exclusively to the husband or to the wife.'\n Article 73: 'A decree of divorce shall produce the following effects : . . .\n'3. The guilty spouse shall lose all that may have been given or promised him or her by the innocent one, or by any other person, in consideration for the latter; and the innocent spouse shall keep all that he or she has received from the guilty one, being permitted besides to claim forthwith all that may have been promised by the same.'\n\n In the opinion of the court of first instance it is stated that the plaintiff received from her mother 2,000 pesos, which, with interest amounting to 345 pesos, must be regarded as the portion contributed by the wife to the conjugal partnership. For the purposes of jurisdiction it makes no difference whether the amount claimed be termed alimony or the wife's share of the community property. It is sufficient that she claimed to be entitled to an amount exceeding $25,000, and that the claim was not baseless is shown by the decree of the court of first instance \n\n[201 U.S. 303, 312]\n\u00a0\n allowing it. By the decree of the supreme court she was denied all recovery of any description, upon the ground of her adultery. If, upon a review of the testimony, it were found that she was not guilty of adultery, she would unquestionably be entitled to one half of the conjugal property.\n As  10 of the Philippine statute above cited allows an appeal to this court from 'judgments and decrees of the supreme court of the Philippine Islands in all actions, cases, causes, and proceedings . . . in which the value in controversy exceeds twenty-five thousand dollars,' we know of no power in this court to create an exception where the statute has made none. Such a decision would be a plain case of judicial legislation.\n Our conclusion upon this branch of the case is that the appeal was properly taken, and that it calls for a re-examination of the grounds upon which the petition for a separation of the conjugal property and alimony pendente lite was denied.\n\n 2. \nIn her complaint the plaintiff charges abandonment by her husband without cause, and also adultery with three women, by each of whom he had children, and which resulted in public scandal and the disgrace of the plaintiff. In his answer defendant denies that he abandoned the plaintiff without sufficient cause, and avers that 'he ejected her from his house on account of indignation,' created by her adultery with a Spanish corporal; he denies the various allegations of a adultery charged against him, and says that even if they are true, they are nothing more than the 'necessary consequences of the indescribable conduct of the plaintiff.'\n The parties were married in July, 1891, she being then fourteen years of age and he twenty-three, and lived happily together for about thirteen months, when in August, 1892, a separation ensued.\n Upon the trial the defendant made no denial of his adulteries, but simply declined to answer any questions on the subject. His adultery, however, with three separate women and the birth of a child by each was proven to the satisfaction of both \n\n[201 U.S. 303, 313]\n\u00a0\n courts below, and was not attempted to be disproved by evidence on the part of the defendant. Under the Spanish law the adultery of the husband, to be a good ground for separation, must be accompanied by public scandal and disgrace of the wife. Although there is no evidence that the husband 'ejected her from his house on account of indignation,' as set up in his answer, the fact that he abandoned his wife, excluded her from his house, and formed open and illicit relations with three other women, who bore him a family of children, is quite sufficient evidence that his adultery was accompanied by public scandal and disgrace to the wife.\n There was a difference of opinion between the trial court and the supreme court as to the adultery of the plaintiff. This is the principal contested fact in the case. The question really is whether the finding of the court of first instance, that the plaintiff had not committed adultery, was so manifestly against the weight of evidence that the supreme court was justified in reversing it.\n By  497 of the Code of Civil Procedure it is enacted that 'the supreme court shall not review the evidence taken in the court below, nor retry the question of fact, except, . . . 3. If the excepting party filed a motion in the court of first instance for a new trial, upon the ground that the findings of fact were plainly and manifestly against the weight of evidence, and the judge overruled said motion, and due exception was taken to his overruling the same, the supreme court may review the evidence,' etc.\n The defendant did move for a new trial in the court of first instance, on the ground that the 'conclusions which in said decision have been deducted from the facts are contradictory to what the evidence filed in this case have shown.'\n This is not a literal compliance with  497, above cited, as it is not stated that the findings of fact are plainly and manifestly against the weight of the evidence. It seems rather to fall within the terms of  145 of the Code of Civil Procedure, by the terms of which the court of first instance may, at \n\n[201 U.S. 303, 314]\n\u00a0\n any time during the term at which the action has been tried, set aside the judgment and grant a new trial on the ground that 'the evidence was insufficient to justify the decision, or that it is against the law.' But in this connection it is also provided by  146 that the 'overruling or granting of a motion for a new trial shall not be a ground of exception, but shall be deemed to have been an act of discretion on the part of the judge.'\n Defendant also prepared a bill of exceptions containing the evidence upon which the hearing was had in the supreme court.\n Under the circumstances, and waiving the question whether there was such a motion for a new trial as is contemplated by  497, we are of the opinion that the judgment of the court of first instance should not have been reversed, unless the findings of that court were plainly and manifestly against the weight of the evidence.\n The adultery charged upon the plaintiff is said to have been committed with one Corporal Zabal of the civil guard at Talisay, where the parties then lived. The principal testimony establishing that fact is that of Apolonia Aurelio, a confidential servant, who swears she entered the services of the plaintiff in 1891, that the corporal used to frequent the plaintiff's house during the absence of the husband, who was wont to leave home to inspect his haciendas; that plaintiff habitually visited the quarters of the civil guard for the purpose of meeting Zabal, and that Zabal was also in the habit of going to the plaintiff's house at ten o'clock at night and remaining until morning; that defendant became acquainted with these facts from a letter written by plaintiff to be sent to Zabal at the quarters of the civil guard, but purloined by the witness and given to defendant. This letter, which, upon the theory of the defendant, would have furnished conclusive evidence of the plaintiff's adultery, was destroyed. The letter, if written at all, was written in May, yet her husband continued to live with her until August, when he carried her to her parents in the town of Valladolid, apparently for a visit, cohabited with her there, \n\n[201 U.S. 303, 315]\n\u00a0\n and then abandoned her. His version is that he took her to her mother on the same or the next day after he discovered the letter, and that he did not cohabit with her there, although he occupied the same room, in which there was but one bed. Little reliance was placed upon the testimony of Apolonia by either of the courts below, as it appeared that she did not enter the service of the plaintiff until the year 1893, after the couple had separated, and that she was then sent by the husband to the wife as a servant. She also told a most improbable story of always sleeping in the room of the plaintiff duing her husband's absence, and even while the corporal was there. The court of first instance found that the attitude of the witness was apparently hostile to the plaintiff by reason of the fact that Apolonia was about to marry a man whom the plaintiff disliked, and the plaintiff had punished her.\n Upon the other hand, the court of first instance did not hesitate to say that the attitude of the plaintiff during the trial of the case was such as to impress the court very favorably in her behalf. 'Her entire bearing was that of a modest, retiring, self-respecting, and conscientious woman.' There was testimony tending to show that Apolonia did not want to testify, but was given two packages of paper money in order to induce her to do so, and that another witness was also paid for his testimony. The testimony of Apolonia is to a certain extent bolstered up by that of three or four men, whose intelligence was evidently of such a low order that they can scarcely deserve to be called corroborating witnesses. The judge of the court came to the conclusion that 'the testimony of this woman is too uncertain and too suspicious to justify any court in declaring the plaintiff guilty of adultery, especially when the worthlessness and the dubious character of the testimony of the other witnesses for the defendant on this subject increase the probability of the existence of something in the nature of a conspiracy to destroy the case of the plaintiff, and to support that of the defendant in the present action.'\n As already stated, these parties were married in July, 1891, \n\n[201 U.S. 303, 316]\n\u00a0\n the plaintiff then being but fourteen years of age. The intrigue with Zabal, if it occurred at all, took place within thirteen months thereafter, as the parties separated in August, 1892. The story that a bride of fourteen, happily married, and living in comfort, if not in luxury, should immediately after her marriage enter into liaison with a common soldier, should receive him at her house in the presence of her servants, without an attempt at concealment, spend the night with him with her confidential maid apparently sleeping in the same room, should openly visit his quarters at night, taking her maid with her, is so improbable that it should only be accepted upon evidence leaving no other legitimate conclusion to be drawn from it except that of adultery. The inference that this testimony was fabricated was so strong that the courts below were fully justified in disregarding it. The court of first instance discarded it entirely. The supreme court evidently placed no reliance upon it, but found conclusive evidence of adultery in a letter written in March, 1899, by the plaintiff to her husband.\n This letter, which was written seven years after their separation, is printed in the margin. We do not regard it as by any\n The letter of March 6, 1899, addressed by the plaintiff to the defendant reads as follows:\n'My respected and unforgetable Esteban:\n\n'Pardon that I disturb your tranquillity E., that in the midst of a profound sentiment that afflicts me I find consolation for my profound grief in addressing the man who loved me in the time of my good fortune, and who led me to the altar before the eyes of the being whom we most love, God. Remember me; let fall a drop of compassion from your soul; look at me back again with your cheerful eyes at the woman who is watching for you. I know well that you are very disgusted with me, and for just reason,-for having claimed my pension. Be calm, quiet yourself, reflect a moment for my situation, which I will explain to you.\n\n When you went to Europe, mother went to see you to explain our situation to you, and you answered that it had nothing to do with you. She insulted you, Esteban; you had reason to be offended.\n'Now, regarding my having demanded my pension, you are also in the right, but pardon my impudence in stating what I have to say:\n\n'I swear to you, E., and call God to witness that when you went to Spain, my pain was unbearable thinking of my fatal misfortune. I had become completely desperate, and Orozco wrote and advised me to demand my pension in view of the fact that you were going to reside permanently in Spain; then I finally did commence proceedings in view of my desperate situation, and nothing further came of the matter during your absence.\n\n'If the Lacsons, who wish me ill, have told you more, they have made a mistake, for the truth about my comportment is that it cannot be complained of; you can secure information regarding my conduct during our separation here in Valladolid. \n\n[201 U.S. 303, 317]\n\u00a0\n means conclusive. While it is perhaps susceptible of the construction put upon it by the husband, it is entirely consistent with the theory that she had been abandoned by her husband without cause, was left in a desperate state of mind, was anxious to regain his favor, and to make any sacrifice to induce him to take her back and resume their former relations. She hints at no misconduct of her own, but intimates that he is disgusted with her, and for just reason,-for having claimed her pension. She says that when he went to Spain her pain was unbearable, that she had become completely desperate, and was advised to demand her pension because of the fact that he was going to reside abroad permanently, and she finally commenced proceedings in view of her desperate situation. So far from confessing adultery, she says that if those who wished her ill 'have told you more, they have made a mistake, for the truth about my comportment is that it cannot be complained of.' There is nothing indicating that after their separation her conduct had not been irreproachable.\n\n The paragraph much relied upon is as follows: 'I keep yet on my face the shame of what has happened, notwithstanding that it has been already many years since we parted.\n___ 'I keep yet on my face the shame of what has happened, notwithstanding that it has been already many years since we parted. Therefore, my husband, forgive me; erase what has happened, remember me for God's love; behold our dark fate. In you I trust my future.\n'E., I have heard that you have had some misfortunes. I send my sympathy, although I am unworthy of your presence.\n\n'I also learn from Modesto that you do not wish to have my pension sent. Do as you wish.\n\n'Good-by, E., take good care of yourself, and command, 'Your faithful servant Q. B. S. P., March 6, 1899. Agueda Benedicto. \n\n[201 U.S. 303, 318]\n\u00a0\n Therefore, my husband, forgive me; erase what has happened; remember me for God's love; behold our dark fate. In you I trust my future.' This is by no means necessarily a confession of guilt.\n\n The letter is that of a broken-hearted woman, who is willing to make any sacrifice necessary to be restored to her husband's favor, and to submit to any humiliation necessary to regain his affection. She makes no confession of adultery, points to her 'comportment' since their separation as showing nothing that could be complained of, but in her frequent repetition of the claim she had made for her pension points to that as the source of her husband's disgust. Bearing in mind that her husband had seduced her when she was only thirteen years of age, and that since their separation, and for nearly a decade, he had not only repudiated her, but had maintained unlawful relations with at least three other women, all of whom had borne him children, we think that, even if two constructions were possible, the court of first instance was right in putting that construction upon the letter which was most favorable to the plaintiff.\n We have reached the conclusion that there is no such preponderance of evidence in favor of the theory of plaintiff's guilt as authorized the supreme court to set aside the conclusions of the court below upon the ground that these findings were plainly and manifestly against the weight of the evidence. In this connection it is proper to bear in mind that the trial judge had all these witnesses before him, and doubtless formed his conclusions largely from their appearance on the stand, their manner of giving testimony and their apparent credibility. Under the circumstances we think the supreme court should have affirmed, rather than reversed, the action of the lower court.\n While the right of the plaintiff to her proportion of the conjugal property, to alimony pending suit, and to other allowances claimed, is the basis of our jurisdiction, the decree of the supreme court in dismissing plaintiff's petition renders it unnecessary to review the action of the court of first instance in fixing the amount that it held plaintiff was entitled to recover. \n\n[201 U.S. 303, 319]\n\u00a0\n We are therefore of opinion that the decree of the supreme court dismissing the petition must be reversed, and the cause remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice White, Mr. Justice Peckham, Mr. Justice Holmes, and Mr. Justice Day dissented upon the question of jurisdiction. \n\n\n\n","41":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDE RODRIGUEZ v. VIVONI(1906)\nNo. 209\nArgued: Decided: April 2, 1906\n\n\n\n Messrs. Fritz von Briesen, Charles M. Boerman, and Stephen M. Hoye for appeallant.\n\n\n\n[201 U.S. 371, 374]\n\u00a0\n Mr. N. B. K. Pettingill for appellees.\n\n\n[201 U.S. 371, 375]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a bill for the partition of real estate, in which the female plaintiff claims one undivided eighth as heir to her daughter, Felipa Benicia, who died an infant, without issue. This daughter got her title under the will of Thomas Jos e Ramirez, and the question is whether, in the event which happened, her share went to her mother by descent or to her fellow devisees by the terms of the will. The other devisees all were living at her death. The case was heard upon a plea setting up the foregoing facts, together with the will, and the bill was dismissed. Thereupon the plaintiffs appealed to this court. \n\n[201 U.S. 371, 376]\n\u00a0\n The material clause of the will is as follows: 'Trece.-El remanente de mis bienes, derechos, y acciones, lo lego con calidad de fideicomiso, y que acrezcan las demas, caso de fallecimiento sin sucesi on legitima, por iguales partes, a mis sobrinas Dona Cornelia y Dona Antonia Martinez, Dona Monserrate, Dona Obdulia, Dona Encarnaci on, Dona Angela, y Dona Concesi on Ramirez de Arellano y Felipa Benicia, mi hija de crianza,' etc. We vary slightly the translation in the record. 'The remainder of my goods, rights, and actions I bequeath in the character of fidei-commissum and that the other [shares] may [profit by] accretion, in case of death without sucesi on legitima, by equal parts to my nieces [named] and Felipa Benicia, my foster child, who shall adopt my surname,' with appointment of a guardian for the last, a provision for her education, and a request that when that is finished she return to live with the said nieces.\n It is agreed that it is possible for sucesi on legitima to mean either issue or lawful heirs. If it means the latter, the mother inherited, as she was the lawful heir. If it means the former, then, by the terms of the will, Felipa Benicia's share went to the testator's nieces when she died. It seems to us too plain to need extended elucidation that sucesi on legitima here means issue. The argument on the other side, that the purpose is merely to prevent an escheat by making the nieces and Felipa Benicia reciprocal successors, to impose a fetter on free alienation, and to enhance the dowry of the nieces, strikes us as fanciful. The natural object of this fidei-commissary substitution is that which is said to be its object,-to secure accretion among the shares. But that purpose would pretty nearly vanish into thin air if death without heirs were the event in view. For each of the nieces being heir to all the others, accretion among them would be excluded. It is argued, to be sure, that they might requdiate the inheritance and then claim under the will, if any of the nieces died heavily in debt. Whether this would be true by Spanish law we need not inquire. For such remote explanations must be rejected when \n\n[201 U.S. 371, 377]\n\u00a0\n the will offers a different and more obvious one upon its face. And while it is pressed that substitutions are strictly construed in favor of the first taker, we do not understand that or any other rule of construction to require a perversion of language, or to govern a case where the second taker stands on an equal footing with the first in the testator's mind, with equal mutual chances, and when the plainly expressed purpose is to create an artificial class, with cross limitations in case of death without a child.\n A suggestion is made by an afterthought, in a brief filed since the argument, that the testator could not exclude the mother of Felipa from her right, as necessary or forced heir, to two thirds of Felipa's share. The suggestion comes too late. No such claim was set up in the bill, or, so far as appears, in the court below. Therefore, we shall not consider at length whether, in case of a pure gratuity to one to whom the testator was under no legal obligation, the Spanish law entitled a forced heir to claim against the words of a gift like this. The texts cited are not sufficient to establish the proposition, and the contrary seems to be shown by Ley 10, titulo 4, part. 6, and note 13, Madrid ed. 1848. See also 4 Escriche, 1051, 1052, sub. v. Substituci on Fideicomisaria, ad fin. On the whole case the plaintiffs must abide by the construction and the law, in which, it would seem from the bill, they have acquiesced for thirty years.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","42":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDEVINE v. CITY OF LOS ANGELES(1906)\nNo. 207\nArgued: March 13, 1906Decided: May 14, 1906\n\n\n\n\n Statement by Mr. Chief Justice Fuller: \n\n[202 U.S. 313, 314]\n\u00a0\n Complainants below, appellants here, are 244 in number, and own in severalty various tracts of land aggregating several thousand acres, located in the county of Los Angeles, California, in ranchos San Rafael, Los Felis, and Providencia. The rancho San Rafael was granted by the King of Spain, and the other two ranchos by the Republic of Mexico, to the predecessors of complainants. The titles were confirmed, pursuant to the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo [9 Stat. at L. 922], to the successors of the original grantees by the board of land commissioners created by and acting under an act of Congress approved March 3, 1851, entitled, 'An Act to Ascertain and Settle Private Land Claims in the State of California.' [9 Stat. at L. 631, chap. 41.] Patents were thereupon issued by the United States to the confirmees, and it was alleged that these grants conveyed the title to the waters within them.\n It was further alleged that the city of Los Angeles claimed to be the successor in right and title to all the grants made by the Spanish and Mexican governments to the Pueblo de Los Angeles, and the city filed a claim before the land commissioners in virtue of the general laws of Spain to 16 square leagues of land, alleging that the said lands had been granted to the pueblo, which board confirmed the title of the city to four square leagues of land, but rejected its claim to the remaining 12 square leagues, and that a patent was issued to the city by the United States for the land so confirmed, which patent did not refer to the river or its tributary waters, and did not purport to convey any of the waters of said river. That the city claimed the paramount right to the waters of the Los Angeles river and the river itself in virtue of the grants, laws, usages, and customs of the Republic of Mexico and of the Kingdom of Spain, made and in vogue prior to the cession of the territory embraced within the state of California to the United States under the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, and by virtue \n\n[202 U.S. 313, 315]\n\u00a0\n of certain acts of the legislature of the state of California, referred to in the bill, and especially by virtue of an act of the legislature of California, passed April 4, 1850, incorporating the city of Los Angeles, and declaring that it 'shall succeed to all the rights, claims, and powers of the Pueblo de Los Angeles in regard to property, and shall be subject to all the liabilities incurred, and obligations created, by the ayuntamiento of said pueblo.\n It was further alleged that the city never procured the confirmation of any rights in the waters of the Los Angeles river other than those that passed under the grant of land conferred by the patent, and that the act of the legislature, passed April 4, 1850, and certain other acts of the legislature, and proceedings, acts, and charters of the city, set forth in the bill, are a cloud upon complainants' title to their lands. That the Los Angeles river runs through the three ranchos and thence through the city; that complainants' lands are riparian to the stream; that underlying complainants' lands are percolating waters which do not constitute a part of the river, but which, by reason of the patents referred to and mesne conveyances, belong to the several complainants as owners of said lands. The bill then went on to aver that the city claims that it is the owner of the river and its tributaries and their waters, passing through the ranchos named, and of the percolating waters in complainants' lands; that it claims the right to appropriate said waters for the use of the city and its inhabitants, and that complainants have no right to take any of the surface waters of the river or the percolating waters except in subordination to the city's paramount right to take and use the same, and the city threatens and intends to institute suit in the state courts of California to enjoin complainants from using any of the waters possessed by them from wells on their lands.\n That the city rests its right and claim to the river and its waters upon a certain construction of the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo and of the act of Congress of March 3, 1851, and upon certain acts of the California legislature and certain charters \n\n[202 U.S. 313, 316]\n\u00a0\n of the city of Los Angeles, adopted and approved in pursuance of an erroneous construction of the treaty and the act of Congress; the acts and charters being enumerated.\n It was further alleged that, under said acts and said charters, the city had asserted and assumed the right to take physical control of the Los Angeles river and its tributaries, and has exercised the right of obstructing ditches and other conduits maintained by owners of land in the valley of the river above the city, and of preventing the use of the waters of the river for irrigation of the lands of complainants, and that said laws and charters and the exercise of said rights have resulted in the destruction of the values of the lands. And it was charged that the acts of the legislature and the charters of the city of Los Angeles were in violation of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, in that they deprived, or attempted to deprive, complainants of their property without due process of law, and to grant the same to the city of Los Angeles; that the acts and charters impaired the obligation of the contracts expressed in the patents of the United States to complainants' lands; and that the assertion and exercise by the city of the right to control the river and its waters were in violation of  1979, title 24, of the Revised Statutes of the United States (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p 1262).\n And the bill further averred that the construction of the act of Congress of March 3, 1851, upon which the defendant city rested its right and claim to said river and to said waters, is erroneous, and that, according to the proper construction thereof, the city was required to present to the board of land commissioners its claim to the waters of the river for confirmation.\n It was also alleged that the claims and threats of the city to institute actions against complainants, and the control which it has exercised over the river and the waters thereof, and the several acts of the legislature of California, and the charter of the city, purporting to convey title to the river and its waters upon the city as the successor to the Mexican pueblo, cast a \n\n[202 U.S. 313, 317]\n\u00a0\n cloud upon the titles of complainants to their lands, and had, in large measure, destroyed the market values thereof.\n It was prayed:\n\n 1. \nThat a decree be granted complainants removing the cloud cast by the city of Los Angeles upon their titles to the lands described in the bill, and that the acts of the legislature of the state of California and the charters of the city be declared invalid in respect to conferring upon the city any rights in the waters of the Los Angeles river, acquired from the pueblo of Los Angeles, other than such rights as were ascertained and confirmed under the act of March 3, 1851\n\n\n 2. That a decree be granted to complainants and each of them quieting their several titles to their lands and to the waters therein, and to the riparian right of each of them to use the waters of said river, as against the paramount title claimed by said city to have been derived from Spain or Mexico, or claimed to have been derived from or to be supported by said acts of the legislature of the state of California, or by the charter of said city; and also that it be decreed that complainants and the city have each and severally such title only, derived from Spain and Mexico, as was confirmed and patented to them or their predecessors by the act of Congress of March 3, 1851.\n\n 3. \nThat a decree be granted to complainants, forever enjoining the city of Los Angeles from setting up or asserting such paramount right and title to said waters; and further enjoining said city from asserting and exercising dominion or control over said river and said waters under or by virtue of said acts of the legislature or said charter of said city of Los Angeles.\n It was alleged in the answer that, by the terms of each of the grants to the three ranchos named in the bill, and by the laws of the government making the same, all of the waters within any of the lands embraced in said ranchos, which formed a part of or found their way into the surface or subterranean stream of the Los Angeles river, were excepted and reserved in favor of the pueblo of Los Angeles, and that none of said \n\n[202 U.S. 313, 318]\n\u00a0\n waters were confirmed or granted by the United States to complainants' predecessors.\n It was admitted that the city claimed to be, and it was alleged that the city was, in fact, the successor to all the rights and grants made by the Spanish and Mexican governments to the pueblo of Los Angeles.\n The answer further alleged that the patent issued by the United States to the city of Los Angeles purported to grant to the mayor and council of the city of Los Angeles all appurtenances belonging to the land therein granted, which included all the waters of the river and the right to the use of the same.\n It was admitted that the city claimed the paramount right to the waters of the Los Angeles river by virtue of grants, laws, usages, and customs of the Republic of Mexico and the Kingdom of Spain and the act of the legislature approved April 4, 1850, mentioned in the bill, but it was denied that these were the only sources of title through which the city claimed; and alleged that it also claimed said paramount right by virtue of long-continued use and possession of said river and the waters thereof for the period of more than one hundred and twenty years, and by various grants and conveyances from private individuals, and by virtue of various judgments and decrees of courts of competent jurisdiction, and of the patents to the mayor and common council of the city of Los Angeles, mentioned in the bill, and also by virtue of its ownership of various tracts of land, which are riparian to said river, amounting in area to more than 4,000 acres, embracing the land through which the river flows in passing through the lands included in said patent.\n The answer disclaimed that the city acquired, under the act of the legislature passed April 4, 1850, any right to the Los Angeles river, or the waters thereof, or any other water or right which was, at the time of the passage of said act, vested in the predecessors of complainants, or any private individual or corporation.\n The answer denied that the acts of the legislature, or the \n\n[202 U.S. 313, 319]\n\u00a0\n proceedings, or acts, or charters of the city, referred to in the bill, constituted any cloud upon complainants' titles, but, on the contrary, allege that none of complainants had, at the time of the commencement of the suit, or have now, any right or interest in or to the waters of the Los Angeles river, save in subordination to the paramount right of the city to take and use all of the waters of said river to the extent of the necessities of the city or its inhabitants.\n The answer alleged that all of the waters underlying complainants' lands form and constitute a part of the Los Angeles river, and would, if not intercepted, reach the surface stream of the river at a point above the northern boundary of the city, and denied that any of said waters belonged to the several complainants, or that they, or any of them, have ever had any ownership of said waters, save in subordination to the paramount right of the city to take and use said waters, so far as it and its inhabitants might need the same.\n It was denied that, in the petition of the mayor and common council of the city of Los Angeles to the board of land commissioners for confirmation of the pueblo lands, no claim was made to the waters of the Los Angeles river, and alleged that the board of land commissioners, in its finding and judgment confirming the claim of the city to the pubelo lands, also confirmed its claim to the rights with respect to the waters of the river which were possessed by the pueblo; and it was admitted that the city of Los Angeles had, in the past, claimed, and still claimed, to be the owner of all the waters of said river, and of its tributaries, from its sources of supply to the southern boundary of the city, and also of all of the waters existing in complainants' lands, and of the waters under said lands; and it was alleged that all the waters in those lands did in fact constitute a stream or water course, and were part of the waters of the Los Angeles river. The city admitted that it claimed that complainants had no right to pump the waters in their lands, because such pumping might ultimately have the effect of reducing the supply in the surface and subterranean river, \n\n[202 U.S. 313, 320]\n\u00a0\n and it was denied that they were percolating waters, and also denied that the city claimed the right to enter on the lands of any of complainants to take or use said waters, or any part thereof, without having first obtained the right so to do by grant from, or condemnation against said complainants. It was admitted that the city claimed the right to prevent complainants from using the waters in their lands when the city had need of the same, but denied that it claimed the right to prevent complainants from using said waters by entering upon their lands or by using physical force, and alleged that the city claimed the right to prevent the use of said waters by complainants only in the manner prescribed by the laws of the state of California, and that the city intended to enforce its rights against complainants by means of the suit brought by it, as alleged in the bill, in the state court, against certain of the complainants, for the purpose of enjoining them from using the waters pumped by them from their lands, and by means of other legal process, and not by any unlawful acts or physical force.\n It was admitted that the city rested its claim to the Los Angeles river and the waters thereof, including the waters in the lands of complainants, in part upon the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, according to the manifest meaning thereof, viz., that the rights of pueblos were intended to be protected by said treaty, as well as the rights of individuals; and it was admitted that the city rested its claim in part upon the act of Congress of March 3, 1851, according to the manifest meaning thereof, viz., that the claims of pueblos, and of municipal corporations succeeding them, to lands granted by the Spanish and Mexican governments, were entitled to confirmation, and that the confirmation thereof had the effect of confirming all water rights which were appurtenant to said lands, and that said act did not require claims for property other than lands to be presented for confirmation.\n It was denied that the city rested its claim to the Los Angeles river and its waters, including the waters in the lands of \n\n[202 U.S. 313, 321]\n\u00a0\n complainants, upon the laws of the state of California and the ordinances and charters of the city of Los Angeles, except to the extent that the same had the effect of vesting and continuing in the city and its predecessors such rights with respect to the waters of the Los Angeles river as were possessed by the pueblo at the time the pueblo was dissolved and the city was incorporated by the act of April 4, 1850, and such rights with respect to the waters of the river as might have been vested in the state of California upon its admission to the Union.\n It was expressly disclaimed that there was granted by said acts of the legislature, or by the city charter, to the mayor and common council of the city of Los Angeles, any right to develop waters percolating under the bed of the Los Angeles river or elsewhere, which, at the time of the passage of said acts, or at the time of the adoption of said charter, was vested in the complainants, or any of them, or in their predecessors, or in any private individual or corporation.\n It was alleged that the legislative acts, and the ordinances and charters mentioned in the bill, were adopted with the intention of asserting that the city of Los Angeles was the owner of all the rights possessed by the pueblo of Los Angeles to the waters of the Los Angeles river, and not with the intention of depriving complainants, or any of them, or any of their predecessors, or any other private individual or private corporation, of any right in respect to the waters of said river; and denied that by any of said acts of the legislature mentioned in the bill, or by the charter of the city or the amendments thereof, there was intended to be granted to the city any right with respect to the water flowing in said river or beneath the surface of the bed thereof, which was then vested in complainants, or any of them. or any of their predecessors, or any private individual or private corporation, or that by any of said acts it was intended to devest any private person or corporation of any vested private rights in said waters, or that any of said acts had ever been construed by any court in the state of California \n\n[202 U.S. 313, 322]\n\u00a0\n to so devest any such private vested rights, but, on the contrary, it was alleged that it had been determined by the supreme court of California that said acts did not have such effect.\n The answer denied that the city had ever interfered with the appellants in the use of the waters of the river or its tributaries, or the waters of said valley, except when such waters were located on or in the lands of the city, or on or in lands on which the city had acquired the right of entry to divert and use said waters, except when the city has interfered with such use by judgments of court, obtained by due process of law, and denied that the city has ever assumed or asserted the right to take physical control of any waters on or in complainants' lands. It was disclaimed that the acts or charters referred to in the bill granted to the city the right to take physical control of property belonging to complainants.\n The answer denied that the acts of the legislature and the ordinances and charters of the city of Los Angeles, mentioned in the bill, or any of them, were in violation of the 14th Amendment, or impaired the obligation of contracts, or were in violation of  1979, title 24, of the Revised Statutes of the United States.\n The answer alleged that, according to the proper construction of the act of March 3, 1851, the confirmation and patent therein provided for only had the effect of confirming to the confirmee and patentee the lands therein described, but subject to all the easements and servitudes imposed thereon by the laws of Spain and Mexico in favor of third parties, including the rights to the waters of unnavigable streams which were attached to other lands, or belonged to pueblos or private individuals other than the grantees. And where such water rights were appurtenant to lands granted by the Spanish and Mexican governments, and confirmed and patented under said act of Congress, such water rights passed by such patents, and a claim for such water rights was not required by such act to be confirmed or patented. \n\n[202 U.S. 313, 323]\n\u00a0\n It was admitted that the city claimed that complainants had no right to the waters of the Los Angeles river, including the waters in other lands, as against the city and its inhabitants, when the city shall determine that it needs said waters, and that the city claims that the use by the complainants of such waters is at the sufferance of the city, and may be prohibited by the city at any time, and that the city is threatening to institute suits against complainants for the purpose of enforcing such claims, but it is denied that any and all said claims, or any dominion or control which the city has exercised over the river and the waters thereof, has cast any cloud upon the several titles of complainants to their lands, or affected the market value or salability of such lands.\n It was alleged in the answer that, in the year 1781, a pueblo was founded on the site of the present city of Los Angeles by the government of the Kingdom of Spain, and that, according to the laws and regulations of that country, said pueblo became entitled to the sole and exclusive right in perpetuity to the absolute ownership of all the waters of the Los Angeles river, whether flowing upon or beneath the surface of the ground; that said river then rose and now rises several miles above the site of the pueblo, and ran and still runs down through said site to the lands now embraced within the city of Los Angeles; that, during the whole of the occupation and control of said pueblo by the Spanish and Mexican governments, the municipal authorities at all times exercised control of, and claimed the exclusive right to use, all the waters of said river, and that right was, during all of said time, recognized and acknowledged by the owners of all of the lands bordering on said river, including the predecessors of complainants; that, ever since the occupation and control of said pueblo by the United States and by the state of California, the municipal authorities of the city have exercised the same rights over and to the waters of the river as were previously exercised and claimed by the authorities of the pueblo, and that such control and rights were exercised and claimed for the purpose of irrigation \n\n[202 U.S. 313, 324]\n\u00a0\n and for the domestic and other uses of said pueblo and said city and the inhabitants thereof.\n It was further alleged that, within one year after the foundation of the pueblo, the municipal authorities thereof constructed a system of irrigation works and conveyed the waters of the river to and upon lands in the pueblo, and that thereafter, from time to time, other lands of the pueblo were brought under irrigation, so that all of said waters were diverted from said river and used for such irrigation during a period of many years prior to the conquest of California by the United States, and that, from and after such conquest, the same use was made of the waters of the river for the irrigation of lands within the pueblo and for domestic use of its inhabitants up to the time of the passage of the act of April 4, 1850, incorporating the city of Los Angeles; that from and after that time the municipal authorities of said city continued to construct additional works for the more economical diversion and distribution of such waters for use in irrigating lands within said city and for domestic use of the inhabitants thereof; that, within the past eighteen years, nearly all of said irrigable lands have been divided into building lots and covered with houses, so that all of the waters previously used for the irrigation of said lands, excepting the portion thereof which has been diverted by complainants within the last five years, have been used by the city and its inhabitants for purposes other than for irrigation, and all of the waters of said river during the dry season of each year, extending from the first day of May to the first day of November, and a great portion of said waters during the rest of the year, have been needed for said uses. That the population of said city is not less than 180,000 people, and is increasing at the rate of more than 10,000 per year, and that the city has no other source of water supply except said river.\n It was alleged that, with certain exceptions referred to therein, the pueblo of Los Angeles, from the time of its foundation in the year 1781, up to the incorporation of the pueblo as a \n\n[202 U.S. 313, 325]\n\u00a0\n city by the act of 1850, and the said city from that time until now, has continuously, exclusively, and adversely to the whole world, used all of the waters of the Los Angeles river under a claim of ownership of said waters, the exceptions referred to being claims made by certain persons at various times of rights to the use of the waters of the river and of affluents thereof, which have been litigated and decide by the state courts in favor of the city, and it was further alleged that, within the past twelve years, certain owners of lands in which flowed underground waters of the river have set up a claim that said waters were not a part of the river, and that they were entitled to take and appropriate said underground waters for their own use, and that, in pursuance of such claims, great numbers of said parties, including some of complainants, had constructed wells, and engaged in pumping large quantities of said water, thereby diminishing the surface flow of the river, and that it was for the purpose of preventing such diminution that the city was bringing and contemplated bringing the actions against complainants referred to in the bill; that, within the past five years, such abstraction of these underground waters did not interfere with the supply of water required by the city, but, within the past three years, the amount of diversion by means of said wells has increased so much, and the needs of the city and its inhabitants have also so greatly increased, that the waters of the river which reached the surface stream thereof and the underground diversion works of the city have not been sufficient to supply it and its inhabitants with the water needed by them.\n It was also alleged that the city, in its corporate name or in the name of the board of water commissioners, is the owner of numerous tracts of land which are riparian to the river, and which are particularly described in the answer. And further, that in the year 1879 two actions were commenced by predecessors of some of complainants against the city of Los Angeles, claiming the right to divert and use waters of the river, and both of said actions were finally determined by the supreme \n\n[202 U.S. 313, 326]\n\u00a0\n court of the state of California against the plaintiffs, and in favor of the city, and it was alleged that complainants, who are successors in interest of the plaintiffs in the suits last mentioned, are, by said judgments, estopped to deny that the city is the owner of a paramount right to use so much of the waters of the Los Angeles river as it and its inhabitants may need.\n Thereafter the city of Los Angeles, by its counsel, moved the court to dismiss this cause on the ground that it appeared that the court had no jurisdiction thereof, which motion was sustained and the bill dismissed; whereupon the cause was brought here on certificate.\n Messrs. Cyrus F. McNutt, J. E. Hannon, Warren E. Lloyd, and Stephens & Stephens for appellants.\n\n\n[202 U.S. 313, 329]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. W. B. Mathews, J. R. Scott, and Henry T. Lee for appellee.\n\n\n[202 U.S. 313, 332]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n There being no diversity of citizenship, the jurisdiction of the circuit court could only be maintained upon the ground \n\n[202 U.S. 313, 333]\n\u00a0\n that the suit arose under the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States, and a suit does not so arise unless it really and substantially involves a dispute or controversy as to the effect or construction of the Constitution or some law or treaty of the United States, upon the determination of which the result depends. And this must appear from the plaintiff's statement of his own claim, and cannot be aided by allegations as to the defenses which might be interposed.\n Complainants prayed for a decree quieting their title to the lands described in the bill, but the averments did not bring the case within the classes of bills of peace or to quiet title, recognized by the usual chancery practice, as succinctly stated in Boston & M. Consol. Copper & S. Min. Co. v. Montana Ore Purchasing Co. \n188 U.S. 632\n, 47 L. ed. 626, 23 Sup.Ct.Rep. 434. It was apparently framed under  738 of the California Code of Civil Procedure, providing that 'an action may be brought by any person against another who claims an estate or interest in real property adverse to him, for the purpose of determining such adverse claim.' This statute enlarged the ancient jurisdiction of courts of equity in respect of suits to quiet title, but, the equitable rights themselves remaining, the enlargement thereof may be administered by the circuit courts of the United States as well as by the courts of the state. Broderick's Will ( Kieley v. McGlynn) 21 Wall. 503, 22 L. ed. 599; Holland v. Challen, \n110 U.S. 15\n, 28 L. ed. 52, 3 Sup. Ct. Rep. 495; Gormley v. Clark, \n134 U.S. 348\n, 33 L. ed. 913, 10 Sup.Ct.Rep. 554.\n It seems, and it has often been held by the supreme court of California, that, in an action under this section, it is not necessary that the complaint should allege the nature of the estate or interest claimed by the defendant. Head v. Fordyce, 17 Cal. 151; Castro v. Barry, 79 Cal. 443, 21 Pac. 946; Bulwer Consol. Min. Co. v. Standard Consol. Min. Co. 83 Cal. 589, 23 Pac. 1102.\n We are dealing with the question of the jurisdiction of the circuit court, and the general rule as to that is thus stated by Mr. Justice Peckham, speaking for the court, in Boston & M. Consol. Copper & S. Min. Co. v. Montana Ore Purchasing Co. supra: \n\n[202 U.S. 313, 334]\n\u00a0\n 'It would be wholly unnecessary and improper, in order to prove complainant's cause of action, to go into any matters of defense which the defendants might possibly set up, and then attempt to reply to such defense, and thus, if possible, to show that a Federal question might or probably would arise in the course of the trial of the case. To allege such defense and then make an answer to it before the defendant has the opportunity to itself plead or prove its own defense is inconsistent with any known rule of pleading, so far as we are aware, and is improper.\n'The rule is a reasonable and just one that the complainant in the first instance shall be confined to a statement of its cause of action, leaving to the defendant to set up in his answer what his defense is.\n\n ... * *\n'The cases hold that, to give the circuit court original jurisdiction, the Federal question must appear necessarily in the statement of the plaintiff's cause of action, and not as mere allegations of the defense which the defendants intend to set up or which they rely upon. Third Street & Suburban R. Co. v. Lewis, \n173 U.S. 457\n, 43 L. ed. 766, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 451.'\n\n Tested by this rule, we are of opinion that, as a bill to quiet title, the jurisdiction of the circuit court cannot be sustained by reason of the allegations that defendant's adverse claims are based on an erroneous construction of the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo [9 Stat. at L. 922], the act of March 3, 1851 [9 Stat. at L. 631, chap. 41], and the acts of the legislature of California, and ordinances and charters of the city of Los Angeles, enumerated, as clearly shown hereafter.\n But complainants, appellants here, deny that the present case was brought under  738, and say that the bill was one to remove clouds from complainants' titles; that is to say, clouds created by claims and threats, and by the several acts of California including defendant's charters, which complainants ask to be declared invalid.\n We do not understand, however, that a bill will lie to dispel mere verbal assertions of ownership as clouds on title, or, in- \n\n[202 U.S. 313, 335]\n\u00a0\n voking equity interposition on the ground of the removal of clouds, that decrees may be sought adjudging statutes unconstitutional and void. If it were true that the statutes and charters referred to in the bill were unconstitutional, as alleged, they were void on their face, and could not constitute a cloud on complainants' titles.\n The test as to when a cloud is or is not cast, as stated by Mr. Justice Field, then chief justice of California, in Pixley v. Huggins, 15 Cal. 127, and reasserted in Hanne-winkle v. Georgetown, 15 Wall. 547, 21 L. ed. 231, is undoubtedly applicable and demonstrates that the assertion of unconstitutionality cannot be resorted to to maintain Federal jurisdiction as constituting a cloud. The averment of unconstitutionality in such circumstances is a mere pretext to obtain that jurisdiction.\n According to the bill complainants' titles were derived from Spain and Mexico by virtue of grants to their predecessors from those countries, which were confirmed by the board of land commissioners. The state of California was not in the line of such titles, so that the acts of the legislature and the charters of the city complained of manifestly did not have the effect of depriving complainants of their property or of impairing the obligation of any contract, but simply conferred on the city such rights in respect of the waters of the river as may have been vested in the state.\n Hooker v. Los Angeles, \n188 U.S. 314\n, 47 L. ed. 487, 63 L. R. A. 471, 23 Sup.Ct.Rep. 395, was a suit brought by the city to condemn a tract of land riparian to the Los Angeles river, and embraced in one of the ranchos described in the present bill. It originated in the superior court of the county of Los Angeles under the title of Los Angeles v. Pomeroy, was carried to the supreme court of the state and there affirmed. 124 Cal. 597, 637, 638, 57 Pac. 585. It involved the question of the respective rights of the city and of the defendants to the water of the Los Angeles river. The state supreme court said:\n'No act of the legislature . . . can diminish or change \n\n[202 U.S. 313, 336]\n\u00a0\n the rights of the defendants in these lands derived from their predecessors, the Mexican and Spanish grantees. . . . The defendants hold their lands as successors to several Spanish and Mexican grantees, under patents from the United States based upon the original grants. They claim that, even conceding the rights of the pueblo and the city's succession to those rights (a concession which they make only for the purposes of the argument on this point), they are still, by virtue of their ownership of the lands in question, entitled to the exercise of full riparian rights, except so far, and so far only, as those rights are impaired by the paramount rights of the pueblo as they existed before the change of flag and without any legislative addition thereto.\n\n'This claim, we think, is clearly just, The legislature of California could grant nothing to the city of Los Angeles which belonged to others, and the rights of the city, as successor to the pueblo, in the lands of riparian proprietors holding under Mexican and Spanish grants, cannot exceed the rights of the pueblo itself.'\n\n The case was brought here on writ of error, and we said:\n'And so as to certain statutes of the state of California, which declared that the city of Los Angeles is vested with the paramount right to the surface and subterranean water of the Los Angeles river. Those statutes were admitted in evidence merely to show that the city was the successor of the ancient pueblo. The court held that the right of the city of Los Angeles to take from the Los Angeles river all of the waters of the river to the extent of its reasonable domestic and municipal needs was based on the Spanish and Mexican law, and not on the charters of the city of Los Angeles. The validity of the statutes, on account of repugnancy to the Federal Constitution, was not drawn in question in the trial court nor in the supreme court of the state, and both courts held that they neither granted to the city nor took away from plaintiffs in error any rights or property.' \n\n[202 U.S. 313, 337]\n\u00a0\n This being so, the averments of deprivation or impairment afforded no proper basis for jurisdiction, and as to  1979 or the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1262), that was inapplicable. Holt v. Indiana Mfg. Co. \n176 U.S. 68\n, 44 L. ed. 374, 20 Sup.Ct.Rep. 272.\n\n In truth, the questions as to the nature and extent of complainants' titles or rights, as put forward in the bill, are not Federal questions, but questions of state or general law.\n In Hooker v. Los Angeles, supra, it was contended that the decision of the state court against the claim of plaintiffs in error to certain riparian rights and in certain alleged percolating waters, which rights were alleged to be derived from a patent of the United States, and confirmed Mexican grants, was a decision against a title, right, privilege, or immunity claimed under the Constitution or some statute or treaty of the United States and so reviewable here. But this court held otherwise, and we said:\n'Obviously, the question as to the title or right of plaintiffs in error in the land, and whatever appertained thereto, was one of state law and of general public law, on which the decision of the state court was final. San Francisco v. Scott, \n111 U.S. 768\n, 28 L. ed. 593, 4 Sup.Ct.Rep. 688; California Powder Works v. Davis, \n151 U.S. 389\n, 38 L. ed. 206, 14 Sup.Ct.Rep. 350. And the question of the existence of percolating water was merely a question of fact.\n\n'The patents were in the nature of a quitclaim, and, under the act of March 3, 1851, were 'conclusive between the United States and the said claimants only, and shall not affect the interests of third person.' The validity of that act was not drawn in question in the state court, and, as the right or title asserted by plaintiffs in error was derived under Mexican and Spanish grants, the decision of the state court on the claims asserted by plaintiffs in error to the waters of the river was not against any title or right claimed under the Constitution, or any treaty, or statute of, or commission held, or authority exercised under, the Constitution. If the title of plaintiffs in error were protected by the treaty, still the suit did not arise thereunder, because the controversy in the state court did not in- \n\n[202 U.S. 313, 338]\n\u00a0\n volve the construction of the treaty, but the validity of the title of Mexican and Spanish grants prior to the treaty.'\n\n Crystal Springs Land & Water Co. v. Los Angeles, \n177 U.S. 169\n, 44 L. ed. 720, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 573, was a bill brought in the circuit court for the southern district of California and that court ruled (82 Fed. 114) that where both parties claimed under Mexican grants, confirmed and patented by the United States in accordance with the provisions of the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, and the controversy was only as to what were the rights thus granted and confirmed, the suit was not one arising under a treaty so as to confer jurisdiction on a Federal court, and that where the only ground of Federal jurisdiction was the allegation that defendant's claim of title was based in part on certain acts of the legislature of the state, which attempted to transfer to it, as alleged, the title held by complainant's grantors at the time of their passage, the court would not retain jurisdiction when an answer was filed by defendant denying the allegations, and disclaiming any title or claim of title not held by it before the passage of the acts. The bill was dismissed, and we affirmed the judgment.\n We there cited, among other cases, Phillips v. Mound City Land & Water Asso. \n124 U.S. 605\n, 31 L. ed. 588, 8 Sup.Ct.Rep. 657, and Robinson v. Anderson, \n121 U.S. 522\n, 30 L. ed. 1021, 7 Sup.Ct.Rep. 1011. In the one case it was adjudged, as stated in the syllabus, that 'an adjudication by the highest court of a state that certain proceedings before a Mexican traibunal prior to the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo were insufficient to effect a partition of a tract of land before that time granted by the Mexican government to three persons who were partners, which grant was confirmed by commissioners appointed under the provisions of the act of March 3, 1851 (9 Stat. at L. 631, chap. 41), 'to ascertain and settle the private land claims in the state of California,' presents no Federal question which is subject to review here.'\n In the other, that under the act of 1875 [18 Stat. at L. 740, chap. 137, U. S.Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 508], even if the complaint, standing by itself, made out a case of jurisdiction, it was taken away as soon as, when the answer came in, it appeared that defendants either disclaimed all interest in the \n\n[202 U.S. 313, 339]\n\u00a0\n land in question, or claimed title under, and not adverse to, that of plaintiff. See also Boston & M. Consol. Copper & S. Min. Co. v. Montana Ore Purchasing Co. \n188 \nU.S. 632, 643\n, 47 S. L. ed. 626, 633, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 434. There are the same disclaimers here as in the Crystal Springs Case, but, from what we have heretofore said, it will be seen that we are of opinion, in any aspect, that the bill was properly dismissed, and that the decree to that effect must be affirmed. \n\n\n\n","43":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDONES v.

After answer and proofs, the case came on for hearing, and on July 8, 1905, a decree was entered, reciting that nine of the twelve claims in the patent were good and valid, that three were invalid and void by reason of the fact that the patentee was not the original or first inventor or discoverer, that five of the nine valid claims had been infringed by the defendant, but the remaining four had not been. As to the claims held invalid and those found to have been not infringed, it was ordered that the bill of complaint be dismissed. As to the remaining five claims,-those held to be infringed,-it was ordered that the plaintiffs recover the gains, profits, savings, and advantages which the defendant had derived by reason of the infringement, and that the case be referred to a master to report the amount thereof, and also that an injunction issue against further infringement. On August 1, 1905, the defendant appealed from said decree to the court of appeals and filed its assignment of errors. On August 8 the plaintiffs also appealed to the circuit court of appeals and assigned as errors the rulings in the decree adverse to them. On January 3, 1906, this cross appeal of the plaintiffs was dismissed by the court of appeals, on the ground that it had no jurisdiction thereof. Thereupon the plaintiffs filed in this court this petition for a writ of mandamus, commanding the judges of the circuit court of appeals to take jurisdiction of said cross appeal, and to dispose of it simultaneously with the appeal of the defendant.\n Messrs. Louis Marshall, Arthur v. Briesen, and Walter D. Edmonds for petitioners. \n\n[201 U.S. 156, 158]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Robert N. Kenyon, Walter F. Rogers, and Jacob Steinhardt for respondent.\n\n\n[201 U.S. 156, 160]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n The decree entered by the circuit court was interlocutory, and not final. Barnard v. Gibson, 7 How. 650, 12 L. ed. 857; Humiston v. Stainthorp, 2 Wall. 106, 17 L. ed. 905, and cases cited in note; Estey v. Burdett, \n109 \nU.S. 633, 637\n, 27 S. L. ed. 1058, 1059, 3 Sup.

Rep. 590; Smith v. Vulcan Iron Works, \n165 U.S. 518\n, 41 L. ed. 810, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 407.\n Plaintiffs brought one suit upon a single patent. The findings of the circuit court that three of the twelve claims were invalid and that the remaining nine were valid, but that four of them had not been infringed by the defendant, did not break this one suit into twelve. They were a guide to the master in his ascertainment of the damages, and indicated the scope of the final decree.\n In the Federal courts no appeal can, as a general rule, be taken, except from a final decree. As said by Mr. Chief Justice Taney in Forgay v. Conrad, 6 How. 201, 205, 12 L. ed. 404, 406:\n'In this respect the practice of the United States chancery courts differs from the English practice. For appeals to the House of Lords may be taken from an interlocutory order of \n\n[201 U.S. 156, 161]\n\u00a0\n the Chancellor, which decides a right of property in dispute. . . . But the case is otherwise in the courts of the United States, where the right to appeal is by law limited to final decrees.' See also McLish v. Roff, \n141 \nU.S. 661, 665\n, 35 S. L. ed. 893, 894, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 118.\n\n In the latter case this was held persuasive against extending the right of review given by  5 of the circuit court of appeals act of March 3, 1891 (26 Stat. at L. 826, chap. 517, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 547), to other cases than those in which there was a final judgment or decree, although the word 'final' is omitted in some of the clauses of the section.\n By  7 of that act, however, an appeal was provided from certain interlocutory orders or decrees. That section has been twice amended. 28 Stat. at L. 666, chap. 96; 31 Stat. at L. 660, chap. 803, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 550. As it now stands it reads:\n'Sec. 7. That where, upon a hearing in equity in a district court or in a circuit court, or by a judge thereof in vacation, an injunction shall be granted or continued or a receiver appointed, by an interlocutory order or decree, in a cause in which an appeal from a final decree may be taken, under the provisions of this act, to the circuit court of appeals, an appeal may be taken from such interlocutory order or decree granting or continuing such injunction or appointing such receiver to the circuit court of appeals: Provided, That the appeal must be taken within thirty days from the entry of such order or decree, and it shall take precedence in the appellate court; and the proceedings in other respects in the court below shall not be stayed unless otherwise ordered by that court, or by the appellate court or a judge thereof, during the pendency of such appeal: Provided, further, That the court below may, in its discretion, require, as a condition of the appeal, an additional bond.'\n\n It will be noticed that the appeal is allowed from an interlocutory order or decree granting or continuing an injunction, that it must be taken within thirty days, that it is given precedence in the appellate court, that the other proceedings in the lower court are not to be stayed, and that the lower \n\n[201 U.S. 156, 162]\n\u00a0\n court may require an additional bond. Obviously that which is contemplated is a review of the interlocutory order, and of that only. It was not intended that the cause as a whole should be transferred to the appellate court prior to the final decree. The case, except for the hearing on the appeal from the interlocutory order, is to proceed in the lower court as though no such appeal had been taken, unless otherwise specially ordered. It may be true, as alleged by petitioners, that 'it is of the utmost importance to all of the parties in said cause that there shall be the speediest possible adjudication by the United States circuit court of appeals as to the validity of all of the claims of the aforesaid letters patent which are the subject-matter thereof.' But it was not intended by this section to give to patent or other cases in which interlocutory decrees or orders were made any precedence. It is generally true that it is of importance to litigants that their cases be disposed of promptly, but other cases have the same right to early hearing. And the purpose of Congress in this legislation was that there be an immediate review of the interlocutory proceedings, and not an advancement generally over other litigation.\n Petitioners rely mainly on Smith v. Vulcan Iron Works, \n165 U.S. 518\n, 41 L. ed. 810, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 407. In that case it was held that when an appeal is taken from an interlocutory order granting or continuing an injunction, the whole of the order is taken up, and the appellate court may (if, upon an examination of the record, as thus presented, it is satisfied that the bill is entirely destitute of equity) direct a dismissal, and is not limited to a mere reversal of the order granting or continuing the injunction. Take an ordinary patent case. If an injunction is granted by an interlocutory order and the order is taken on appeal to the circuit court of appeals, and that court is of opinion that the patent is, on its face, absolutely void, it would be a waste of time and an unnecessary continuance of litigation to simply enter an order setting aside the injunction and remanding the case for further proceedings. The direct and obvious way is to order \n\n[201 U.S. 156, 163]\n\u00a0\n a dismissal of the case, and thus end the litigation. And such is the scope of the opinion in that case. After noticing the general rule that appeals will not lie until after final decree, and that an order or decree in a patent case granting an injunction and sending the cause to a master for accounting is interlocutory only, and therefore not reviewable on appeal before the final decree in the case, it referred to the provision of  7, and said (p. 525, L. ed. p. 812, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 410):\n'The manifest intent of this provision, read in the light of the previous practice in the courts of the United States, contrasted with the practice in courts of equity of the highest authority elsewhere, appears to this court to have been, not only to permit the defendant to obtain immediate relief from an injunction, the continuance of which throughout the progress of the cause might seriously affect his interests, but also to save both parties from the expense of further litigation, should the appellate court be of opinion that the plaintiff was not entitled to an injunction because his bill had no equity to support it.'\n\n But nowhere in the opinion is it intimated that the plaintiff was entitled to take any cross appeal or to obtain a final decree in the appellate court. This view of the scope of  7 was reaffirmed in Mast, F. & Co. v. Stover Mfg. Co. \n177 \nU.S. 485, 494\n, 495 S., 44 L. ed. 856, 860, 861, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 708.\n It is suggested that, as to the claims held to be invalid and those held to be valid, but not infringed, the bill was dismissed; that thus, in fact, a final decree was entered which entitled the plaintiff to an appeal. Forgay v. Conrad, 6 How. 201, 205, 12 L. ed. 404, 406, and Hill v. Chicago & E. R. Co. \n140 U.S. 52\n, 35 L. ed. 331, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 690, are cited as authorities. In both these cases there were several defendants and the decrees were adjudged final only in respect to certain of the defendants. In the first the circuit court passed a decree declaring sundry deeds to be fraudulent and void and directing the lands and slaves therein mentioned to be delivered up to the complainant, and also directing one of the defendants named in the decree to pay him $11,000, and 'that the complainant \n\n[201 U.S. 156, 164]\n\u00a0\n do have execution for the several matters aforesaid, in conformity with law and the practice prescribed by the rules of the Supreme Court of the United States.' The court refused to dismiss the appeal, holding that, while the decree was not final in the strict technical sense of the term, yet, in view of the effect of the orders entered, and the fact that unless review was granted at once there might be irreparable injury, the decree must be regarded as final to that extent. At the same time it criticised the terms of the decree, said that the final orders should have been delayed until the master's report was received, and added, after its comments upon the procedure below (p. 206, L. ed. p. 406):\n'These remarks are not made for the purpose of censuring the learned judge by whom this decree was pronounced, but in order to call the attention of the circuit courts to an inconvenient practice into which some of them have sometimes fallen, and which is regarded by this court as altogether inconsistent with the objects and policy of the acts of Congress in relation to appeals, and at the same time needlessly burdensome and expensive to the parties concerned, and calculated, by successive appeals, to produce great and unreasonable delays in suits in chancery. For it may well happen that, when the accounts are taken and reported by the master, this case may again come here upon exceptions to his report, allowed or disallowed by the circuit court, and thus two appeals made necessary, when the matters in dispute could more conveniently and speedily and with less expense have been decided in one.'\n\n In the subsequent case of Beebe v. Russell, 19 How. 283, 15 L. ed. 668, in which the rule in reference to the finality of decrees was further considered, it was said, in explanation of the decision in the Forgay Case ( p. 287, L. ed. p. 669):\n'In Forgay's Case, it [the question] was made upon the decree given by the court below, and it was adjudged by this court to be final to give this court jurisdiction of it. But it was so, upon the ground that the whole merits of the controversy between the parties had been determined, that execution \n\n[201 U.S. 156, 165]\n\u00a0\n had been awarded, and that the case had been referred to the master merely for the purpose of adjusting the accounts. The fact is, the order of the court in that case for referring it to a master was peculiar, making it doubtful, if it could in any way control or qualify the antecedent decree of the court upon the whole merits of the controversy, or modify it in any way, except upon a petition for a rehearing.'\n\n In Hill v. Chicago & E. R. Co. \n140 U.S. 52\n, 35 L. ed. 331, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 690, there had been an order of dismissal in favor of some of defendants, together with a reference to a master of a separable controversy between the plaintiff and other parties, and the court observed (p. 54, L. ed. p. 332, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 691):\n'But there was no adjudication as to the payment of the amount to be ascertained by the master; that remained unsettled. It was, however, a severable matter from the other subjects of controversy, and did not affect their determination. The fact that it was not disposed of did not change the finality of the decree as to the defendants against whom the bill was dismissed; that amount, or to whom made payable, did not concern them. They were no longer parties to the suit for any purpose. The appeal from the subsequent decree did not reinstate them. All the merits of the controversy pending between them and the complainant were disposed of, and could not be again reopened except on appeal from that decree. As to the other parties, it remained to ascertain the amount of one item and to determine as to its payment.'\n\n But, as held in Hohorst v. Hamburg-American Packet Co. \n148 U.S. 262\n, 37 L. ed. 443, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 590, that rule does not apply to cases where the liability of the defendants is alleged to be joint; and, therefore, cannot to a case in which there is but a single defendant.\n The rule is discharged, and the application for a writ of mandamus is denied. \n\n\n\n","45":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFAIR HAVEN & W R. CO. v. CITY OF NEW HAVEN(1906)\nNo. 84\nArgued: Decided: December 3, 1906\n\n\n\n Messrs. George D. Watrous and Talcott H. Russell for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[203 U.S. 379, 380]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Leonard M. Daggett and E. P. Arvine for defendant in error.\n\n\n[203 U.S. 379, 381]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case involves the validity of an assessment of $36,879, against plaintiff in error, for the cost of paving between its tracks and for 1 foot on each side thereof. Plaintiff in error operates a double track electric railway through West Chapel street in New Haven.\n In pursuance of certain laws of the state the court of common council, through a contractor, caused the street to be \n\n[203 U.S. 379, 382]\n\u00a0\n paved with sheet asphalt. The work was begun in June, 1897, and completed in October or November of the same year. The city paid for the work, and, as provided by the statutes, assessed against plaintiff in error its proportion of the cost; to wit, $36,879. On appeal to the superior court for New Haven county, that court reduced the assessment to $5,823, and entered judgment against plaintiff in error for that sum.\n The learned judge of the superior court expressed the contentions of the parties and his conclusions as follows:\n'It is contended by the defendant that the assessment against the plaintiff is legal and valid under the act of 1895. Charter of New Haven, page 80.\n\n'It is contended by the plaintiff that the act of 1895 is repealed by the act of 1899, Special Laws of 1899, p. 181; and if it is not repealed, the act of 1895 is unconstitutional and void.\n\n'Inasmuch as I hold and rule that the act of 1895 is repealed by the act of 1899, it is unnecessary to pass upon the constitutionality of the former. The intention and effect of the latter act is to repeal the former. The last act covers the whole subjectmatter of assessments for benefits and damages arising from paved streets, and provides expressly for the assessments of benefits and damages for pavements already constructed in West Chapel street.\n\n'This conclusion entitles the plaintiff to relief from the assessment as laid by the amendment to the report of the bureau of compensation; and it is therefore ordered that the assessment be reduced to the sum of $5, 823, as recommended by the bureau of compensation.'\n\n And the judgment of the superior court recited:\n'The asphalt pavement in said street is not a direct benefit to the plaintiff or its property, but, on the other hand, is a direct damage to the plaintiff and its property, inasmuch as it largely increases the expense of repairing the roadway between the rails, and of general repairs to the track, ties, and structure of the railroad. The only benefit to the railroad is such as \n\n[203 U.S. 379, 383]\n\u00a0\n results from the general improvement to the locality by reason of such pavement tending to increase the population and traffic in that section of the city. Such benefit does not exceed the amount of $5,823.'\n\n Upon the appeal of the city the judgment was reversed by the supreme court of errors. 75 Conn. 442, 53 Atl. 960. On the return of the case to the superior court that court rendered judgment dismissing the application of plaintiff in error, and confirming and establishing the assessment of $ 36,879. The judgment was reversed by the supreme court of errors and the case remanded to the superior court, with directions to deduct from the assessment the cost of repair. In accordance with this direction the superior court deducted from the assessment the sum of $3,590.85, and confirmed the assessment less such deduction. This judgment was affirmed by the supreme court of errors.\n The statutes under which the street was paved and the assessment against plaintiff in error was made may be summarized as follows: Section 9 of the charter of plaintiff in error authorized the common council of the city to establish such regulations in regard to the railway as might be required for 'paving . . . in and along the street,' and the company was required to conform to the grades then existing or thereafter established. And it was provided that the company should 'keep that portion of the streets and avenues over which their road or way shall be laid down, with a space of 2 feet on each side of the track or way, in good and sufficient repair, without expense to the city or town of New Haven, or the owners of land adjoining said track or way.'\n It was provided ( 13) that the act might be altered, amended, or repealed at the pleasure of the general assembly.\n The charter was amended July 9, 1864, and the company was authorized to lay down its tracks and run its cars through Chapel street, subject to the prohibitions of the 9th section of its original charter.\n In 1893 a general law was passed applicable to all railways \n\n[203 U.S. 379, 384]\n\u00a0\n by  6 of which it was previded that every street railway was required to keep so much of the street or highway as is included within its tracks, and a space of 2 feet on the outer side of the outer rails, in repair, to the satisfaction of the authorities of the city, town, or borough which was bound by law to maintain such street or highway. More expensive material, however, was not to be required than that used on the other parts of the street, except, however, for a space of 1 foot on each side of each rail, unless a more expensive kind of material was required in the order permitting the original location of such railway. If the railway company did not make such repairs after notice, it was provided that the city might do so, and recover the expense thereof from the company. And it was provided that the act should be deemed an amendment to the charters of all existing railway companies.\n On July 1, 1895, an act was passed authorizing and empowering the court of common council of the city to issue bonds for the construction of permanent pavements, and providing that all pavements laid by authority of the act should be laid upon the grade of the street, and the city was empowered to collect the cost thereof from the owners of abutting land. The act contained the following provisions as to railways:\n'On all streets occupied by the track, or tracks, of any railway company or companies, said company or companies shall be assessed and shall severally pay to the city the cost of paving and repaving the full length, and 9 feet wide for each and every line of track of such railway or railways, now existing, or that may hereafter be laid in any street of said city.'\n\n By supplement to this act, passed in March, 1897, it was provided that, in estimating the cost of each square yard to be assessed, the entire cost of laying the pavement and the agreement to keep the pavement in repair for a period not exceeding fifteen years should be considered.\n An act passed, April 28, 1899, provided for an assessment \n\n[203 U.S. 379, 385]\n\u00a0\n upon the 'grand list' 1 mill on the dollar for the paving of streets, to be expended only for the original construction of pavements. There was a provision for the laying of benefits and damages, and a specification of limits of the assessment, varying with the kind of material used for paying. Assessment of benefits and damages for the pavement on certain streets and on West Chapel street were required to be laid in accordance with the provision of the act. Anyone aggrieved by the assessment was given the right of appeal to the superior court. The act was declared to be an amendment to the charter of the city, and acts inconsistent therewith were repealed. The liability of street railway companies under the general laws was preserved.\n The statutes and the assessments made under them are attacked by plaintiff in error as repugnant to the contract clause of the Constitution of the United States and the 14th Amendment.\n\n 1. \nThe contention that the assessment was unconstitutional, even though the act of 1895 is constitutional, was commented on by the supreme court of errors on the second appeal as follows:\n'Other claims new to the case are made, to the general effect that, as the street had been paved twenty-three years before, and the plaintiff had been assessed a portion of the cost thereof, and especially as the city had not shown the need of the new pavement as a means of repair, an unconstitutional use of the act would result if the present charge against the plaintiff was enforced. These claims have no foundation, either in the application or pleadings, and therefore have no standing in the case. We do not hesitate to say, however, without discussion, that in view of the pleadings, which did not put the defendant to the proof of the necessity of the new work as a means of repair and proper maintenance of the street, the facts indicated could not be held sufficient to accomplish the results claimed for them.' [77 Conn. 224, 58 Atl. 705.]\n\n Plaintiff in error contests this conclusion of the court, and \n\n[203 U.S. 379, 386]\n\u00a0\n insists that the claims were made on the first appeal of the case, and were overlooked by the court. It is questionable whether we may dispute the ruling of the supreme court of errors as to what the record in the case before it showed. But, granting we have such power, the record does not justify the assertion of plaintiff in error. A bill of exceptions was tendered by plaintiff in error to the superior court of certain claims and requests for rulings made by plaintiff in error, so that the questions arising thereon could be considered by the supreme court of errors in connection with those by the appeal of the city, and one of the claims was 'that the repavement, if required at all, could only be required when it was found to be a satisfactory, or the most satisfactory, method of repair, which did not appear in this case.'\n The bill of exceptions stated also that the court did not rule upon the requests, because it was of opinion that the act of 1895, so far as it affects the pavement in question, was repealed by the act of 1899, 'and therefore decided against said requests.' The court allowed the bill of exceptions, and expressed the reason as follows: 'Being of the opinion that some, at least, of the questions arising upon the above bill of exceptions will arise again if a new trial of this cause should be had, the above bill of exceptions is hereby allowed, and ordered to be made a part of the record.'\n But this does not militate with the ruling of the supreme court of errors, nor indicate that the court did not consider the claims and requests of plaintiff in error. The ruling was based upon the application or pleadings, and it is not contended that the court's view of the application or pleadings was erroneous. Indeed, on the return of the case to the superior court an application was made by plaintiff in error for leave to amend its application by adding six paragraphs, setting out the grounds indicated above and other grounds why the assessment was an unconstitutional exercise of the authority in terms conferred by the act of 1895. The motion was denied on the ground (1) that the court had no power to \n\n[203 U.S. 379, 387]\n\u00a0\n allow the amendment, and (2) that the amendment ought not, as a matter of discretion, to be allowed. The ruling was affirmed by the supreme court of errors. Justifying its ruling, the court denied that it thereby enforced a stringent rule of pleading, but said it enforced only the familiar one which confined the evidence to the matters pleaded, and that it was the duty of plaintiff in error to have made its application full enough to cover all the claims desired to be made.\n\n\n (2)\n It will be observed that the superior court ruled that the act of 1895 was repealed by the act of 1899, and that the latter act covered the whole subject-matter of assessment for benefits and damages accruing from paved streets, and provided expressly for the assessments of benefits and damages for pavements which had been constructed on West Chapel street. The supreme court of errors reversed the ruling and sustained the contention of the city that the assessment should be made under the act of 1895. The court said: 'This difference of view explains the situation disclosed by the case. The city bases its claim to the larger sum assessed by it upon the rule of recovery laid down in the act of 1895; the railway company claims to limit its liability at least to the smaller sum assessed by the court, upon the strength of the rule of assessment prescribed in the act of 1899, as interpreted by the court and accepted by the company.' And after the construction and discussion of the provision of the two acts the court said: 'The situation is, we think, susceptible of a simple explanation. The act of 1899 is to be taken in its natural meaning. Its provisions relating to assessments were intended to deal only with assessments of benefits and damages in favor of or against owners of land whose land adjoins the street in which the pavement is laid, by reason of some benefit or damage received affecting its value. The railway companies were not meant to be and are not to be regarded as within their scope. No change in the burden already upon them for the completed work was intended to be effected.' [75 Conn. 446, 450, 53 Atl. 962, 963.]\n So, deciding between the statutes, the court adjudged that \n\n[203 U.S. 379, 388]\n\u00a0\n the act of 1895 was constitutional, on the ground that it was a proper exercise of the police power of the state, and on the ground that the act was an exertion of the power reserved by the state of altering, amending, or repealing the charter of the railway company. If either ground is tenable the judgment must be affirmed. We will place our decision on the second ground, as being of more local character, and because the exercise of the power expressed only comes under our review in its excesses.\n We accept the decision of the supreme court of errors, that the statutes were intended as an exercise of the power of amendment reserved by the state, although plaintiff in error contends that such was not their intention. The court treated the question involved as primarily one on statutory construction, and 'best approached,' to use the language of the court, 'by an examination of the statutory situation,' and upon that examination pronounced its conclusion that 'the act of 1895 was in effect an amendment of the plaintiff's charter,' citing Bulkley v. New York & N. H. R. Co. 27 Conn. 479; New York & N. E. R. Co. v. Waterbury, 60 Conn. 1, 22 Atl. 439. Was such an amendment in excess of the power of the state? The limitation upon the power of amendment of charters of corporations has been defined by this court several times. It is said in one case that such power may be exercised to make any alteration or amendment in a charter granted that will not defeat or substantially impair the object of the grant or any rights which have vested under it, which the legislature may deem necessary to secure either the object of the grant or any other public right not expressly granted away by the charter. Holyoke Water- Power Co. v. Lyman, 15 Wall. 522, 21 L. ed. 140. In another case it was said that the 'alterations must be reasonable; they must be made in good faith, and be consistent with the scope and object of the act of incorporation. Sheer oppression and wrong cannot be inflicted under the guise of amendment or alteration.' Shields v. Ohio, \n95 U.S. 324\n, 24 L. ed. 359. Later cases have repeated these definitions. \n\n[203 U.S. 379, 389]\n\u00a0\n Sinking Fund Cases, \n99 U.S. 720\n, 25 L. ed. 502; Greenwood v. Union Freight R. Co. \n105 U.S. 13\n, 26 L. ed. 961; Close v. Glenwood Cemetery, \n107 U.S. 476\n, 27 L. ed. 412, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 267. In the Sinking Fund Cases, it was said that whatever regulations of a corporation could have been inserted in its charter can be added by amendment. All the cases are reviewed and their principles affirmed in Stanislaus County v. San Joaquin & K. River Canal & Irrig. Co. \n192 U.S. 201\n, 48 L. ed. 406, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 241, and water rates fixed by the board of supervisors of the county of Stanislaus under a law of the state sustained though the income come of the company was reduced from 1 1\/2 per cent per month to 6 per cent per annum.\n In the light of these cases let us examine what the statutes of Connecticut require of plaintiff in error. By its original charter (1862) plaintiff in error was required to keep the street between its tracks, with a space of 2 feet on each side of the tracks, in good and sufficient repair. In the amendment of the charter in 1864 this obligation was retained, and also in the public acts of 1893. In the act of 1895 the duty of paving and repaving was imposed on all railway companies. We shall assume, for the purpose of our discussion, that the duty to repair did not include the duty to pave and repave, although much can be said and cases can be cited against the assumption. Does the change and increase of burden upon the plaintiff in error come within the limitations upon the reserved power of the state? Has it no proper relation to the objects of the grant to the company or any of the public rights of the state? Can it be said to be exercised in mere oppression and wrong? All of these questions must be answered in the negative. The company was given the right to occupy the streets. It exercised this right first with a single track, and afterwards with a double track. Before granting this right the state certainly could have, and reasonably could have, put upon the company the duty of paving as well as of repairing. Such requirement would have been consistent with the object of the grant. It is yet consistent with the object of the grant. It is not imposed in sheer oppression and wrong, and the good faith of the \n\n[203 U.S. 379, 390]\n\u00a0\n state cannot be questioned. It is imposed in the exercise of one of the public rights of the state,-the establishment, maintenance, and care of its highways. The extent of this right is illustrated by West Chicago Street R. Co. v. Illinois, \n201 U.S. 506\n, 50 L. ed. 845, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 518, and cases cited.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","46":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFELTS v. MURPHY(1906)\nNo. 533\nArgued: Decided: March 12, 1906\n\n\n\n The appellant was indicted in the circuit court of Winnebago county, in the state of Illinois, for the crime of murder. He was tried at the January term of that court, held in 1905, found guilty, and sentenced to the penitentiary for his natural life. He made an application to the circuit court of Cook county for a writ of habeas corpus, after judgment upon the verdict had been entered, and that court denied the writ. He then made a like application to the supreme court of the state of Illinois, which was denied. The appellant says that he was unable to obtain a writ of error in the state court, because, as he avers, it would cost between $ 700 and $800 to print the record, and that he was absolutely penniless, except that he had a pension of some $24 a month. Hence he was unable to obtain any relief in the state courts.\n Subsequently the appellant applied by written petition to the United States circuit court for the northern district of Illinois, eastern division, for the same writ, to be directed to the warden of the Illinois state penitentiary, where the petitioner was confined \n\n[201 U.S. 123, 124]\n\u00a0\n under the judgment entered upon the verdict of guilty upon the trial of the indictment. The appellant alleged in his petition the foregoing facts, and also, among other things, that he was not guilty of the crime of which he was indicted and had been convicted. He further stated and described the circumstances in which the killing was done, and said that he had been set upon on a dark night by some one unknown to him, who came upon him from behind and grasped him by the neck and almost broke it as he ran him about in the dark; that his neck was very badly hurt in the struggle and marks were left upon it visible for days thereafter. In the struggle the person was killed and the petitioner was subsequently convicted of his murder. The petitioner is a veteran of the Civil War, and lost his hearing in the line of his duty as a soldier, and is now between sixty and seventy years of age. He is so deaf that he can only hear when a person speaks into the mouthpiece of his ear trumpet, close to his ear.\n He alleged in his petition that, upon the trial of the case, he did not hear one single word of the examination of the jurors, either by the state's attorney or by his own counsel; that he did not hear the names of the jurors nor their business, and could not confer intelligently with his counsel as to the advisability of acceptance or rejection of a juror, and, as a matter of fact, he was not consulted and did not know the facts elicited by the examination of the jurors before acceptance; that if he had known the facts as they occurred he would have counseled the rejection of certain jurors on account of their relationship to other people; that he did not hear or have communicated to him, in any way, the evidence of the witnesses on the trial of his case, and that he was unable to suggest to his counsel any questions for their examination or cross-examination during the trial, and that the substance of their evidence was not communicated to him, and he did not know what it was until he saw some partial reports of it in the newspapers, when it was too late to suggest to his counsel proper cross-questions; that the first thing communicated to him after the beginning of the \n\n[201 U.S. 123, 125]\n\u00a0\n trial, which lasted about two weeks, was the verdict; he was in the court room, with his ear trumpet, but was unable to hear the verdict, and did not know what the verdict was until the clerk of the court wrote it upon a piece of paper and gave it to him.\n He was present in the court room during the motion for a new trial, but did not hear a word that was said by either counsel, and the only thing communicated to him was when he was called to the bar to be sentenced.\n The record shows that after the motion for a new trial had been made, the court said: 'On reviewing the entire case I am disposed to say that the motion for a new trial be overruled.' Continuing, the court said:\n It is regretted in one sense that the defendant, on account of his infirmity, is unable to know clearly what has been done. He should be informed, I suppose, of the fact that his motion for a new trial has been overruled. Mr. Sheriff, will you bring Mr. Felts forward? I wish you would say to Mr. Felts that his motion for a new trial has been overruled.\n The Sheriff: The court wishes me to tell you that motion for a new trial is overruled. Do you understand?\n Felts: I understand; yes.\n The Court: You may ask him if he has anything to say why sentence of the court should not now be pronounced.\n The Sheriff: Have you anything to say why the sentence of the court should not be pronounced?\n Felts: False swearing is all I got to say.\n Court: Well, under the circumstances, of course, it is practically impossible for me to say anything to this defendant.\n (Here follows the sentence of the court), which sentence was transmitted to the defendant by the sheriff through a tube.\n The record shows that the appellant was himself examined as a witness on his trial and had the benefit of counsel, who appeared for and defended him upon such trial.\n He contended before the Federal circuit court, on his application \n\n[201 U.S. 123, 126]\n\u00a0\n for the writ of habeas corpus, that, on account of the manner in which he was tried, his constitutional rights had been denied him, and that his conviction was without due process of law within the meaning of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and that he was entitled, therefore, to be discharged from imprisonment under the judgment. He also urged that the same was void, as being rendered without jurisdiction, on account of the violation of his constitutional rights. The circuit court denied the application for the writ, and from the order denying the same the appellant has appealed to this court.\n Mr. William E. Mason for appellant. \n\n[201 U.S. 123, 127]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Harry B. North, William H. Stead, and Edgar Eldredge for appellee. \n\n[201 U.S. 123, 128]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Peckham, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The uncontradicted facts are that this unfortunate man has been convicted of the crime of murder and sentenced to imprisonment for life, although he did not hear a word of the evidence that was given upon his trial, because of his almost total deafness, his inability to hear being such that it required a person to speak through his ear trumpet, close to his ear, in order that such person should be heard by him. \n\n[201 U.S. 123, 129]\n\u00a0\n Counsel for the appellant has cited in his brief cases regarding the mode of procedure which has been sometimes adopted where, from the condition of mind of the individual to be tried, it was doubtful if he were able to understand or comprehend the proceedings of the trial, and it may well be that such a method might properly have been adopted in this case. But upon this writ the question for our determination is simply one of jurisdiction. If that were not lacking at the time of the trial, and if it continued all through, then the application for the writ was properly denied by the circuit court, and its order must be affirmed. The writ cannot perform the function of a writ of error. Ex parte Bigelow, \n113 U.S. 328\n, 20 L. ed. 1005, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 542; Re Lennon, \n166 \nU.S. 548, 552\n, 41 S. L. ed. 1110, 1112, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 658; Re Eckart, \n166 U.S. 481\n, 41 L. ed. 1085, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 638.\n In this case the state court had jurisdiction both of the subject- matter and of the person upon the trial of the accused, and such jurisdiction was not lost during his trial, but continued to its end, and it had jurisdiction to direct the judgment which was entered, and to have the same executed. If there were any irregularities in the trial of the appellant, because of the failure of the court to see to it that the testimony in the case was repeated to him through the ear trumpet which he had with him, it was at most an error, which did not take away from the court its jurisdiction over the subject-matter and over the person of the accused. The appellant was not deprived of his liberty without due process of law by the manner in which he was tried, so as to violate the provisions of the 14th Amendment to the Federal Constitution. That amendment, it has been said by this court, 'did not radically change the whole theory of the relations of the state and Federal governments to each other, and of both governments to the people.' Re Kemmler, \n136 \nU.S. 436, 448\n, 34 S. L. ed. 519, 524, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 930; Brown v. New Jersey, \n175 \nU.S. 172, 175\n, 44 S. L. ed. 119, 120, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 77.\n We are unable to see how jurisdiction was lost in this case by the manner of trial. The accused was compos mentis. No claim to the contrary is made. He knew he was being tried on account of the killing of the deceased. He had counsel, and understood the fact that he was on trial on the indictment mentioned, \n\n[201 U.S. 123, 130]\n\u00a0\n but he did not hear the evidence. He made no objection, asked for nothing, and permitted his counsel to take his own course. We see no loss of jurisdiction in all this and no absence of due process of law. It is to be regretted that the testimony was not read or repeated to him. But that omission did not affect the jurisdiction of the court.\n Upon the point that the failure to have repeated to the appellant the testimony given on the trial caused the court to lose jurisdiction, the case of Re Nielsen, \n131 U.S. 176\n, 33 L. ed. 118, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 672, is cited by appellant. We think it plain that the case does not substantiate the contention. The sentence imposed in this case was held by this court to have been beyond the jurisdiction of the trial court to pronounce, because it was against the express provisions of the Constitution, which bounds and limits all jurisdiction; but we are entirely clear that in this case the trial was so conducted that there was not at any time any lack of jurisdiction in the court, and that the most that can be urged is that there might have been an error committed by the trial court in omitting to have the evidence repeated to the appellant as it was given by the witnesses at the trial, even though no demand of the kind was made by petitioner or his counsel.\n Although the conviction and punishment of the appellant under the facts appearing on this record may seem to be somewhat hard, yet this court has no jurisdiction to grant the relief asked for.\n The order of the Circuit Court refusing the writ was right, and is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","47":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFERNANDEZ Y PEREZ v. PEREZ Y FERNANDEZ(1906)\n\nArgued: April 29, 1904Decided: April 23, 1906\n\n\n\n [Messrs. An action at law was begun November 18, 1901, in the United States district court for the district of Porto Rico by the defendant in error, Jos e Perez y Fernandez, against Jos e Antonio Fernandez y Perez, to recover in an action for 'trespass upon the case for wrongful attachment.' The declaration contained the usual averments of a declaration in a common- law action and averred that the attachment had been issued maliciously \n\n[202 U.S. 80, 81]\n\u00a0\n and without probable cause, and levied upon a certain two-story house then belonging to the defendant in error, in Mayaguez, Porto Rico. One Rafael Diaz Aguerria was made codefendant, and it was averred that the attachment was issued in a suit brought by Fernandez as attorney in fact and agent of Aguerria, who authorized and ratified the acts complained of. It appeared that the defendant in error, Perez, had owed about 6,000 pesos to one Claudio Barro, who died, leaving a will in which Rafael Diaz Aguerria was named as executor. The will was probated in Spain, and Aguerria qualified there as executor of the estate. Perez, on November 10, 1899, recorded a mortgage in favor of one Don Victor Ochoa y Perez for 20,000 pesos. The suit in which the attachment was issued was begun January 2, 1900, by the filing of a declaration to recover on certain notes, and was brought in the name of Aguerria as executor of the last will and testament of Claudio Barro. The action was begun in the military court established by the authority of the United States after the cession of Porto Rico, called the United States provisional court for the department of Porto Rico, which court was succeeded by the United States district court. On the date of the beginning of the suit an affidavit for attachment was filed, which was sworn to by Fernandez, plaintiff in error, purporting to have the power of attorney of Rafael Diaz Aguerria, executor of the last will and testament of Claudio Barro, the ground alleged being that the affiant had reason to believe that the defendant intended to and would fraudulently part with or conceal his property before judgment could be recovered against him, so that the judgment could not be satisfied out of the property. The summons was issued, and a writ of attachment was levied upon the premises of the defendant in error, and notice posted thereon. Further proceedings were arrested by an injunction proceeding in the United States court, brought by Jacinto Perez Barro, heir of Claudio Barro, deceased, upon the ground that Aguerria, plaintiff in the attachment proceeding, suing as executor of the will probated in Spain, had not taken out ancillary letters in \n\n[202 U.S. 80, 82]\n\u00a0\n Porto Rico. The action for malicious attachment was joint in form and the summons was returned as to Aguerria that the marshal was unable to find him within his district. The declaration averred that he was a resident of Porto Rico, but he was never served with summons in this case. Fernandez demurred to the declaration, averring that it appeared on its face that he was acting as the duly authorized agent of Aguerria, and was neither principal nor party plaintiff to the action against Perez, the defendant in error. This demurrer was overruled, and no exception taken to such action by Fernandez. Afterwards the general issue was filed, the case was tried to a jury without objection, and upon charge of the court substantially leaving to the jury the question whether Fernandez had caused the attachment to issue and be levied maliciously and without probable cause, to the injury of the standing and credit of the defendant in error as a merchant. A verdict was returned in favor of the defendant in error for the sum of $7,000, upon which a motion for a new trial was overruled and judgment entered.\n James S. Harlan and John Maynard Harlan for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[202 U.S. 80, 85]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Frederic D. McKenney, Francis H. Dexter, and Wayne MacVeagh for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[202 U.S. 80, 90]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Day, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case was argued orally and upon briefs at the October term, 1904, of this court. After the case had been argued \n\n[202 U.S. 80, 91]\n\u00a0\n and submitted, on December 5, 1904, an order was entered as follows:\n'No. 6. Jos e Antonio Fernandez y Perez, Plaintiff in Error v. Jos e Perez y Fernandez. Counsel are requested to submit additional briefs on these points:\n\n'1. Can this court, on the record of this case, properly consider and determine the contention of the plaintiff in error, that a civil action like the present one was, at the date of the attachment and the commencement of this action, unknown to and unauthorized by the laws and jurisprudence of Porto Rico?\n\n'2. Was a civil action like the present one known to the laws and jurisprudence of Porto Rico at the time the attachment in question was sued out?\n\n'3. Under the law of civil procedure as existing in Porto Rico at the time of the attachment proceeding complained of, could the damages herein claimed have been allowed or assessed in that proceeding upon the dissolution or discharge of the attachment? If so, was that mode exclusive of every other for ascertaining such damages?'\n\n Our views in this case will be practically in answer to these questions.\n The case affords a striking illustration of the difficulty of undertaking to establish a common-law court and system of jurisprudence in a country hitherto governed by codes having their origin in the civil law, where the bar and the people know little of any other system of jurisprudence. The action in this case was begun and tried upon pleadings and under principles which are controlling in a state following the common law, having its origin in England, and the case was submitted to the jury upon general principles governing such actions for the recovery of damages for the seizure of property upon writs of attachment issued maliciously and without probable cause. The action proceeded in all respects in form and substance as it would had it been begun and prosecuted in a common-law state.\n Cases which have come to this court from the Philippines and Porto Rico, where we have had occasion to consider the \n\n[202 U.S. 80, 92]\n\u00a0\n enactments making changes in the laws of those islands, show the disposition of the Executive and Congress not to interfere more than is necessary with local institutions, and to engraft upon the old and different system of jurisprudence established by the civil law only such changes as were deemed necessary in the interest of the people, and in order to more effectually conserve and protect their rights.

President's Message, Dec. 5, 1899; Walton, Civil Law in Spain & Spanish America, 594. The new civil government was established by the act of April 12, 1900, commonly known as the Foraker act. 31 Stat. at L. 77, chap. 191. Section 8 of that act provides: 'That the laws and ordinances of Porto Rico now in force shall continue in full force and effect, except as altered, amended, or modified hereinafter, or as altered or modified by military orders and decrees in force when this act shall take effect, and so far as the same are not inconsistent or in conflict with the statutory laws of the United States not locally inapplicable, or the provisions hereof, until altered, amended, or repealed by the legislative authority hereinafter provided for Porto Rico or by act of Congress of the United States.'\n The first inquiry, then, to which we shall direct attention, concerns the law in force at the time of the passage of this act in Porto Rico, governing the issuing of attachments and the recovery of damages for wrongfully causing the same to issue and be levied. The additional briefs filed by counsel upon both sides in this case since the order of the court of December 5, 1904, above quoted, exhibit commendable zeal and industry in investigating this question and bringing to the attention of the court of Spanish treatises and cases throwing light upon the subject. Upon behalf of the defendant in error it is insisted that the action is governed by article 1902 of the Civil Code of Porto Rico, which provides: 'Art. 1902. A person who, by an act or omission, causes damage to another when there is fault or negligence, shall be obliged to repair the damage so done.' \n\n[202 U.S. 80, 93]\n\u00a0\n War Department Translation of the Civil Code in force in Duba, Porto Rico, and the Philippines, p. 244. Much discussion is had in the briefs as to the meaning of this section, and whether the term 'fault'-culpa in the Spanish jurisprudence-is broad enough to include actions brought to recover for conduct which is alleged as malicious, as distinguished from those where the basis of the recovery is a careless act or omission which does not have for its motive the intention to cause damage.\n In the view we take of this case we do not find it necessary to consider the authorities cited, or the views pressed pro and con as to whether a malicious act, such as is complained of in this case, is within the terms of this article of the Code. The references to sections of the Code of Procedure show a comprehensive system specially provided for the issuing of attachments and the recovery of damages where the same were wrongfully procured to be allowed. The subject of attachment of property is treated in title 14, Law of Civil Procedure, War Department translation, art. 1395 et seq. Unlike ordinary American procedure, an attachment is issued by order of the judge, and certain grounds are recognized. They are summarized as follows: 'If the debtor be a foreigner; or if, being a citizen, he has no known domicil, or does not own real estate, or does not have any place of business at which the payment of the debt may be demanded. It may also be ordered, without any such attendant condition, if he has disappeared from his home or place of business, leaving no one in charge or if he conceals himself, or if there be reasonable grounds for believing that he will conceal or undersell his property to the prejudice of creditors.' Art. 1398. If it shall turn out that the attachment was wrongfully procured, ample provisions are made for the adjudication and recovery of damages in the action. See articles 1409-1415, which are set forth in the margin. \n\n Art. 1409. A person who has requested and obtained a provisional seizure for an amount of more than 1,000 pesetas must request the ratification thereof in an executory action or in the declaratory action which may be proper, filing the corresponding complaint within twenty days after the levying of the attachment. Upon the expiration of this period without the action having been instituted or a ratification of the seizure having been requested, the latter shall be null de jure, and shall be without effect at the instance of the defendant, without the plaintiff being heard. A petition for a rehearing may be made against this ruling, and if it should not be granted, an appeal for a stay and review of the proceedings may be interposed. \n\n[202 U.S. 80, 94]\n\u00a0\n The theory of these sections of the Code is that when the court which issues the attachment is satisfied that the same has been wrongfully issued, it will proceed in the manner pointed out in the statute to ascertain the loss and damages \n\n[202 U.S. 80, 95]\n\u00a0\n which the defendant has suffered, and in the same action to tax the costs against the plaintiff and to adjudge him to indemnify the defendant for such losses and damages. And these losses and this recovery are adjudicated in the manner pointed out in articles 927 et seq. of the Code of Civil Procedure. These articles are found in title 8 of that Code, entitled 'Execution of Judgments.' The defendant in the attachment having been declared entitled to recover damages, proceedings follow for the purpose of asscertaining the amount thereof. Section 927 et seq. provide for the manner of making up an issue, taking testimony, and hearing witnesses, and, upon final order or decree made by the court, an appeal can be prosecuted. This full and comprehensive statutory method of ascertaining and adjudging the damages to be recovered in cases where attachments are wrongfully issued and vacated for any cause would seem to preclude the application of general provisions of the Code giving a right of recovery for acts of fault or negligence.\n We are not cited to any decision of the supreme court of Spain expressly adjudicating this matter, but are referred by counsel on both sides to a treatise on the law of civil procedure ('Commentario a la Ley de Enjuiciamiento Civil,' ed. 1891, p. 412), by Senor Jos e Maria Manresa v. Navarro, said to be a text writer of the highest authority in Spain. The English translation of his text is given as follows: 'We do not think that this rule [relating to independent actions for damages under the mortgage law] is applicable to attachments, because, on the motion to vacate an attachment, no discussion or proof of the \n\n[202 U.S. 80, 96]\n\u00a0\n existence of losses and damages is allowed, and because the law itself provides, in addition to this, that when, by final order of the court, an attachment is vacated, the plaintiff be adjudged to pay the defendant his losses and damages, they being ascertained in the manner provided in article 1417,1 that is, according to the procedure in article 928 et seq. Such a proceeding permits of a discussion, if the issue is made, not only of the amount, but of the existence, of losses and damages. It follows that the court can decide on both questions without the necessity of a new suit, which is precisely what the law has sought to avoid.' This seems to be a direct authority for the proposition that this plan of recovery of damages for wrongful attachments is exclusive. In the absence of authority to the contrary, and in view of the plain provisions of the Code, we accept it as properly declaring the existing law upon the subject. We reach the conclusion that the Porto Rican system in force at the time of the passage of the Foraker act, and binding until changed or amended, provided, in the state of affairs shown by this record, a recovery for damages in the method pointed out in the attachment suit, by the special statutory method provided for, and not otherwise.\n The difference between the liability of one wrongfully levying an attachment at common law and the assessments of costs and damages under these provisions of the Porto Rican Code is not one of form merely. The former action is substantially one for malicious prosecution, and can be maintained only upon proof of malice and want of probable cause. Under the Code remedies given in Porto Rico the court is required to assess damages, although malice or want of probable cause in suing out the attachment may not be expressly shown. The remedy given seems to cover all cases where the attachment is vacated, irrespective of the motive in suing it out.\n This brings us to briefly inquire as to the nature and extent of the jurisdiction and practice of the United States courts in Porto Rico. Section 34 of the Foraker act established a \n\n[202 U.S. 80, 97]\n\u00a0\n United States district court for Porto Rico, and gave to it, in addition to the ordinary jurisdiction of a district court of the United States, jurisdiction of all cases cognizant in the circuit courts of the United States, and provides that it shall proceed therein in the same manner as a circuit court, the intention of Congress obviously being to establish a United States court in Porto Rico, having like jurisdiction of both district and circuit courts of the United States in the states. Section 914 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 684) provides: 'The practice, pleadings, and forms and modes of proceeding in civil causes, other than equity and admiralty causes, in the circuit and district courts, shall conform, as near as may be, to the practice, pleadings, and forms and modes of proceeding existing at the time in like causes in the courts of record of the state within which such circuit or district courts are held, any rule of court to the contrary notwithstanding.' The act of August 13, 1888 (25 Stat. at L. 433, chap. 866, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 508), provides that the circuit courts of the United States shall have original jurisdiction concurrent with the courts of the several states in suits at common law and in equity. We think it was the intention of Congress in the Porto Rican act to require the district court exercising the jurisdiction of a circuit court, in analogy to the powers of the circuit courts in the states, to adapt itself, save in the excepted cases in equity and admiralty, to the local procedure and practice in Porto Rico. This conclusion is in accord with the policy of the United States, evidenced in its legislation, concerning the islands ceded by Spain, and secures to the people thereof a continuation of the laws and methods of practice and administration familiar to them, which are to be controlling until changed by law.\n In the Revised Statutes of the United States  915 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 684), it is provided as to attachments: 'In common-law causes in the circuit and district courts the plaintiff shall be entitled to similar remedies, by attachment or other process, against the property of the defendant, which are now provided by the laws of the state in which such court is held, for the courts thereof; \n\n[202 U.S. 80, 98]\n\u00a0\n and such circuit or district courts may, from time to time, by general rules, adopt such state laws as may be in force in the states where they are held in relation to attachments and other process: Provided, That similar preliminary affidavits or proofs and similar security, as required by such state laws, shall be first furnished by the party seeking such attachment or other remedy.' By analogy it would seem that the district court of Porto Rico, exercising the jurisdiction of a circuit court in its practice as to the issuing of attachments, is to adapt itself to the local practice recognized and established in Porto Rico. Circuit courts of the United States are not governed by any separate attachment law, but are required to administer the remedy in attachment provided in the laws of the state in which the courts are held. Bates v. Days, 17 Fed. 167.\n It is further objected on the part of the defendant in error that Porto Rican procedure can have no application to this action against Fernandez, because he was not a party plaintiff to the attachment suit, and the statute provides that the costs of the attachment and damages shall be assessed against the plaintiff in the action. We do not perceive that this fact affects the determination of the question as to the proper remedy in such cases. There is nothing in this action to show that Fernandez was not authorized to bring the suit and take out the attachment in behalf of the plaintiff in that suit, in which event Aguerria would be liable for the acts of his agent in that behalf. Nor is there any reason why Fernandez might not be made a party to the attachment proceeding if damages were to be assessed against him alone.\n It is further objected that the United States court has no method by which it can assess these damages in the manner required in the Porto Rican Code. In giving the remedies provided therein and assessing the damages we see no reason why that court cannot adapt itself to the requirements of the local Code and administer the remedies therein provided. In Madisonville Traction Co. v. Saint Bernard Min. Co. \n196 U.S. 239\n, 49 L. ed. 462, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 251, it was held \n\n[202 U.S. 80, 99]\n\u00a0\n that the Federal court might follow the methods required by the Kentucky statute in administering the local law for the condemnation of property, so far as required to meet the needs of justice. In that case the local law required the appointment of appraisers by the court to assess compensation for the property taken. Speaking of the judicial power of a circuit court of the United States administered in such courts, it was held: 'In the exercise of that power a circuit court of the United States, sitting within the limits of a state, and having jurisdiction of the parties, is, for every practical purpose, a court of that state. Its function, under such circumstances, is to enforce the rights of parties according to the law of the state, taking care, always, as the state courts must take care, not to infringe any right secured by the Constitution and the laws of the United States.' In view of the provisions of the Foraker act, continuing local laws in force, this reasoning has application to the powers of the United States court in that territory. There can be no difficulty in exercising the attachment remedies provided in the Porto Rican Code, if the attachment shall turn out to have been wrongfully issued, and making an assessment of damages in the manner provided in that Code. The procedure is simple and easily administered. Nor is there anything in that special procedure encroaching upon the right to a jury trial, secured by the Federal Constitution in suits at common law where the value in controversy exceeds $20. If it be assumed-a point which is not necessary to decide-that that part of the Constitution is applicable and in force in Porto Rico, the proceeding is not a suit at common law, but simply a method of ascertaining damages in a special proceeding in which property has been wrongfully seized.\n Nor would the general provisions of the Revised Statutes ( 648, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 525) providing for a jury trial as to issues of fact in circuit courts, except in cases of admiralty and equity jurisdiction, prevent the enforcement of the express provisions of the Porto Rican Code as to assessment for damages for wrongful attachment. \n\n[202 U.S. 80, 100]\n\u00a0\n Section 8 of the Foraker act, as we have seen, continues in force the laws and ordinances of Porto Rico, except as modified by military orders and decrees in force, so far as the same are not inconsistent or in conflict with the statutory laws of the United States, which, by  14 of the act, when not locally inapplicable, with certain exceptions, are declared to be in force and effect in Porto Rico as in the United States. The general provisions as to jury trials in civil causes in circuit courts of the United States are not inconsistent with the enforcement of a special statutory proceeding as to the assessment of damages in attachment proceedings, as to which the United States has no special statutory procedure, and enforces in that respect the requirements of the local law.\n If we are right in holding that the Porto Rican law and practice as to attachments and the recovery of damages in respect thereto are controlling in a Federal court in that territory, and a common-law action for a wrongful and malicious attachment was unknown to the Porto Rican procedure, the court had no jurisdiction of the action. The record shows that practically no exception was taken in the record and proceedings in the trial court, but it is familiar law that this court will, of its own motion, inquire into the jurisdiction which it has, and as well that of the court below, without any special exception being taken. If, as illustrated in the brief for counsel for the plaintiff in error, a circuit court of the United States should undertake to entertain a bankruptcy proceeding or an admiralty cause, its proceedings would be void for want of jurisdiction. So, in the present case, there being no such common-law action enforceable under the Porto Rican procedure, a court of that district would have no jurisdiction to entertain the suit. Where the jurisdiction fails the objection can be raised in this court; if not by the parties, then by the court itself. Parker v. Ormsby, \n141 U.S. 81\n, 35 L. ed. 654, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 912; Mansfield C. & L. M. R. Co. v. Swan, \n111 U.S. 379\n, 28 L. ed. 462, 4 Sup. Ct. Rep. 510; Thompson v. Central Ohio R. Co. 6 Wall. 134, 18 L. ed. 765.\n We, therefore, reach the conclusion that the United States \n\n[202 U.S. 80, 101]\n\u00a0\n district court had no jurisdiction of this action, and consequently the proceedings had therein were null and void.\n Judgment reversed.\n\n Mr. Justice White, dissenting:\n As it is conceded that the question upon which the judgment is now reversed was not saved in the court below, I am constrained to dissent. In my opinion the error, if any, was a mere question of mode of procedure, involving no want of jurisdiction ratione materioe, even conceding that the presence of a question of such a character would authorize this court to reverse, in the absence of any exception in the court below, or any reference to the question in that court.\n Mr. Justice McKenna concurs in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n Art. 1410. Notwithstanding the provisions of the foregoing article, if the debtor should be included in any of the cases of article 1398, the provisional seizure may also be ordered after the institution of the action, a separate record being made thereof. The provisions contained in articles 1399 to 1410, inclusive, shall be applicable to this case, and after the attachment has been levied the proceedings thereupon shall be continued as prescribed for incidental issues. When an attachment is vacated by a final ruling, because it is not included in any of the cases of said article 1398, the plaintiff shall be taxes all the costs and be adjudged to indemnify the defendant for any losses or damages he may have suffered, which shall be recovered in the manner prescribed in article 1415.\n Art. 1411. When the provisional seizure becomes of no effect by reason of its having become null de jure, in accordance with article 1409, the surety shall be ordered canceled in the same ruling, if any should have been furnished, or what may be proper shall be ordered for vacating the attachment and canceling the cautionary notice, in a proper case, and all costs shall be taxed against the plaintiff, who shall also be adjudged to indemnify the defendants for any losses and damages he may have incurred. If the attachment should be vacated for any other reason, the ruling thereupon shall also determine what may be proper according to the cases with regard to costs and the indemnification of losses and damages which may have been suffered.\n Art. 1412. If the acknowledgment of a signature or of the written evidence of a debt should not be made, or be delayed through the fault of the debtor, and if the filing of the complaint and the ratification of the attachment should depend thereupon, the time lost in obtaining said acknowledgment shall not be included in the period of time prescribed in article 1409.\n Art. 1413. If the owner of the property seized should request it, the attachment creditor must file his complaint within the period of ten days, unless any of the circumstances mentioned in the foregoing article is attendant. Should he not do so, the attachment shall be vacated, and the costs, losses, and damages shall be taxed against him.\n Art. 1414. After the provisional seizure has been levied the debtor may object thereto and request that it be vacated, with indemnification of losses and damages, if not included in any of the cases of article 1398. He may make this petition within the five days following that of the notice of the ruling ratifying the seizure, or before that time, if he should deem it proper, and it shall be heard and determined in a separate record, in accordance with the procedure prescribed for incidental issues.\n Art. 1415. In cases in which there is an adjudication of losses and damages, as soon as the ruling thereupon becomes final, they shall be recovered according to the procedure established in articles 927 et seq. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Porto Rican Code, art. 1415. \n\n\n\n\n","48":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFIDELITY MUT.

It also seeks to compel the plaintiff in the action at law, and other parties to whom interests in the policies were assigned, to repay the sums which they received upon them. The judgment was rendered in a case which came before this court, and the dramatic circumstances of the alleged death are set forth in the report. Fidelity Mut. Life Asso. v. Mettler, \n185 U.S. 308\n, 46 L. ed. 922, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 662. The appellant is the plaintiff in error in that case, having changed its name. After the date of the judgment the appellant discovered that Hunter, the party whose life was insured, was alive, and that the recovery was the result of a deliberate plot. Thereupon it forthwith brought this bill. One of the defenses set up and argued below and here was that, by the 7th Amendment to the Constitution, no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise re- examined in any court of the United States than according to the rules of the common law. On the facts alleged and proved the circuit court entered a decree against the plaintiff at law, Mettler, now Smythe, but dismissed the bill as against the assignees of partial interests in the policies. The insurance company appealed to this court.\n The material facts are these: By way of a contingent fee for the services in collecting the insurance, Mrs. Mettler assigned to the present defendant Clark and his partners one-third interest in the policies, with an additional sum in case statutory damages and attorney's fees were recovered. This afterwards came to Clark alone. Clark and Mrs. Mettler assigned $500 each, from their respective \n\n[203 U.S. 64, 73]\n\u00a0\n interests, to the defendant Culberson, as a contingent fee for argument and services in this court. Clark also employed the defendant Spoonts, it would seem, on a contingent fee. Finally he mortgaged his right to the Phillips Investment Company. When the judgment was recovered, before execution, the insurance company paid the amount ($24,028.25) into court. Out of this the clerk paid to Mrs. Mettler $11,616; to Clark, $8,346; to Spoonts on Clark's order, $1,500; to Culberson, $1,026; and to the Phillips Investment Company, $1,540.24. It is these sums, other than that paid to Mrs. Mettler, that are in question here.\n It will not be necessary to consider the constitutional question under the 7th Amendment, to which we have referred, or some other questions which were raised, because we are of opinion that the appellees are entitled to keep their money, even if the judgment can be impeached for fraud. They all got the legal title to the money which was paid to them, or, what is the same thing, got the legal title transferred to their order. That being so, the appellant must show some equity before their legal title can be disturbed. It founds its claim to such an equity on the mode in which the judgment which induced it to part with the title to its money was obtained. But fraud, of course, gives rise only to a personal claim. It goes to the motives, not to the formal constituents, of a legal transfer (Rodliff v. Dallinger, 141 Mass. 1, 6, 55 Am. Rep. 439, 4 N. E. 805), and the rule is familiar that it can affect a title only when the owner takes with notice or without having given value (Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch, 87, 133, 3 L. ed. 162, 177; 2 Wms. Vend. & P. 674. See The Eliza Lines, \n199 \nU.S. 119, 131\n, 50 S. L. ed. 115, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 8). The question is whether the appellant can make out such a case as that.\n It is said that the title of the appellees stands on the judgment, and that if the judgment fails the title fails. But that mode of statement is not sufficiently precise. The judgment hardly can be said to be part of the appellees' title. It simply afforded the appellant a motive for its payment into court. \n\n[203 U.S. 64, 74]\n\u00a0\n The appellees derive their title immediately from Mrs. Mettler, and remotely from the act of the appellant. They stand exactly as if the appellant had handed over the $24,000 in gold to her and she thereupon had handed their proportion to them. We are putting no emphasis on the fact that the thing transferred was money. The appellees knew from what fund they were paid, from what source it came, and why it was paid to Mrs. Mettler. We are insisting only that the title had passed to them. But we repeat that, as the title had passed, the appellant must find some equity before it can disturb it, and we now add that, as there is no question that the appellees took for value, that is, in payment for their services, or, if it be preferred, in performance of Mrs. Mettler's contingent promise, the equity must be founded upon notice.\n The notice to be shown is notice of the fact that the judgment which induced the appellant's payment was obtained by fraud. But notice cannot be established by the mere fact that, while the appellees held an interest in the policies only, they were assignees of choses in action, and took them subject to the equities. That is due to a chose in action not being negotiable. It does not stand on notice. The general proposition was decided in United States v. Detroit Timber & Lumber Co. \n200 \nU.S. 321, 333\n, 334 S., 50 L. ed. 499, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 282; and United States v. Clark, \n200 \nU.S. 601, 607\n, 608 S., 50 L. ed. 613, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 340; and earlier in Judson v. Corcoran, 17 How. 612, 615, 15 L. ed. 231, 232; and, we have no doubt, is the law of England. Of course, the assignee of an ordinary contract can only stand in the shoes of the party with whom the contract was made. In the discussions of the rule which we have seen we have found no other reason offered, as no other is necessary. But the assumption of the good faith of the assignee occurs in more cases than one.\n The principle which we apply is further illustrated by the priority given to the later of two equitable titles, if the legal title be added to it (2 Pom. Eq. Jur. 3d ed.  727, 768) by the doctrine of tacking, and, in some degree, by the great dis- \n\n[203 U.S. 64, 75]\n\u00a0\n tinction recognized in other respects between the holder of title under an executed contract and a party to a contract merely executory. See 1 Wms. Vend. & P. 540, and cases cited. We may add further that, even if we were wrong, the equities to which an assignee takes subject are equities existing at the time of the assignment (1 Wms. Vend. & P. 584), and that the notice with which he is supposed to be charged as assignee can be of nothing more. Therefore, merely as assignees, the appellees had not notice of the, as yet, unaccomplished fraud in obtaining the judgment. The policies were honest contracts, and it was an interest in the policies which was assigned, at least to Clark.\n The appellant is driven, therefore, to contend, as it did contend at the argument, that notice of the denial that Hunter was dead, in the suit on the policy, was notice of the fraud. But it is admitted that the appellees all acted in good faith; that they believed the plaintiff's case. In such circumstances, even if the answer had gone further, and had charged the plaintiff with all that the present bill charges against her, when a jury had decided that the charges were groundless, a judgment had been entered on the verdict, and the insurance company had accepted the result by paying the money into court without waiting for an execution, it would be impossible to say that the supposed notice was not purged. The appellees were not bound to contemplate future discoveries of what they honestly believed untrue, and a bill to impeach the final act of the law. See Bank of United States v.

STAAKE(1906)\nNo. 213\nArgued: Decided: April 30, 1906\n\n\n\n [Messrs. \n\n[202 U.S. 141, 142]\n\u00a0\n This writ of certiorari was allowed to review an order of the circuit court of appeals, affirming a decree of the district court in favor of Staake, as trustee in bankruptcy of the estate of Chester R. Baird, bankrupt, subrogating him to the rights of certain creditors, and authorizing him to enforce their attachment liens with like force and effect as the attaching creditors-one of which was the First National Bank of Baltimore-might have done had not the bankruptcy proceedings intervened.\n The facts of the case are substantially as follows: Chester R. Baird, doing business under the name of C. R. Baird & Company, and owning certain real estate in Virginia known as the West End Furnace Company, sold the same, December 7, 1899, to the Roanoke Furnace Company, subject to certain encumbrances, executed a contract in writing, and received from the furnace company the entire consideration, namely, $500,000, in the capital stock of the furnace company. Under this contract of sale the furnace company took immediate possession, but no deed to the company was made until November 5, 1900, when a deed was executed and recorded.\n Meantime, however, and on October 26, 1900, nine different attachments, among them one by the petitioning bank, were sued out of the hustings court for the city of Roanoke, amounting to over $40,000, against Baird as a nonresident, and were levied upon the furnace property. Under the provisions of the law of Virginia the attachments, having been levied before the deed of the furnace property had been executed and recorded, the attaching creditors acquired, as against Baird and the furnace company, a lien on the properties attached.\n Within four months after the levy of the attachments, namely, December 24, 1900, Baird was adjudicated a bankrupt in the district court for the eastern district of Pennsylvania, and on January 2, 1901, the district court for the western district of Virginia assumed ancillary jurisdiction of such property as was located in Virginia. On December 29, 1900, the Roanoke Furnace Company was also adjudicated a \n\n[202 U.S. 141, 143]\n\u00a0\n bankrupt. On March 26, 1901, Staake was appointed trustee of Baird's estate, and on June 29, 1901, John M. N. Shimer was appointed trustee of the Roanoke Furnace Company.\n It was further agreed that the deed of November 5, 1900, from Baird to the Roanoke Furnace Company, was a valid conveyance to a purchaser in good faith for a then fair consideration, and was not affected by the bankruptcy proceedings.\n The proceedings in question here were instituted by a petition filed by Staake, entitled both in the cases of Chester R. Baird and the Roanoke Furnace Company, averring that under the laws of Virginia the rights of the attaching creditors were superior to those of the furnace company, and that as to them the property attached was the property of Baird; but that, by reason of his insolvency and of the fact that these attachments had been levied within four months preceding the filing of the petition in bankruptcy, such attachments were null and void, unless the court should order them preserved for the benefit of the estate. He therefore prayed that they be decreed null and void as regards plaintiffs, but that they be preserved for the benefit of petitioner.\n The bank demurred to this petition, and also answered, denying that its attachment was null and void, and also denying the right of the court to enter an order preserving the attachment for the benefit of the petitioner; and alleging that respondent is entitled to the benefit of the attachment, said property when sold by an interlocutory order having realized enough to pay said attachment, as well as all prior liens.\n Shimer, trustee for the Roanoke Furnace Company, also answered, praying that, if the attachment be continued for the trustee of Baird, the petitioner should be required to abate a large claim which he filed against the estate of the Roanoke company, by the amount of said attachments.\n Upon a hearing before the district court, that court overruled the demurrer to Staake's petition, and authorized him to enforce the attachment liens for the benefit of the estate. \n\n[202 U.S. 141, 144]\n\u00a0\n 126 Fed. 845.

Hamilton Graves, William Gordon Robertson, Holmes Conrad, E. W. Robertson, and Abram P. Staples for petitioner.\n Messrs. Arthur G. Dickson, John Dickey, Jr., S. Griffin, M. Griffin, and H. Gordon McCouch for respondent.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Brown:\n\n Mr. Justice Brown delivered the opinion of the court:\n At the time these attachments were levied, the title to the property in question stood in the name of Baird, and the attaching creditors, by their levies, secured a preferential lien upon the property, not only as against Baird, but also as against the furnace company, which received a deed to the property November 5, 1900, after the attachments had been levied. These attachments, however, were annulled by the filing of a petition in bankruptcy against Baird within four months after the attachments were levied, and if the case stood upon this fact alone there could be no doubt that the property would pass to the trustee of the furnace company, discharged of the lien of the attachments. We are not concerned here with any conflicting rights of the two trustees, Staake and Shimer, since they were both appointed receivers of the Roanoke Furnace Company, and the only claim made by Shimer now is that, if the attachments be continued, the petitioner Staake be required to abate his claim against the \n\n[202 U.S. 141, 145]\n\u00a0\n estate of the furnace company by the amount of these attachments. It is therefore unnecessary to consider whether, if the attachments were annulled, the property would pass unencumbered to the trustee of the furnace company, since, as stated by the district judge, the demurrer to the petition is intended merely to raise the question whether the trustee of Baird's estate or the attaching creditors shall have the benefit of the attachments.\n This depends upon the peculiar terms of  67 of the bankrupt act, which provides as follows:\n'Sec. 67f. That all levies, judgments, attachmants, or other liens obtained through legal proceedings against a person who is insolvent, at any time within four months prior to the filing of a petition in bankruptcy against him, shall be deemed null and void in case he is adjudged a bankrupt, and the property affected by the levy, judgment, attachment, or other lien shall be deemed wholly discharged and released from the same, and shall pass to the trustee as a part of the estate of the bankrupt, unless the court shall, on due notice, order that the right under such levy, judgment, attachment, or other lien shall be preserved for the benefit of the estate; and thereupon the same may pass to and shall be preserved by the trustee for the benefit of the estate as aforesaid. And the court may order such conveyance as shall be necessary to carry the purposes of this section into effect: Provided, That nothing herein contained shall have the effect to destroy or impair the title obtained by such levy, judgment, attachment, or other lien, of a bona fide purchaser for value who shall have acquired the same without notice or reasonable cause for inquiry.'\n\n Section 67c, which also treats of liens created by attachments on mesne process, and provides for their dissolution, in the last clause declares that-'if the dissolution of such lien would militate against the best interests of the estate of such person, the same shall not be dissolved, but the trustee of the estate of such person, for the benefit of the state, shall be subrogated to the rights of the \n\n[202 U.S. 141, 146]\n\u00a0\n holder of such lien, and empowered to perfect and enforce the same in his name as trustee, with like force and effect as such holder might have done had not bankruptcy proceedings intervened.' [30 Stat. at L. 564, 565, chap. 541, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 3449, 3450.]\n This section (67f) makes two distinct provisions for the disposition of the property of an insolvent attached within four months prior to the filing of a petition in bankruptcy against him. First, such attachments shall be declared null and void, and the property affected shall be deemed released, and shall pass to the trustee of the estate of the bankrupt; or second, the court may order that the right acquired by the attachment shall be preserved for the benefit of the estate. In the first case the whole property passes free from the attachment. In the second, so much of the value of the property attached as is represented by the attachments passes to the trustee for the benefit of the entire body of creditors; that is, 'for the benefit of the estate,'-in other words, the statute recognizes the lien of the attachment, but distributes the lien among the whole body of creditors.\n The first provision contemplates the attachment of property to which the bankrupt has the complete, legal, and equitable title, which, as soon as the attachment is dissolved, passes at once to the bankrupt's trustee as part of his estate. The second provision evidently does not apply to this, as there is no object in preserving the lien of the attachment for the benefit of the estate, since, under the first clause, the entire value of the property attached passes to the trustee, free from the attachment. The second clause contemplates property in which the bankrupt has an interest which has been secured to attaching creditors by the levy of the writ, but which might have passed to another person, as, for instance, a purchaser under an unrecorded deed, but for the fact that the attaching creditors had acquired a prior lien thereon. In such case the statute recognizes the validity of the lien, but preserves it for the benefit of the entire body of creditors, by reason of the fact that the attachment was dissolved as a preferential lien \n\n[202 U.S. 141, 147]\n\u00a0\n in favor of the attaching creditors, by the institution of proceedings in bankruptcy.\n In the present case Baird had contracted to convey the property to the Roanoke Furnace Company, possession had been taken, and the consideration paid, but the deed was not actually executed and recorded until after the attachment had been levied. Hence, under the Virginia statute, the validity of which is not questioned, the lien of the attachment took precedence of the deed, and would have remained a prior lien, had it not been for the institution of the bankruptcy proceedings within four months. This dissolved the attachment, and, had the case rested here, the property would have apparently passed to the furnace company, or to its trustee in bankruptcy, Shimer; but at this point the court, under the second proviso of  67f, interposed and recognized the lien of the attachment; not, however solely for the benefit of the attaching creditors, but for the benefit of Baird's estate. Shimer made no objection, and the court declined to express an opinion as to his rights.\n This is one of the very contingencies provided for by the second clause of the section, which apparently vests in the court a certain discretion with regard to the preservation of the right acquired under the attachment or other lien. In this case the court recognized the validity of the lien, the trustee of the furnace company making no objection to this; but the attaching creditors imsist that, as the lien was acquired for their own benefit, they should not be required to share with the general creditors of Baird's estate.\n Their argument is based upon the theory that the second clause was not intended to apply to liens acquired upon the estate of third parties, but to property which would have passed to Baird's trustee had the attachment not been levied. In other words, that the bankruptcy court has nothing to do with the property, since it really did not belong to the bankrupt, and would have passed to his vendee if the attachments had not been levied upon it. Indeed, the opinion especially \n\n[202 U.S. 141, 148]\n\u00a0\n finds that 'had valid attachments not been levied, the property would have passed to the trustee of the Roanoke Furnace Company.'\n To what extent liens obtained by prior judicial proceedings shall be recognized is a matter wholly within the discretion of Congress. It might have validated all such liens, even though obtained the day before proceedings were instituted. It might probably have invalidated all such liens whenever obtained. It took a middle course, and invalidated all liens obtained through legal proceedings within four months prior to the filing of the petition, but at the same time preserved to the general body of creditors, as against third parties (such as purchasers under an unrecorded deed), such liens as attaching creditors had secured upon property which would have passed to the subsequent purchaser in case the attachment had not been levied. It is true that the attaching creditors are thereby deprived of the fruits of their diligence, but the same thing would have happened had the attachment been levied upon property to which the bankrupt had the whole and undisputed title, or of which he had made a fraudulent conveyance. As remarked by the district judge, 'In cases where the bankrupt makes a valid conveyance, or where his fraudulent vendee makes a valid conveyance, the purpose of the law is worked out by preserving and enforcing the liens of the attaching creditors for the pro rata benefit of all the creditors.' [126 Fed. 847.]\n Section 67f is merely carrying out the general purposes of the act, of securing to the creditors the entire property of the bankrupt, reckoning as part of such property liens obtained by attaching creditors against real estate which had been transferred to another, though no deed had been actually executed and recorded.\n The argument that  67f in question here refers only to liens upon property which, if such liens were annulled, would pass to the trustee of the bankrupt, we think is unsound, since that contingency is amply provided for by the prior clause of the section annuling all such liens and providing \n\n[202 U.S. 141, 149]\n\u00a0\n that property affected thereby shall pass to the trustee as a part of the estate. Under the argument of the attaching creditors in this case, the subsequent clause would be entirely unnecessary. This clause evidently contemplates that attaching creditors may acquire liens upon property which would not pass to the bankrupt if the liens were absolutely annulled, and therefore recognizes such liens, but extends their operation to the general creditors. Had no proceedings in bankruptcy been taken, doubtless this property would have been sold for the benefit of the attaching creditors.\n The general rule relied upon by the bank in this case, that the words 'property of the bankrupt' mean only the property to which the bankrupt is beneficially entitled, and do not include property to which he has only a bare legal title, is perhaps justified by our decision in Hewit v. Berlin Mach. Works, \n194 U.S. 296\n, 48 L. ed. 986, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 690. But the extent to which the bankruptcy court shall recognize the rights obtained by creditors upon property attached as the property of the bankrupt, though in fact such property had been conveyed by an unrecorded contract, is a matter solely within the discretion of Congress. The liens acquired in this case were liens upon property which, as to attaching creditors, was the property of the bankrupt, and Congress may lawfully insist that it shall be reckoned as a part of his estate, and pass to the trustee. As remarked by the court of appeals: 'The rule that the trustee takes the estate of the bankrupt in the same plight as the bankrupt held it is not applicable to liens which, although valid as to the bankrupt, are invalid as to creditors.' [66 C. C. A. 550, 133 Fed. 720.]\n If the interest of Baird in this property were sold solely for the benefit of the attaching creditors, it would obviously result in a preference to those creditors over the general creditors of his estate, and in fraud of the bankruptcy act, which is designed to secure equality among all creditors.\n The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","50":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFIRST NAT BANK OF OTTAWA v. CONVERSE(1906)\nNo. 176\nArgued: Decided: February 19, 1906\n\n\n\n\n[200 U.S. 425, 426]\n\u00a0\n For brevity, the plaintiff in error will be hereafter referred to as the bank and the defendant in error as the receiver.\n The receiver commenced this action against the bank in the circuit court of the United States for the northern district of Illinois. The object of the action was to recover from the bank, as the owner of 274 shares of preferred stock in the Minnesota Thresher Manufacturing Company, the amount of an assessment of $18 per share, levied upon said stock for the payment of the debts of the thresher company. A demurrer to an amended declaration having been overruled, and the bank electing not to plead further, judgment was entered for the receiver, and, on account of constitutional questions raised by the demurrer, the case was brought directly to this court.\n The averments of the amended declaration may be summarized as follows: In May, 1884, the Northwestern Manufacturing & Car Company was a corporation engaged in the manufacturing business at Stillwater, Minnesota. At the date mentioned the car company owed a large amount which it was unable to pay, among which was a sum due to the bank for money lent. In that month a receiver was appointed for the car company by a court of the state of Minnesota having jurisdiction. Some time afterwards, in November, 1884, the bank with other creditors, and some of the stockholders of the car company, organized, under the laws of Minnesota, a new corporation, styled the Minnesota Thresher Manufacturing Company. The articles of incorporation of the new company provided 'that the objects for which said corporation was formed were the purchase of the capital stock, evidences of indebtedness issued by and the assets of the Northwestern Manufacturing & Car Company, a corporation existing under the laws of the state of Minnesota, or any portion of said capital stock, evidences of indebtedness or assets, and the manufacture and sale of steam engines of all kinds, farm implements and machinery of all kinds, and the manufacture and \n\n[200 U.S. 425, 427]\n\u00a0\n sale of all articles, implements, and machinery of which wood and iron or either of them form the principal component parts, and the manufacture of the materials therein used.'\n The thresher company exchanged its preferred stock at par for the debts of the car company and issued common stock in exchange for the preferred stock of the car company. Subsequently, at a judicial sale, the new company acquired all the assets of the car company, and paid for the same with the claims which it had acquired for issuing its preferred stock as above stated. The stock held by the bank upon which the assessment was sought to be enforced was alleged to have been acquired by the bank in the manner above stated; that is, by an exchange of its claim against the car company for the preferred stock of the new corporation. The declaration alleged that at the time of the acquisition of the stock by the bank, as above stated, under the Constitution and laws of Minnesota, there was a double liability imposed upon the stockholders to pay the debts of the corporation in the event of its insolvency.\n After the organization of the thresher company and the purchase of the assets of the car company, as above stated, the thresher company carried on the manufacturing business authorized by its charter. In 1901 it became insolvent. A creditor having sued and obtained judgment, and an execution having been issued and returned unsatisfied, the creditor procured, under the provisions of chapter 76 of the General Statutes of Minnesota and the amendments thereto, the appointment of a receiver of the property of the thresher company, who duly qualified and entered upon the discharge of his duties. In the proceeding in which the receiver was appointed, creditors exhibited claims and demands against the thresher company, aggregating $443,752.17, but no property or assets of the corporation existed available to pay this indebtedness or any portion thereof.\n Thereafter, upon petition of the receiver, pursuant to the provisions of chapter 272 of the General Laws of Minnesota \n\n[200 U.S. 425, 428]\n\u00a0\n for 1899, copied in the margin, steps were taken to provide a fund for the payment of the debts of the corporation, by enforcing contribution from its stockholders upon the double liability alleged to result from the ownership of its stock. The bank did not appear in the proceeding.\n General Laws of Minnesota for 1899\n\n\n Chapter 272.\n'An Act to Provide for the Better Enforcement of the Liability of Stockholders of Corporations.\n\n'Sec. 1.

Under the petition of the assignee or the receiver of any such corporation, or of any creditor of such corporation, who has filed his claim in such assignment or receivership proceedings, the said district court shall, by order, appoint a time for hearing not less than thirty (30) nor more than sixty (60) days from the time of filing said petition with the clerk of said court, and shall direct such notice of such hearing to be given to the party presenting said petition, by publication or otherwise, as the court, in its discretion, may deem proper; but if said petition be filed by a creditor, other than the assignee or receiver of said corcoration, the court shall direct that notice of such hearing be personally served on such assignee or receiver.\n\n'Sec. 3. At such hearing the court shall consider such proofs, by affidavit or otherwise, as may then be offered by the assignee or receiver, or by any creditor or officer or stockholder of said corporation, who may appear in person or by attorney, as to the probable indebtedness of said corporation, and the expenses of said assignment or receivership, and the probable amount of assets available for the payment of such indebtedness and ex- \n\n[200 U.S. 425, 429]\n\u00a0\n After compliance with the requirements of the act of 1899 the court made an assessment of $18 upon each of the shares of the stock of the thresher company, and the receiver was authorized and directed, in the event of the failure \n\n[200 U.S. 425, 430]\n\u00a0\n of a stockholder to pay, after due notice by mail, 'to forthwith institute and prosecute such action or actions or other proceedings against such person, persons, corporation, or party liable in any court having jurisdiction, whether in this state or elsewhere, which said receiver may deem necessary or proper for the recovery of the amount due from such person, persons, corporation, or party under the terms of this order.' After alleging the default of the bank to pay the assessment, the amended declaration prayed for a judgment against the bank for the sum of the assessment, that is, $18 per share on the 274 shares of stock of the thresher company, which stood on the books of that company in the name of the bank.\n\n As stated at the outset, the bank demurred to the amended declaration, and, on the demurrer being overruled, stood upon the demurrer, and judgment was entered against it as prayed for. The grounds upon which the amended declaration was demurred to were as follows:\n'(1) It does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against the defendant.\n\n'(2) It does not show that plaintiff has legal capacity to institute and maintain the present action.\n\n'(3) It shows that said supposed Laws of Minnesota for 1899 are in contravention of clause 1 of  10 of article 1 of the Constitution of the United States.\n\n'(4) It shows that said supposed Laws of Minnesota for \n\n[200 U.S. 425, 431]\n\u00a0\n 1899 are in contravention of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.\n\n'(5) It shows that said supposed Laws of Minnesota for 1899, being 'An Act to Provide for the Better Enforcement of the Liability of Stockholders of Corporations,' are in contravention of the Constitution of the United States.\n\n'(6) It shows that said supposed Laws of Minnesota for 1899 unjustly discriminate against nonresident stockholders, and are such as will not be enforced in this jurisdiction.\n\n'(7) It shows that the supposed order of the court levied an assessment on stockholders that is excessive and beyond reason.\n\n'(8) It does not show that the supposed corporate indebtedness is contractual, or that is has been judicially determined as against this defendant.\n\n'(9) It does not show that all the necessary steps prescribed by the supposed laws of Minnesota have been taken.\n\n'(10) It shows, as a basis of liability, supposed acts of the defendant which are ultra vires and void under the national bank act.\n\n'(11) It states conclusions of the pleader instead of facts.\n\n'(12) It does not allege a case within the jurisdiction of this court.\n\n'(13) It is, in other respects, uncertain, informal, and insufficient.'\n\n Messrs. Lester H. Strawn, Laurence Arnold Tanzer, and Winston, Payne, & Strawn for plaintiff in error. \n\n[200 U.S. 425, 432]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. C. A. Severance, Frank B. Kellogg, Robert E. Olds, and J. H. Chandler for defendant in error. \n\n[200 U.S. 425, 433]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice White, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The questions principally discussed at bar relate to the alleged repugnancy to the Constitution of the United States of the Minnesota law of 1899, by virtue of which the receiver \n\n[200 U.S. 425, 434]\n\u00a0\n asserted his power and authority to sue in a court of another jurisdiction than that of Minnesota to enforce the assessment made by the court of Minnesota on the stockholders of the thresher company. But antecedent to that question we must consider and dispose of the propositions arising from the tenth ground of the demurrer; that is, that under the averments of the bill there was no liability on the bank as the facts alleged from which it is asserted the liability arose showed that the act of the bank in subscribing to the stock was ultra vires and prohibited by the provisions of the national banking act. We say this is antecedent because, if from the averments of the declaration, aside from the validity or invalidity of the act of 1899, there could be no liability on the bank to pay the assessment, it will be unnecessary to consider whether the Minnesota statute added such conditions to the obligation resulting from the stock subscription at the time it was made as to cause the statute to be repugnant to the contract or any other clause of the Constitution of the United States.\n At the time the bank took the stock in the thresher company it was provided in  3 of article 10 of the Constitution of Minnesota as follows: 'Each stockholder in any corporation (excepting those organized for the purpose of carrying on any kind of manufacturing or mechanical business) shall be liable to the amount of stock held or owned by him.'\n If the thresher company was organized solely for manufacturing purposes, it is of course apparent that under this provision of the Minnesota Constitution the stockholders of the company would not be liable for its debts. Senour Mfg. Co. v. Church Paint & Mfg. Co. 81 Minn. 294, 84 N. W. 109. It has, however, been decided by the supreme court of Minnesota that unless it unquestionably appears that a Minnesota corporation claiming to be a manufacturing corporation was organized for the exclusive purpose of engaging in manufacturing and such incidental business as might be reasonably necessary for effecting that purpose, the exception in the Minnesota Constitution to which reference has been made would not apply, \n\n[200 U.S. 425, 435]\n\u00a0\n and the double liability would result. State ex rel. Clapp v. Minnesota Thresher Mfg. Co. 40 Minn. 213, 3 L. R. A. 510, 41 N. W. 1020; Merchants' Nat. Bank v. Minnesota Thresher Mfg. Co. 90 Minn. 144, 95 N. W. 767. These cases, it is to be observed, referred to the very act of incorporation, upon which the liability of the bank, if at all, must rest. It clearly appears, from the comments of the supreme court of Minnesota upon the charter, that in the articles of association the thresher company was declared to be organized under the law of Minnesota relating to manufacturing corporations as a class exempt from double liability, and that the motives of the incorporators were to obtain immunity from the double liability. The court, however, held that the mere law under which the corporation was organized, and the motive therefor, would not suffice to bring the incorporators within the control of the exemption accorded by the constitutional provision if, from the articles of association, it did not clearly appear that the corporation was confined solely to a manufacturing business and its incidents. The doctrine of the court was thus clearly stated (90 Minn. p. 147, 95 N. W. p. 768):\n'It is immaterial that the corporation was organized under the statute providing for organizing manufacturing corporations, or what the actual intention of the incorporators was, or that the corporation in fact carried on only a manufacturing business, but its articles of incorporation are the sole criterion as to such intention and the purposes for which the corporation was organized; and, unless it fairly appears therefrom that it was organized for the exclusive purpose of engaging in manufacturing and such incidental business as may be reasonably necessary for effectuating the purpose of its organization, its stockholders are not within the exception to the general rule of constitutional liability of stockholders for the debts of their corporation.'\n\n And further along in the opinion the declaration was reiterated (p. 148, N. W. p. 768) that the intention of the corporators could not be ascertained by reference to matters not appearing on the face of the articles of association, and that the articles were the \n\n[200 U.S. 425, 436]\n\u00a0\n sole criterion as to the purpose for which a corporation was formed; 'that is, for ascertaining the intention of the associates.' Applying this rule to the articles of association of the thresher company, the court found that the acquisition of the stock, etc., of the car company was a business independently to be engaged in, and was not incidental to that of manufacturing, and, hence, that the corporation was not within the exception embodied in the constitutional provision imposing a double liability upon stockholders.\n Now, the exclusive and only ground upon which the supreme court of Minnesota, in construing the articles of association of the thresher company, held that the articles embodied a distinct business from that of manufacturing, is plainly made manifest by the opinions expressed by the court in the two cases to which we have referred. In the earlier case the court said (40 Minn. p. 223, 3 L. R. A. p. 517, 41 N. W. p. 1024):\n'It is clear, therefore, to our minds that, under the act of 1873, a corporation can only be organized for carrying on an exclusively manufacturing or mechanical business, which, of course, includes anything that is properly incidental to or necessarily connected with such business. A corporation organized to carry on manufacturing and also some other lawful, but independent, business, belongs to the class authorized by title 2, chap. 34 ( 109-119.) With this construction of the law in mind, it is not difficult, on examination of respondent's articles of association, to determine to what class it belongs. One of the declared objects of its formation is to purchase the capital stock and evidences of indebtedness of the car company, a business in no way incident to or properly connected with that of manufacturing. The contention of counsel to the contrary cannot be seriously entertained for a moment. If a manufacturing corporation desires to buy the plant of another corporation formerly engaged in the same business, that is legitimate; and if, in order to get it, it becomes necessary to buy with it some other property, not needed for nor connected with the manufacturing \n\n[200 U.S. 425, 437]\n\u00a0\n business, this also would be permissible, if done as incidental to the main purpose of securing the plant; but no such reason or excuse existed for buying the stock and indebtedness of the car company. Indeed, it would be difficult to imagine anything more foreign to or inconsistent with a legitimate manufacturing business than for a corporation to invest all its capital in the stock and indebtedness of another and insolvent corporation. Under title 2, a corporation can be organized to carry on any lawful business, and, if parties desire to deal in such speculative property, they can do so under that title, but not under the act of 1873, even by connecting it with manufacturing. Our conclusion, therefore, is that respondent is a corporation of the class authorized by title 2. That is what the corporators themselves have characterized it by their statement of the objects of its formation.'\n\n In the latter case, after restating the rule that the face of the articles of association was the sole criterion as to the purpose for which the corporation was formed, the court said (90 Minn. p. 148, 95 N. W. p. 768):\n'Now, taking the articles in question by the four corners, and reading them in the light of the rule we have stated, without resorting to technicalities, does it fairly appear therefrom that the corporation was organized for the exclusive purpose of engaging in manufacturing and business incidental thereto and reasonably necessary for carrying into effect such purpose? We answer the question in the negative. There are two general purposes for which the corporation was organized, as declared by the articles,-one, the purchase of the capital stock, evidence of indebtedness, and assets of an existing corporation; and the other, the manufacture and sale of all articles, implements, and machinery made of wood and iron, or either of them, and the manufacture of the materials therein used. The first purpose does not appear to be a necessary incident to the second one. On the contrary, the corporation was authorized to buy and sell the stock, choses in action, and assets of the Northwestern Manufacturing & Car Company mentioned in the \n\n[200 U.S. 425, 438]\n\u00a0\n articles, without ever engaging in the business of manufacturing. The first purpose appears to be independent of the second one, for the power to buy necessarily includes the incidental power to use, collect, deal with, or sell the stock and assets of the then-existing corporation. Nor does it fairly appear, expressly or by necessary implication, from the language of these articles, that such stock and assets were to be purchased only as a necessary incident to the declared purpose of manufacturing all articles which are made of wood or iron, or either of them.'\n\n Accepting this construction given by the supreme court of Minnesota to the articles of association, by which alone the incorporators under those articles can be taken out of the exemption accorded by the Constitution of Minnesota, it follows that the thresher company was organized to embark in the purely speculative business of buying and selling the stock and assets of an existing and insolvent corporation, with power, but without the obligation, to engage, as an independent enterprise, in a manufacturing business.\n Now, the limitations upon the powers of national banks were clearly pointed out in California Nat. Bank v. Kennedy, \n167 U.S. 362\n, 42 L. ed. 198, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 831, where it was said (p. 366, L. ed. p. 200, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 833):\n'It is settled that the United States statutes relative to national banks constitute the measure of the authority of such corporations, and that they cannot rightfully exercise any powers except those expressly granted or which are incidental to carrying on the business for which they are established. Logan County Nat. Bank v. Townsend, \n139 \nU.S. 67, 73\n, 35 S. L. ed. 107, 110, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 496. No express power to acquire the stock of another corporation is conferred upon a national bank, but it has been held that, as incidental to the power to loan money on personal security, a bank may, in the usual course of doing such business, accept stock of another corporation as collateral, and by the enforcement of its rights as pledgee it may become the owner of the collateral, and be subject to liability as other stockholders. Germania Nat. Bank v. Case, \n99 U.S. 628\n, 25 L. ed. 448. So, also, a national bank may be con- \n\n[200 U.S. 425, 439]\n\u00a0\n ceded to possess the incidental power of accepting, in good faith, stock of another corporation as security for a previous indebtedness. It is clear, however, that a national bank does not possess the power to deal in stocks. The prohibition is implied from the failure to grant the power. First Nat. Bank v. National Exch. Bank, \n92 U.S. 128\n, 23 L. ed. 681.'\n\n As no authority, express or implied, has ever been conferred by the statutes of the United States upon a national bank to engage in or promote a purely speculative business or adventure, accepting the view of the articles of association by which the bank was denied the benefit of the exemption accorded by the Constitution of Minnesota, it follows that the bank had no power to engage in such business by taking stock or otherwise. The power of a national bank to engage in the character of business which the articles of association of the thresher company manfested, as defined by the supreme court of Minnesota, cannot be inferred to have been possessed by the bank as an incident of securing a present loan of money, or as a means of protecting itself from loss upon a pre-existing indebtedness. To concede that a national bank has ordinarily the right to take stock in another corporation as collateral for a present loan or as a security for a pre-existing debt does not imply that, because a national bank has lent money to a corporation, it may become an organizer and take stock in a new and speculative venture; in other words, do the very thing which the previous decisions of this court have held cannot be done.\n The speculative venture, therefore, which the bank undertook, as held by the Minnesota court, when it engaged in taking the stock in the thresher company, being ultra vires, it follows, under the settled rules hitherto applied by this court, that the bank, despite the subscription, was entitled to plead its want of authority as a defense to the claim of the receiver. The doctrine on the subject was stated in De la Vergne Refrigerating Mach. Co. v. German Sav. Inst. \n175 U.S. 40\n, 44 L. ed. 65, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 20, where it was said (p. 59, L. ed. p. 71, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 25): \n\n[200 U.S. 425, 440]\n\u00a0\n 'The doctrine that no recovery can be had upon the contract is based upon the theory that it is for the interest of the public that corporations should not transcend the limits of their charters; that the property of stockholders should not be put to the risk of engagements which they did not undertake; that, if the contract be prohibited by statute, everyone dealing with the corporation is bound to take notice of the restrictions in its charter, whether such charter be a private act or a general law under which corporations of this class are organized.'\n And, moreover, the authorities cited in the case just referred to conclusively establish that the principle which the case announced as to the power of a corporation to avail of the defense of ultra vires had been previously conclusively settled in this court. Indeed, the case arising on the record presents an obvious dilemma, which is this: If the construction of the articles of association given by the supreme court of the state of Minnesota, by which alone the double liability can be enforced, is accepted, then there was no liability because of ultra vires. If, on the other hand, we were to disregard the construction given by the supreme court of Minnesota to the articles of association, we should be constrained to the conclusion that those articles but endowed the incorporators of the thresher company with the power to carry on a manufacturing business; and, as a mere incident, to acquire for the purposes of such business the property of the car company; and it would follow that there was no double liability, by force of the exception created in the Constitution of Minnesota.\n The judgment must be reversed and the case remanded with directions to sustain the demurrer and enter judgment for the bank.\n Mr. Justice Harlan concurs solely upon the authority of California Nat. Bank v. Kennedy and the previous cases announcing the doctrine which was adhered to and applied in that case. \n\n[200 U.S. 425, 441]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer, dissenting:\n I am unable to concur in the opinion and judgment in this case, and will briefly state the grounds of my dissent.\n There is nothing in the organization of a national bank that puts it outside of the ordinary rules governing corporations, whether we consider the rights, obligations, or the remedies in actions by or against it. Section 5136, Rev. Stat. (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3455), prescribes the terms of its charter. It is authorized to do a banking business, and, like any other corporation, its powers are limited by the terms of the charter. A national bank may not engage in manufacturing, for its charter gives it no authority therefor. Neither can a manufacturing corporation engage in banking, and for a like reason. Neither one can engage in the business of buying and selling stocks, because authority therefor is not granted in the charter of either; but, never-theless, each has authority to take stock in another corporation as security for or in payment of a debt. It was so long since decided by this court,-First Nat. Bank v. National Exch. Bank, \n92 U.S. 122\n, 126-128, 23 L. ed. 679, 681, 682,-in which the question presented, as stated in the opinion of the court, announced by Mr. Chief Justice Waite, was:\n'Whether a national bank, organized under the national banking act, may, in a fair and bona fide compromise of a contested claim against it growing out of a legitimate banking transaction, pay a larger sum than would have been exacted in satisfaction of the demand, so as to obtain by the arrangement a transfer of certain stocks in railroad and other corporations; it being honestly believed at the time, that, by turning the stocks into money under more favorable circumstances than existed, a loss which would otherwise accrue from the transaction might be averted or diminished.'\n\n And answering that question in the affirmative, it was said:\n'Its own obligations must be met, and debts due to it collected or secured. The power to adopt reasonable and appropriate measures for these purposes is an incident to the \n\n[200 U.S. 425, 442]\n\u00a0\n power to incur the liability or become the creditor. Obligations may be assumed that result unfortunately. Loans or discounts may be made that cannot be met at maturity. Compromises to avoid or reduce losses are oftentimes the necessary results of this condition of things. These compromises come within the general scope of the powers committed to the board of directors and the officers and agents of the bank, and are submitted to their judgment and discretion, except to the extent that they are restrained by the charter or bylaws. Banks may do in this behalf whatever natural persons could do under like circumstances.\n\n ... * *\n'Dealing in stocks is not expressly prohibited; but such a prohibition is implied from the failure to grant the power. In the honest exercise of the power to compromise a doubtful debt owing to a bank, it can hardly be doubted that stocks may be accepted in payment and satisfaction, with a view to their subsequent sale or conversion into money so as to make good or reduce an anticipated loss. Such a transaction would not amount to a dealing in stocks. It was, in effect, so decided in Fleckner v. Bank of United States, 8 Wheat. 351, 5 L. ed. 634, where it was held that a prohibition against trading and dealing was nothing more than a prohibition against engaging in the ordinary business of buying and selling for profit, and did not include purchases resulting from ordinary banking transactions.'\n\n In California Nat. Bank v. Kennedy, \n167 U.S. 362\n, 42 L. ed. 198, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 831, the right to take stock of another corporation as collateral security was affirmed.\n In the case before us the bank had a claim against the Northwestern Manufacturing & Car Company. This was in 1884. The car company was in financial trouble and had been placed in charge of a receiver appointed by a state court. The bank, in connection with other creditors of the car company, organized a new corporation-the Minnesota Thresher Manufacturing Company-to buy the entire plant of the car \n\n[200 U.S. 425, 443]\n\u00a0\n company. It was so purchased and the bank surrendered its claim, taking in payment thereof preferred stock in the thresher company. The latter company carried on business until it failed, and then proceedings were had by which the defendant in error was appointed receiver and an assessment made by order of the court, which assessment is the basis of this action. Now, in accordance with the decision of this court in 92 U. S., supra, the bank had a right to surrender its claim and take stock in payment thereof. It did so, and, so far as the record shows, everything was done in good faith and in the belief that the best interests of the bank would be promoted thereby. Having thus become a stockholder in the thresher company, it was entitled to all the benefits and subject to all the liabilities which attached to ownership of the stock. The fact that the arrangement antedated the organization of the thresher company is immaterial, for, until the arrangement was carried into effect, the claim of the bank against the car company was undisturbed. To hold that a national bank may take, in satisfaction of a claim, stock in a corporation already existing, and cannot agree to take in such satisfaction stock in a corporation to be created, and which is afterwards created, and whose stock is issued to it in payment of the claim, is to create a distinction without a difference, and to sacrifice substance to form. The transaction is precisely the same as though the thresher company had been fully organized, and thereafter the bank surrendered its claim against the car company for stock in the thresher company, and that, as held in 92 U. S., is perfectly legitimate. It held that stock for nearly a score of years, its right to so hold being, so far as the record shows, unchallenged by the government or any stockholder, and enjoying during that time all the benefits and profits resulting from such holding. Finally the thresher company became embarrassed. Its creditors proceeded against it, and then for the first time is it discovered that the holding by the bank of stock in the thresher company was unauthorized and illegal, and now it repudiates its liability as stockholder, and leaves the burden of the thresher \n\n[200 U.S. 425, 444]\n\u00a0\n COMPANY'S DEBTS TO BE BORNE BY THE OTHER stockholders. certainly there is little in this to appeal to the sense of justice.\n The bank was not, as suggested, investing in any merely speculative business. It was not accepting stock in a corporation organized for the business of buying and selling. It was no more engaged in a speculative transaction than if it had taken a piece of real estate in satisfaction of a debt, hoping that the time would come when that real estate would be worth as much or more than the debt. The object of the organization of the thresher company, as stated in its charter, was to purchase the plant of the Northwestern Manufacturing & Car Company-that is, to buy a single property which was then in the hands of the court, and likely to be sacrificed in judicial proceedings. Clearly the creditors thought that, by acquiring title and possession of the entire plant, they could realize more than by a receiver's sale to outside parties; and at the same time, contemplating the possibilities of the future, they provided in the charter for the carrying on of a general manufacturing business. The scheme is clearly set forth in the following passage from the opinion of the supreme court of Minnesota, quoted in the opinion of this court:\n There are two general purposes for which the corporation was organized, as declared by the articles,-one, the purchase of the capital stock, evidence of indebtedness, and assets of an existing corporation; and the other, the manufacture and sale of all articles, implements, and machinery made of wood and iron, or either of them, and the manufacture of the materials therein used. The first purpose does not appear to be a necessary incident to the second one. On the contrary, the corporation was authorized to buy and sell the stock, choses in action, and assets of the Northwestern Manufacturing & Car Company mentioned in the articles, without ever engaging in the business of manufacturing. The first purpose appears to be independent of the second one, for the power to buy necessarily includes the incidental power to use, collect, deal with, or sell the stock and assets of the then-existing corporation. \n\n[200 U.S. 425, 445]\n\u00a0\n Nor does it fairly appear, expressly or by necessary implication, from the language of these articles, that such stock and assets were to be purchased only as a necessary incident to the declared purpose of manufacturing all articles which are made of wood and iron, or either of them.' [90 Minn. 148, 95 N. W. 767.]\n Clearly the thresher company was no speculative corporation, but an ordinary and legitimate business venture. Suppose the bank had been the only creditor, is it possible that it could not have taken the whole car company's plant in satisfaction if its claim, and then held it in the hopes of being able to realize fully on the property? And if it could do so, acting alone and for its single interest, what is there in the organization of a national bank which prevents it doing the like thing in conjunction with other creditors?\n Of course, as held by the supreme court of Minnesota, unless the thresher company was organized solely for the purpose of carrying on a manufacturing business, its stockholders would, under  3 of article 10 of the Constitution of Minnesota, be subject to the double liability. For if a power to engage in manufacturing exempts stockholders from double liability, no matter what other business the corporation is chartered to carry on, every corporation organizing under the Minnesota statutes would include that among its charter powers. We ordinarily accept the construction by a state supreme court of its Constitution and laws as conclusive. In this case the construction placed by the supreme Court of Minnesota upon this clause in the Constitution is so obviously right as to preclude the necessity of defense.\n For these reasons, thus briefly stated, I am constrained to dissent from the opinion and judgment of the court, and am authorized to say that Mr. Justice Brown concurs in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n penses, and also as to what parties are or may be liable as stockholders of said corporation, and the nature and extent of such liability. And if it appear to the satisfaction of the court that the ordinary assets of said corporation, or such amount as may be realized therefrom within a reasonable time, will probably be insufficient to pay and discharge in full and without delay, its indebtedness and the expenses of such assignment or receivership, and that it is necessary or proper that resort be had to such liability of the stockholders, the said court shall thereupon, by order, direct and levy a ratable assessment upon all parties liable as stockholders or upon or on account of any stock or shares of said corporation, for such amount, proportion, or percentage of the liability upon or on account of each share of said stock as the court, in its discretion, may deem proper (taking into account the probable solvency or insolvency of stockholders, and the probable expenses of collecting the assessment); and shall direct the payment of the amount so assessed against each share of said stock to the assignee or receiver within such time thereafter as said court may specify in said order.\n'Sec. 4. Said order shall direct the assignee or receiver to proceed to collect the amount so assessed against each share of said stock from the parties liable therefor; and shall direct and authorize said assignee or receiver, in case of the failure of any party liable upon or on account of any share or shares of said stock to so pay the amount so assessed against the same within the time specified in said order, to prosecute action against each and every such party so failing to pay the same, wherever such party may be found, whether in this state or elsewhere.\n\n'Sec. 5. Said order and the assessment thereby levied shall be conclusive upon and against all parties liable upon or on account of any stock or shares of said corporation, whether appearing or represented at said hearing, or having notice thereof or not, as to all matters relating to the amount of and the propriety of and necessity for the said assessment. This provision shall also apply to any subsequent assessment levied by said court as hereinafter provided.\n\n'Sec. 6. It shall be the duty of such assignee or receiver to, and he may, immediately after the expiration of the time specified in said order for the payment of the amount to be assessed by the parties liable therefor, institute and maintain an action or actions against any and every party liable upon or on account of any share or shares of such stock who has failed to pay the amount so assessed against the same, for the amount for which such party is liable. Said actions may be maintained against each stockholder, severally, in this state or in any other state or country where such stockholder, or any property subject to attachment, garnishment, or other process \n\n in an action against such stockholder, may be found. But if said assignee or receiver shall, in good faith, believe any stockholder so liable to be insolvent, or that the expense of prosecuting such action against such stockholder will be so great that it will not be of advantage to the estate and interest of creditors to prosecute the same, said assignee or receiver shall so report to said court; and shall not be required to institute or prosecute any such action unless specifically directed so to do by said court. And in such case said court shall not require said receiver to institute or maintain such action unless said court shall have reasonable cause to believe that the result of such action will be of advantage to the estate and creditors of said corporation, except as hereinafter provided.' \n\n\n\n\n","51":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFISHER v.

An order to show cause was granted, returnable August 4, to which return was made, the cause heard, and the application denied on the ground that the writ of habeas corpus had been suspended, and \n\n[203 U.S. 174, 179]\n\u00a0\n that the action of the Philippine authorities in that regard was not open to judicial review.\n Petition for the allowance of a writ of error from this court, dated October 19, and service of copy thereof acknowledged by respondents the same day, was filed January 3, 1906, and the writ of error thereupon allowed and issued on that day.\n The second clause of  9 of article 1 of the Constitution of the United States provides: 'The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless when, in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may require it.'\n The 7th paragraph of  5 of the act of Congress of July 1, 1902 (32 Stat. at L. chap. 1369, pp. 691, 692), reads: 'That the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless when, in cases of rebellion, insurrection, or invasion, the public safety may require it; in either of which events the same may be suspended by the President, or by the governor, with the approval of the Philippine Commission, where-ever, during such period, the necessity for such suspension shall exist.'\n The record discloses that on January 31, 1905, the Philippine Commission adopted the following resolution:\n'Whereas certain organized bands of ladrones exist in the proviness of Cavite and Batangas, who are levying forced contributions upon the people, who frequently require them, under compulsion, to join their bands, and who kill or maim in the most barbarous manner those who fail to respond to their unlawful demands, and are therefore terrifying the law- abiding and inoffensive people of those provinces; and\n\n'Whereas these bands have, in several instances, attacked police and constabulary detachments, and are in open insurrection against the constituted authorities; and\n\n'Whereas it is believed that these bands have numerous agents and confederates living within the municipalities of the said provinces; and\n\n'Whereas, because of the foregoing conditions, there exists a state of insecurity and terrorism among the people which makes it impossible in the ordinary way to conduct preliminary \n\n[203 U.S. 174, 180]\n\u00a0\n investigations before justices of the peace and other judicial officers:\n\n'Now, therefore, be it resolved, 'That, the public safety requiring it, the civil governor is hereby authorized and requested to suspend the writ of habeas corpus in the provinces of Cavite and Batangas.'\n\n Whereupon, on the same day, the civil governor issued the following proclamation:\n'Whereas certain organized bands of ladrones exist in the provinces of Cavite and Batangas, who are levying forced contributions upon the people, who frequently require them, under compulsion, to join their bands, and who kill or maim in the most barbarous manner those who fail to respond to their unlawful demands, and are therefore terrifying the law- abiding and inoffensive people of those provinces; and\n\n'Whereas these bands have, in several instances, attacked police and constabulary detachments, and are in open insurrection against the constituted authorities, and it is believed that the said bands have numerous agents and confederates living within the municipalities of the said provinces; and\n\n'Whereas, because of the foregoing conditions, there exists a state of insecurity and terrorism among the people which makes it impossible in the ordinary way to conduct preliminary investigations before justices of the peace and other judicial officers:\n\n'In the interest of the public safety, it is hereby ordered that the writ of habeas corpus is from this date suspended in the provinces of Cavite and Batangas.'\n\n But we must take notice of the fact that on October 19, 1905, the civil governor issued a proclamation revoking that of January 31, 1905, as follows:\n'Whereas the ladrone bands which, up to a recent date, infested the provinces of Cavite and Batangas, have been practically destroyed, and the members thereof killed or captured or have surrendered, so that the necessity for the continuance of the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus in the \n\n[203 U.S. 174, 181]\n\u00a0\n aforesaid provinces, which was made necessary by the conditions therein prevailing on the 31st day of January last, no longer exists:\n\n'Now, therefore, I, Luke E. Wright, governor general of the Philippine Islands, being duly authorized and empowered thereto by the Philippine Commission, do hereby proclaim the revocation of the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus in the provinces of Cavite and Batangas which was made by me on the 31st day of January last.'\n\n This proclamation wiped out the basis of the decision sought to be reviewed on the day when the copy of the petition for writ of error was served on opposing counsel, and more than two months before the writ of error was issued. The question ruled by the court below, and solely argued before us, became, in effect, a moot question, not calling for determination here. Mills v. Green, \n159 U.S. 651\n, 40 L. ed. 293, 16 Sup.

Re Morrissey (Morrissey v. Perry) \n137 \nU.S. 157, 158\n, 34 S. L. ed. 644, 645, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 57; Rice v. Ames, \n180 \nU.S. 371, 373\n, 45 S. L. ed. 577, 581, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 406, 407. In the latter case the court said:\n'Motion is made to dismiss the appeal upon the ground that there is no provision of law allowing an appeal in this class of cases. Prior to the court of appeals act of 1891, provision was made for an appeal to the circuit court in habeas corpus cases 'from the final decision of any court, justice, or judge inferior to the circuit court' (Rev. Stat.  763, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 594); and from the final decision of such circuit court an appeal might be taken to this court (Rev. Stat.  764, as amended March 3, 1885, chap. 353, 23 Stat. at L. 437, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 595).\n\n'The law remained in this condition until the court of appeals act of March, 1891 [26 Stat. at L. 828, chap. 517, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 549 ], was passed, the 5th section of which permits an appeal directly from the district court to this court 'in any case in which the constitutionality of any law of the United States, or the validity or construction of any treaty made under its authority, is drawn in question.' In this connection the appellee insists that an appeal will not lie, but that a writ of error is the proper remedy. In support of this we are cited to the case of Bucklin v. United States, \n159 U.S. 680\n, 40 L. ed. 304, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 182, in which the appellant was convicted of the crime of perjury, and sought a review of the judgment against him by an appeal, which we held must be dismissed, upon the ground that criminal cases were reviewable here only by writ of error. Obviously that case has no application to this, since, under the prior sections of the Revised Statutes, above cited, which are taken from the act of 1842, an appeal was allowed in habeas corpus cases. The observation made in the Bucklin Case that 'there was no purpose by that act to \n\n[203 U.S. 174, 183]\n\u00a0\n abolish the general distinction, at common law, between an appeal and a writ of error, may be supplemented by saying that it was no purpose of the act of 1891 to change the forms of remedies theretofore pursued.

A. Kaiser, and 10 acres heretofore owned and occupied by Edward McGuiness, being in Township Fourteen, north range four east, and being a part of the Bokowtonden reserve, conveyed by the United States to the children of Bokowtonden and their heirs, by patent, dated November 6th, A. D. 1827.'\n The defendants pleaded the general issue, giving notice that they would show that for more than twenty years next preceding the commencement of this action they and their grantors had been in open, notorious, exclusive, and adverse possession* \n\n[203 U.S. 233, 237]\n\u00a0\n and occupancy of the lands in question under claim and color of title.\n At the conclusion of the evidence the jury, by direction of the court, returned a verdict for the defendants, upon which judgment was rendered. That judgment was affirmed, upon writ of error, by the supreme court of Michigan.\n By the treaty of September 24th, 1819, made at Saginaw in the territory of Michigan, and proclaimed March 25th, 1820, between the United States and the Chippewa Nation of Indians, the lands comprehended within certain boundaries were forever ceded to the United States. But from that cession certain tracts were reserved for the use of the Chippewa Nation of Indians. And by article 3 of the treaty it was provided that 'there shall be reserved, for the use of each of the persons hereinafter mentioned and their heirs, which persons are all Indians by descent, the following tracts of land: . . . For the use of the children of Bokowtonden, six hundred and forty acres, on the Kawkawling river.' 7 Stat. at L. 203.\n Subsequently, november 6th, 1827, a patent was signed by President Adams. It purported to have been issued pursuant to that treaty, for a tract of 640 acres on Kawkawling river, described by metes and bounds, 'unto the said children of Bokowtonden, and their heirs forever,' the patent containing these words: 'But never to be conveyed by them or their heirs without the consent and permission of the President of the United States.'\n The particular land here in question is a part of the 640 acres reserved by the above treaty for the use of the children of Bokowtonden and their heirs, and embraced by the patent of 1827.

Or was it substantially a title in fee simple, with full power of alienation? Undoubtedly, the right of the Indian nations or tribes to their lands within the United States was a right of possession or occupancy only; the ultimate title in fee in those lands was in the United States; and the Indian title could not be conveyed by the Indians to anyone but the United States, without the consent of the United States,'- citing Johnson v.

Wilson, 23 How. 457, 463, 16 L. ed. 584, 586; United States v. Cook, 19 Wall. 591, 22 L. ed. 210; United States v. Kagama, \n118 \nU.S. 375, 381\n, 30 S. L. ed. 228, 230, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1109; Buttz v. northern P. R. Co. \n119 \nU.S. 55, 67\n, 30 S. L. ed. 330, 335, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 100. But in that case, after an extended review of previous decisions, this court further said: 'The clear result of this series of decisions is that when the United States, in a treaty with an Indian tribe, and as part of the consideration for the cession by the tribe of a tract of country to the United States, make a reservation to a chief or other member of the tribe of a specified number of sections of land, whether already identified, or to be surveyed and located in the future, the treaty itself converts the reserved sections into individual property; the reservation, unless accompanied by words limiting its effect, is equivalent to a present grant of a complete title in fee simple; and that title is alienable by the grantee at his pleasure, unless the United States, by a provision of the treaty, or of an act of Congress, have expressly or impliedly prohibited or restricted its alienation.'\n Did an alienable title in fee simple pass to she children of Bokowtonden by virtue of the treaty of 1819, 1820? That question was under consideration in the courts of Michigan a long while ago and was answered in the affirmative; and it would seem that their construction of the provisions in question has become a rule of property in that state. In Stockton v. Williams, Walk. Ch. (Mich.) 120, 129, decided in 1843, \n\n[203 U.S. 233, 239]\n\u00a0\n the question was elaborately discussed and fully considered. The treaty in that case-the same one involved here-contained these words: 'There shall be reserved for the use of each of the persons hereinafter mentioned and their heirs, which persons are all Indians by descent, the following tracts of land. . . . For the use . . . of Mokitchenoqua . . . each, six hundred and forty acres of land, to be located at and near the Grand Traverse of the Flint river in such manner as the President of the United States may direct.' 7 Stat. at L. 204. The chancellor said: 'It makes no mention of a patent, nor does it require the President or other officer of the government, after the lands have been located, to do any act whatever recognizing the right of the several reservees to the different sections. All it required of the President was to have the lands located, at and near a particular place pointed out by the treaty. To locate does not mean to patent, but to have the several sections surveyed and marked out, and a map made of them, showing the particular section belonging to each of the reservees. This was done; and, when it was done, this part of the treaty was fully executed on the part of the government. Nothing further was required to carry it into effect, and the title then vested in the respective reservees, unless we hold the treaty itself to be clearly defective in not providing for the execution of its several stipulations. A patent, although the usual, is by no means the only, mode in which the title to the public domain can pass from the government to an individual. It may pass by an act of Congress, or by a treaty stipulation, as well as by a patent. The Indian title to the land reserved did not pass to the United States by the treaty, which operated as a release, by both the Indians and government, of all interest either had in the lands reserved to the respective reservees, in fee simple; and it would be a violation of the treaty for the government to claim the land in question.' Upon appeal the supreme court of Michigan, 1 Dougl. 546, 558, 564, said: 'The first question to be determined is, What estate passed to the reservee \n\n[203 U.S. 233, 240]\n\u00a0\n UNDER THE TREATY? THE 3D ARTICLE IS IN the following words: 'there shall be reserved for the use of each of the persons hereinafter mentioned, and their heirs, which persons are all Indians by descent, the following tracts of land,' etc. 'For the use of Mokitchenoqua, six hundred and forty acres of land, to be located at and near the Grand Traverse of the Flint river, in such manner as the President of the United States may direct.' It is very clear that, if a fee-simple estate was intended to be granted, the parties to the treaty were unfortunate in the choice of terms by which to give effect to that intention; and yet it is difficult to conceive that any other estate was in the contemplation of the parties at the time of its existence. Will, then, the 3d article warrant such a construction? It will be observed that the reservation is to the use of Mokitchenoqua and her heirs. No limitation as to the time of holding, or restriction upon the right of alienation, is contained in the grant. The use of the word heirs clearly implies that such an estate was granted as would, upon her death, descend to her legal representatives. Here, then, are all the essential elements of a fee-simple estate. This construction, we think, is justified by the words of the 3d article, and is strengthened by the fact that it corresponds not only with an opinion given by the Attorney General of the United States to the Secretary of War (Land Laws, pt. 2, pp. 96, 97 ), but with the opinion of the Senate,-a branch of the treaty-making power,- which is certainly entitled to great consideration. 3 Senate Doc. 1836, No. 197.' Again, in the same case, the court said: 'The location of the lands became a duty devolving on the President by the treaty. This duty he could execute without an act of Congress; the treaty, when ratified, being the supreme law of the land, which the President was bound to see executed. It was impossible to describe the tract granted to any of the reservees in the treaty, as it is matter of history that none of the lands ceded had ever been surveyed. But locality is given to the grant by the terms of the treaty, with an authority to locate afterwards by a sur- \n\n[203 U.S. 233, 241]\n\u00a0\n vey making it definite. Smith v. United States, 10 Pet. 331, 9 L. ed. 444. This authority being executed, the grant then became as valid to the particular section designated by the President as though the description had been incorporated in the treaty itself. We are, therefore, of opinion that a fee simple passed to the reservee, Mokitchenoqua, by force of the treaty itself, and that the rights of the parties could in no wise be affected by the subsequent act of the President directing a patent to be issued.'\n In Dewey v. Campau, 4 Mich. 565, 566, the court, interpreting the same treaty, said: 'A title in fee, under this clause of the treaty, passed, by this language, to the reservee. The term 'reservation' was equivalent to an absolute grant. The title passed as effectually as if the grant had been executed. The title was conferred by the treaty; it was not, however, perfect until the location was made; the location was necesary to give it identity. The location was duly made, and thus the title to the land in controversy was consummated by giving identity to that which was before unlocated.' In Campau v. Dewey, 9 Mich. 381, 433, reference was made to Stockton v. Williams, 1 Dougl. (Mich.) 546, above cited, the court saying: 'This decision has, for sixteen years, been recognized as the law governing the titles under this treaty, at least, and these must be quite numerous, many of which have doubtless been bought and sold on the faith of this decision. We are therefore compelled to recognize it as a rule of property which we are not at liberty to disturb.' These cases were not, in any sense, modified by Auditor General v. Williams, 94 Mich. 180, 53 N. W. 1097, which was the case of an Indian treaty which expressly provided that the land there in question should never be sold or alienated to any person or persons whomsoever, without the consent of the Secretary of the Interior for the time,-manifestly a different case from the present one, in which the treaty contained no restriction upon alienation.\n The result of the cases cited is: 1. That this court and the highest court of Michigan concur in holding that a title in fee may pass by a treaty without the aid of an act of Congress, \n\n[203 U.S. 233, 242]\n\u00a0\n and without a patent. 2. That the construction of the treaty here involved, whereby the respective Indians named in its 3d article are held to have acquired by the treaty a title in fee to the land reserved for the use of themselves, has become a rule of property in the state where the land is situated. That rule of property should not be disturbed, unless it clearly involves a misinterpretation of the words of the treaty of 1819. We agree with the state court in holding that a title in fee passed by the treaty to the children of Bokowtonden, and that the patent issued in 1827 only located or made definite the boundaries of the tract reserved to them by the treaty. it follows that the words in the patent of 1827, 'but never to be conveyed by them or their heirs without the consent and permission of the President of the United States,' were ineffectual as a restriction upon the power of alienation. The President had no authority, in virtue of his office, to impose any such restriction; certainly not, without the authority of an act of Congress, and no such act was ever passed. The children of Bokowtonden having, then, obtained by the treaty the right to convey, there is no reason to doubt that title could be acquired by prescription. The evidence shows that the defendants and those through whom they claim have had peaceable, adverse possession of the premises in question continuously for more than half a century prior to the commencement of this action.\n Without assigning other grounds in support of the ruling below, the judgment of the Supreme Court is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice White did not participate in the decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","53":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFRANKLIN SUGAR REFINING CO. v.

Closson for appellant.\n Solicitor General Hoyt, Attorney General Moody, and Mr. William R. Harr for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case was argued and submitted with No. 269.\n The appellant imported and entered at the port of Philadelphia on September 29, 1903, certain sugars, the product of the Republic of Cuba. The collector imposed on all the sugars the full rate imposed by the tariff act of July 24, 1897. [30 Stat. at L. 151, chap. 11, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1626.] Permits for the removal of all the sugars for consumption from bonded warehouse were issued to appellant before December 17, 1903, and all removed for consumption before that date except 1,250 bags, which were removed December 28, and 3,279 bags and 67 bags of sweepings on December 29.\n It is contended (1) that all of the sugars having been imported after the exchange of ratifications of the treaty between the United States and Cuba [33 Stat. at L. 2136], appellant was entitled to the reduction of 20 per cent of the rates of duty imposed by the act of July 24, 1897; (2) that appellant was entitled, in any event, to such reduction as to the sugar not actually removed from bonded warehouse until after December 27, 1903. The board of appraisers sustained the collector and the circuit court affirmed the order of the board.\n As to the first contention this case is exactly like that of United States v. American Sugar Ref. Co. (just decided) \n202 U.S. 563\n, 50 L. ed . --, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 717. We decided that under the treaty between the United \n\n[202 U.S. 580, 582]\n\u00a0\n States and Cuba and the act of Congress approved December 17, 1903 [33 Stat. at L. 3, chap. 1, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1905, p. 393], there quoted, imports from Cuba were not entitled to the reduction of the duties imposed by the act of July 24, 1897, until December 27, 1903, the date proclaimed by the President of the United States and the President of Cuba for the commencement of the operation of the treaty.\n The answer to the second contention depends upon  20 of the customs administrative act, as amended by the act of December 15, 1902. 32 Stat. at L. 753, chap. 1, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1905, p. 420. Section 20 provides as follows:\n'That any merchandise deposited in any public or private bonded warehouse may be withdrawn for consumption within three years from the date of original importation on payment of the duties and charges to which it may be subject by law at the time of such withdrawal. Provided, That the same rate of duty shall be collected thereon as may be imposed by law upon like articles of merchandise imported at the time of the withdrawal: And provided further, That nothing herein shall affect or impair existing provisions of law in regard to the disposal of perishable or explosive articles.'\n\n The section needs no interpretation. It is clear that it subjects merchandise to the duties prescribed by law at the time it is withdrawn for consumption. Mosle v. Bidwell, 65 C. C. A. 533, 130 Fed. 334. And our inquiry then must be, When were the sugars in controversy withdrawn for consumption? If before December 27, 1903, they were dutiable under the act of July, 1897; if after December 27, they were entitled to 20 per cent reduction of the duties prescribed by that act.\n Between September 29 and October 10 withdrawal entries were made of the entire cargo and duties at regular rates paid thereon. The delivery permits were lodged with the storekeeper at the same time. This put the sugars at the absolute disposition of the importers. It may be that the government had the custody of them, or rather the joint custody with the importer. Rev. Stat.  2960, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1945. But it was a mere manual custody, not claiming any right over them or right to \n\n[202 U.S. 580, 583]\n\u00a0\n detain them. Indeed, it may be said that the payment of duties and the delivery of the permit to the storekeeper operated to give up the custody which the government had jointly with the importer before the payment of duties. It is, however, pointed out by appellant that, by  2977, Rev. Stat. (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1952), merchandise upon which duty has been paid may remain in the warehouse, 'in custody of the officers of the customs, at the expense and risk of the owners of such merchandise, and, if exported directly from such custody to a foreign country, within three years, shall be entitled to return duties.' Whether this section covers a case where a permit has been issued it is not necessary to decide. It is enough to say that the section is part of the plan for the payment of drawbacks. The merchandise is identified by remaining in the warehouse. Rev. Stat.  2978, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1952. We think, therefore, that where duties are paid upon merchandise and permits issued for its removal which have been delivered to the storekeeper, it is withdrawn for consumption, and is subject to duties as of that time.\n A contention is made, based on the date of ultimate liquidation of duties, which was not until after December, 1903. In case No. 269 the effect of liquidation was apparently urged to be to entitle the importer to the benefit of the treaty, which it was contended went into operation April 10, 1903, although the act giving the treaty effect was not passed until after the importation of the sugars. In other words, it was said, 'before the duties had been liquidated, so much of the statute as imposed more than 80 per cent of the regular duties upon these imports was repealed, and the repeal, by its very terms, took effect as of a date prior to the date of the importation.' It was not necessary in No. 269 to notice the contention, as we decided the treaty did not go into effect until 27th December, 1903. In the case at bar the date of final liquidation is seemingly given greater force. It is contended that 'there was no liquidation until after the convention was concededly in effect,' and was therefore 'required to be made in accordance \n\n[202 U.S. 580, 584]\n\u00a0\n with the tariff act as then in force.' In other words, whether the treaty went into effect in April or in December was unimportant; being in effect under the act of Congress when liquidation was made, it determined the rate of duty. The proposition, if true, is decisive and makes all others in the case valueless. Appellant submits the proposition without other argument than its statement, and we may, therefore, reply to it briefly. It is plainly in contradiction of  20 of the customs administrative act as amended. That section subjects merchandise to the rate of duty in force at the time of withdrawal for consumption, not the rate in force at the time of liquidation. See United States v.

Laird Company of Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, commenced proceedings in the district court of the United States for the western district of New York to cause the Frederick L. Grant Shoe Company, a corporation doing business in Rochester, New York, to be adjudicated involuntary bankrupts. The petition was solely made by the Laird Company, it averring, among other things, that the shoe company had less than twelve creditors, and that the petitioner was a creditor and had provable unsecured claims against the shoe company amounting in the aggregate to more than The nature of the claim was detailed at length, and showed that it was one for unliquidated damages aggregating $3,732.80, asserted to have been suffered by reason of breaches of an alleged express warranty in the sale of merchandise. The alleged bankrupt answered, denying its insolvency and the commission of any of the acts of bankruptcy averred in the petition, and demanded a trial by jury of the said issues. It also denied being indebted in any amount to the petitioner.\n Soon afterwards a motion was made to dismiss the petition on the ground that, because of the nature of the claim held \n\n[203 U.S. 502, 503]\n\u00a0\n by the Laird Company, that company was not a creditor and the holder of a provable claim for any amount against the shoe company within the meaning of subdivision b of  19 of the bankruptcy act, and consequently was not entitled to file a petition in bankruptcy against the alleged debtor. The motion to dismiss was denied by the district judge. 125 Fed. 576. In the order entered it was directed that the claim of the petitioner be liquidated by the jury at the jury trial demanded by the alleged bankrupt for the determination of the issues as to insolvency and the commission of acts of bankruptcy. On the petition of the alleged bankrupt to review this order it was affirmed by the circuit court of appeals for the second circuit. 66 C. C. A. 78, 130 Fed. 881.\n A trial of the issues thus raised was had before a jury in May, 1905, and, as recited in the record, 'at the close of all the evidence, the court having directed the jury to find a verdict that the said alleged bankrupt did, within four months of the filing of the petition herein, commit an act of bankruptcy, in that it transferred a portion of its property to the German-American Bank of Rochester, one of its creditors, with the intent to prefer said German-American Bank over its other creditors, and that, at the time of said transfer, said alleged bankrupt was insolvent, and that the petitioner has a provable claim against said alleged bankrupt for damages for the breach of warranty in the sale of shoes, and that the amount of such claim of the petitioner is the sum of $ 3,454.00, the jury found a verdict accordingly.' An order was thereupon entered adjudicating the shoe company a bankrupt, and declaring that the claim of the Laird Company was liquidated at the sum of $3,454.00. The present appeal was then taken.\n For the purpose of the appeal, and reciting that it was pursuant to the requirements of general order in bankruptcy No. 36, the trial judge made and filed findings of fact and conclusions of law. A single question of jurisdiction was also certified as having been raised at the opening of the hearing in September, 1905, by motion to dismiss, substantially \n\n[203 U.S. 502, 504]\n\u00a0\n upon the grounds urged in the previous motion to dismiss, which had been passed upon by the court of appeals.\n Messrs.

Elliott v. Toeppner, \n187 U.S. 327\n, 47 L. ed. 200, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 133. In the cited case, answering a question certified from the United States circuit court of appeals for the sixth circuit, it was held that a judgment that a person is not a bankrupt, entered by a court of bankruptcy on a verdict of not guilty in a trial by jury, demanded as of right under  19 of the bankruptcy act, was reviewable only by writ of error. Section 25a of the bankruptcy act, which authorizes appeals, as in equity cases, to be taken to the circuit court of appeals, among other cases, from a judgment adjudging or refusing to adjudge the defendant a bankrupt, was expressly considered, and it was held that the provision only applied to judgments adjudging or refusing to adjudge the defendant a bankrupt, 'when trial by jury is not demanded, and the court of bankruptcy proceeds on its own findings of fact.' The reasoning upon which the decision was based was, in substance, that, as in the character of proceeding under consideration the right to a trial by jury was absolute, such a trial was a trial according to the course of the common law, and judgments therein rendered are revisable only on writ of error.

Laws N. C. 1889, chap. 221. This law was thus summarized by the supreme court of that state in State v. McGinnis, 138 N. C. 724, 51 S. E. 51:\n'Section 1 made void all contracts for the sale of articles therein named for future delivery, wherein (notwithstanding any terms used) it is not intended that the articles agreed to be sold and delivered shall be actually delivered, but only the difference between the contract price and the market value at the time stipulated shall be paid. Section 2 enacted that when the defense provided by that act is set up in a verified answer the burden shall be upon the plaintiff to prove a lawful contract, but the answer shall not be used against the defendant on an indictment for the transaction. Section 3 made the parties to such contract, and agents concerned therein, indictable, and  4 made persons, while in this state, consenting to become parties to such contract, made in another state, and all agents in this state, aiding and furthering such contract, made in another state, indictable.'\n\n In 1905 there was adopted 'An Act . . . to Prevent the Dealing in Futures.' This law contains seven sections. The first and second made it 'unlawful for any person, corporation, or other association of persons, either as principal or agents, to establish or open an office or other place of business . . . for the purpose of carrying on or engaging in any such business as is forbidden in this act or in chapter 221 \n\n[203 U.S. 531, 536]\n\u00a0\n of the Public Laws of North Carolina of 1889,' and affixed a penalty for so doing. The law of 1889, referred to, is the one of which we have just previously given a summary.\n The acts made punishable by the 1st and 2d sections of the act of 1905 were thus defined in State v. McGinnis, supra:\n'The business forbidden by the act of 1905 is-to avoid a paraphrasis, and following the usual American method of describing an act by a word or a phrase-the business of running a 'bucket shop,' which is defined by the Century dictionary as 'an establishment, nominally for the transaction of a stock exchange business, or business of a similar character, but really for the registration of bets or wagers, usually for small amounts, on the rise or fall of the prices of stocks, grain, oil, etc., there being no transfer or delivery of the stock or commodities nominally dealt in.\"\n\n The 3d section provided that no person should be excused from testifying in any prosecution under the act of 1889, or its amendments, on the ground of self-incrimination, the section granting immunity to such persons so obliged to testify. It was declared by the 4th, 5th and 6th sections of the act that in all prosecutions for a violation of the provisions of the act of 1889, or the act of 1905, a prima facie presumption of guilt should arise from the proof of certain facts stated in the sections in question. These sections are reproduced in the margin. \n1\n The 7th and last section of the act contained \n\n[203 U.S. 531, 537]\n\u00a0\n provisions concerning dealing in futures by those engaged in the business of manufacturing or wholesale merchandising, which we do not presently reproduce, as we shall hereafter consider the section.\n Gatewood, plaintiff in error, was indicted for the offense of establishing and keeping an office and place of business for the purpose of carrying on or engaging in the character of business made unlawful by the 1st section of the act of 1905; that is, the opening and carrying on a 'bucket shop.' The indictment, moreover, in an additional paragraph, alleged the doing of certain acts as though it was intended to charge them as distinct offenses from the one charged in the first paragraph. The two things thus alleged were as follows: First. That, on a date named, the accused 'unlawfully and wilfully did post and publish, from information received over his wires, the fluctuations in prices of grain, cotton, provisions, stocks, bonds, and other commodities, contrary to the form of statute in such case made and provided,' the acts so charged being those from the proof of which it was provided in the 6th section of the act of 1905 that a prima facie presumption of guilt would arise as to the commission of the acts forbidden by the 1st section of that act. Second. That, on a date named, the accused 'unlawfully and wilfully did take and receive from E. T. Lea an order or contract to purchase on margin 100 bales of cotton for future delivery, to wit, August delivery, at 7 56.100 per pound, and that said Lea did deposit with said \n\n[203 U.S. 531, 538]\n\u00a0\n defendant at said time in said county the sum of $50.00 by way of margin fluctuations in said cotton, and that settlement between said parties for said cotton was agreed to be made upon the difference in value of said cotton at said date and the date of its delivery, contrary to the form of the statute in such cases made and provided, and against the peace and dignity of the state.' The acts thus charged being among those from which, when proved, there would arise a prima facie presumption of a guilty violation of certain of the provisions of the act of 1889\n\n\n The case was tried to a jury, and, as stated in the record, after proof and hearing, a special verdict was returned. By this verdict it was separately found that the defendant had committed the several acts separately charged in the indictment; that is, in separate numbered paragraphs the jury returned that the defendant had kept an office for the unlawful dealing in futures forbidden by the 1st section of the act of 1905, that he had posted and published in such office the fluctuating prices of grain, etc., and that he had made the contract for future delivery upon margin with Lea. The evidence at the trial upon which the jury acted is not in the record. The court then directed a general verdict of guilty, and judgment was entered thereon. A motion for a new trial was made, 'because the act of 1905, chapter-, is in conflict with the 14th Amendment,  1, of the Constitution of the United States, to wit, the guaranty of equal protection of the laws.' The new trial having been refused, and a fine of $5 and costs having been imposed, the case was taken to the supreme court of North Carolina. That court affirmed the conviction. The reasoning by which the action of the court was controlled was stated as follows: 'Upon the authority of State v. McGinnis, at this term, there is no error.' And in the judgment of affirmance there was embodied the record and opinion in State v. McGinnis, and such record and opinion are contained in the transcript before us. \n\n[203 U.S. 531, 539]\n\u00a0\n The assignments of error and the argument in support thereof involve three general contentions, viz.: the asserted repugnancy of the statute to the equal protection of the law clause of the 14th Amendment, and the alleged want of power of the state to enact the statute, because its provisions not only abridge the privileges and immunities of the plaintiff in error as a citizen of the United States, but also deprive him of his properly without due process of law, in violation of the same Amendment. The contention that the statute denied the equal protection of the laws rests upon the terms of the 7th section, reading as follows:\n'Sec. 7. That this act shall not be construed so as to apply to any person, firm, corporation, or his or their agent, engaged in the business of manufacturing or wholesale merchandising, in the purchase or sale of the necessary commodities required in the ordinary course of their business.'\n\n The alleged repugnancy of  7, and consequently of the entire act, to the equality clause of the 14th Amendment, is sought to be sustained upon two grounds: First, because it is asserted that those engaged in the business of manufacturing or wholesale merchandising are permitted to commit without offense the act or acts which are made criminal by the laws of 1889 and 1905, when done by any other person; and, second, because, even if the terms of the 7th section do not effect such a result, the section nevertheless operates to produce an unlawful inequality, since it creates a prima facie presumption of guilt from the proof of certain acts as against all persons but those engaged in the business of manufacturing and wholesale merchandising.\n It suffices to say, as to the first of these propositions, that the supreme court of the state, in the case upon the authority of which it placed its decision in this, expressly decided that the statute did not operate the asserted discrimination. Thus, after expressly holding that the effect of  7 was not to relieve those engaged in manufacturing and wholesale merchandising from the operation of the provisions of  1 of \n\n[203 U.S. 531, 540]\n\u00a0\n the act of 1905, prohibiting the opening and keeping of a place for gambling dealings in futures, denominated by the court a 'bucket shop,' the court came to consider whether the provisions of  7 operated to relieve manufacturers or wholesale merchants from the prohibitions of the act of 1889, concerning the making of gambling contracts for future delivery. Considering this subject, the court, in express terms, decided that the 7th section did not have that effect, since the dealings which were prohibited by the acts of 1889 were alike prohibited as to all, including manufacturers and wholesale merchants. The court said:\n'Section 7 does not confer any exclusive right or privilege upon manufacturers or wholesale merchants. It does not authorize them to engage in any business prohibited by the act of 1889. It does not authorize them to speculate in cotton or other commodities. It simply provides that the courts shall not construe the act of 1905 to have the effect of preventing . . . [manufacturers or wholesale merchants] from buying and selling for future delivery the necessary commodities required in their ordinary business.'\n\n'But a purchase for actual future delivery of necessary commodities, required in the ordinary course of business, and not for 'wagering' or gambling on the fluctuations of the market, would not be against the statute. The statute of this state does not prohibit all purchases or sales for future delivery, but only such dealings as are in the nature of gambling or wagering contracts. Though  7 mentions only manufacturers and wholesale mercantile establishments as authorized to make bona fide dealings in 'futures,' this was done unnecessarily, we think, and only out of abundant caution. It is not a discrimination, for there is no prohibition upon anyone else or any other business to buy commodities for future delivery bona fide in the 'ordinary course of such business,' when not for speculative or gambling purposes. That no other businesses or persons are mentioned as authorized to deal bona fide for the purchase of commodities on 'margin' \n\n[203 U.S. 531, 541]\n\u00a0\n is not an implied restriction upon others to do an act not forbidden by any statute.'\n\n In the argument it is insisted that the construction given by the supreme court of North Carolina to the statute is wrong, since, in effect, it reads out the provisions of  7, and it is urged that it is the duty of this court to disregard the interpretations affixed by the state court, thereby bringing the statute within the prohibitions of the 14th Amendment. But it is elementary that, under the circumstances, we must follow the construction given by the state court, and test the constitutionality of the statute under that view. Armour Packing Co. v. Lacy, \n200 U.S. 226\n, 50 L. ed. 451, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 232; Smiley v. Kansas, \n196 \nU.S. 447, 455\n, 49 S. L. ed. 546, 550, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 289, and cases cited.\n As to the second proposition, viz., the asserted discrimination, because of inequality produced by the engendering a prima facie presumption of guilt from the proof of certain acts when done by persons generally, and not raising such prima facie presumption from the same acts when done by those engaged in manufacturing or wholesale merchandising, we think the question is not open on this record. As we have stated, the indictment distinctly charged the commission of the offense prohibited by the 1st section of the act of 1905, viz., the keeping a place for gambling in futures, and at the same time in a separate paragraph charged the doing of acts from which the presumption of guilt was authorized by certain sections of the act of 1905. Upon the indictment so framed a special verdict was returned, finding that the prohibited place of business had been opened and kept as charged, and that the other acts separately charged in the indictment had been committed. Now, as the evidence upon which the jury acted is not in the record, and as there is nothing in the verdict tending to show that the separate conclusion as to the commission of the act forbidden by  1 of the statute of 1905, viz., the keeping of a place for gambling in futures, was found by the jury because of the presumptions authorized by the statute, it cannot be affirmed that the finding of the jury \n\n[203 U.S. 531, 542]\n\u00a0\n as to the keeping of the place for gambling in futures was not based upon independent evidence, wholly irrespective of any presumption authorized by the act of 1905. And this conclusion becomes irresistible when it is considered that there is nothing in the record disclosing any request made to the trial court for instructions concerning the effect of the presumption created by the act of 1905, or that any express rulings on that subject were made by the court.\n The contention that the judgment of conviction should be reversed, even although it does not appear that the same was based upon the presumptions authorized by the act of 1905, because of the inseparability of the alleged unequal presumptions, is without merit. In State v. McGinnis, supra, after expressing an opinion as to the right of a state under its police power, without violating the 14th Amendment, to create presumptions of guilt as to some classes of persons which would not be applicable to the same acts when done by other classes, the court said:\n'But, aside from what we have already said, the defendant is indicted for carrying on a 'bucket shop' business. The legislature had unquestionably power to make such business indictable. Booth v. Illinois, \n184 U.S. 425\n, 46 L. ed. 623, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 425, and other cases cited, supra. The facts found are that the defendant was carrying on the forbidden business. It can in no wise affect the validity of the statute making such business indictable that the purchase of commodities by others upon 'margin' shall, under certain circumstances, raise a prima facie case that such purchases were void, and under other circumstances shall not constitute such prima facie evidence. A statute may be void in part and valid in part. If the provision as to prima facie evidence, as to certain purchases upon 'margin,' were null, because not applying to all purchases upon 'margin,' this would in no wise invalidate that part of the statute which forbids carrying on the business of running a 'bucket shop.' The defendant is not indicted for buying commodities for future delivery upon a 'margin;' nor are manufacturers and \n\n[203 U.S. 531, 543]\n\u00a0\n wholesale merchants, nor anyone else, exempted from the prohibition of carrying on the 'bucket shop' business. Upon the special verdict the defendant was properly adjudged guilty.'\n\n This ruling as to the separability of the statute is conclusive, and refutes the contention that the entire law is void, even upon the hypothesis that the creation of presumptions as to one class, not applicable to another class or classes, was repugnant to the 14th Amendment.\n It remains only to consider the contentions that the statute upon which the conviction was had was repugnant to the due process clause of the 14th Amendment, and was, moreover, void because it abridged the privileges and immunities of the plaintiff in error as a citizen of the United States. As the first rests solely upon the proposition that there was a want of due process of law, because the state was without power to authorize a presumption of guilt on proof of the doing of certain acts specified in the statute, it is disposed of by what we have already said. And as the second was not pressed in argument, and is not shown by the record to have been raised or even suggested in the court below, we need not further consider it.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 4.

CO. v. GILA WATER CO.(1906)\nNo. 226\nArgued: Decided: May 14, 1906\n\n\n\n Messrs. William C. Prentiss and Joseph K. McCammon for appellant.\n Mr. C. F. Ainsworth for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n The appellant and appellee are Arizona corporations. The former brought this suit in the district court of Maricopa county to quiet title to certain land and water rights against the appellee and the Peoria Canal Company, Valley Canal & Land Company, also Arizona corporations, and against the Arizona Construction Company, an Illinois corporation, and against certain persons, one of whom was a resident of the ter- \n\n[202 U.S. 270, 271]\n\u00a0\n ritory, and the others nonresidents. The complaint contained the usual allegations. All the defendants but the Gila Water Company, appellee herein, disclaimed title. The appellee answered denying appellant's title, and, in a cross complaint, set up title in itself. To the cross complaint appellant answered that appellee claimed title 'under and by virtue of a certain judgment and decree of this court (district court of Maricopa county), rendered and entered November 20, 1894, and certain pretended receiver's deed or deeds made, executed, and delivered under and by authority of said judgment and decree and proceedings thereunder, or a certain deed or deeds of some person or persons deriving title under, through, and by virtue of said receiver's deed or deeds.' And it was alleged that said judgment and the proceedings thereunder were void in that (1) the action in which the judgment was rendered was a proceeding in rem and that the court never acquired jurisdiction over the property or any part thereof; (2) that the judgment was rendered July 21, 1894, and appellant duly appealed from said judgment to the supreme court of the territory, and the district court thereby lost jurisdiction of the action, and yet, on the 20th, of November, 1894, the district court entered a pretended amendment to the judgment and decree, which was pretended to be in lieu of the original decree of July 21, and that the only right and title appellee has to the property is under this 'pretended, amended, and void judgment and decree.'\n It was further alleged that the receiver was duly appointed in another action and that he took possession of the property, and that during the time appellee claims to have obtained title to any of said property the same and the whole thereof was in the custody of the court and in the possession of the receiver, and that prior to the commencement of the suit at bar the court and receiver ceased to have any custody or possession of the property.\n The trial court found that the appellee was the owner in fee simple of the property, and adjudged that the claim of the ap- \n\n[202 U.S. 270, 272]\n\u00a0\n pellant and all of the defendants in the question to be 'invalid and groundless.' The decree was affirmed by the supreme court.\n The findings of fact of the supreme court are very general. They are only that the appellant had not, at the commencement of the action, any cause of action in respect to the property, and has not now any right, title, or interest therein; that the appellee was the owner in fee simple and in possession thereof.\n The special rulings of the trial court, which were assigned as errors, and affirmed by the supreme court, appear in the opinion of the latter court and in the bill of exceptions. These rulings were made upon the introduction in evidence by the appellee to sustain its title of certain judgments rendered by the district court of Maricopa county. The facts as to these judgments are stated by the supreme court as follows:\n'It appears that in the district court of Maricopa county, in the year 1893 the appellant brought suit against the Peoria Canal Company and the Arizona Construction Company, and applied for a receiver therein to take possession of the property in controversy in this action. Thereafter the court appointed one James McMillan as such receiver, who took possession of the property, and by leave of the court issued a large amount of receiver's certificates to meet the expense of necessary improvements upon the property. This suit was docketed as No. 1728. Pending this action, one W. H. Linn, and others, brought suit in the district court of Maricopa county, against the appellant and other defendants, alleging in their complaint, among other facts, the pendency of action No. 1728, the appointment of the receiver, and the issuing of the receiver's certificates, and praying, among other things, that the assets of the Gila Bend Reservoir & Irrigation Company be marshaled and that the receiver take possession of and be directed to sell the property of the said company and from the proceeds of said sale pay the debts adjudged due against it. \n\n[202 U.S. 270, 273]\n\u00a0\n 'All the parties to this suit, including the Gila Bend Reservoir & Irrigation Company, appeared and answered. A trial was had and judgment was rendered, in which the receiver was directed to sell the property. The record further discloses that a sale was made under this judgment by the receiver, which was affirmed by the court, and a deed executed by the said receiver to the purchaser, who was one of the grantors of the appellee. This judgment was appealed from to this court, where it was affirmed, and subsequently an appeal was taken by the appellant to the Supreme Court of the United States, where the judgment of this court was affirmed. \n171 U.S. 685\n, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 942. The latter suit in the court below was docketed as No. 1996. The objection which the appellant urged in the court below to the judgment in cause No. 1996 was that it appears upon the face of the record that the judgment, ordering a sale of the premises by the receiver, was without jurisdiction and void for the reason that no order was made by the court extending the receivership in suit No. 1728 to cause No. 1996. In passing upon this objection the trial court pointed out that all the parties in cause No. 1728 were parties in cause No. 1996; that, when the latter suit was brought, the property was in the hands of the court, through its receiver, and that after the bringing of cause No. 1996 the record disclosed that the court and all the parties, including the Gila Bend Reservoir & Irrigation Company, treated the property in possession of the receiver appointed in cause No. 1728 as though it had been placed in his possession as a receiver appointed in cause No. 1996, and, further, that orders were made by the court concerning said receivership which were entitled in both suits jointly, and held that, although no order was made consolidating the two suits, and no order was in terms made extending the receivership to the second suit, No. 1996, the receivership was in fact extended to the second suit, and that the court, by its action, ratified the acts of the receiver in the second suit and thereby, in effect, extended his power and authority as such receiver to said second suit. \n\n[202 U.S. 270, 274]\n\u00a0\n 'The view thus taken is amply justified by an inspection of the record in the two suits, and upon this ground alone the action of the trial court in admitting the judgment was correct.' [(Ariz.) 76 Pac. 990.]\n\n We concur in this conclusion. The objection made by the appellant to it is, as we have indicated, that suit No. 1996 was a proceeding in rem, and that the court did not acquire jurisdiction of the property, for the reason that it was in the custody of the court in suit No. 1728, and that the court in the latter case did not extend the receivership to No. 1996 nor consolidate the suits, and, therefore, had no power to order the sale of the property by the receiver in No. 1728\n\n\n This is tantamount to saying that the absence of formal orders by the court must prevail over its essential action. It is clear from the record that the district court considered the cases pending before it at the same time, considered No. 1996 as the complement of No. 1728, regarded the cases in fact as consolidated, and empowered the receiver appointed in 1728 to sell the property and distribute the proceeds as directed by the decree in 1996. The provision of the decree entered July 21, 1894 (and of the amended decree of November 20, 1894), is as follows:\n'It is further ordered, adjudged, and decreed by the court that James McMillan, the receiver heretofore appointed by this court, and now in possession of said premises under the orders of this court, proceed to advertise and sell said property and distribute the proceeds as directed in the decree.'\n\n This decree was affirmed by the supreme court of the territory and afterwards by this court. The assignments of error, therefore, are without foundation.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","58":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGILA VALLEY, G. & N. RY. CO. v. LYON(1906)\nNo. 96\nArgued: Decided: December 10, 1906\n\n\n\n\n[203 U.S. 465, 466]\n\u00a0\n The defendant in error, who was plaintiff below, recovered a judgment against the railroad company, plaintiff in error, in a trial court in Arizona territory, for the negligent killing of her son, which judgment was affirmed by the supreme court of the territory, and the company brings the case here.\n The deceased was a brakeman and had been employed by the defendant company as such for a few weeks before the accident occurred in which he lost his life. He acted as one of the brakemen upon the freight train, which was pushed up on a spur track that ran from the main line in the town of Globe, in the territory, to a mining station, about 500 yards away. The accident, which resulted in the death of the deceased, occurred on this spur track on the 14th of July, 1900. The grade of the spur, after leaving the main line, was, for a short distance, level. It then became quite steep upgrade, getting steeper and steeper, until it again became level, under what is termed the tramway house. This was a structure erected over the tracks, and the bottom of it was only 2 feet above the top of the freight cars, and from that tramway structure to the end of the road the grade was about level, and the distance a little over a hundred feet. The track ended on a trestle, with a buffer at the end, which was not calculated to resist a car pushed by an engine, but only to stop on pushed by hand or by the wind. The trestle ended at the side of a canon, and there was at that point an abrupt fall to the bottom of the canon of 75 feet. There was a curve on the spur track, which would prevent the engineer from seeing the end of his train, and he would have to obtain signals from others in order to run his engine. The upgrade was so steep that only a few cars could be taken up from the main track at any one time.\n On the occasion of the accident the train started from the \n\n[203 U.S. 465, 467]\n\u00a0\n main line, and was pushed up grade by the engine in the rear. The deceased was on top of the front car of the train, being farthest away from the engine at the time the train was being pushed up. The conductor was on the car next to that of the deceased, and by his orders the engineer shoved the train as rapidly as he could, and ran it at the rate of 5 or 6 miles an hour, and then after a shove the two cars on which were the deceased and the conductor were detached from the train and passed along at that rate of speed under the tramway house and on to the level portion of the road, which ended in about a hundred feet at the side of the canon. The deceased was unable to control the speed of the cars with his brakes, and the car on which he was riding passed along and knocked away the buffer and plunged down to the bottom of the canon. Eye witnesses of the accident immediately descended the side of the canon and found at the bottom the car and the dead body of the deceased.\n There was evidence tending to show that the spur track was not a safe and proper structure to operate over its length with cars, for the reason that the tramway house was so close to the top of the cars when passing under it that the brakes could not be handled, and there was not sufficient length of road after the train passed under the house during which to get the cars under control and stop them before they arrived at the end of the track and the side of the canon. The only way in which it ought ever to have been done was to have the engine at all times attached to the train, and even then, if anything got out of order with the engine, the train was not under control of the brakeman, on account of the tramway house. The buffer at the end of the track was also asserted to be insufficient, and witnesses were called who testified that the track was not a reasonably safe one upon which to conduct the business of the road.\n The company, on its part, gave evidence tending to show that the track was properly constructed; that the buffer was sufficient for the purpose intended, and that the whole structure \n\n[203 U.S. 465, 468]\n\u00a0\n was a reasonably safe place, and that the accident was caused simply by the flagrant negligence of the conductor, in ordering the two cars to be detached from the train, and thus taken away from the control of the engine. It also gave evidence that the buffer was not to be used at the end of the track to stop cars in motion, nor were the hand brakes intended to be so used at that spot, as it was intended that the engine should control the cars and should not be there detached from them. They therefore insist that, when the operation was properly performed, the matters of the low shed, short track, and insufficient buffer were immaterial. It was all predicated upon the fact that the cars should be under the control of the engine, and should not be detached therefrom, as these cars were, under the orders of the conductor.\n Mr. Frank W. Burnett for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[203 U.S. 465, 469]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Waters Davis for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[203 U.S. 465, 470]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Peckham, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The first question presented by the plaintiff in error is founded upon an exception to the refusal of the court to instruct the jury to render a verdict for the plaintiff in error, on the ground that there was no evidence that the railroad company was guilty of negligence by failing to provide a reason ably safe place for the servants of the company to work in; that the cause of the accident was the gross negligence of the conductor in ordering the cars to be detached from the train and engine, and that such negligence was that of a fellow servant of the deceased, and did not form the basis for a recovery against the defendant. We are of opinion that, taking the whole evidence, enough was proved on the part of the plaintiff below to make it proper to send the case to the jury on the question of the negligence of the company.\n The next question arises in regard to the charge of the court upon the proximate cause of the accident, whether it was the \n\n[203 U.S. 465, 471]\n\u00a0\n negligence of the defendant company in not furnishing a proper and reasonably safe place for its employees to work, or that it was the negligence of the conductor (a fellow servant of the deceased) in ordering the cars detached from the engine. The court charged that--\n'The conductor of the train was a fellow servant of the man who was killed, and if the accident was brought about solely by the negligence of the conductor of the train, then the defendant company is not liable; or if the accident was brought about by the negligence of the conductor and the negligence of the man who was killed, the defendant company is not liable. If, however, the accident was caused by a failure of the defendant company to provide a reasonably safe place to perform the work in which the man who was killed was engaged, then the defendant company is liable in damages for the death, if it was negligent in not providing such safe place.\n\n'The fundamental question, therefore, for you to determine in this case is, What was the cause of this accident; what brought it about?\n\n'If you find that this accident was caused solely by the action of the conductor in the method which he employed in putting cars on the spur at the time in question, then you should find a verdict for the defendant company, and you should not award any damages to the plaintiff in this case; or if you should find that the dead man has, through his own negligence, brought about this accident or contributed to it, then you should find for the defendant, and you should not award any damages in this case.\n\n'On the other hand, if you find that the defendant company was negligent in not providing a reasonably safe place for the performance of the work, you should find for the plaintiff and award her damages, provided that the negligence of the defendant in not providing such a safe place was the cause of the accident, or contributed to the accident.\n\n'To find for the plaintiff, it is not enough that you should find that the premises were unsafe, or that the defendant \n\n[203 U.S. 465, 472]\n\u00a0\n company was negligent in that respect, in not providing a safe place; you must also find that the place was unsafe, and that the accident was brought about or contributed to by reason of that unsafe place. That is, if you should find that the act of the conductor was the sole, or if you should find that it was the proximate, or the procuring, cause of the accident, then you should not award damages; but if you find that the accident was caused by the acts of the conductor and also by the negligence of the defendant company in not providing a safe place to do the work, then you should find damages for the plaintiff. In other words, in order to award damages to the plaintiff, you must find, first, that the defendant company was negligent in not providing a safe place to do the work, and that such negligence was the cause of the accident or contributed thereto. If you find the accident was brought about solely by the acts of the conductor, you should not award damages. If the acts of the conductor alone did not cause the accident, but the accident was contributed to by the negligence of the defendant company by not providing a safe place to work, then you should award damages.'\n\n Again:\n'Was the place where the deceased was working a reasonably safe place for the performance of the work to be done there,-a reasonably safe place, considering the character of the work to be done and the character of the premises?\n\n'If you find it was not reasonably safe, and the defendant company was negligent in that respect, did that fact have anything to do with the accident, or was it caused by the negligence of the conductor of the train alone?\n\n'If it was caused solely or procured or brought about by the negligence of the conductor, then the defendant is not liable. If the negligence of the defendant company contributed to the accident, then the defendant is liable, provided the dead man himself was not guilty of any negligence which contributed to the accident.'\n\n The company now finds fault with this charge, on the ground \n\n[203 U.S. 465, 473]\n\u00a0\n that it was error to charge that unless the accident was caused solely by the action of the conductor, the defendant was liable; that 'sole' cause is not synonymous with 'proximate' cause, as the action of the conductor may not have been the sole, although at the same time it may have been the 'proximate,' cause, and if it was the proximate cause, the company would not be liable. The rule would seem to be that if the negligence of the company had a share in causing the injury to the deceased, the company was liable, notwithstanding the negligence of a fellow servant contributed to the happening of the accident. Grand Trunk R. Co. v. Cummings, \n106 U.S. 700\n, 27 L. ed. 266, 1 Sup. Ct. Rep. 493; Ellis v. New York, L. E. & W. R. Co. 95 N. Y. 546, 552. But, in addition to the main charge above set forth, the court charged the jury at the request of the counsel for defendant as follows: that if the manner of throwing the cars, as testified to, were unsafe, and the conductor caused the cars to be so thrown by that unsafe method, and if such act of the conductor was the proximate cause of the accident, and that such unsafe method was adopted by the conductor without the authority or direction of the defendant, the plaintiff cannot recover; that if the jury believed that the accident to the deceased was proximately caused by the negligence of the conductor, it was immaterial whether the deceased had had previous experience as a brakeman, or not; that, although the jury might believe from the evidence that other, better, and safer appliances might have been used by the defendant company, yet the defendant was not thereby rendered liable in this action, if the proximate cause of the accident was the negligence of the conductor in the manner in which he conducted the work on the occasion in question; that, as the conductor was the fellow servant of the deceased, the defendant could not be held liable if the accident was proximately caused by negligence on the part of the conductor; that if the jury believed, from the evidence, that the appliances furnished by the defendant company were defective, yet if they further believed, from the evidence, that the conductor was negligent in the manner in which he con- \n\n[203 U.S. 465, 474]\n\u00a0\n ducted the work on the occasion, and that such negligence was the proximate cause of the accident, without which such accident would not have happened, then the jury should find for the defendant.\n We think the defendant received no prejudice from the charge as given, taken in connection with the defendant's requests to charge, which were complied with. If the defendant had desired to obtain a more specific charge in relation to the distinction between 'sole' and 'proximate' cause of the accident, as applied to the negligence of the conductor, the court should have had its attention specifically drawn to the objection to the word 'sole,' and the particular freedom from liability asserted if the negligence of the conductor were the proximate cause of the accident, as distinguished from the sole cause. A general exception to the charge as given would not raise the question. Congress & E. Spring Co. v. Edgar, \n99 \nU.S. 645, 659\n, 25 S. L. ed. 487, 491. The requests to charge as given show the jury had its attention drawn to the proximate cause, and that if the conductor's negligence were the proximate cause, the plaintiff could not recover.\n A third question arises upon the admission of evidence. Certain of the witnesses for plaintiff were called to prove that, in their opinion, the company had not furnished a reasonably safe place for its employees to work in. This was objected to on the ground that the witnesses testifying to it were not properly experts and should not be permitted to testify. One witness, who testified that the buffer was not a reasonably safe and proper one, said that he had been railroading for fifteen years, following the business of trackman during that time; that it was his business to go over the track and see if it was in proper shape, and that he had had something to do with the construction of a railroad; that he was familiar with the construction of tracks, trestles, and buffers; that that was what he had had to do; that overhead structures came under another department; that he considered it unsafe for the reason that the buffer would afford an obstruction to the wheels and \n\n[203 U.S. 465, 475]\n\u00a0\n that the car would slide off the trucks and go over into the ravine.\n Another witness said that he had been working on railroads for twenty years, and that from his experience he had had occasion to become acquainted with structures over tracks, over bridges and highways, and buffers at the end of chutes and tracks, and as to the control of the cars, their operation and the operation of the brakes on the cars, the stopping cars, the resisting power of buffers, etc. He said that, in his opinion, the tramway house was too close to the top of a car, and that it was an impediment to the operation of the hand brake of the car, and that the buffer at the end was not an effective obstruction. Evidence was given by other witnesses, by depositions, in regard to the structure over the railroad track and the character of the buffer.\n In the cases of all the witnesses, we think the question of the admissibility of their evidence was one within the reasonable discretion of the trial court, and that the discretion was not abused. All the witnesses had had practical experience on railroads, and were familiar with structures and the character of buffers mentioned in the evidence. There was certainly enough to call upon the court to decide upon the admissibility of their opinions under these circumstances, and we ought not to interfere with the decision of the trial court in this case.

MEATH(1906)\nNo. 53\nArgued: Decided: November 19, 1906\n\n\n\n This case is before us on error to the supreme court of Washington. 38 Wash. 126, 80 Pac. 295. It was submitted to the state courts on an agreed statement of facts, and involves the question of the liability of the land of the plaintiff, now plaintiff in error, to taxation for the year 1904. He is a Puyallup Indian, and claims exemption under and by virtue of the treaty of December 26, 1854. 10 Stat. at L. 1132. That treaty provided for an allotment of land in severalty to such members of the tribe as were willing to avail themselves of the privilege, on the same terms, and subject to the same regulations, as were named in the treaty with the Omahas. \n\n[203 U.S. 146, 147]\n\u00a0\n The latter treaty, March 16, 1854 (10 Stat. at L. 1043), authorized the President to issue a patent for any allotted land, 'conditioned that the tract shall not be aliened or leased for a longer term than two years; and shall be exempt from levy, sale, or forfeiture, which conditions shall continue in force until a state constitution, embracing such lands within its boundaries, shall have been formed, and the legislature of the state shall remove the restrictions. . . . No state legislature shall remove the restrictions herein provided for without the consent of Congress.' Under this treaty, on January 30, 1886, a patent to the plaintiff was issued. One of the facts agreed upon is the following:\n'That since the issuance of said patent, and by an act of Congress passed and approved on the 8th day of February, 1887, plaintiff became and now is a citizen of the United States, and entitled to all the rights, privileges, and immunities of such citizens. Said act is found in the United States Statutes at Large, vol. 24, chapter 119, at page 388.'\n\n In 1889, Washington was admitted as a state. Its first legislature enacted:\n'Section 1. That the said Indians who now hold. or who may hereafter hold, any of the lands of any reservation, in severalty, located in this state, by virtue of treaties made between them and the United States, shall have power to lease, encumber, grant, and alien the same in like manner and with like effect as any other person may do under the laws of the United States and of this state, and all restrictions in reference thereto are hereby removed.' Laws 1889, 1890, p. 499.\n\n In 1893, Congress passed an act (27 Stat. at L. 612, 633, chap. 209) authorizing the appointment of a commission with power to superintend the sale of the allotted lands, with this proviso:\n'That the Indian allottees shall not have power of alienation of the allotted lands not selected for sale by said commission for a period of ten years from the date of the passage of this act.'\n\n Construing these several acts, the Secretary of the Interior, \n\n[203 U.S. 146, 148]\n\u00a0\n on February 14, 1903, wrote to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, summing up his conclusions in these words:\n'I am of the opinion that the requirements of the treaties with respect to these lands have been fully met, and that the provisions of the act of the legislature of the state of Washington of March 22, 1890, and the Indian appropriation act of March 3, 1893, referred to above, together operate to remove all restrictions upon the alienation or sale thereof by the allottees. I have therefore to direct that the Puyallup commissioner be instructed to continue the selection and appraisement of such portions of the Puyallup allotted lands, but only with the consent of the Indians, as provided in the act of March 3, 1893, until the expiration of the ten- year period mentioned, to wit, March 3, 1903, after which date, in my judgment, the Puyallup Indian allottees will 'have power to lease, encumber, grant, and alien the same in like manner and like effect as any other person may do under the laws of the United States, and of' the state of Washington.\n\n'You are further directed to instruct the commissioner to take the necessary steps to complete and close up the business of his office as soon as practicable after March 3, next.'\n\n Mr. Walter Christian for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Walter M. Harvey and Charles O. Bates for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Brewer:\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n In the brief filed by the plaintiff in error no question is made of his right to sell and convey the land. The supreme court of the state, in its opinion, says: 'It is conceded that the Indians may now sell their lands voluntarily and convey a title in fee, and that thereupon the lands so sold are subject to taxation in the hands of parties not Indians.' [38 Wash. 129, 80 Pac. 296.] But the contention is that although he has the power of voluntary sale \n\n[203 U.S. 146, 149]\n\u00a0\n and conveyance, yet, until he has exercised that power, the land is not subject to taxation or forced sale. His argument rests mainly upon the contention that there is no express repeal of the exemption provided in the original treaty, 'from levy, sale, or forfeiture.' That Congress may grant the power of voluntary sale while withholding the land from taxation or forced alienation may be conceded. For illustration, see treaty of January 31, 1855, with the Wyandotts (10 Stat. at L. 1159, 1161). But while Congress may make such provision, its intent to do so should be clearly manifested, for the purpose of the restriction upon voluntary alienation is protection of the Indian from the cunning and rapacity of his white neighbors, and it would seem strange to withdraw this protection and permit the Indian to dispose of his lands as he pleases, while at the same time releasing it from taxation,-in other words, that the officers of a state enforcing its laws cannot be trusted to do justice, although each and every individual acting for himself may be so trusted.\n But further, by the act of February 8, 1887, plaintiff became and is a citizen of the United States. That act, in addition to the grant of citizenship, provided that 'Indians to whom allotments have been made shall have the benefit of and be subject to the laws, both civil and criminal, of the state or territory in which they may reside.' Re Heff, \n197 U.S. 488\n, 49 L. ed. 848, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 506.\n Among the laws to which the plaintiff as a citizen became subject were those in respect to taxation. His property, unless exempt, became subject to taxation in the same manner as property belonging to other citizens, and the rule of exemption for him must be the same as for other citizens,-that is, that no exemption exists by implication, but must be clearly manifested. No exemption is clearly shown by the legislation in respect to these Indian lands. The original treaty provided that they should be exempt from levy, sale, or forfeiture until the legislature of the state should, with the consent of Congress, remove the restriction. This, of course, \n\n[203 U.S. 146, 150]\n\u00a0\n meant involuntary as well as voluntary alienation. When the state was admitted and its constitution formed, its legislature granted the power of alienation 'in like manner and with like effect as any other person may do under the laws of the United States and of this state, and all restrictions in reference thereto are hereby removed.' What restrictions? Evidently those upon alienation. The Indian may not only voluntarily convey his land (authority to do that is provided by the use of the word 'grant'), but he may also permit its alienation by any action or omission which, in due course of law, results in forced sale. Congress postponed the operation of this statute for ten years. When the ten years expired ( and they had expired before this tax was attempted to be levied) all restriction upon alienation ceased. It requires a technical and narrow construction to hold that involuntary alienation continues to be forbidden while the power of voluntary alienation is granted; and it is disregarding the act of Congress to hold that the Indian having property is not subject to taxation when he is subject to all the laws, civil and criminal, of the state.\n We see no error in the ruling of the Supreme Court of the state of Washington, and its judgment is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","60":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGRAHAM v. FOLSOM(1906)\nNo. 108\nArgued: December 8, 1905Decided: January 8, 1906\n\n\n\n Messrs. F. Barron Grier, Joseph A. McCullough, and J. B. Park for plaintiffs in error. \n\n[200 U.S. 248, 249]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. H. J. Haynsworth and R. E. L. Mountcastle for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n This writ of error brings up for review the judgment of the circuit court in mandamus, requiring plaintiffs in error to assess and collect taxes to pay a judgment recovered against Township Ninety-six, for certain bonds issued by it in aid of the Greenville & Port Royal Railroad Company. in Folsom v. Township Ninety Six, \n159 U.S. 611\n, 40 L. ed. 278, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 174, the bonds were declared valid obligations of the township. In accordance with the opinion in that case, judgment was entered in favor of the suing bondholders. Defendants in error are owners of that judgment. The legislation which authorized the issue of the bonds is recited in Folsom v. Township Ninety Six, and need not be repeated at length. We may say, however, that the act incorporating the railroad empowered townships interested in its construction to subscribe for its capital stock such sum as the majority of the voters, voting at an election held for that purpose, might authorize, and it was provided ( 9) that 'the county auditor or other officers discharging such duties, or city or town treasurer, as the case may be, shall be authorized and required to assess annually upon the property of said county, city, town, or townships such per centum as may be necessary to pay said interest on said sum of money subscribed, which shall be known and styled on the tax books as railroad tax, which shall be collected by the treasurer under the same regulations as are provided by law for the collection of taxes in any of the counties, cities, towns, or townships so subscribing.' 19 S. C. Stat. 239, 241.\n In 1895 South Carolina adopted a new Constitution, by which it was provided that the several townships of the state, with names and boundaries as then established, should continue, with power, however, in the legislature, to form other townships, or change the boundaries of those established. Art. 7 \n\n[200 U.S. 248, 250]\n\u00a0\n This section, by an amendment finally adopted in 1903, was made inapplicable to certain townships, including Ninety-six. It was provided that 'the corporate existence of the said townships be, and the same is hereby, destroyed, and all offices in said townships are abolished, and all corporate agents removed.' 24 S. C. Stat. 3.\n At the time of the execution of the bonds, Township Ninety-six was situated in Abbeville county, and in 1896 the county, of Greenwood was organized out of portions of Abbeville and Edgefield counties, and Township Ninety-six was included in Greenwood county.\n The officers of the latter county refuse to assess and collect the taxes, contending that they are not officers of the county, but officers of the state, appointed by the governor of the state, and are termed county officers because assigned to duty in that county, but cannot exercise any function of those offices except as authorized by the laws of the state; and that they have been forbidden, by an act of the general assembly of the state, to assess or collect taxes for the payment of subscriptions by townships to the building of roads which have not been built. 23 S. C. Stat. 78.\n Against this defense defendants in error invoke the contract clause of the Constitution of the United States.\n As we have seen, the validity of the bonds was decided in Folsom v. Township Ninety Six, \n159 U.S. 611\n, 40 L. ed. 278, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 174; in other words, they were decided to be the contracts of the township, and that the acts which authorized their issue constituted their obligation. In this the court announced and applied the principle of many cases which are too familiar to need especial citation.\n Plaintiffs in error yield to the case of Folsom v. Ninety Six, but contend that it is open to inquiry what officers, under the act authorizing the bonds, were the corporate agents or officers of the township, and, answering the inquiry, say the county commissioners were such agents and officers, not the county auditor and county treasurer, and that, it is contended, the circuit court has so decided. The distinction that plaintiffs \n\n[200 U.S. 248, 251]\n\u00a0\n contend for, based on the opinion of the court, is merely verbal. The court distinguished the duties of the commissioners from those of the auditor and treasurer, and expressed with emphasis the continuing duty of the latter. The court said: 'If the contention that the legislature had the right to destroy the corporate existence of the township be true, we are nevertheless confronted with the fact that the instrumentalities and means employed by the legislature, in this instance, for the purpose of enforcing the collection of a tax, are still unimpaired.' [131 Fed. 505.]\n The purpose of the court, therefore, was to point out the temporary duties of the commissioners, and to emphasize the permanent duties of the auditor and treasurer as instrumentalities of the law, with a continuing power to give its remedy and protection to the bonds, 'independent of the existence of the township.' And there can be no doubt about this from the words of the statute.\n It is further contended that the action of the court in issuing the writ disregarded article 9 of the Constitution of 1868, entitled 'Finance and Taxation.' Section 8 of the article provides 'that the corporate authorities of counties, townships, school districts, cities, towns, and villages may be vested with power to assess and collect taxes for corporate purposes.' And the further limitation of the power of municipal corporations to levy and assess taxes, expressed in  6, article 10, of the Constiution of 1895, to wit, 'for educational purposes, to build and repair public roads, buildings, and bridges, to maintain and support prisoners, pay jurors, county officers, and for litigation, quarantine, and court expenses, and for ordinary county purposes, to support paupers and pay past indebtedness.'\n The argument is that 'the 'corporate authorities' of the county cannot be vested with power to assess and collect a tax for township purposes, nor vice versa. That power can only be delegated to the authorities of the body contracting, or about to contract, the debt.' And this argument, it is contended, \n\n[200 U.S. 248, 252]\n\u00a0\n is not opposed to Folsom v. Ninety Six. There, it is said, the validity of the bonds was established, but it was not decided that the 'corporate authorities' of the township might be vested with power to assess and collect a tax to pay them. Here the question is, Can the auditor and treasurer, who are state officers, be made to assess and collect a tax which, under the Constitution and laws of the state, can only be done by the 'corporate authorities' of the township?\n Plaintiffs' construction of the case of Folsom v. Ninety Six is too limited. It takes from the case about all of its value. The case decided that the bonds were issued for corporate purposes, and established them as a valid indebtedness of the township. It proclaimed the validity of the laws under which the bonds were issued, and made those laws and every part of them the contract with the bondholders. It did not occur to any one to urge that, because the legislature might vest the township authorities with the power to assess and collect taxes, such power could not be vested in county officers. By clear implication the contrary is decided in State ex rel. Charleston, C. & C. R. Co. v. Whitesides, 30 S. C. 579, 3 L. R. A. 777, 9 S. E. 661; State ex rel. Charleston, C. & C. R. Co. v. Harper, 30 S. C. 586, 9 S. E. 664; State ex rel. Dickinson v. Neely, 30 S. C. 587, 3 L. R. A. 672, 9 S. E. 664. The offices of auditor and treasurer still exist, and through them taxes are assessed and collected in the state of South Carolina. The case at bar is not, therefore, like Heine v. Levee Comrs. 19 Wall. 655, 22 L. ed. 223; or Meriweather v. Garrett, \n102 U.S. 498\n, 26 L. ed. 197. It is like Von Hoffman v. Quincy (United States ex rel. Von Hoffman v. Quincy) 4 Wall. 535, 18 L. ed. 403; Galena v. Amy (Galena v. United States) 5 Wall. 705, 18 L. ed. 560; Seibert v. Lewis (Seibert v. United States) \n122 U.S. 284\n, 30 L. ed. 1161, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1190; Mobile v. Watson, \n116 U.S. 289\n, 29 L. ed. 620, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 398, and many others.\n But plaintiffs in error urge other defenses: (a) By an amendment of the Constitution in 1903 the corporate existence of Township Ninety-six was destroyed, its offices abolished and all its corporate agents were removed. (b) By an act of the legislature Township Ninety-six was included in Greenwood county. At the time the bonds were issued it was situated in Abbeville county. (c) Plaintiffs in error are forbidden by the laws of the state from assessing and collecting taxes for Ninety- \n\n[200 U.S. 248, 253]\n\u00a0\n six Township and have no power to perform the acts enjoined upon them by the judgment of the circuit court.\n These defenses differ only in form from those which this court held insufficient in the cases to which we have referred, and they acquire no sanctifying power because one of them, or all of them, may be said to rest upon the Constitution of the state. This, indeed, is not denied. It is asserted that the obligation of the contract is unimpaired; that the state has done nothing but exercise an unquestionable right,-the right to alter or destroy its corporations.\n The power of the state to alter or destroy its corporations is not greater than the power of the state to repeal its legislation. Exercise of the latter power has been repeatedly held to be ineffectual to impair the obligation of a contract. The repeal of a law may be more readily undertaken than the abolition of townships, or the change of their boundaries or the boundaries of counties. The latter may put on the form of a different purpose than the violation of a contract. But courts cannot permit themselves to be deceived. They will not inquire to closely into the motives of the state, but they will not ignore the effect of its action. The cases illustrate this. There may, indeed, be a limitation upon the power of the court. This was seen and expressed in Heine v. Levee Comrs. 19 Wall. 655, 22 L. ed. 223, and Meriweather v. Garrett, \n102 U.S. 498\n, 26 L. ed. 197. There is no limitation in the case at bar. A tax has been provided for and there are officers whose duty it is to assess and collect it. A court is within the line of its duty and power when it directs those officers to the performance of their duty; and their objects upon which the tax can be laid. It is the property within the boundaries of the territory that constituted Township Ninety-six.\n Mt. Pleasant v. Beckwith, \n100 U.S. 514\n, 25 L. ed. 699, and Mobile v. Watson, \n116 U.S. 289\n, 29 L. ed. 620, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 398, are cases in which municipal corporations had incurred indebtedness, and afterward their municipal organization was destroyed and their territory added to other municipalities. It was argued in those cases, as it is argued in this, that such alteration or destruction of the subordinate governmental \n\n[200 U.S. 248, 254]\n\u00a0\n divisions was a proper exercise of legislative power, to which creditors had to submit. The argument did not prevail. It was answered, as we now answer it, that such power, extensive though it is, is met and overcome by the provision of the Constitution of the United States which forbids a state from passing any law impairing the obligation of contracts. See also Shapleigh v. San Angelo, \n167 U.S. 646\n, 42 L. ed. 310, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 957. And this is not a limitation, as plaintiffs in error seem to think it is, of the legislative power over subordinate municipalities, either over thier change or destruction. It only prevents the exercise of that power being used to defeat contracts previously entered into.\n It is further contended by plaintiffs in error that this is, in effect, a suit against the state. The argument to support this contention is that, if the auditor and treasurer are not corporate authorities, as it is insisted the circuit court decided, they are necessarily 'state officers, and, being state officers, this proceeding is an attempt to require of the state the performance of her contract.' The reasoning by which this is attempted to be sustained is rather roundabout. It is based in part on distinctions which, it is contended, were made by the circuit court, and on the assumption that the circuit court decided that the levy of taxes prescribed by  9 of the statute under which the bonds were issued was a levy by the legislature, and the taxing officers state officers. This proceeding, hence, it is argued, becomes a proceeding against the state, and 'the relief sought is to require of the state the performance of her contract' (italics ours) by the coercion of her officers to the performance of duties which she has, by a statute, forbidden. And, it is said, it may be admitted that such statute 'is unconstitutional and therefore void;' nevertheless, the relief asked against the officers is \"affirmative official action,' which the political body of which they are the mere servants has forbidden them to exercise,' and it is not competent for a court to compel them to exercise, because of the immunity of the state from suit under the Constitution of the United States. \n\n[200 U.S. 248, 255]\n\u00a0\n To sustain these contentions an elaborate argument is presented and a number of cases are cited. The most direct of the cases are Louisiana v. Jumel, \n107 U.S. 711\n, 27 L. ed. 448, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 128; Hagood v. Southern, \n117 U.S. 52\n, 29 L. ed. 805, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 608; Rolston v. Missouri Fund Comrs. (Rolston v. Crittenden) \n120 U.S. 411\n, 30 L. ed. 728, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 599; Re Ayers, \n123 U.S. 443\n, 31 L. ed. 216, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 164; Pennoyer v. McConnaughy, \n140 U.S. 1\n, 35 L. ed. 363, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 699. It would make this opinion too long to review these cases. Nor is it necessary. It is enough to say that they do not sustain the contentions of plaintiffs in error.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","61":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGUARDIAN TRUST & DEPOSIT CO. v.

A subsequent mortgage or deed of trust was foreclosed and the title to the property passed to a new corporation, subject to the lien of the first mortgage. After its purchase the new corporation executed a further mortgage or deed of trust. Subsequently two fires occurred, destroying property belonging to the respondents. Actions were commenced in the superior court of Guilford county by the owners of the property destroyed against the new corporation, and judgments recovered, the judgment entries each reciting that the recovery was 'for the injury and damage done him by the negligence of the defendant.' 128 N. C. 375, 38 S. E. 912. Proceedings having been commenced in the circuit court of the United States to foreclose the existing mortgages, a decree was entered and a sale made. Thereupon the judgment creditors intervened, insisting that, in the distribution of the proceeds, they were entitled to priority over the mortgage liens by virtue of the statute above referred to. The circuit court decided in their favor. 115 Fed. 184. Its judgment was taken on appeal to the court of appeals, from which court the case was brought here on certiorari.\n Messrs.

Brooks for respondents.\n\n\n[200 U.S. 57, 64]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n It is contended that neither the plaintiff in the pending suit nor the bondholders whom it represents were parties or privies to the actions in the state court; that therefore the judgments of the latter court were not conclusive in the foreclosure proceeding as to the nature of the causes of action; that whether they were for torts or breaches of contracts is for the determination of the Federal court, and further, that when the property passed from the old to the new water company, it passed subject to the fifty-thousand dollar mortgage, and that under this statute, if applicable at all, only the interest in the property acquired by the second water company was responsible for the damages caused by its negligence. On the other hand, it is contended that the statute deals with judgments,-not claims for damages caused by negligence; that the decision of the state court as to the nature of the cause of action is as much a part of the judgment as the determination of the amount to be recovered; that a judgment which in terms is for damages caused by negligence, if entered by a court having jurisdiction, is made by the statute superior to any mortgage; that, by the mortgage, the mortgagee and the bondholders it represents agree to accept such judgment as conclusive, and to subordinate their mortgage to its lien; that to hold that the transfer of property encumbered by a mortgage from one company to another puts that mortgage outside the statute practically destroys its beneficial intent; that such has been the holding of the supreme court of the state, and is a holding which the Federal courts will follow. \n\n[200 U.S. 57, 65]\n\u00a0\n We shall assume, without deciding, that the nature of the causes of action upon which the state judgments were rendered is open for consideration in the Federal court in the foreclosure proceeding. The statute subordinates the mortgage to judgments for torts. Now, what is the judgment? It is a determination that, upon the facts stated, the plaintiff is entitled to recover so much money. It may not be essential that it recite whether the facts stated show a breach of contract or a tort, but it is essential that the judgment should be considered as a determination that, upon those facts, the plaintiff is entitled to recover. And it must be assumed that under the statute the mortgagee and the bondholders it represents agree to accept the judgment as conclusive in this respect, or, if not conclusive, at least prima facie evidence. In this foreclosure proceeding the record of the proceedings in the state courts was introduced in evidence. Taking the Fisher Case, for illustration, the complaint set out fully the contract made between the city of Greensboro and the water company, and the proceedings by which the title to the property passed from the one company to the other; alleged the destruction by fire of the plaintiff's property, and that he was free from all negligence in the matter. It added:\n'The plaintiff alleges, . . . that the defendant company was culpably negligent and wilfully careless of its duty and obligations, both to the city of Greensboro and its inhabitants, under the said contract, and by virtue also of the duties, obligations, and responsibilities which it assumed when it undertook to supply water to the city of Greensboro and its inhabitants for a stipulated price, which was paid to it by the said city.'\n\n It then set forth as matters of negligence on the part of the water company the 'carelessly, wilfully, and negligently failing to keep a sufficient quantity of water in its storage water tank in the said city of Greensboro, necessary for the purpose of extinguishing fire, together with the other uses to which it was applied;' also a failure 'to keep its pumping engine \n\n[200 U.S. 57, 66]\n\u00a0\n ready at all times, and particularly on the day of the fire above referred to, to supply the needed fire pressure, in that it negligently failed to keep a suitable person at said engine or pumping house, or near the same, for the purpose of responding to the demands for water for the extinguishment of fire, and especially did it fail so to do at the time the property of the plaintiff was burned;' and closed with this averment: 'That it was through no fault of the plaintiff that the said fire occurred, or that the same was not immediately extinguished; but that the negligence and omissions of duty, heretofore complained of on the part of the defendant company, was the proximate cause of the destruction of his property, whereby the defendant company becomes liable therefor.'\n The answer consisted mainly of denials in separate paragraphs of the averments in corresponding paragraphs of the complaint, specifically denying the validity of the contracts between the city and the original water company. Questions were submitted to the jury and answers returned, establishing the making of the contracts, the attempt on the part of the company to perform its stipulations, its failure to do so successfully, and also that the plaintiff was injured by the negligence of the defendant.\n Upon this record the supreme court of North Carolina ruled that the action was one in tort, saying:\n'We think the plaintiff was entitled to judgment as prayed for. There was an express and legal obligation upon the part of the defendant to provide and furnish ample protection against fires, and a breach of that obligation and a consequential damage to the plaintiff. Although action may have been maintained upon a promise implied by law, yet an action founded in tort was the more proper form of action, and the plaintiff so declared. He stated the facts out of which the legal obligation arose, fully, and also the obligation itself, and the breach of it, and the damage resulting from that breach. 1 Chitty, Pl. 155; 5 Thomp. Corp. \n\n[200 U.S. 57, 67]\n\u00a0\n  6340.' 128 N. C. 375, 379, 38 S. E. 912.\n\n From the conclusion thus reached we are not inclined to dissent, and for these reasons: One may acquire by contract an opportunity for acts and conduct in which parties other than those with whom he contracts are interested, and for negligence in which he is liable in damages to such other parties. A company is chartered to construct and operate a railroad. Proceeding thereunder it constructs and operates its road. Nothing may be said in the charter in reference to the manner in which the road shall be operated or the particular acts which it must do. Yet, without any such specification, it is under an implied obligation to exercise reasonable care in both construction and operation. If, from undue speed, failure to give proper warnings, or other like acts or omissions, individuals are injured, they may recover for such injuries, and their actions to recover sound in tort. Doubtless in the same transaction there may be negligence and breach of contract. If a railroad company contracts to carry a passenger, there is an implied obligation that he will be carried with reasonable care for his safety. A failure to exercise such care, resulting in injury to the passenger, gives rise to an action ex contractu for breach of the contract, or as well to an action for the damages on account of the negligence,-an action sounding in tort. But where there is no contract, and the injuries result from a failure of the corporation to exercise reasonable care in the discharge of the duties of its public calling, actions to recover therefor are strictly and solely actions ex delicto. Pollock, in his treatise, groups torts into three classes, in the last of which he specifies 'breach of absolute duties specially attached to the occupation of fixed property, to the ownership and custody of dangerous things, and to the exercise of certain public callings.' Webb's Pollock, Torts, p. 7. This, it is said, implies the existence of some absolute duty not arising from personal contract with the other party to the action. \n\n[200 U.S. 57, 68]\n\u00a0\n And here we are met with the contention that, independently of contract, there is no duty on the part of the water company to furnish an adequate supply of water; that the city owes no such duty to the citizen, and that contracting with a company to supply water imposes upon the company no higher duty than the city itself owed, and confers upon the citizen no greater right against the company than it had against the city; that the matter is solely one of contract between the city and the company, for any breach of which the only right of action is one ex contractu on the part of the city. It is true that a company contracting with a city to construct waterworks and supply water may fail to commence performance. Its contractual obligations are then with the city only, which may recover damages, but merely for breach of contract. There would be no tort, no negligence, in the total failure on the part of the company. It may also be true that no citizen is a party to such a contract, and has no contractual or other right to recover for the failure of the company to act; but, if the company proceeds under its contract, constructs and operates its plant, it enters upon a public calling. It occupies the streets of the city, acquires rights and privileges peculiar to itself. It invites the citizens, and if they avail themselves of its conveniences, and omit making other and personal arrangements for a supply of water, then the company owes a duty to them in the descharge of its public calling, and a neglect by it in the discharge of the obligations imposed by its charter, or by contract with the city, may be regarded as a breach of absolute duty, and recovery may be had for such neglect. The action, however, is not one for breach of contract, but for negligence in the discharge of such duty to the public, and is an action for a tort. 'The fact that a wrongful act is a breach of a contract between the wrongdoer and one person does not exempt him from the responsibility for it as a tort to a third person injured thereby.' Osborne v. Morgan, 130 Mass. 102, 104, 39 Am. Rep. 437. See also Emmons v. Alvord, 177 Mass. 466, 470, 59 N. E. 126. An individual may be \n\n[200 U.S. 57, 69]\n\u00a0\n under no obligation to do a particular thing, and his failure to act creates no liability; but if he voluntarily attempts to act and do the particular thing, he comes under an implied obligation in respect to the manner in which he does it. A surgeon, for instance, may be under no obligation, in the absence of contract, to assume the treatment of an injured person, but if he does undertake such treatment, he assumes likewise the duty of reasonable care in such treatment. The owner of a lot is not bound to build a house or store thereon, but if he does so he comes under an implied obligation to use reasonable care in the work to prevent injury therefrom to others. Holmes, Common Law, p. 278. Even if the water company was under no contract obligations to construct waterworks in the city or to supply the citizens with water, yet, having undertaken to do so, it comes under an implied obligation to use reasonable care; and if, through its negligence, injury results to an individual, it becomes liable to him for the damages resulting therefrom, and the action to recover is for a tort, and not for breach of contract.\n With reference to the contention that only the interest in the property required by the second water company was responsible for the damages caused by its negligence,-a contention which, if sustained, would result in giving priority to the fifty-thousand dollar mortgage,-the argument is that by the statute 'mortgages of incorporate companies . . . shall not have power to exempt the property or earnings of such incorporations . . . for torts committed by such incorporation;' that the torts were committed by the second water company; that its purchase was of the property of the first company, subject to the fifty-thousand dollar mortgage, and therefore over that property thus encumbered, and that only, were the judgments given priority. There is, doubtless, force in this contention. But this is not a penal statute, to be construed strictly, but remedial in its nature, and to be construed liberally, to carry into effect the intention of the legislature and provide the adequate remedy which it intended. \n\n[200 U.S. 57, 70]\n\u00a0\n Theobvious purpose was to make the corporate property situate in the state security against torts committed by its owner, and it would materially impair, if not wholly destroy, the statute, and thus set at naught that purpose, if the corporation constructing the plant could place a mortgage thereon for its entire value, and then, by sale, to a new corporation, enable the purchaser to use that property discharged of all substantial responsibility. In reference to a kindred question arising under the same statute, the supreme court of North Carolina said in Wilmington & W. R. Co. v. Burnett, 123 N. C. 210, 214, 31 S. E. 602, that under such construction 'this statute would be a false light held out to such claimants to induce them to furnish material and labor,-thinking they had a security, when in fact they had none.'\n It is more reasonable to hold that the statute imposes upon the investment made by a corporate company in its plant a responsibility for torts committed by it or any subsequent corporate owner, and that that responsibility cannot be avoided by any mortgage or other encumbrance voluntarily placed upon the property. Security to the individual citizen is to go hand in hand with the franchise and privilege granted by the state. We see no other question requiring notice, and the decree of the Circuit Court is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice White, Mr. Justice Peckham, and Mr. Justice McKenna dissented. \n\n\n\n","62":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGUNTER v. ATLANTIC COAST LINE R. CO.(1906)\nNo. 88\nArgued: Decided: January 15, 1906\n\n\n\n\n[200 U.S. 273, 274]\n\u00a0\n Mr. W. F. Stevenson and Messrs. Stevenson & Matheson for appellants.\n\n\n\n[200 U.S. 273, 277]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Theodore G. Barker, P. A. Willcox, and J. T. Barron for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n Before analyzing the facts particularly bearing upon the legal questions for decision, in order to a comprehension of those questions, we summarize, in their chronological order, matters which are undisputed concerning the origin and development of this controversy.\n The legislature of South Carolina, in 1855, exempted the capital stock and property of the Northeastern Railroad Company from all taxation during its charter existence. In 1849 the Cheraw & Darlington Railroad Company was chartered by legislative act, and, by an amendment to the charter, adopted in 1863, the last-named company was endowed with all the powers, rights, and privileges granted by the charter of the Northeastern Railroad Company; it being besides provided that the charter should not be subject to the provisions of a general law, reserving the right to repeal, alter, and amend, except where otherwise specially provided.\n Under the assumed authority of a law of South Carolina, providing for the assessment and taxation of property, passed in 1868 (14 S. C. Stat. pp. 27 to 69), the Cheraw & Darlington Railroad was assessed in the counties of Darlington and Chesterfield, through which the road ran. It became the duty of \n\n[200 U.S. 273, 278]\n\u00a0\n the respective treasurers of the counties named to collect the state and county taxes on the assessment thus made, and they proceeded so to do. Thereupon, in 1870, Thomas E. B. Pegues, a citizen of Mississippi, a stockholder of the Cheraw & Darlington Railroad, filed his bill in the circuit court of the United States for the district of South Carolina against the Cheraw & Darlington Railroad Company and the treasurers of Darlington and Chesterfield counties, seeking to enjoin the corporation from paying, and the county treasurers from collecting, the taxes referred to. The ground stated for the relief prayed was that the taxes in question impaired the obligation of the charter contract of exemption, and were, therefore, repugnant to the Constitution of the United States. Various provisions of a law of South Carolina, adopted in 1870, as an amendment to the act of 1868 under which the taxes were levied, restricting the right of the corporation to resist the collection of taxes, or to recover back an illegal tax, if paid, were alleged as justifying the interposition of a court of equity. An injunction pendente lite was allowed, restraining the collection of the disputed taxes. By its answer the corporation admitted the averments of the bill. A joint answer was filed for the two county treasurers, signed by 'The Attorney General for the State of South Carolina, for defendants.' This answer admitted the assessment, the steps taken to collect the taxes, and asserted their validity, and denied the existence of the alleged contract of exemption. It was averred that, if such an exemption ever existed, it was subject to the legislative power to repeal, alter, and amend, and such repeal was alleged to have been operated by constitutional and legislative provisions, which were referred to. Jurisdiction of the court in equity was challenged on the ground that there was an adequate remedy at law. A final decree passed in favor of the complainant, recognizing the alleged exemption, and perpetuating the injunction. An appeal was prosecuted to this court. The cause was decided at the December term, 1872. It was held that there was a contract of exemption, which would be impaired by enforcing the taxes \n\n[200 U.S. 273, 279]\n\u00a0\n complained of, and bence the decree below was affirmed. Humphrey v. Pegues, 16 Wall. 244, 21 L. ed. 326.\n For at least twenty-five years following the decision in the Pegues Case no attempt was made to tax the property of the Cheraw & Darlington Railroad Company. In the year 1897 an act was passed, directing the attorney general to proceed to test the right of any railroad company to exemption, and, under this act, that official sued the Cheraw & Darlington Railroad Company to recover $134,000, the sum of taxes, penalties, and interest for a period of twenty years, on the alleged ground that the company had been mistakenly treated as having a contract of exemption. The supreme court of the state, however, without passing upon the question of exemption, decided that the right to recover did not obtain, because, in any event, an assessment against the railroad, as provided by law, was a prerequisite to the levy and collection of taxes.\n From a statement made in the argument of counsel, it is to be deduced that during the year 1898 the capital stock and property of the Cheraw & Darlington Railroad Company was acquired by the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company of South Carolina, and, as the result of a charter granted to that company by the state of South Carolina, in 1898, it is conceded that the property formerly belonging to the Cheraw & Darlington Railroad Company became taxable, and that the state has, since that time, levied and collected the taxes due on the property. It is, moreover, conceded that the appellee on this record, the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company, a Virginia corporation, acquired, in 1900, the property of the Cheraw & Darlington Railroad Company, as the successor of the South Carolina corporation which bore the same name.\n In the year 1900 an act was passed in South Carolina, providing for the assessment for taxation of railroad property 'which has been off the tax books for the years in which they have been off the books, and to fix the time when such taxes shall become due, and for the collection thereof.' The act \n\n[200 U.S. 273, 280]\n\u00a0\n created a board to make the assessment to which it referred, limited the taxes to be imposed to ten years back, provided that the assessment made by the board should be put upon the rolls separately for each of the back years, and that there should be levied upon such assessment state and county taxes for the years to which the back assessment related. The act caused the taxes for which it provided to become a lien against the property upon which they might bear, and directed a certification of the taxes as assessed and levied to the respective county treasurers, and made it their duty to collect the same. To this end such treasurers were directed to make a demand for payment upon the company in whose name the assessment was made, or, if it was found that the property assessed was 'in the control of another company, demand should be made of the company . . . in possession of the property.' By the act, in addition, the attorney general was directed, if the back taxes assessed were not paid within sixty days after demand, to bring a suit in the name of the state, with the co-operation of such counsel as the counties might employ, to enforce the collection of the back taxes against the company in whose name they were assessed, or against the company found in possession of the property assessed.\n A meeting of the board appointed by this act was called in May, 1900, by the secretary of state, for the purpose of assessing the property formerly belonging to the Cheraw & Darlington Railroad Comapny, and in the control and possession of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, for a period of ten years back from 1898, on the ground that, during such period, the property in question had not been taxed for state or county purposes. The Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company appeared and protested against the proposed assessment. In the protest it directed the attention of the board to the exemption act, to the injunction granted, and the decree rendered and affirmed by this court in the Pegues Case. The board overruled the protest and valued the property of the Cheraw & Darlington Railroad Company for a period of ten years back from \n\n[200 U.S. 273, 281]\n\u00a0\n 1898, inclusive. The valuation so made was certified to the officials of the counties of Chesterfield, Darlington, and Florence, respectively, these three counties embracing the territory included in the counties of Chesterfield and Darlington at the time the decree was rendered in the Pegues Case. The state and county taxes for the years covered by the assessments were placed upon the rolls, and the taxes were certified for collection to the county treasurers. These officers demanded payment of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, as the company in possession and control of the property taxed. The company refusing to pay, the attorney general of the state of South Carolina, and counsel associated with him, commenced, in the common pleas court in the respective counties, actions in the name of the state to enforce payment against the Cheraw & Darlington Railroad Company and the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company, as the corporation in possession of the property. Thereupon the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company, alleging itself to be a citizen of Virginia, commenced, in the circuit court of the United States for the district of South Carolina, the proceeding which is now before us against the attorney general of the state, the counsel associated with him in the suits above referred to, and the treasurers of Chesterfield, Darlington, and Florence counties. The petition which initiated the proceeding was filed as ancillary to the original Pegues Case, and was entitle and numbered as of that cause. It referred to the prior proceedings in the cause, including the perpetual injunction therein issued, and to the decree of this court which affirmed the same. It alleged the assessment of back taxes as above stated, the asserted lien resulting therefrom, the demand of payment, and the suits brought to enforce payment, and charged that each and all of the acts done concerning the said assessment of the back taxes, including the bringing of the actions in the state court, were in direct violation and disregard of the injunction previously issued. The prayer was that the petitioner, as successor in interest of Pegues, be protected in the rights and privileges adjudged in the Pegues \n\n[200 U.S. 273, 282]\n\u00a0\n Case, and be accorded the benefit of the injunction issued in that case, and to that end that the attorney general of the state and his associate counsel be enjoined from further prosecution of the actions commenced in the state courts in the name of the state, to enforce payment of the taxes, and that the respective county treasurers be enjoined from any further attempt to collect such taxes.\n A preliminary injunction was granted, restraining the attorney general and his associate counsel from further prosecuting the actions brought in the state court, and also restraining the county treasurers from further proceeding to collect the taxes. In response to a rule to show cause why the preliminary injunction should not be made perpetual, the defendants answered, denying the right to the relief prayed upon grounds which, as far as now material, we shall hereafter state and consider. After hearing on petition and answers, accompanied by affidavits or admissions establishing the facts to be as we have previously stated them, a final decree was entered, perpetuating the preliminary injunction. Subsequently the court, reciting that its attention had been directed to the fact that its decree was interpreted as restraining the prosecution of suits for any tax which might have accrued from the 18th day of July, 1898, when the exemption had been surrendered, modified its decree so as to exclude from the operation of the injunction any act of the defendants looking to the collection, 'by suit or otherwise, of any sum or sums of money which may be due or charged for taxes on said property of the Cheraw & Darlington Railroad Company after said 18th day of July, 1898, at which date it was admitted in argument the exemption established in Humphrey v. Pegues was surrendered.' This appeal was then taken.\n Although the errors assigned on the record are seventeen in number, in the argument at bar but six contentions were relied upon, and we shall therefore confine ourselves to their consideration.\n All the propositions involved in the assignments will be disposed \n\n[200 U.S. 273, 283]\n\u00a0\n of by determining first, whether all the defendants on this record, including the state, through its attorney general, were parties or privies to the decree in the Pegues Case; second, if they were, whether the decree in that case concluded against them the want of power to impose or collect the taxes in controversy; and, third, if it did so conclude them, whether the court below erred in granting the relief which it awarded.\n First. We at once treat as undoubted the right of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company to the benefits of the decree in the Pegues Case, since it is conceded in the argument at bar that that company, as the successor to the rights of Pegues, is entitled to the protection of the original decree rendered in his favor.\n On the face of the record in the Pegues Case, the nominal defendants were the treasurers of the counties of Chesterfield and Darlington, in which counties the property of the railroad was situated. Those now holding the office of treasurer in each of the named counties are among the parties on this record, with the addition of the treasurer of Florence county, which county, as we have stated, consists of territory embraced in Chesterfield or Darlington county at the time of the entry of the Pegues decree. That, under these circumstances, the defendant treasurers, as the successors in office of the officials who were parties to the Pegues Case, are privies to that decree, is established. Prout v. Starr, \n188 \nU.S. 537, 544\n, 47 S. L. ed. 584, 587, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 398.\n In deciding whether the state and its attorney general were privies to the Pegues decree, some elementary propositions must be borne in mind.\n a. In view of the prohibitions of the 11th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, a state, without its consent, may not be sued by an individual in a circuit court of the United States.\n b. A suit against state officers to enjoin them from enforcing a tax alleged to be in violation of the Constitution of the United States is not a suit against a state, within the prohibition of the 11th Amendment. The doctrine announced in \n\n[200 U.S. 273, 284]\n\u00a0\n many previous cases on the subject was stated by Mr. Justice Harlan, delivering the opinion of the court in Smyth v. Ames, \n169 U.S. 466\n, 42 L. ed. 819, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 418, wherein, after holding that a suit against officers to prevent the doing of acts authorized by a state statute was not necessarily a suit against the state, or within the prohibitions of the 11th Amendment, it was said (pp. 518, 519, L. ed. p. 839, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 423):\n'It is the settled doctrine of this court that a suit against individuals, for the purpose of preventing them, as officers of a state, from enforcing an unconstitutional enactment, to the injury of the rights of the plaintiff, is not a suit against the state, whitin the meaning of that amendment.'\n\n And the subject was reviewed and restated in Prout v. Starr, \n188 U.S. 537\n, 47 L. ed. 584, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 398.\n c. Although a state may not be sued without its consent, such immunity is a privilege which may be waived; and hence, where a state voluntarily become a party to a cause, and submits its rights for judicial determination, it will be bound thereby, and cannot escape the result of its own voluntary act by invoking the prohibitions of the 11th Amendment. Clark v. Barnard, \n108 \nU.S. 436, 447\n, 27 S. L. ed. 780, 784, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 878.\n As, then, the state was not a party eo nomine in the Pegues Case and as, although the suit was against officers, it was not, for that reason alone, a suit against the state, it must follow that the ascertainment of whether the state was a party to that cause depends upon determining whether the taxing officers, who were the nominal defendants, were endowed by the state with the power, in a suit brought against them assailing the validity of taxes levied, to represent the state in the controversy so as to conclusively establish the rights of the state against the plaintiff if decree passed against him, and, on the other hand, to establish, as against the state, the rights of the plaintiff in that cause if decree passed in his favor. Thus the inquiry reduces itself to this: Did the state of South Carolina become, in substance and effect, a party to the Pegues Case? In other words, Did the state, through the authority which it had conferred upon the defendant officers, voluntarily submit \n\n[200 U.S. 273, 285]\n\u00a0\n to judicial determination the question raised in the Pegues Case concerning the alleged limitation of the taxing power of the state, arising from the contract on that subject which was asserted in that case?\n As a prelude to the consideration of the question just stated, it is well to determine at once the interest which the state had in the controversy which was represented by the county treasurers, who were the nominal defendants in the Pegues Case. Coming to do so, it is plain that the controversy which that suit involved was one in which the state was directly interested, since the officers who were the nominal defendants were charged by the state law, not only with the duty of collecting the county, but also the state, taxes, the validity of which was assailed on grounds which challenged the power of the state to impose any tax upon the property of the corporation during the existence of its charter. The officers were, therefore, in a sense, state officers, charged with the performance of a duty imposed for the benefit of the state. And that those officers were considered as being pro hac vice state officers, for the purposes of the controversy which the Pegues Case involved, is shown by the statement of the case made by this court in delivering its opinion affirming the decree. Thus it was said (16 Wall. 245, 246):\n'These different enactments above mentioned being in force, the state officers of counties in South Carolina, where the Cheraw & Darlington Railroad was situate, acting under the authority of the legislature of the state, imposed certain taxes on the stock and property of that company, and were proceeding to enforce payment of them, when one Pegues, a stockholder in Mississippi, filed a bill in the court below, praying an injunction to restrain the collection.'\n\n The question, then, is narrowed to this: Were the officers endowed with authority to stand in judgment for the state in suits brought against such officers, wherein the validity of the taxes was assailed?\n The law of South Carolina under which the taxes were levied \n\n[200 U.S. 273, 286]\n\u00a0\n was adopted in 1868. Now, by  137 of that act (14 S. C. Stat. 65), the county auditors and county treasurers were authorized to employ counsel, and the counties were made liable for the fees of such counsel, as well as for any damages which might be awarded against such officials, resulting from a defense made by them of any action prosecuted against the officials 'for performing or attempting to perform any duty enjoined upon them by this act, the result of which action will affect the interests of the county, if decided in favor of the plaintiff in such action.' It follows from this provision that where a suit was brought against a county treasurer in respect to county taxes, that official was empowered to represent the county for the purpose of the defense of its interest, and a judgment rendered against such official was therefore made binding upon the county. It was further provided in the section that 'if the state be interested in the revenue in said action, the county auditor shall immediately, upon the commencement of said action, inform the auditor of state of its commencement, of the alleged cause thereof, and the auditor of state shall submit the same to the attorney general, who shall defend said action for and on behalf of the state.'\n We see no escape from the conclusion that the provision last quoted, where suit was brought concerning state taxes, made a county treasurer, who was the state tax collector, an agent for the state, and empowered him, 'for and on behalf of the state,' to defend the suit, and required him, in order fully to protect the interests of the state, to be represented by the highest law officer of the state,-the attorney general. And the power which we think the section referred to conferred upon the county officers to represent the state in suits or actions is, moreover, persuasively indicated by a consideration of the act of 1870, amending in certain particulars the act of 1868. 14 S. C. Stat. 366. Substantially, that amendment, whilst forbidding the taxpayer from enjoining the collection of taxes, created a remedial system, by which questions of asserted illegality were to be examined by the state auditor, and, where that official \n\n[200 U.S. 273, 287]\n\u00a0\n disallowed the claim of illegality, made it the duty of the taxpayer to pay, and, subject to certain conditions, gave a right of action to recover back the money paid. And by  8, where such an action was brought, it was made 'the duty of the attorney general of the state to defend any suit or proceedings against any tax collector or other officer who shall be sued for moneys collected, or property levied on, or sold on account of any tax, when the state auditor shall have ordered such collector to proceed in the collection of any such tax, . . . and any judgment against such collector or officer finally recovered shall be paid in the manner provided in  81 of the act to provide for the assessment and taxation of the property aforesaid,'-that is,  81 of the act of 1868. Now, by that section, where a judgment passed against a county official concerning state taxes which had been paid, the state was, in effect, made liable for the amount of the judgment. Thus, in such a case, as in cases provided for in  137 of the act of 1868, the state, through its officials, was made the real defendant.\n If there were doubt-which we think there is not-as to the construction which we give to the act of 1868, that doubt is entirely dispelled by a consideration of the contemporaneous interpretation given to the act by the officials charged with its execution, by the view which this court took as to the real party in interest on the record in the Pegues Case, and by the action as well as nonaction which followed the decision of that case by the state government in all its departments through a long period of years.\n The answer in the Pegues Case, which denied the existence of the alleged contract of exemption, and asserted the existing and continuing power of the state to tax, was signed, for the defendants, by the attorney general of South Carolina, who also, in his official capacity, verified such pleading. The word 'defendants' cannot be construed as implying any other than the county officers empowered to represent the state, without imputing to the attorney general a failure to discharge the \n\n[200 U.S. 273, 288]\n\u00a0\n duty directly imposed upon him by the state. This must result from the command of the statute, that he should defend the suit, the state revenue being concerned, not merely for the county officers, but 'for and on behalf of the state,'-a command which would have been wholly disregarded if the appearance of the attorney general be treated as having been made solely for the purpose of representing the defendants as individuals. And subsequent events show that the highest law officer of the state, when he filed the answer for the defendants in the Pegues Case, intended that answer to be what the statute caused it to be,-that is, an answer for the defendants, standing upon the record, for and in behalf of the state, in defense of the right of the state to collect the taxes. When the appeal was prosecuted from the final decree, perpetually enjoining the officials who were named as the defendants (and, as we have seen, their successors in office) from any attempt in the future to collect a tax upon the property of the Cheraw & Darlington Railroad Company, such appeal was prayed by the same counsel who had signed the answer as attorney general of the state, and who, upon the expiration of his term of office, was retained by his successor in office and the governor of the state (as shown by an official report made to the legislature of the state) to prosecute the appeal, and 'to appear in behalf of the state.' And when the appeal was heard in this court a printed argument was signed, not only by the counsel thus retained on behalf of the state by the governor and the attorney general, but also by the then incumbent of the office of attorney general of the state. That this court, in deciding the appeal in the Pegues Case, considered that the state was the real party appellant, in shown by the opinion, where it was said (p. 247, L. ed. p. 326):\n'The state contends that the privileges thus granted were limited to those conferred upon the Northeastern by its original charter or act of incorporation, passed in 1851.'\n\n When, to all these conclusive considerations, there is added the fact that we have not been referred to any legislative action \n\n[200 U.S. 273, 289]\n\u00a0\n repudiating the conduct of the governor and the attorney general in the defense of the Pegues suit for and on behalf of the state, and when, besides, we take into account the failure of the state government, in all its departments, for more than twenty-five years following the decision of the Pegues Case, to assert any right to tax in conflict with the contract exemption which the Pegues decree sustained, the binding efficacy of the decree in that case upon the state of South Carolina seems to us beyond the reach of serious controversy. Indeed, we are not left to conjecture that the inaction of the state was the result of what was deemed to be the conclusive effect on the state of the Pegues decree, since it is shown that in one or two instances after that decree was rendered, where preliminary steps were taken by the taxing officials of the state to impose taxes on the property of the railroad, such efforts were at once abandoned in consequence of the advice of attorneys general of the state that the decree in the Pegues Case was conclusive, and the property could not be taxed.\n Concluding, as we do from the terms of the act of 1868, that the officers who were named as defendants in the Pegues Case were, for the purpose of that litigation, the agents voluntarily appointed by the state to defend its rights and submit them to judicial determination, we content ourselves with saying that it is unnecessary to review the case of State v. Corbin, 16 S. C. 533, and other decisions of the supreme court of South Carolina, pressed upon our attention, since those cases did not involve the statute of 1868 or statutes of like import. And, moreover, we must not be understood as holding that other provisions of the law of South Carolina, relied upon in argument, would be inadequate to bind the state by the action of its attorney general, if the provisions of the act of 1868 did not exist. Into that consideration we have not entered.\n Second. The state of South Carolina and its attorney general, and his associate counsel, as the agents of the state, being, therefore, privies to and bound by the decree in the Pegues Case, we must determine what was concluded by that decree. \n\n[200 U.S. 273, 290]\n\u00a0\n That the issue in the case was the existence of a charter exemption from taxation in favor of the Cheraw & Darlington Railroad Company, and the consequent want of power of the state to tax the property of the railroad during the continuance of the exemption, is obvious. And that the decree rendered in the cause established the exemption embraced in the issues is also obvious. This being true, it unquestionably follows that the decree established as to the parties and their privies the very question in issue in this proceeding. Escape from this inevitable result is sought to be accomplished by several propositions, all of which we think are unsound.\n a. The complaint in the Pegues Case, it is said, mistakenly averred that the Cheraw & Darlington Railroad had not been built at the time the amendment of the charter was made which gave the exemption relied upon, and as this, it is asserted, was not traversed by the answer filed in the case by the attorney general, it was consequently erroneously assumed to be true in fact, and the decree, it is argued, was based upon such assumption. From this the contention is that if the truth had been established, a different decree would have been rendered, because no consideration for the grant of exemption would then have appeared. But, even granting the premise, the deduction is unsound. To admit it would destroy the effect of the thing adjudged, resulting from the decree in the Pegues Case, since all defenses then existing to the asserted right of exemption, whether brought to the attention of the court or waived, were foreclosed by the decree. United States v. California & o. Land Co. \n192 U.S. 355\n, 48 L. ed. 476, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 266; Fayerweather v. Ritch, \n195 \nU.S. 276, 300\n, 49 S. L. ed. 193, 210, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 58, et seq., and cases cited. And although it be conceded for the sake of argument that the doctrine of res judicata, as announced in rulings of the supreme court of South Carolina, lend support to the contention made, our duty is to give to the decree of the circuit court of the United States in the Pegues Case the force and effect to which it is entitled under the principles of res judicata as settled by this court, especially in view of the fact that the controversy in the Pegues Case involved \n\n[200 U.S. 273, 291]\n\u00a0\n rights protected by the Constitution of the United States. Deposit Bank v. Frankfort, \n191 U.S. 499\n, 48 L. ed. 276, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 154.\n b. It is urged that as the taxes, the collection of which the court enjoined, were not for the same years as were the taxes with which the Pegues Case was concerned, the Pegues decree was, therefore, not res judicata, because it related to a different cause of action. This rests upon the assumption that a decree enjoining the collection of a tax for one year can never be the thing adjudged as to the right to collect taxes of a subsequent year. But the proposition entirely disregards the fact that the decree in the Pegues Case, enjoining the collection of the taxes in controversy in that case, was rested upon the ground that there was a contract protected from impairment by the Constitution of the United States which was as controlling on future taxes as it was upon the particular taxes to which the Pegues suit related. The contention, therefore, simply asserts that a contract right of exemption was beyond the pale of judicial protection, because rights under such contract could never be sanctioned by final judicial action. Besides, the proposition is not open to controversy. New Orleans v. Citizens' Bank, \n167 U.S. 371\n, 42 L. ed. 202, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 905; Deposit Bank v. Frankfort, \n191 U.S. 499\n, 48 L. ed. 276, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 154.\n Third. It is insisted that the court below had no power to restrain the attorney general of South Carolina and the counsel associated with him from prosecuting, in the state courts, actions authorized by the laws of the state, and hence that the court erred in awarding an injunction against said officers. Support for the proposition is rested upon the terms of the 11th Amendment and the provisions of  720 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 581), forbidding the granting of a writ by any court of the United States to stay proceedings in any court of a state, except in cases where such injunction may be authorized by any law relating to proceedings in bankruptcy. The soundness of the doctrine relied upon is undoubted. Re Ayers, \n123 U.S. 443\n, 31 L. ed. 216, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 164; Fitts v. McGhee, \n172 U.S. 516\n, 43 L. ed. 535, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 269. The difficulty is that the doctrine is inapplicable to this case. Section 720 of the Revised Statutes was originally adopted in \n\n[200 U.S. 273, 292]\n\u00a0\n 1793, whilst the 11th Amendment was in process of formation in Congress for submission to the states, and long, therefore, before the ratification of that amendment. The restrictions embodied in the section were, therefore, but a partial accomplishment of the more comprehensive result effectuated by the prohibitions of the 11th Amendment. Both the statute and the amendment relate to the power of courts of the United States to deal, against the will and consent of a state, with controversies between it and individuals. None of the prohibitions, therefore, of the amendment or of the statute relate to the power of a Federal court to administer relief in causes where jurisdiction as to a state and its officers has been acquired as a result of the voluntary action of the state in submitting its rights to judicial determination. To confound the two classes of cases is but to overlook the distinction which exists between the power of a court to deal with a subject over which it has jurisdiction, and its want of authority to entertain a controversy as to which jurisdiction is not possessed. From this it follows that, as in the Pegues Case, the court had acquired jurisdiction, with the assent of the state of South Carolina, to determine as to it the controversy presented in that case, the right of the court to administer relief-to make its decree effective-cannot be measured by constitutional or statutory provisions relating to original proceedings where jurisdiction over the controversy did not obtain. In other words, the proposition relied upon is disposed of by the conclusion which we have previously expressed concerning the persons who were parties and privies to the decree rendered in the Pegues Case. Indeed, the proposition that the 11th Amendment, or  720 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 581), control a court of the United States in administering relief, although the court was acting in a matter ancillary to a decree rendered in a cause over which it had jurisdiction, is not open for discussion. Dietzsch v. Huidekoper (Kern v. Huidekoper) \n103 U.S. 494\n, 26 L. ed. 497; Prout v. Starr, \n188 U.S. 537\n, 47 L. ed. 584, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 398; Julian v. Central Trust Co. \n193 \nU.S. 93, 112\n, 48 S. L. ed. 629, 639, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 399.\n And this reasoning disposes of the contention that the court \n\n[200 U.S. 273, 293]\n\u00a0\n below erred in enforcing its prior decree because there was adequate remedy at law, by interposing a defense in the state courts to the actions brought by the attorney general. That question was foreclosed by the decree in the Pegues Case. So also does the reasoning dispose of the assertion that, because a part of the tax for the year 1898 may have been due, therefore tender should have been made before invoking the power of the court to protect its jurisdiction and enforce the prior decree. The amendment of the decree made by the court eliminated from the controversy all question concerning the portion of the tax not covered by the decree in the Pegues Case. Having acquired by that decree a right which the petitioner was entitled to enforce, whatever might have been the rule of tender as applied to other cases, that rule could not rightly be invoked to deprive the court below, as a court of equity, of the power to protect the petitioner in the enjoyment of rights previously secured under a decree of the court.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice Brown dissents. \n\n\n\n","63":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGUSS v. NELSON(1906)\nNo. 124\nArgued: Decided: January 15, 1906\n\n\n\n On May 28, 1900, at Guthrie, Oklahoma territory, the parties to this action entered into the following contract:\n'Memorandum of agreement made and entered into this 28th day of May, 1900, to wit, as follows: J. T. Nelson agrees on his part to turn over 25 per cent of the capital stock of the following coal companies located in the Creek Nation, to wit: Sapulpa, Choctaw, Catoosa, Wewoka, Red Fork, Neyaka, Concharty, Tulsa, Car Creek, and Broken Arrow Mining Companies, to the following persons: U. C. Guss, W. H. Gray, F. H. Greer, and J. W. McNeal. The consideration of the delivery under which the above-listed stock and other stock as hereinafter described is as follows: This also includes the delivery of the records belonging to each of said above-named companies, the seals and other records that in any way belong to any of said companies. A payment of $500 is to be made in cash upon delivery of the above-named property, and additional property in the way of stock hereinafter listed. The \n\n[200 U.S. 298, 299]\n\u00a0\n $500 is to be considered an option on all said property until the 4th day of March, 1901. At that date the above-named parties are to pay to Nelson an additional sum of $4,500.00 (four thousand, five hundred dollars), or in lieu thereof to turn back to said Nelson all the property delivered by him. In addition to the above-mentioned 25 per cent of the capital stock aforesaid, which the said J. T. Nelson represents he owns in his own right, he agrees to turn over and deliver enough more stock to make the aggregate sum of stock delivered by him under this contract as follows:'\n\n (Here follows a list of companies and number of shares of stock each.)\n'The $500.00 above mentioned is to be earnest money, to be forfeited in case the balance of payment is not paid. Nelson also agrees to give U. C. Guss his proxy as director in each of the above-named companies until such time as it may be convenient for him to resign and Guss or someone else be elected to fill the vacancy.'\n\n On April 6, 1901, Nelson brought suit in the district court of Logan county, Oklahoma territory, to recover the additional sum named in the contract. After answer the case was tried by the court without a jury, and judgment rendered in his favor on February 20, 1903, for $4,500 and interest. This was affirmed by the supreme court of the territory (14 Okla. 296, 78 Pac. 170), and its judgment was brought here both by appeal and writ of error.\n Messrs. A. G. C. Bierer and Frank Dale for appellants and plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n\n[200 U.S. 298, 300]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. W. R. Biddle, W. P. Dillard, Selwyn Douglas, George S. Green, and H. B. Martin for appellee and defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Brewer:\n\n\n[200 U.S. 298, 302]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n The appeal must be dismissed. Oklahoma City v. McMaster, \n196 U.S. 529\n, 49 L. ed. 587, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 324.\n Considering the writ of error, we remark that no rulings were made in respect to the admission or rejection of testimony presenting anything worthy of consideration. No special findings of fact were made by either the district or supreme court, the former finding generally the issues in favor of the plaintiff, and rendering judgment upon such general finding, and the latter merely discussing the right of recovery upon the pleadings and such general finding.\n Plaintiffs in error contend that this is a mere option contract, and that no liability could attach to them except upon an election to purchase the property, which they never made, but, on the contrary, declined to make, and notified the plaintiff thereof by letter. They call attention to the clause providing that 'the $500 is to be considered an option,' refer to the fact that there is nothing in the contract in terms mentioning 'sale' or 'purchase.' There is always danger in applying a generic term to a contract, and then subjecting it to the general rules controlling contracts of that nature, irrespective of its special stipulation. While an option is given by the contract, and the price paid for the option is named, yet it contains other clauses which are equally binding, and from which liability arises. Option contracts are not all alike. As said in Hunt v. Wyman, 100 Mass. 198, 200, quoted approvingly by this court in Sturm v. Boker, \n150 \nU.S. 312, 329\n, 37 S. L. ed. 1093, 1100, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 99, 104:\n'An option to purchase if he liked is essentially different from an option to return a purchase if he should not like. In one case, the title will not pass until the option is determined; in the other, the property passes at once, subject to the right to rescind and return.' \n\n[200 U.S. 298, 303]\n\u00a0\n In the contract before us, while an option running until the 4th of March, 1901, is given, for which $500 is to be paid, the stipulation for such option is followed by this: 'At that date the above-named parties are to pay to Nelson an additional sum of $4,500 (four thousand, five hundred dollars), or, in lieu thereof, to turn back to said Nelson all the property delivered by him.' Here is an absolute promise on the part of plaintiffs in error to pay an additional sum of $4,500 at a specified date, or, in lieu thereof, to turn back the property. They did not return the property. The amount to be paid and the time of payment are expressly named, and that stipulation in the contract is as significant and binding as any other. It shows that the option given is an option to return, and that, if it is not exercised at the time named, the sale is complete, and the promise to pay the balance of the purchase price becomes absolute. The construction of the contract is reinforced by the fact that not only was the stock to be delivered to the plaintiffs in error, but also Nelson agreed to give, and did give, his proxy as director in each of the companies, so that the possession of the stock and all the rights which attached to it passed to the plaintiffs in error, to be exercised by them subject to the right at any time before the 4th of March to return the property. Haskins v. Dern, 19 Utah, 89, 56 Pac. 953, is directly in point.\n\n We see no error in the ruling of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma, and its judgment is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McKenna took no part in the decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","64":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGUY v. DONALD(1906)\nNo. 90\nArgued: November 8, 1906Decided: December 3, 1906\n\n\n\n\n[203 U.S. 399, 400]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. D. Tucker Brooke and R. C. Marshall for Guy et al.\n\n\n[203 U.S. 399, 402]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Robert M. Hughes for Donald.\n\n\n[203 U.S. 399, 403]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case comes before us on a certificate from the circuit court of appeals. It is a libel brought by the owners of a steamer against the members of the Virginia Pilot Association, and seeks to hold them all liable for the alleged negligence of Guy, one of their number. For the proceedings in the district court see 127 Fed. 228, 135 Fed. 429. The negligence occurred when Guy was acting as pilot of the steamer and led to a collision, for which the owners of steamer paid damages to the other vessel in order to end a suit. The questions certified are (1) whether the members of \n\n[203 U.S. 399, 404]\n\u00a0\n the association are partners on the facts set forth; (2) whether, if partners, they are liable to owners of piloted vessels for the negligence of each other; (3) whether, if not technically partners, they nevertheless are so liable.\n The facts appear in the third article of the libel, which was excepted to, and in answers to interrogatories. They are as follows: The defendants are a voluntary, unincorporated association. By their agreement they take turns in boarding vessels required by law to take a pilot, and the fees, which otherwise would be paid to the pilot that boarded the vessel, are paid, except in cases of national vessels and disputed bills, to the association upon bills made out by it, and go into a common fund, from which the association pays the expenses of the business, including office rent. At the time of the accident the net profits were divided according to the number of days the several pilots were upon the active list. The constitution and by-laws of the association are exhibited and will be referred to. It is proper to add here a few words as to the Virginia law. By the Code of 1887 a board of commissioners is instituted to examine persons applying for branches as pilots; and the commissioners are given 'full authority to make such rules as they may think necessary for the proper government and regulation of pilots licensed by them.'  1955. There are details as to the qualification and classification of pilots and their duties, including a requirement as to boats, of the pilot 'or the company to which he belongs.'  1960. Acting as pilot without authority is punished.  1963. Certain vessels are required to take the first pilot that offers his services or to pay full pilotage.  1965. See  1976. The amount of pilotage is fixed.  1969. A personal liability is imposed for the amount, and it is to be noticed that it is a liability to the individual pilot employed.  1978. The pilot's right to collect his account is fortified by a penalty.  1979. The board of commissioners is authorized to decide any controversy between licensed pilots or between a pilot and the master, owner, or consignee of a vessel, and to enter judgment, \n\n[203 U.S. 399, 405]\n\u00a0\n which, if for money, may be collected by a sheriff, etc.  1980. But a judgment of suspension against a pilot is limited in general to between one and twelve months.  1981. And the board cannot decide upon the liability of 'a pilot' to any party injured by his negligence.  1982. Pilots demanding or receiving more or less than their lawful fees are subjected to a forfeiture.  1985. And certain further duties are prescribed.\n The rules of the board of commissioners provide for the appointment by them of a supervisory board from the pilot association, to report to the president of the board of commissioners all cases of insubordination, breach of rules, etc., or any misdemeanor, afloat or on shore, on the part of any member of the association. A pilot desiring to go off duty for five days or longer is required to apply to the board of commissioners. Suspensions, by whomsoever ordered, are to be reported within twenty-four hours to the president of the board, and are to be acted upon by the board. All pilots are required to look out for their turns, and each pilot is held responsible for whatever turn he may hold upon the list, officers being prohibited from having anything to do with the swapping of turns. It will be seen that the rules of the board, made under the authority of this statute, recognize the association, as does the Code, more vaguely, in  1960, quoted above. The rules also recognize the substitution of turns for the free competition of which there are traces in the Code. The rules tacitly assume that every pilot is a member of the association. All punishment and suspension is in the hands of the board, except, as may be added here, that the by-laws of the association impose a fine of $10 for a first violation of the rules of the association, of $20 for a second offense, and provide that a third shall be reported to the board of pilot commissioners. Thus substantially the whole government of the association is in the hands of the board.\n The questions certified very properly go beyond the question \n\n[203 U.S. 399, 406]\n\u00a0\n of the existence of a partnership. As long as the matter to be considered is debated in artificial terms there is a danger of being led by a technical definition to apply a certain name, and then to deduce consequences which have no relation to the grounds on which the name was applied. The substance of the case is this: A man who is responsible before the law is alleged to have committed a tort. It is proposed to make other men pay for it who not only have not commanded it or any act of which it was the natural consequence, but who would have prevented it if they could, and who have done what they could to prevent it, so far as the qualifications and employment of the pilot were not taken out of their hands by law. Why they should have to pay is the problem recurring through agency in all its forms, and whatever may be thought of some of the reasons that have been offered when the obligation has been imposed, it is certain that something more and better must be found than that the defendants divide the pay for the work that they have done, or that it is a convenience to the party aggrieved to discover a full purse to which to resort.\n Whether the ground be policy or tradition, such a liability is imposed, as we all know, in many cases. When a man is carrying on business in his private interest and intrusts a part of the work to another, the world has agreed to make him answer for that other as if he had done the work himself. But there is always a limitation. It is true that he is not excused by care in selection or orders sufficient to secure right conduct, if obeyed. But when he could not select, could not control, and could not discharge, the guilty man, he does not answer for his torts. As a familiar instance, the servants of an independent contractor are not the servants of the contractee. The liability of a vessel when in the hands of a compulsory pilot is not put upon the ground that the pilot is the agent or servant of the owners, and therefore does not bear upon the question. The China (The China v. Walsh) 7 Wall. 53, 19 L. ed. 67. Now, we are not curious to inquire what form of test shall be accepted as \n\n[203 U.S. 399, 407]\n\u00a0\n the most profound for the existence of a partnership when considering liability for debts; but it is plain that when we are considering a liability for torts under the circumstances supposed no stricter or different criterion ought to be applied than in those cases where agency is the admitted ground. The rule, however stated, presses to the verge of general principles of liability. It must not be pressed beyond the point for which we can find a rational support.\n So far as appears, the Virginia Pilot Association had no one of the three powers which we have mentioned. Seemingly it could neither select nor discharge its members, as certainly it could not control or direct them in the performance of their duties as pilots. To take the last first, it is quite plain that the Virginia Code contemplates a bond of mutual personal liability between the master of a vessel and the pilot on board. If we imagine such a pilot performing his duties within sight of the assembled association, he still would be sole master of his course. If all of his fellows passed a vote on the spot that he should change, and shouted it through a speaking trumpet, he would owe no duty to obey, but would be as free as before to do what he thought best. Then, as to the selection of members, there is no indication of any in the Code, the rules of the board, or the constitution and by-laws of the association. Nothing is said about membership, and the implication is plain that a condition of the association being permitted by the board to exist is that every pilot belongs to it. Probably, while it exists, a pilot scarcely would find it possible to compete from the outside. It is still plainer that the only provision for expulsion is that which would follow upon a pilot's being deprived of his license. The association has no power over that.\n All that there is upon which to base a joint liability is that the pilots, instead of taking their fees as they earn them, accomplish substantially the same result by mingling them in the first place, and then, after paying expenses, distributing them to those on the active list according to the number of \n\n[203 U.S. 399, 408]\n\u00a0\n days they respectively have been there. Apart from the possible slight difference between the proportion of days on the active list and days of active service, the case is the same as if each pilot kept his fees, merely contributing to keep up a common office from which his bills might be sent out and where a few details of common interest could be attended to. In the latter case this suit hardly would have been brought. The distinction between it and the one at bar is not great enough to justify a different result. See The City of Dundee, 47 C. C. A. 581, 108 Fed. 679, 684, 103 Fed. 696. The second and third questions certified are answered 'No.' \n\n\n\n","65":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHADDOCK v. HADDOCK(1906)\nNo. 119\nArgued: December 11, 1905Decided: April 16, 1906\n\n\n\n\n\n[201 U.S. 562, 564]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Abram J. Rose, William H. Willits, and Alfred C. Pette for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Henry Willis Smith, William T. Tomlinson, and William W. Smith for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n The plaintiff in error will be called the husband and the defendant in error the wife.\n The wife, a resident of the state of New York, sued the husband in that state in 1899, and there obtained personal service upon him. The complaint charged that the parties had been married in New York in 1868, where they both resided and where the wife continued to reside, and it was averred that the husband, immediately following the marriage, abandoned the wife, and thereafter failed to support her, and that he was the owner of property. A decree of separation from bed and board and for alimony was prayed. The answer admitted the marriage, but averred that its celebration was procured by the \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 565]\n\u00a0\n fraud of the wife, and that immediately after the marriage the parties had separated by mutual consent. It was also alleged that during the long period between the celebration and the bringing of this action the wife had in no manner asserted her rights, and was barred by her laches from doing so. Besides, the answer alleged that the husband had, in 1881 obtained in a court of the state of Connecticut a divorce which was conclusive. At the trial before a referee the judgment roll in the suit for divorce in Connecticut was offered by the husband and was objected to, first, because the Connecticut court had not obtained jurisdiction over the person of the defendant wife, as the notice of the pendency of the petition was by publication and she had not appeared in the action; and, second, because the ground upon which the divorce was granted, viz., desertion by the wife, was false. The referee sustained the objections and an exception was noted. The judgment roll in question was then marked for identification and forms a part of the record before us.\n Having thus excluded the proceedings in the Connecticut court, the referee found that the parties were married in New York in 1868, that the wife was a resident of the state of New York, that after the marriage the parties never lived together, and shortly thereafter that the husband, without justifiable cause, abandoned the wife, and has since neglected to provide for her. The legal conclusion was that the wife was entitled to a separation from bed and board and alimony in the sum of $780 a year from the date of the judgment. The action of the referee was sustained by the supreme court of the state of New York, and a judgment for separation and alimony was entered in favor of the wife. This judgment was affirmed by the court of appeals. As, by the law of the state of New York, after the affirmance by the court of appeals the record was remitted to the supreme court, this writ of error to that court was prosecuted.\n The Federal question is, Did the court below violate the Constitution of the United States by refusing to give to the \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 566]\n\u00a0\n decree of divorce rendered in the state of Connecticut the faith and credit to which it was entitled?\n As the averments concerning the alleged fraud in contracting the marriage and the subsequent laches of the wife are solely matters of state cognizance, we may not allow them to even indirectly influence our judgment upon the Federal question to which we are confined, and we, therefore, put these subjects entirely out of view. Moreover, as, for the purpose of the Federal issue, we are concerned not with the mere form of proceeding by which the Federal rights, if any, was denied, but alone have power to decide whether such right was denied, we do not inquire whether the New York court should preferably have admitted the record of the Connecticut divorce suit, and, after so admitting it, determined what effect it would give to it, instead of excluding the record, and thus refusing to give effect to the judgment. In order to decide whether the refusal of the court to admit in evidence the Connecticut decree denied to that decree the efficacy to which it was entitled under the full faith and credit clause, we must first examine the judgment roll of the Connecticut cause in order to fix the precise circumstances under which the decree in that cause was rendered.\n Without going into detail, it suffices to say that on the face of the Connecticut record it appeared that the husband, alleging that he had acquired a domicil in Connecticut, sued the wife in that state as a person whose residence was unknown, but whose last known place of residence was in the state of New York, at a place stated, and charged desertion by the wife and fraud on her part in procuring the marriage; and, further, it is shown that no service was made upon the wife except by publication and by mailing a copy of the petition to her at her last known place of residence in the state of New York.\n With the object of confining our attention to the real question arising from this condition of the Connecticut record, we state at the outset certain legal propositions irrevocably concluded by previous decisions of this court, and which are re- \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 567]\n\u00a0\n quired to be borne in mind in analyzing the ultimate issue to be decided.\n First. The requirement of the Constitution is not that some, but that full, faith and credit shall be given by states to the judicial decrees of other states. That is to say, where a decree rendered in one state is embraced by the full faith and credit clause, that constitutional provision commands that the other states shall give to the decree the force and effect to which it was entitled in the state where rendered. Harding v. Harding, \n198 U.S. 317\n, 49 L. ed. 1066, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 679.\n Second. Where a personal judgment has been rendered in the courts of a state against a nonresident merely upon constructive service, and, therefore, without acquiring jurisdiction over the person of the defendant, such judgment may not be enforced in another state in virtue of the full faith and credit clause. Indeed, a personal judgment so rendered is, by operation of the due process clause of the 14th Amendment, void as against the nonresident, even in the state where rendered; and, therefore, such nonresident, in virtue of rights granted by the Constitution of the United States, may successfully resist, even in the state where rendered, the enforcement of such a judgment. Pennoyer v. Neff, \n95 U.S. 714\n, 24 L. ed. 565. The facts in that case were these: Neff, who was a resident of a state other than Oregon, owned a tract of land in Oregon. Mitchell, resident of Oregon, brought a suit in a court of that state upon a money demand against Neff. The Oregon statutes required, in the case of personal action against a nonresident, a publication of notice, calling upon the defendant to appear and defend, and also required the mailing to such defendant at his last known place of residence of a copy of the summons and complaint. Upon affidavit of the absence of Neff, and that he resided in the state of California, the exact place being unknown, the publication required by the statute was ordered and made, and judgment by default was entered against Neff. Upon this judgment execution was issued and real estate of Neff was sold and was ultimately acquired by \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 568]\n\u00a0\n Pennoyer. Neff sued in the circuit court of the United States for the district of Oregon to recover the property, and the question presented was the validity in Oregon of the judgment there rendered against Neff. After the most elaborate consideration it was expressly decided that the judgment rendered in Oregon, under the circumstances stated was void for want of jurisdiction and was repugnant to the due process clause of the Constitution of the United States. The ruling was based on the proposition that a court of one state could not acquire jurisdiction to render personal judgment against a nonresident who did not appear by the mere publication of a summons, and that the want of power to acquire such jurisdiction by publication could not be aided by the fact that under the statutes of the state in which the suit against the nonresident was brought, the sending of a copy of the summons and complaint to the postoffice address in another state of the defendant was required and complied with. The court said (p. 727, L. ed. p. 570):\n'Process from the tribunals of one state cannot run into another state, and summon parties there domiciled to leave its territory and respond to proceedings against them. Publication of process or notice within the state where the tribunal sits cannot create any greater obligation upon the nonresident to appear. Process sent to him out of the state and process published within it are equally unavailing in proceedings to establish his personal liability.'\n\n And the doctrine thus stated but expressed a general principle expounded in previous decisions. Bischoff v. Wethered, 9 Wall. 812, 19 L. ed. 829. In that case, speaking of a money judgment recovered in the common pleas of Westminster hall, England, upon personal notice served in the city of Baltimore, Mr. Justice Bradley, J., speaking for the court, said (p. 814, L. ed. p. 830):\n'It is enough to say [of this proceeding] that it was wholly without jurisdiction of the person, and whatever validity it may have in England, by virtue of statute law, against property of the defendant there situate, it can have no validity here, even of a prima facie character. It is simply null.' \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 569]\n\u00a0\n Third. The principles, however, stated in the previous proposition, are controlling only as to judgments in personam, and do not relate to proceedings in rem. That is to say, in consequence of the authority which government possesses over things within its borders, there is jurisdiction in a court of a state by a proceeding in rem, after the giving of reasonable opportunity to the owner to defend, to affect things within the jurisdiction of the court, even although jurisdiction is not directly acquired over the person of the owner of the thing. Pennoyer v. Neff, supra.\n\n Fourth. The general rule stated in the second proposition is, moreover, limited by the inherent power which all governments must possess over the marriage relation, its formation and dissolution, as regards their own citizens. From this exception it results that where a court of one state, conformably to the laws of such state, or the state, through its legislative department, has acted concerning the dissolution of the marriage tie, as to a citizen of that state, such action is binding in that state as to such citizen, and the validity of the judgment may not therein be questioned on the ground that the action of the state in dealing with its own citizen concerning the marriage relation was repugnant to the due process clause of the Constitution. Maynard v. Hill, \n125 U.S. 190\n, 31 L. ed. 654, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 723. In that case the facts were these: Maynard was married in Vermont, and the husband and wife removed to Ohio, from whence Maynard left his wife and family and went to California. Subsequently he acquired a domicil in the territory of Washington. Being there so domiciled, an act of the legislature of the territory was passed granting a divorce to the husband. Maynard continued to reside in Washington, and there remarried and died. The children of the former wife, claiming in right of their mother, sued in a court of the territory of Washington to recover real estate situated in the territory, and one of the issues for decision was the validity of the legislative divorce granted to the father. The statute was assailed as invalid, on the ground that Mrs. \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 570]\n\u00a0\n Maynard had no notice, and that she was not a resident of the territory when the act was passed. From a decree of the supreme court of the territory adverse to their claim the children brought the case to this court. The power of the territorial legislature, in the absence of restrictions in the organic act, to grant a divorce to a citizen of the territory, was, however, upheld, in view of the nature and extent of the authority which government possessed over the marriage relation. It was therefore decided that the courts of the territory committed no error in giving effect within the territory to the divorce in question. And as a corollary of the recognized power of a government thus to deal with its own citizen by a decree which would be operative within its own borders, irrespective of any extraterritorial efficacy, it follows that the right of another sovereignty exists, under principles of comity, to give to a decree so rendered such efficacy as to that government may seem to be justified by its conceptions of duty and public policy.\n Fifth. It is no longer open to question that where husband and wife are domiciled in a state there exists jurisdiction in such state, for good cause, to enter a decree of divorce which will be entitled to enforcement in another state by virtue of the full faith and credit clause. It has, moreover, been decided that where a bona fide domicil has been acquired in a state by either of the parties to a marriage, and a suit is brought by the domiciled party in such state for divorce, the courts of that state, if they acquire personal jurisdiction also of the other party, have authority to enter a decree of divorce, entitled to be enforced in every state by the full faith and credit clause. Cheever v. Wilson, 9 Wall. 108, 19 L. ed. 604.\n Sixth. Where the domicil of matrimony was in a particular state, and the husband abandons his wife and goes into another state in order to avoid his marital obligations, such other state to which the husband has wrongfully fled does not, in the nature of things, become a new domicil of matrimony, and, therefore, is not to be treated as the actual or constructive \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 571]\n\u00a0\n domicil of the wife; hence, the place where the wife was domiciled when so abandoned constitutes her legal domicil until a new actual domicil be by her elsewhere acquired. This was clearly expressed in Barber v. Barber, 21 How. 582, 16 L. ed. 226, where it was said (p. 595, L. ed. p. 230):\n'The general rule is, that a voluntary separation will not give to the wife a different domiciliation in law from that of her husband. But if the husband, as is the fact in this case, abandons their domicil and his wife, to get rid of all those conjugal obligations which the marriage relation imposes upon him, neither giving to her the necessaries nor the comforts suitable to their condition and his fortune, and relinquishes altogether his marital control and protection, he yields up that power and authority over her which alone makes his domicil hers.'\n\n And the same doctrine was expressly upheld in Cheever v. Wilson, supra, where the court said (9 Wall. 123, 19 L. ed. 608):\n'It is insisted that Cheever never resided in Indiana; that the domicil of the husband is the wife's, and that she cannot have a different one from his. The converse of the latter proposition is so well settled that it would be idle to discuss it. The rule is that she may acquire a separate domicil whenever it is necessary or proper that she should do so. The right springs from the necessity for its exercise, and endures as long as the necessity continues.'\n\n Seventh. So also it is settled that where the domicil of a husband is in a particular state, and that state is also the domicil of matrimony, the courts of such state having jurisdiction over the husband may, in virtue of the duty of the wife to be at the matrimonial domicil, disregard an unjustifiable absence therefrom, and treat the wife as having her domicil in the state of the matrimonial domicil for the purpose of the dissolution of the marriage, and as a result have power to render a judgment dissolving the marriage which will be binding upon both parties, and will be entitled to recognition in all other states by virtue of the \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 572]\n\u00a0\n full faith and credit clause. Atherton v. Atherton, \n181 U.S. 155\n, 45 L. ed. 794, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 544.\n Coming to apply these settled propositions to the case before us, three things are beyond dispute: a. In view of the authority which government possesses over the marriage relation, no question can arise on this record concerning the right of the state of Connecticut within its borders to give effect to the decree of divorce rendered in favor of the husband by the courts of Connecticut, he being at the time when the decree was rendered domiciled in that state. b. As New York was the domicil of the wife and the domicil of matrimony, from which the husband fled in disregard of his duty, it clearly results from the sixth proposition that the domicil of the wife continued in New York. c. As then there can be no question that the wife was not constructively present in Connecticut by virtue of a martimonial domicil in that state, and was not there individually domiciled, and did not appear in the divorce cause, and was only constructively served with notice of the pendency of that action, it is apparent that the Connecticut court did not acquire jurisdiction over the wife within the fifth and seventh propositions; that is, did not acquire such jurisdiction by virtue of the domicil of the wife within the state or as the result of personal service upon her within its borders.\n These subjects being thus eliminated, the case reduces itself to this: Whether the Connecticut court, in virtue alone of the domicil of the husband in that state, had jurisdiction to render a decree against the wife under the circumstances stated, which was entitled to be enforced in other states in and by virtue of the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution. In other words, the final question is whether, to enforce in another jurisdiction the Connecticut decree, would not be to enforce in one state a personal judgment rendered in another state against a defendant over whom the court of the state rendering the judgment had not acquired jurisdiction? Otherwise stated, the question is this: Is a proceeding for divorce \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 573]\n\u00a0\n of such an exceptional character as not to come within the rule limiting the authority of a state to persons within its jurisdiction, but, on the contrary, because of the power which government may exercise over the marriage relation, constitutes an exception to that rule, and is therefore embraced either within the letter or spirit of the doctrine stated in the third or fourth propositions?\n Before reviewing the authorities relied on to establish that a divorce proceeding is of the exceptional nature indicated, we propose first to consider the reasons advanced to sustain the contention. In doing so, however, it must always be borne in mind that it is elementary that where the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution is invoked to compel the enforcement in one state of a decree rendered in another, the question of the jurisdiction of the court by which the decree was rendered is open to inquiry. And if there was no jurisdiction, either of the subject-matter or of the person of the defendant, the courts of another state are not required, by virtue of the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution, to enforce such decree. National Exch. Bank v. Wiley, \n195 \nU.S. 259, 269\n, 49 S. L. ed. 184, 190, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 70, and cases cited.\n I. The wide scope of the authority which government possesses over the contract of marriage and its dissolution is the basis upon which it is argued that the domicil within one state of one party to the marriage gives to such a state jurisdiction to decree a dissolution of the marriage tie which will be obligatory in all the other states by force of the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution. But the deduction is destructive of the premise upon which it rests. This becomes clear when it is perceived that if one government, because of its authority over its own citizens, has the right to dissolve the marriage tie as to the citizen of another jurisdiction, it must follow that no government possesses as to its own citizens, power over the marriage relation and its dissolution. For if it be that one government, in virtue of its authority over marriage, may dissolve the tie as to citizens of another \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 574]\n\u00a0\n government, other governments would have a similar power, and hence the right of every government as to its own citizens might be rendered nugatory by the exercise of the power which every other government possessed. To concretely illustrate: If the fact be that where persons are married in the state of New York either of the parties to the marriage may, in violation of the marital obligations, desert the other and go into the state of Connecticut, there acquiring a domicil, and procure a dissolution of the marriage which would be binding in the state of New York as to the party to the marriage there domiciled, it would follow that the power of the state of New York as to the dissolution of the marriage as to its domiciled citizen would be of no practical avail. And conversely, the like result would follow if the marriage had been celebrated in Connecticut and desertion had been from that state to New York, and consequently the decree of divorce had been rendered in New York. Even a superficial analysis will make this clear. Under the rule contended for it would follow that the states whose laws were the most lax as to length of residence required for domicil, as to causes for divorce and to speed of procedure concerning divorce, would in effect dominate all the other states. In other words, any person who was married in one state and who wished to violate the marital obligations, would be able, by following the lines of least resistance, to go into the state whose laws were the most lax, and there avail of them for the purpose of the severance of the marriage tie and the destruction of the rights of the other party to the marriage contract, to the overthrow of the laws and the public policy of the other states. Thus the argument comes necessarily to this,-that to preserve the lawful authority of all the states over marriage it is essential to decide that all the states have such authority only at the sufferance of the other states. And the considerations just stated serve to dispose of the argument that the contention relied on finds support in the ruling made in Maynard v. Hill, referred to in the fourth proposition, which was at the outset stated. For in that case \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 575]\n\u00a0\n the sole question was the effect within the territory of Washington of a legislative divorce granted in the territory to a citizen thereof. The upholding of the divorce within the territory was, therefore, but a recognition of the power of the territorial government, in virtue of its authority over marriage, to deal with a person domiciled within its jurisdiction. The case, therefore, did not concern the extraterritorial efficacy of the legislative divorce. In other words, whilst the ruling recognized the ample powers which government possesses over marriage as to one within its jurisdiction, it did not purport to hold that such ample powers might be exercised and enforced by virtue of the Constitution of the United States in another jurisdiction as to citizens of other states to whom the jurisdiction of the territory did not extend.\n The anomalous result which it is therefore apparent would arise from maintaining the proposition contended for is made more manifest by considering the instrument from which such result would be produced,-that is, the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution. No one denies that the states, at the time of the adoption of the Constitution, possessed full power over the subject of marriage and divorce. No one, moreover, can deny that, prior to the adoption of the Constitution, the extent to which the states would recognize a divorce obtained in a foreign jurisdiction depended upon their conceptions of duty and comity. Besides, it must be conceded that the Constitution delegated no authority to the government of the United States on the subject of marriage and divorce. Yet, if the proposition be maintained, it would follow that the destruction of the power of the states over the dissolution of marriage, as to their own citizens, would be brought about by the operation of the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution. That is to say, it would come to pass that, although the Constitution of the United States does not interfere with the authority of the states over marriage, nevertheless the full faith and credit clause of that instrument destroyed the authority of the states over the marriage rela- \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 576]\n\u00a0\n tion. And as the government of the United States has no delegated authority on the subject, that government would be powerless to prevent the evil thus brought about by the full faith and credit clause. Thus neither the states nor the national government would be able to exert that authority over the marriage tie possessed by every other civilized government. Yet more remarkable would be such result when it is borne in mind that, when the Constitution was adopted, nowhere, either in the mother country or on the continent of Europe, either in adjudged cases or in the treatises of authoritative writers, had the theory ever been upheld or been taught or even suggested that one government, solely because of the domicil within its borders of one of the parties to a marriage, had authority, without the actual or constructive presence of the other, to exert its authority by a dissolution of the marriage tie, which exertion of power it would be the duty of other states to respect as to those subject to their jurisdiction.\n II. It is urged that the suit for divorce was a proceeding in rem, and, therefore, the Connecticut court had complete jurisdiction to enter a decree as to the res, entitled to be enforced in the state of New York. But here again the argument is contradictory. It rests upon the theory that jurisdiction in Connecticut depended upon the domicil of the person there suing, and yet attributes to the decree resting upon the domicil of one of the parties alone a force and effect based upon the theory that a thing within the jurisdiction of Connecticut was the subject-matter of the controversy. But putting this contradiction aside, what, may we ask, was the res in Connecticut? Certainly it cannot in reason be said that it was the cause of action or the mere presence of the person of the plaintiff within the jurisdiction. The only possible theory, then, upon which the proposition proceeds, must be that the res in Connecticut, from which the jurisdiction is assumed to have arisen, was the marriage relation. But as the marriage was celebrated in New York between citizens \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 577]\n\u00a0\n of that state, it must be admitted under the hypothesis stated, that before the husband deserted the wife in New York the res was in New York, and not in Connecticut. As the husband, after wrongfully abandoning the wife in New York, never established a matrimonial domicil in Connecticut, it cannot be said that he took with him the marital relation from which he fled to Connecticut. Conceding, however, that he took with him to Connecticut so much of the marital relation as concerned his individual status, it cannot in reason be said that he did not leave in New York so much of the relation as pertained to the status of the wife. From any point of view, then, under the proposition referred to, if the marriage relation be treated as the res, it follows that it was divisible, and therefore there was a res in the state of New York and one in the state of Connecticut. Thus considered, it is clear that the power of one state did not extend to affecting the thing situated in another state. As illustrating this conception, we notice the case of Mississippi & M. R. Co. v. Ward, 2 Black, 485, 17 L. ed. 311. The facts in that case were these: A bill was filed in a district court of the United States for the district of Iowa to abate a nuisance alleged to have been occasioned by a bridge across the Mississippi river, dividing the states of Illinois and Iowa. Under the assumption that the nuisance was occasioned by the operation of the bridge on the Illinois side, the court, after pointing out that the United States circuit court for the district of Iowa exercised the same jurisdiction that a state court of Iowa could exercise, and no more, said ( p. 494, L. ed. p. 315):\n'The district court had no power over the local object inflicting the injury; nor any jurisdiction to inquire of the facts, whether damage had been sustained, or how much. These facts are beyond the court's jurisdiction and powers of inquiry, and outside of the case.'\n\n Nor is the conclusive force of the view which we have stated been met by the suggestion that the res was indivisible, and therefore was wholly in Connecticut and wholly in New York, \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 578]\n\u00a0\n for this amounts but to saying that the same thing can be at one and the same time in different places. Further, the reasoning above expressed disposes of the contention that, as the suit in Connecticut involved the status of the husband, therefore the courts of that state had the power to determine the status of the nonresident wife by a decree which had obligatory force outside of the state of Connecticut. Here, again, the argument comes to this,-that, because the state of Connecticut had jurisdiction to fix the status of one domiciled within its borders, that state also had the authority to oust the state of New York of the power to fix the status of a person who was undeniably subject to the jurisdiction of that state.\n III. It is urged that whilst marriage is, in one aspect, a contract, it is nevertheless a contract in which society is deeply interested, and, therefore, government must have the power to determine whether a marriage exists or to dissolve it, and hence the Connecticut court had jurisdiction of the relation and the right to dissolve it, not only as to its own citizen, but as to a citizen of New York who was not subject to the jurisdiction of the state of Connecticut. The proposition involves in another form of statement the non sequitur which we have previously pointed out; that is, that because government possesses power over marriage, therefore the existence of that power must be rendered unavailing.\n Nor is the contention aided by the proposition that because it is impossible to conceive of the dissolution of the marriage as to one of the parties in one jurisdiction without, at the same time, saying that the marriage is dissolved as to both in every other jurisdiction, therefore the Connecticut decree should have obligatory effect in New York as to the citizen of that state. For, again, by a change of form of statement, the same contention which we have disposed of is reiterated. Besides, the proposition presupposes that because, in the exercise of its power over its own citizens, a state may determine to dissolve the marriage tie by a decree which is efficacious \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 579]\n\u00a0\n within its borders, therefore such decree is in all cases binding in every other jurisdiction. As we have pointed out at the outset, it does not follow that a state may not exert its power as to one within its jurisdiction simply because such exercise of authority may not be extended beyond its borders into the jurisdiction and authority of another state. The distinction was clearly pointed out in Blackinton v. Blackinton, 141 Mass. 432, 55 Am. Rep. 484, 5 N. E. 830. In that case the parties were married and lived in Massachusetts. The husband abandoned the wife without cause and became domiciled in New York. The wife remained at the matrimonial domicil in Massachusetts and instituted a proceeding to prohibit her husband from imposing any restraint upon her personal liberty and for separate maintenance. Service was made upon the husband in New York. The court, recognizing fully that under the circumstances disclosed the domicil of the husband was not the domicil of the wife, concluded that, under the statutes of Massachusetts, it had authority to grant the relief prayed, and was then brought to determine whether the decree ought to be made, in view of the fact that such decree might not have extraterritorial force. But this circumstance was held not to be controlling, and the decree was awarded. The same doctrine was clearly expounded by the Privy Council, in an opinion delivered by Lord Watson, in the divorce case of Le Mesurier v. Le Mesurier \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 1895]\n\u00a0\n A. C. 517, where it was said (p. 527):\n'When the jurisdiction of the court is exercised according to the rules of international law, as in the case where the parties have their domicil within its forum, its decree dissolving their marrage ought to be respected by the tribunals of every civilized country. . . . On the other hand, a decree of divorce a vinculo, pronounced by a court whose jurisdiction is solely derived from some rule of municipal law peculiar to its forum, cannot, when it trenches upon the interests of any other country to whose tribunals the spouses were amenable, claim extraterritorial authority.'\n\n IV. The contention that if the power of one state to decree \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 580]\n\u00a0\n a dissolution of a marriage which would be compulsory upon the other states be limited to cases where both parties are subject to the jurisdiction, the right to obtain a divorce could be so hampered and restricted as to be in effect impossible of exercise, is but to insist that in order to favor the dissolution of marriage and to cause its permanency to depend upon the mere caprice or wrong of the parties, there should not be applied to the right to obtain a divorce those fundamental principles which safeguard the exercise of the simplest rights. In other words, the argument but reproduces the fallacy already exposed, which is, that one state must be endowed with the attribute of destroying the authority of all the others concerning the dissolution of marriage in order to render such dissolution easy of procurement. But even if the true and controlling principles be for a moment put aside and mere considerations of inconvenience be looked at, it would follow that the preponderance of inconvenience would be against the contention that a state should have the power to exert its authority concerning the dissolution of marriage as to those not amenable to its jurisdiction. By the application of that rule each state is given the power of overshadowing the authority of all the other states, thus causing the marriage tie to be less protected than any other civil obligation, and this to be accomplished by destroying individual rights without a hearing and by tribunals having no jurisdiction. Further, the admission that jurisdiction in the courts of one state over one party alone was the test of the right to dissolve the marriage tie as to the other party, although domiciled in another state, would at once render such test impossible of general application. In other words, the test, if admitted, would destroy itself. This follows, since if that test were the rule, each party to the marriage in one state would have a right to acquire a domicil in a different state and there institute proceedings for divorce. It would hence necessarily arise that domicil would be no longer the determinative criterion, but the mere race of diligence between the parties in seeking differ- \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 581]\n\u00a0\n ent forums in other states or the celerity by which in such states judgments of divorce might be procured would have to be considered in order to decide which forum was controlling.\n On the other hand, the denial of the power to enforce in another state a decree of divorce rendered against a person who was not subject to the jurisdiction of the state in which the decree was rendered obviates all the contradictions and inconveniences which are above indicated. It leaves uncurtailed the legitimate power of all the states over a subject peculiarly within their authority, and thus not only enables them to maintain their public policy, but also to protect the individual rights of their citizens. It does not deprive a state of the power to render a decree of divorce susceptible of being enforced within its borders as to the person within the jurisdiction, and does not debar other states from giving such effect to a judgment of that character as they may elect to do under mere principles of state comity. It causes the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution to operate upon decrees of divorce in the respective states just as that clause operates upon other rights,-that is, it compels all the states to recognize and enforce a judgment of divorce rendered in other states where both parties were subject to the jurisdiction of the state in which the decree was rendered, and it enables the states rendering such decrees to take into view, for the purpose of the exercise of their authority, the existence of a matrimonial domicil from which the presence of a party not physically present within the borders of a state may be constructively found to exist.\n Having thus disposed of the reasoning advanced to sustain the assertion that the courts of the state of New York were bound by the full faith and credit clause to give full effect to the Connecticut decree, we are brought to consider the authorities relied upon to support that proposition.\n Whilst the continental and English authorities are not alluded to in the argument, it may be well, in the most summary way, to refer to them as a means of illustrating the \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 582]\n\u00a0\n question for consideration. The extent of the power which independent sovereignties exercised over the dissolution of the marriage tie, as to their own citizens, gave rise, in the nature of things, to controversies concerning the extraterritorial effect to be given to a dissolution of such tie when made between citizens of one country by judicial tribunals of another country in which such citizens had become domiciled. We do not deem it essential, however, to consider the conflicting theories and divergent rules of public policy which were thus engendered. We are relieved of the necessity of entering upon such an inquiry, since it cannot be doubted that neither the practice nor the theories controlling in the countries on the continent lend the slightest sanction to the contention that a government, simply because one of the parties to a marriage was domiciled within its borders, where no matrimonial domicil ever existed, had power to render a decree dissolving a marriage, which, on principles of international law, was entitled to obligatory extraterritorial effect as to the other party to the marriage, a citizen of another country. 1 Wharton, Confl. L. 3d ed.  209, p. 441, and notes.\n It cannot be doubted, also, that the courts of England decline to treat a foreign decree of divorce as having obligatory extraterritorial force when both parties to the marriage were not subject to the jurisdiction of the court which rendered the decree. Shaw v. Gould, L. R. 3 H. L. 55; Harvey v. Farnie, L. R. 8 App. Cas. 43. And, although it has been suggested in opinions of English judges treating of divorce questions, that exceptional cases might arise which perhaps would justify a relaxation of the rigor of a presumption that the domicil of the husband was the domicil of the wife (per Lords Eldon and Redesdale, in Tovey v. Lindsay, 1 Dow, P. C. 133, 140; per Lord Westbury, in Pitt v. Pitt, 4 Macq. H. L. Cas. 640; per Brett, L. J., in Niboyet v. Niboyet, L. R. 4 Prob. Div. 14; Briggs v. Briggs, L. R. 5 Prob. Div. 165; and per James and Cotton, L. JJ., in Harvey v. Farnie, L. R. 6 Prob. Div. 47, 49), the courts of England, in cases where the jurisdiction was dependent upon domicil, have enforced \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 583]\n\u00a0\n the presumption, and treated the wife as being within the jurisdiction where the husband was legally domiciled. But this conception was not a departure from the principle uniformly maintained, that, internationally considered, jurisdiction over both parties to a marriage was essential to the exercise of power to decree a divorce, but was simply a means of determining by a legal presumption whether both parties were within the jurisdiction. Of course, the rigor of the English rule as to the domicil of the husband being the domicil of the wife is not controlling in this court, in view of the decisions to which we have previously referred, recognizing the right of the wife, for the fault of the husband, to acquire a separate domicil. Barber v. Barber, 21 How. 582, 16 L. ed. 226; Cheever v. Wilson, 9 Wall. 108, 19 L. ed. 604; Atherton v. Atherton, \n181 U.S. 155\n, 45 L. ed. 794, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 544.\n And even in Scotland, where residence, as distinguished from domicil, was deemed to authorize the exercise of jurisdiction to grant divorces, it was invariably recognized that the presence within the jurisdiction of both parties to the marriage was esseential to authorize a decree in favor of the complainant. 1 Wharton, Confl. L.  215, p. 447; per Lord Westbury, in Shaw v. Gould, L. R. 3 H. L. 88.\n As respects the decisions of this court: We at once treat as inapposite, and therefore unnecessary to be here specially reviewed, those holding (a) that where the domicil of a plaintiff in a divorce cause is in the state where the suit was brought, and the defendant appears and defends, as both parties are before the court, there is power to render a decree of divorce which will be entitled in other states to recognition under the full faith and credit clause (Cheever v. Wilson, supra); (b) that, as distinguished from legal domicil, mere residence within a particular state of the plaintiff in a divorce cause brought in a court of such state is not sufficient to confer jurisdiction upon such court to dissolve the marriage relation existing between the plaintiff and a nonresident defendant. Andrews v. Andrews, \n188 U.S. 14\n, 47 L. ed. 366, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 237; Streitwolf v. Streitwolf, \n181 U.S. 179\n, 45 L. ed. 807, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 553; Bell v. Bell, \n181 U.S. 175\n, 45 L. ed. 804, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 551. This brings us to again consider \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 584]\n\u00a0\n a case heretofore referred to, principally relied upon as sustaining the contention that the domicil of one party alone is sufficient to confer jurisdiction upon a judicial tribunal to render a decree of divorce having extraterritorial effect, viz., Atherton v. Atherton, \n181 U.S. 155\n, 45 L. ed. 794, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 544. The decision in that case, however, as we have previously said, was expressly placed upon the ground of matrimonial domicil. This is apparent from the following passage, which we excerpt from the opinion, at page 171, L. ed. at page 803, and Sup. Ct. Rep. at page 550;\n'This case does not involve the validity of a divorce granted, on constructive service, by the court of a state in which only one of the parties ever had a domicil; nor the question to what extent the good faith of the domicil may be afterwards inquired into. In this case the divorce in Kentucky was by the court of the state which had always been the undoubted domicil of the husband, and which was the only matrimonial domicil of the husband and wife. The single question to be decided is the validity of that divorce, granted after such notice had been given as was required by the statutes of Kentucky.'\n\n The contention, therefore, that the reasoning of the opinion demonstrates that the domicil of one of the parties alone was contemplated as being sufficient to found jurisdiction, but insists that the case decided a proposition which was excluded in unmistakable language. But, moreover, it is clear, when the facts which were involved in the Atherton Case are taken into view, that the case could not have been decided merely upon the ground of the domicil of one of the parties, because that consideration alone would have afforded no solution of the problem which the case presented. The salient facts were these: The husband lived in Kentucky, married a citizen of New York, and the married couple took up their domicil at the home of the husband in Kentucky, where they continued to reside and where children were born to them. The wife left the matrimonial domicil and went to New York. The husband sued her in Kentucky for a divorce. Before the \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 585]\n\u00a0\n Kentucky suit merged into a decree the wife, having a residence in New York sufficient, under ordinary circumstances, to constitute a domicil in that state, sued the husband in the courts of New York for a limited divorce. Thus the two suits, one by the husband against the wife and the other by the wife against the husband, were pending in the respective states at the same time. The husband obtained a decree in the Kentucky suit before the suit of the wife had been determined, and pleaded such decree in the suit brought by the wife in New York. The New York court, however, refused to recognize the Kentucky decree, and the case came here, and this court decided that the courts of New York were bound to give effect to the Kentucky decree by virtue of the full faith and credit clause. Under these conditions it is clear that the case could not have been disposed of on the mere ground of the individual domicil of the parties, since upon that hypothesis, even if the efficacy of the individual domicil had been admitted, no solution would have been thereby afforded of the problem which would have risen for decision, that problem being which of the two courts wherein the conflicting proceedings were pending had the paramount right to enter a binding decree. Having disposed of the case upon the principle of matrimonial domicil, it cannot in reason be conceived that the court intended to express an opinion upon the soundness of the theory of individual and separate domicil which, isolatedly considered, was inadequate to dispose of, and was, therefore, irrelevant to, the question for decision.\n It is contended that an overwhelming preponderance of the decisions of state courts enforce the doctrine that it is the duty of the states, by virtue of the full faith and credit clause, to give within their borders the full effect required by that clause to decrees of divorce rendered in other states, where there was jurisdiction alone by virtue of the domicil of one of the parties. Whilst we may not avoid the duty of interpreting for ourselves the Constitution of the United States, in view of the persuasive force that would result if an overwhelming \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 586]\n\u00a0\n line of state decisions held the asserted doctrine, we come to consider that subject. To examine in detail the many decisions of state courts of last resort, most of which are referred to in the margin, would expand this opinion to undue length. To avoid so doing, if possible, we propose to more particularly direct our attention to the cases in state courts which are specially relied on. In doing so we shall add cases in several of the states not particularly counted on in the argument. We shall do this for the purpose of evolving, if possible, from the state cases thus to be referred to, some classification typical of all the state decisions, hence enabling all the cases to which we do not specially refer to be brought within the appropriate class to which they pertain, without the necessity of reviewing thme in detail. We shall not confine ourselves to the particular state decisions relied on, but shall consider such decisions in the light of the general rule obtaining in the particular state.\n Cases relating to the validity and extraterritorial effect of a decree of divorce rendered upon constructive notice:\n Turner v.

State, 28 Ala. 12; Harding v. Alden, 9 Me. 140, 23 Am. Dec. 549; Ditson v. Ditson, 4 R. I. 87; Burlen v. Shannon, 115 Mass. 438, and Felt v. Felt, 59 N. J. Eq. 606, 47 L. R. A. 546, 83 Am. St. Rep. 612, 45 Atl. 105, 49 Atl. 1071, to which we shall add, for the purposes above stated, cases on the same subject decided in New York, Ohio, Wisconsin, Indiana, and Missouri.\n NEW YORK.-It is not questioned that the courts of New York are vested by statute with authority to render decrees of divorce where the plaintiff is domiciled within the state, which shall be operative in that state, even although the defendant is a nonresident and is proceeded against by constructive service.\n Borden v. Fitch, 15 Johns. 121, 8 Am. Dec. 225, and Bradshaw v. Heath, 13 Wend. 407, were decided, respectively, in the years 1818 and 1835. These cases, as declared by the court of appeals of New York in People v. Baker, 76 N. Y. 78, 82, 32 Am. Rep. 274, upheld the principle that a court of another state could not dissolve the matrimonial relation of a citizen of New York, domiciled in New York, unless he was actually served with notice within the other state or voluntarily appeared in the cause. The doctrine that an action of divorce is one inter partes was thus clearly reiterated by Andrews, J., in Jones v. Jones, 108 N. Y. 415, 424, 2 Am. St. Rep. 447, 451, 15 N. E. 707, 709.\n'The contract of marriage cannot be annulled by judicial sanction any more than any other contract inter partes, without jurisdiction of the person of the defendant. The marriage relation is not a res within the state of the party invoking the jurisdiction of a court to dissolve it, so as to authorize the court to bind the absent party, a citizen of another jurisdiction, by substituted service or actual notice of the proceeding given without the jurisdiction of the court where the proceeding is pending.'\n\n That the principle referred to is still enforced by the New York court is shown by recent cases, viz., Lynde v. Lynde, 162 N. Y. 405, 48 L. R. A. 679, 76 Am. St. Rep. 332, 56 N. E. 979; Winston v. Winston, 165 N. Y. 553, 59 N. E. 273, and the case at bar. And it is indubitable that under this doctrine the \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 588]\n\u00a0\n courts of New York have invariably refused, as they have done in the case at bar, to treat a divorce rendered in another state, under the circumstances stated, as entitled to be enforced in New York by virtue of the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution of the United States; and, indeed, have refused generally to give effect to such decrees even by state comity.\n MASSACHUSETTS.-Barber v. Root, 10 Mass. 260; Hanover v. Turner, 14 Mass. 227, 7 Am. Dec. 203, and Harteau v. Harteau, 14 Pick. 181, 25 Am. Dec. 372, were decided, respectively, in 1813, 1817, and 1833. In 1835 the legislature of Massachusetts incorporated into the statutes of that state, following a section forbidding the recognition of divorces obtained in another jurisdiction in fraud of the laws of Massachusetts, a provision reading as follow: 'In all other cases, a divorce decreed in another state or country, according to the law of the place, by a court having jurisdiction of the cause and of both of the parties, shall be valid and effectual in this state.' And it may be observed that this section, when submitted to the legislature by the commissioners for revising the Massachusetts statutes, was accompanied by the following comment (Rept. Comrs., pt. 1, p. 123): 'This is founded on the rule established by the comity of all civilized nations; and is proposed merely that no doubt should arise on a question so interesting and important as this may sometimes be.'\n In Lyon v. Lyon (1854) 2 Gray, 367, the question was as to the validity in Massachusetts of a divorce decreed in Rhode Island in favor of one party to a marriage against the other, who was domiciled in Massachusetts. The court refused to give extraterritorial effect to the Rhode Island decree. In the opinion by Chief Justice Shaw it was declared that the three cases which we have previously referred to sustained the doctrine, based upon general principles of law, that a decree of divorce rendered in another state without jurisdiction of both of the parties possessed no extraterritorial force.\n In Hood v. Hood (1865) 11 Allen, 196, 87 Am. Dec. 709, the controversy was \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 589]\n\u00a0\n this: The parties were married in Massachusetts, and, after a residence in that state, moved together to Illinois. The wife left the domicil of the husband in Illinois and returned to Massachusetts. Thereafter, in Illinois, the husband used the wife for a divorce on the ground of her desertion, obtained a decree, and married again. The case decided in Massachusetts was a suit brought in that state by the former wife against the former husband for divorce on the ground of adultery alleged to have been committed by him with the person whom he had married after the decree of divorce in Illinois had been rendered. The Illinois decree was pleaded in bar. The question whether the Illinois decree should be given extraterritorial effect in Massachusetts depended, under the rule announced in the previous cases, upon whether both the husband and wife were parties to the Illinois decree. For the purpose of the determination of this jurisdictional question it was held that it was necessary to ascertain whether the wife was justified, by the fault of the husband, in leaving him in Illinois and going back to Massachusetts. It was decided that if she was justified in leaving the husband, her legal domicil was in Massachusetts, and she was not a party to the Illinois decree, and that if she was not justified in living separate from the husband, the ordinary rule being that the domicil of the husband was the domicil of the wife, she was domiciled in Illinois, and must be considered as subject to the jurisdiction of the Illinois court. Applying this legal principle to the facts in the case before it, the court held that as there was no evidence showing that the wife had justifiable cause for leaving her husband, the legal presumption that the domicil of the husband was the domicil of the wife prevailed, and that the Illinois decree was entitled to extraterritorial effect in Massachusetts, and bound the wife, because rendered by a court having jurisdiction over both parties.\n In Shaw v. Shaw (1867) 98 Mass. 158, the facts were these: The parties were married in Massachusetts, lived there, and left together for the purpose of settling in Colorado. \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 590]\n\u00a0\n On the journey, at Philadelphia, the wife was forced by the extreme cruelty of the husband to leave him. She returned to Massachusetts, while he went on to Colorado. Subsequently the wife used in Massachusetts for a divorce from bed and board. The husband was brought in by substituted service and defaulted. The court, in the most explicit terms, recognized that a decree of divorce, to have extraterritorial effect, must be rendered with jurisdiction over both parties. It said (p. 159): 'For the purposes of divorce the general rule of jurisprudence is that a divorce granted in the place of the domicil of both parties, and there valid, is good everywhere.' The court came then to consider whether it could render a decree in Massachusetts in favor of the wife. This depended upon a statute of Massachusetts, which authorized the granting of a divorce where the cause for divorce occurred while the parties had lived together as husband and wife in Massachusetts, and where one of them lived in that state when the cause for divorce occurred. It was held that as at the time of the commission of the cruelty in Philadelphia charged against the husband the domicil of the parties in Massachusetts had not been lost, and as by that cruelty the wife was justified in returning to Massachusetts, and the subsequent acquisition of a new domicil by the husband in Colorado did not make such domicil that of the wife, there was jurisdiction, and the divorce was granted.\n Hood v. Hood (1872) 110 Mass. 463, was an attempt again to assail the validity of the Illinois decree of divorce which had been adjudged valid in 11 Allen, 196, 87 Am. Dec. 709, because it was found that both the husband and wife had been parties to the decree. The Massachusetts decree so holding was therefore held to be res judicata as to all persons, and to foreclose further inquiry into the validity of the Illinois decree of divorce.\n In Burlen v. Shannon (1874) 115 Mass. 438, the facts leading up to the controversy and those involved therein were as follows: Shannon and his wife lived together in Massa- \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 591]\n\u00a0\n chusetts, where she left him. Without stopping to refer to prior legal controversies which arose between Shannon and his wife and between Shannon and Mrs. Burlen, which are irrelevant to be considered, it suffices to say that Mrs. Burlen sued Shannon in 1850 to hold him liable for necessary supplies furnished to the wife. Shannon resisted on the ground that the wife had been living apart from him without his fault or consent, and this defense was maintained. 3 Gray, 387. Shannon went to Indiana in 1855 and took up his domicil in that state, where, in 1856, he obtained a decree of divorce upon constructive service. Subsequently, in Massachusetts, Mrs. Burlen again sued Shannon for necessaries furnished to the wife between February 22, 1860, and February 7, 1866. He pleaded the Indiana divorce, and the validity of the divorce was assailed by Mrs. Burlen on the ground that the wife had not been a party to the divorce cause, and therefore the Indiana decree had not extraterritorial effect in Massachusetts. The court, in effect, after reiterating the previous rulings and referring to the statute concerning the necessity for the presence of both parties within the jurisdiction where a decree for divorce of another state was sought to be given effect in Massachusetts, also reiterated the previous ruling that the wife might acquire a separate domicil from the husband if she lived separate from him for justifiable cause. The court was brought, therefore, to consider whether Mr. and Mrs. Shannon were both parties to the Indiana decree on the ground that the domicil of the husband was the domicil of the wife. The solution of this question depended as it had depended in Hood v. Hood, 11 Allen, 196, 87 Am. Dec. 709, upon whether the wife was absent from the husband because of his fault. On this subject it was decided that the previous judgment in favor of Shannon and against Mrs. Burlen in the prior action between the parties had conclusively determined between them that Mrs. Shannon was absent from her husband without his fault or consent, and therefore, under the legal presumption that the domicil of the husband was the domicil of the wife, both \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 592]\n\u00a0\n the husband and wife were parties to the Indiana decree and it was not subject to attack in Massachusetts. To cite, as has sometimes been done, the language of the opinion of the court referring to the previous judgment in the earlier action between Mrs. Burlen and Shannon as if that language referred to the Indiana decree of divorce, leading to the implication that that decree was held to be conclusive, even if only one of the parties was domiciled, in the state where the decree was rendered, not only is a plain misconception, but is equivalent to asserting that the Massachusetts court had overruled its previous decisions and disregarded the spirit, if not the letter, of the state statute without the slightest intimation to that effect.\n In Cummington v. Belchertown, 149 Mass. 223, 4 L. R. A. 131, 21 N. E. 435, the facts were these: The parties to a marriage, celebrated in Massachusetts, lived together in that state until the wife was taken to a Massachusetts asylum for the insane, when the husband abandoned her, acquired a domicil in New York, there brought suit on the ground of fraud for the annulment of the marriage, and obtained a decree. The wife was only constructively served with process, did not appear, and was not represented. The Massachusetts court held, upon the authority of the Blackinton Case, 141 Mass. 432, 55 Am. Rep. 484, 5 N. E. 830, to which we have already referred, that if the decree was to be recognized in Massachusetts, it could only be on grounds of comity. And in concluding its opinion the court said:\n'Upon the ground, then, that the decree of the New York court attempts to annul a marriage in Massachusetts between Massachusetts citizens, and thus affect the legal status of the woman, who has remained domiciled in Massachusetts, and has never been within the jurisdiction of the New York court, and deprive her of the rights acquired by her marriage, and especially because it declares the marriage void for a reason on account of which by the Massachusetts law it cannot be avoided, we are of opinion that it should not be enforced here, and that \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 593]\n\u00a0\n no principle of interstate comity requires that we should give it effect.'\n\n True it is the court reserved the question as to what effect might be given to a divorce if granted by a New York court under circumstances such as existed in that case. But, as a suit for a declaration of nullity and one for divorce are both but modes for determining judicially the status of the parties, it must in reason follow if jurisdiction over both is a prerequisite in the one class, it is of necessity also essential in the other.\n MAINE.-In Harding v. Alden (1832) 9 Me. 140, 23 Am. Dec. 549, the facts were these: While living together in Maine a husband deserted his wife. He went to North Carolina, where he pretended to marry, and lived there with another woman. In the meantime the wife whom he had deserted took up her residence in Rhode Island, where she sued for a divorce on the ground of the adultery committed by the husband in North Carolina. The husband, who was notified in North Carolina, did not appear in the Rhode Island divorce cause. A decree of divorce was granted and the wife then remarried. The first husband, during the coverture, owned and alienated real estate in Maine, and a statute of that state provided that where a divorce was decreed for adultery by the husband, dower might be assigned to the divorced wife in the same manner as if the husband were dead. The divorced wife brought an action of dower in a court in Maine. The Rhode Island decree was held to possess validity in Maine and the statute relating to dower was decided not to be limited to divorces decreed within the state of Maine. Considering the opinion in its entirety, it is plain that the Rhode Island divorce was given recognition from considerations of right and justice and upon the ground of state comity. Thus, the court called attention to the fact that adultery was a cause for divorce in both states and that divorces were granted in Maine against nonresidents, and it was observed that 'there would be great inconvenience in holding' that divorces ought not to be recognized in other states when granted in the state where the injured party \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 594]\n\u00a0\n resided, against one who had established his domicil in another state and there committed adultery.\n True it is in the course of the opinion reasoning was employed tending to show that the Rhode Island court might be considered to have had jurisdiction in the complete sense and it was intimated that the full faith and credit clause might have application, but the operation of the Rhode Island decree in Maine was, by the decree of the Maine court, expressly limited to the dissolution of the marriage (P. 151.) How far removed this was from giving to the Rhode Island decree the benefit of the full faith and credit clause will, we think, be made clear by what follows.\n Harding v. Alden was decided at the July term, 1832. Less than two years afterward, on March 5, 1834 (1 Maine Laws, chap. 71,  4), the statute of Maine regulating divorces was supplemented by various provisions, one such being the following: 'Sec. 2. Be it further enacted, That in all cases where one party has been or shall be divorced from the bonds of matrimony, the court granting the same may, upon application therefor, grant to the other party a like divorce, on such terms and conditions as the said court in the exercise of a sound discretion may judge reasonable.' This provision was carried into the Revised Statutes of 1841, chap. 89,  2, and although repealed in 1850, in a general revision of the divorce laws, it was held that the legislature did not intend to deprive the courts of Maine of the power to entertain a suit for divorce brought by a person from whom the other party to a marriage had already been divorced, and that the courts of Maine still possessed power to exercise jurisdiction over such suits. Stilphen v. Stilphen, 58 Me. 508, 4 Am. Rep. 305. In the cited case, although a husband had already obtained an absolute divorce, a like divorce was granted to the wife, and the court allowed to her certain articles of personal property and the sum of $500. In overruling exceptions to the decree the appellate court adopted the theory that the second decree in nowise impugned the first, and was 'important only as enabling the court to make \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 595]\n\u00a0\n such ancillary decrees concerning the property as justice may seem to require.' (P. 517, Am. Rep. p. 309.) In the course of the opinion the court said (p. 516, Am. Rep. p. 308):\n'There is no class of cases in which the court is so liable to be imposed upon, and a decision obtained contrary to the truth, as ex parte divorce suits. The notice is often imperfect, so that the confession of guilt implied in the default is deceptive. And it is well known that witnesses, testifying in the presence of one of the parties, and in the absence of the other, will so alter and magnify the faults of the absent, and suppress everything that makes against the party present, that it is impossible to tell where the truth and real merits of the controversy are. When both parties are present, each is sure to put the other in the wrong; and, a fortiori is this true when one of the parties is permitted to testify in the absence of the other, as is now the case in divorce suits. We repeat, therefore, that there is no class of cases in which the court is so liable to be imposed upon; and it seems to us of the utmost importance that the court should be possessed of the power in some form to revise their decisions in this class of cases; otherwise, the grossest injustice is liable to be done.'\n\n In the light of this decision it cannot be assumed that the courts of Maine would give to a citizen of that state against whom a divorce had been obtained in a foreign jurisdiction, upon constructive service, a less degree of relief than they afford as to a decree rendered in Maine, both parties being present and bound by the decree.\n RHODE ISLAND.-Ditson v. Ditson (1856) 4 R. I. 87, was a suit for divorce on the grounds of desertion, extreme cruelty, and nonsupport, brought by a wife domiciled in Rhode Island against the husband, who had never resided in Rhode Island, and whose whereabouts was unknown. The question was whether the Rhode Island court ought to exercise jurisdiction. The opinion was mainly devoted to refuting the reasoning employed by Chief Justice Shaw in his opinion in the case of Lyon v. Lyon, 2 Gray, 367, in which case, as we have previously \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 596]\n\u00a0\n shown, the Massachusetts court refused to give effect to a Rhode Island decree of divorce where both parties were not within the jurisdiction. The Rhode Island court (in the Ditson Case) in effect declared that it would not exercise jurisdiction to grant a divorce if it considered that a decree rendered by it would not be entitled to extraterritorial effect because of a lack of actual jurisdiction over the defendant. The court, however, proceeded to reason that a suit for divorce was in effect a proceeding in rem, and that jurisdiction over one of the parties to a suit for the dissolution of the marriage tie drew to the court jurisdiction of the other party, and thereby gave full and complete jurisdiction over the status of both parties, and upon that hypothesis decided that it would exercise jurisdiction, and that its decree dissolving the marriage would be entitled to the benefit of the full faith and clause of the Constitution and have binding efficacy in every other state.\n NEW JERSEY.-Whilst the courts of New Jersey have exercised the power to grant a divorce from a nonresident defendant, upon constructive service, those courts have from the beginning applied to similar decrees of divorce granted in other states, when sought to be enforced in New Jersey against citizens of that state, a rule like the one prevailing in New York; that is, they decline to enforce them even upon the principles of comity. Doughty v. Doughty, 28 N. J. Eq. 581, 586; Flower v. Flower, 42 N. J. Eq. 152, 7 Atl. 669. Recently, however, it has been decided (Felt v. Felt, 59 N. J. Eq. 606, 47 L. R. A. 546, 83 Am. St. Rep. 612, 45 Atl. 105, 49 Atl. 1071) that where a decree of divorce was rendered in another state, and the complainant alone was subject to the jurisdiction of the court, but it was shown that the defendant had been personally served outside of the jurisdiction with notice of the pendency of the divorce proceeding, and was afforded reasonable opportunity to make defense, and did not avail of the opportunity, effect would be given to such decree in New Jersey, upon principles of comity, provided that the ground upon which the decree rested was one which the public policy of New Jersey \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 597]\n\u00a0\n recognized as a sufficient cause for divorce. In Wallace v. Wallace, 62 N. J. Eq. 509, 50 Atl. 788, the subject is quite fully reviewed.\n OHIO.-In Cooper v. Cooper (1836) 7 Ohio, pt. 2, p. 238, without citation of authority, a divorce granted in Indiana, from a resident of Ohio, upon constructive service, was held to bar an application for divorce and alimony in Ohio. In Mansfield v. MoIntyre (1840) 10 Ohio, 27, despite a divorce obtained in Kentucky by a husband, upon constructive service, the divorced wife was regarded in Ohio as the widow of her former husband after his decease, and as such widow entitled to dower.\n In Cox v. Cox, 19 Ohio St. 502, 2 Am. Rep. 415, decided at the December term, 1869, the facts were these: The husband deserted the wife in Ohio, went to Indiana, and there obtained a divorce, upon constructive service. The wife remained in Ohio, and three years after the granting of the Indiana divorce to the husband she sued him for divorce and for alimony, alleging abandonment and gross neglect of duty. The trial court granted a divorce and alimony. The husband appealed, but as such an appeal, under the statutes of Ohio, did not affect the decree as to the divorce, the district court considered only the question of alimony, and rendered a new decree for alimony against the defendant. The case was then taken to the supreme court of the state. In that court attention was called to the fact that under the statutes of Ohio and the decisions of its courts jurisdiction might be exercised over nonresidents in divorce cases, and reference was made to various authorities as tending to show that public policy required the recognition of the validity of such decrees in other states as to the dissolution of the marriage. After stating the facts, and observing that the wife was entitled under the laws of Ohio to either divorce or alimony, or both, at her election, and alluding to the Indiana decree, the court said (p. 512, Am. Rep. p. 417):\n'The question, therefore, is whether the ex parte decree can be made available, not merely to effect a dissolution of the marriage, but to defeat the right of the petitioner to the ali- \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 598]\n\u00a0\n mony which the statute, upon the facts as they exist in regard to the husband's desertion, intended to provide for her.\n\n'We think the decree ought not to have such effect.\n\n'In arriving at this conclusion we make no distinction between a decree rendered, under the circumstances of this case, in a foreign, and one rendered in a domestic, forum.\n\n'In either case, to give to a decree thus obtained the effect claimed for it would be to allow it to work a fraud upon the pecuniary rights of the wife. Such a result, in our opinion, is rendered necessary by no principle of comity or public policy,-the only grounds upon which ex parte decrees of divorce are authorized and supported.\n\n'It is not essential to the allowance of alimony that the marriage relation should subsist up to the time it is allowed. On appeal, alimony may be decreed by the district court, notwithstanding the subsisting divorce pronounced by the court of common pleas. It is true that the statute speaks of the allowance as being made to the wife. But the term 'wife' may be regarded as used to designate the person, and not the actual existing relation; or the petitioner may still be regarded as holding the relation of wife for the purpose of enforcing her claim to alimony.'\n\n The following cases were cited by the court as sustaining the right of the wife to maintain an independent proceeding for alimony, even after the husband had obtained a divorce: Richardson v. Wilson, 8 Yerg. 67; Crane v. Meginnis, 1 Gill & J. 464, 19 Am. Dec. 237; and Shotwell v. Shotwell, Smedes & M. Ch. 51.\n In Doerr v. Forsythe (1893) 50 Ohio St. 726, 40 Am. St. Rep. 703, 35 N. E. 1055, an Indiana divorce granted to a husband, upon constructive service, was held not to bar the right of the wife to dower in lands in Ohio owned during coverture by the husband.\n ALABAMA.-In Thompson v. State (1856) 28 Ala. 12, the facts were these: Thompson deserted his family in Mississippi, went to Arkansas, and there obtained a divorce upon constructive service. The wife returned to her father's home in Alabama, and, after the divorce, the husband also went to \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 599]\n\u00a0\n Alabama, where he again married. He was prosecuted for and convicted of bigamy. The conviction was set aside, however, upon the ground that the guilt or innocence of the accused depended upon the question as to whether he had a bona fide domicil in Arkansas during the pendency of the proceedings for divorce. Harding v. Alden, 9 Me. 140, 23 Am. Dec. 549, was cited as authority.\n In a subsequent case, however (Turner v. Turner \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 1870]\n\u00a0\n 44 Ala. 437), the supreme court of Alabama strictly limited, as against a citizen of Alabama, the effect of divorce rendered in another state upon constructive service. The parties were married in Alabama, where the husband deserted the wife, and located in Indiana, where he obtained a divorce upon constructive service. The wife remained in Alabama, and, after the granting of the divorce to the husband, she sued him in Alabama for a divorce and alimony. The husband pleaded the Indiana decree in bar. The trial court, however, held that the wife was entitled to maintain her suit, and entered a decree for divorce and alimony. In affirming the decree the supreme court of Alabama, upon the authority of Thompson v. State, supra said that the decree of divorce obtained by the husband in Indiana might protect him against prosecution for bigamy should he marry again in Alabama. Referring to that decree it further said (p. 450):\n'But without stopping to inquire whether it was obtained by him by fraud, and therefore is vicious on that account or not, it certainly cannot affect the rights of the complainant, except her right in the husband as husband. If it is valid, it unmarries him and sets him free from his marital vows to her. He is no longer the complainant's husband. But it does not settle her right to alimony; it does not settle her right to dower in his lands, and her statutory right to distribution of his property in this state, in the event she should survive him, nor any other interest of a pecuniary character she may have against him. . . . It is the duty of the state to protect its own citizens, within its own borders. This is the \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 600]\n\u00a0\n natural compensation for allegiance. This high duty extends to all the pecuniary rights of the citizens, as well as to the rights of security of person. . . . No obligation of comity is paramount to this duty. Without a constant and effective exertion of it, citizenship would become a farce . . . . The wife is as much the citizen of the state as the husband, and is entitled to the protection of its laws to the same extent, so long as she remains within its jurisdiction. It would be a scandal to justice to imperil her, and sacrifice her most important and cherished rights upon a mere technicality,-a technicality that often contradicts the truth. When her protection requires it, it would be cruelly unjust for the state of her actual residence and domicil to repudiate its own right of jurisdiction to give her aid. I therefore think that the better opinion is that she has the right to file her bill here, and to all the relief that the court could give her, notwithstanding her husband might not be domiciled in this state at the commencement and during the whole pendency of her litigation with him. . . .\n\n'Then, if the state courts have competent jurisdiction in such a case, as undoubtedly they have, they may go on and exercise that jurisdiction in the manner and to the extent prescribed by their own laws.\n\n'Under the laws of this state, by the contract and consummation of a marriage, the wife, if she has no separate estate, becomes entitled to dower in the husband's lands, and a certain distributive interest in his personal estate, if she survives him, and to temporary and permanent alimony out of his estate, upon a separation by divorce in her favor. These are right that she cannot legally be deprived of without her consent or her fault. . . . If this were not so, then these important statutory provisions in favor of the wife would be repealed or rendered null by a foreign divorce, of which she had no notice and no knowledge, during its whole progress through the forms of a foreign court. To sue in her own domicil is necessary for the protection of the wife. It, therefore, \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 601]\n\u00a0\n overrides the technical rule that the husband's domicil is also the domicil of the wife. . . . Here the testimony shows that the wife has no separate estate. The witnesses for the defendants say when she was married she 'brought nothing with her.' It also appears that during her connection nection with the defendant, Matthew Turner, as his wife she was a chaste, industrious, economical, faithful, useful, and obedient wife; and that the husband's property is very considerable, worth possibly not less than $100, 000. It is also shown that his three children by a former marriage are already ready sufficiently provided for.\n\n'Under such a state of facts the sum of $30,000 was not an unreasonable sum for permanent alimony to be allowed to the wife, not the sum of $800 too large for temporary alimony.'\n\n INDIANA.-In Tolen v. Tolen (1831) 2 Blackf. 407, 20 Am. Dec. 742, the facts were these: A wife, on being deserted in Kentucky, removed to and became domiciled in Indiana, and after a residence there of five years sued for a divorce from the nonresident husband. In an opinion of great length the court considered the question of its power to grant a divorce which would be valid in Indiana, and decided it had such power, but expressly reserved passing on the question whether the decree would have extraterritorial force.\n In Hood v. State (1877) 56 Ind. 263, 271, 26 Am. Rep. 21, it was declared that as an ex parte divorce in favor of one domiciled within the jurisdiction of a state, and against a nonresident, although founded upon constructive service, was vaild as to the plaintiff, 'public policy demands that it should be held valid as to both parties.'\n In Hilbish v. Hattle (1896) 145 Ind. 59, 33 L. R. A. 783, 44 N. E. 20, certain sections of the Indiana Revised Statutes, wherein it was provided that the divorce of one party to a marriage should dissolve the contract as to both, and that a divorce decreed in another state by a court having jurisdiction of the cause should have full effect in Indiana, were held to be applicable to a decree of \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 602]\n\u00a0\n divorce granted in another state, in favor of a husband, upon constructive service, and the same effect was given to the decree, as to the rights of the wife in the property of the husband in Indiana, as if the divorce had been rendered in Indiana.\n MISSOURI.-In Gould v. Crow, 57 Mo. 200, a decree of divorce regularly obtained by a husband in Indiana, on an order of publication, without personal service, was held to operate as a divorce in favor of the husband in Missouri, so as to prevent the wife from claiming her dower in lands in Missouri owned by the husband. Harding v. Alden, supra, was relied upon as authority. A statute of Missouri, barring the claim of a wife for dower after divorce granted by reason of her fault, was held to apply to all divorces, whether obtained in Missouri or in other states, and whether obtained on personal service or by order of publication. The doctrine of Gould v. Crow was reaffirmed and applied in Anthony v. Rice, 110 Mo. 233, 19 S. W. 423.\n WISCONSIN.-In Shafer v. Bushnell (1869) 24 Wis. 372, an ex parte divorce granted a wife in Minnesota upon constructive service of the defendant, a citizen of Minnesota, was held upon the grounds of comity to be conclusive in Wisconsin in respect to the status or domestic and social condition of the wife. The decree was held to bar an action for criminal intercourse against the person whom the complainant in the divorce suit married after the granting of the divorce.\n In Cook v. Cook (1882) 56 Wis. 195, 43 Am. Rep. 706, 14 N. W. 33, 443, however, in an elaborate opinion, an ex parte divorce obtained in Michigan upon constructive service merely, by a husband who had deserted his wife in Wisconsin, was held not to affect the status of the wife in Wisconsin, nor to bar her from suing in Wisconsin for divorce, alimony, allowance, and a division of the property of such husband situated within Wisconsin.\n Deducing the law of the several states from the rulings of their courts of last resort which we have just reviewed, and ignoring mere minor differences, the law of such states is embraced within one or the other of the following headings: \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 603]\n\u00a0\n a. States where the power to decree a divorce is recognized, based upon the mere domicil of the plaintiff, although the decree when rendered will be but operative within the borders of the state, wholly irrespective of any force which may be given such decree in other states. Under this heading all of the states are embraced with the possible exception of Rhode Island.\n b. States which decline, even upon principles of comity, to recognize and enforce as to their own citizens, within their own borders, decrees of divorce rendered in other states, when the court rendering the same had jurisdiction over only one of the parties. Under this heading are embraced Massachusetts, New Jersey (with the qualification made by the decision in 59 N. J. Eq. 606, 47 L. R. A. 546, 83 Am. St. Rep. 612, 45 Atl. 105, 49 Atl. 1071), and New York.\n c. States which, whilst giving some effect to decrees of divorce rendered against its citizens in other states where the court had jurisdiction of the plaintiff alone, either place the effect given to such decrees upon the principle of state comity alone, or make such limitations upon the effect given to such decree as indubitably establishes that the recognition given is a result merely of state comity. As the greater includes the less, this class of course embraces the cases under the previous heading. It also includes cludes the states of Alabama, Maine, Ohio, and Wisconsin.\n d. Cases which, although not actually so deciding, yet lend themselves to the view that ex parte decrees of divorce rendered in other states would receive recognition by virtue of the due faith and credit clause. And this class embraces Missouri and Rhode Island.\n Coming to consider, for the purpose of classification, the decided cases in other states than those previously reviewed, which have been called to our attention, the law of such states may be said to come under one or the other of the foregoing headings, as follows:\n Proposition a embraces the law of all the states, since in the decision of no state is there an intimation expressing the ex- \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 604]\n\u00a0\n ception found in the Rhode Island case which caused us to exclude that state from this classification.\n Under proposition b comes the law of the states of Pennsylvania, Vermont, and South Carolina. A line of decisions of the state of North Carolina would also cause us to embrace the law of that state within this classification, but for a doubt engendered in our minds as to the effect of the law of North Carolina on the subject, resulting from suggestions made by the North Carolina court in the opinion in Bidwell v. Bidwell, 139 N. C. 402, 52 S. E. 58.\n Proposition c embraces the law of Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, and New Hampshire. And it is pertinent here to remark that in Michigan (3 Mich. Comp. Laws \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 1897]\n\u00a0\n 8617, chap. 232,  2) the obtaining of a divorce in another state from a citizen of Michigan is made cause for the granting of a divorce in Michigan to its citizen. A like provision is also in the statutes of Florida. Fla. Rev. Stat. (1902)  1480\n\n\n Under proposition d we embrace the remaining states, although as to several the classification may admit of doubt, viz., California, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, and Tennessee.\n It indubitably, therefore, follows from the special review we have made of cases in certain states, and the classification just made of the remaining state cases which were called to our attention and which we have previously cited in the margin, that the contention is without foundation, that such cases establish by an overwhelming preponderance that, by the law of the several states, decrees of divorce obtained in a state with jurisdiction alone of the plaintiff are, in virtue of the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution, entitled to be enforced in another state as against citizens of such state. Indeed, the analysis and classification which we have made serves conclusively to demonstrate that the limited recognition which is given in most of the states to such ex parte decress of divorce rendered in other states is wholly inconsistent with the theory that such limited recognition is based \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 605]\n\u00a0\n upon the operation of the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution of the United States, and, on the contrary, is consistent only with the conception that such limited recognition as is given is based upon state comity. No clearer demonstration can be made of the accuracy of this statement than the obvious consequence that if the full faith and credit clause were now to be held applicable to the enforcement in the states generally of decrees of divorce of the character of the one here involved it would follow that the law of nearly all of the states would be overthrown, and thus it would come to pass that the decisions which were relied upon as establishing that the due faith and credit clause applies to such decrees would be overruled by the adoption of the proposition which it is insisted those decisions maintain. The only escape from this conclusion would be to say that the law of the states as shown by the decisions in question would remain unaffected by the ruling of the full faith and credit clause, because not repugnant to that clause. This would be, however, but to assert that the full faith and credit clause required not that full faith and credit be given in one state to the decrees of another state, but that only a limited and restricted enforcement of a decree of one state in another would fulfil the requirements of that provision of the Constitution. To so decide would be to destroy the true import of the full faith and credit clause, as pointed out in the outset of this opinion. Thus, in its ultimate aspect, the proposition relied upon reduces itself to this,-either that the settled law of most of the states of the Union as to divorce decrees rendered in one state, where the court rendering the decree had jurisdiction only of the plaintiff, must be held to be invalid, or that an important provision of the Constitution of the United States must be shorn of its rightful meaning.\n Without questioning the power of the state of Connecticut to enforce within its own borders the decree of divorce which is here in issue, and without intimating a doubt as to the power of the state of New York to give to a decree of that character \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 606]\n\u00a0\n rendered in Connecticut, within the borders of the state of New York and as to its own citizens, such efficacy as it may be entitled to in view of the public policy of that state, we hold that the decree of the court of Connecticut rendered under the circumstances stated was not entitled to obligatory enforcement in the state of New York by virtue of the full faith and credit clause. It therefore follows that the court below did not violate the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution in refusing to admit the Connecticut decree in evidence; and its judgment is, therefore, affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice Brown, with whom were Mr. Justice Harlan, Mr. Justice Brewer, and Mr. Justice Holmes, dissenting:\n Marriage between these parties was solemnized June 4, 1868. They separated the same day, without a consummation, and have never lived together since. No martrimonial domicil was ever established in New York or elsewhere. Defendant left New York soon after the wedding, drifted about the country for several years, and finally settled in Connecticut in 1877; remained there twelve years, during which time, and in 1881, he obtained a divorce in the superior court of Litchfield county, which he now sets up in defense of this action.\n Plaintiff took no steps for twenty-six years to obtain legal separation or maintenance, when, in July, 1894, she applied to the superior court of the state of New York for a summons by publication. The defendant did not appear, and a decree was rendered against him by default, separating the parties and granting alimony of $1,500 a year. This decree appears to have been abortive, so far as respects alimony, at least, probably for lack of personal service on the defendant. Meantime, and in 1891, defendant had inherited a considerable property from his father.\n This action was begun by a summons dated June 3, 1899, thirty-one years after the marriage; was served upon the de- \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 607]\n\u00a0\n fendant, who answered December 18, 1899, setting up, amongst other things, the decree of the superior court of Litchfield county, dissolving the marriage, the validity of which presents the only Federal question in this case.\n\n 1. \nThis decree is attacked upon the ground that the Connecticut court acted without jurisdiction of the parties lawfully obtained. The record in that case shows that notice of the pendency of the petition was ordered to be published in a Litchfield paper, and also that a copy of the petition be sent to the respondent by mail, postage paid, at Tarrytown, New York. While there is no affidavit of the publication of the notice, there is a recital in the decree 'that said complaint and writ have been duly served upon the defendant pursuant to an order of notice made thereon by the clerk of this court.' This is sufficient prima facie evidence of the publication to entitle the record to be received. Applegate v. Lexington & C. County Min. Co. \n117 \nU.S. 255, 268\n, 29 S. L. ed. 892, 896, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 742, wherein it was said by the court that 'while it must be conceded that, in order to give the court jurisdiction over the persons of the defendants, all the steps pointed out by the statute to effect constructive service on nonresidents were necessary, yet it does not follow that the evidence that the steps were taken must appear in the record, unless, indeed, the statute, expressly or by implication, requires it. . . . Therefore every presumption not inconsistent with the record is to be indulged in, in favor of its jurisdiction. . . . It is to be presumed that the court, before making its decree, took care to see that its order for constructive service, on which its right to make the decree sepended, had been obeyed.'\n As the record was rejected for reasons appearing only upon its face, it is unnecessary to decide where the recitals in the decree can be contradicted. Possibly the New York court might have assailed its validity by showing that, notwithstanding the recitals in the record, the court acquired no jurisdiction of the defendant by failure to comply with the order of the court with reference to the publication of notice in a newspaper, \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 608]\n\u00a0\n or in sending a copy of the petition and complaint to the defendant by mail at Tarrytown, New York, the last known place of residence. The fact that the referee refused to admit the record, even as prima facie evidence, foreclosed any defense founded upon the actual failure to obtain jurisdiction over the defendant.\n There is no doubt of the proposition that a decree of divorce may be lawfully obtained at the matrimonial domicil, notwithstanding that the defendant may have taken up his or her residence separate from the other party in another state, providing that the law of the domicil with respect to the personal service or publication be scrupulously observed. Atherton v. Atherton, \n181 U.S. 155\n, 45 L. ed. 794, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 544.\n Doubtless the jurisdiction of the court granting the divorce may be inquired into, and if it appear that the plaintiff had not acquired a bona fide domicil in that state at the time of instituting proceedings, the decree is open to a collateral attack (Bell v. Bell, \n181 U.S. 175\n, 45 L. ed. 804, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 551), and a recital in the proceedings of a fact necessary to show jurisdiction may be contradicted (Thompson v. Whitman, 18 Wall. 457, 21 L. ed. 897; Streitwolf v. Streitwolf, \n181 U.S. 179\n, 45 L. ed. 807, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 550; Andrews v. Andrews, \n188 U.S. 14\n, 47 L. ed 366, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 237).\n Subject to these conditions, each state has the right to regulate the marital status of its citizens, at least so far as to determine in what manner and by whom marriages may be solemnized, what shall be deemed the age of consent, what obligations are assumed, what property rights are created, for what causes divorces shall be granted, for what length of time the domicil of plaintiff shall have been acquired prior to the institution of the proceedings, and in what manner notice shall be given to the defendant. Nor is the power of the legislature in this connection ousted by the fact that the other party to the contract resides in another state, provided that in case of proceedings adverse to such party he or she shall be given such notice as due process of law requires. If such proceedings be in rem or quasi in rem, notice by publication is ordinarily deemed sufficient. But in case of actions in per- \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 609]\n\u00a0\n sonam for the recovery of damages, personal service within the jurisdiction is vital to the proceedings. Pennoyer v. Neff, \n95 U.S. 714\n, 24 L. ed. 565; Huling v. Kaw Valley R.& Improv Co. \n130 U.S. 559\n, 32 L. ed. 1045, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 603.\n By the laws of Connecticut of 1878 (chap. 71, p. 305) exclusive jurisdiction is given to the superior courts to grant divorces for several causes, among which are 'wilful desertion for three years with total neglect of duty,' with a further provision (Rev. Stat.  4555) that plaintiff shall have continuously resided in the state three years next before the date of the complaint, with certain exceptions not material to be noticed. A further provision,  4553, that, 'where the adverse party resides out of, or is absent from, the state, or the whereabouts of the adverse party is unknown to the plaintiff, any judge or clerk of the supreme court of errors, or of the superior court, or any county commissioner, may make such order of notice as he may deem reasonable, and such notice having been given and duly proved to the court, it may hear such complaint; if it finds that the defendant has actually received notice that the complaint is pending, and if it shall not appear that the defendant has had such notice, the court may hear such case, or, if it see cause, order such further notice to be given as it may deem reasonable, and continue the complaint until the order is complied with.'\n The complaint alleged a wilful desertion of the plaintiff for more than three years, and the court found this to be the fact.\n\n 2. \nThe case turns upon the question whether the superior court of Litchfield county gained jurisdiction by a residence of the plaintiff within the state for more than three years. The testimony also showed that the defendant had acquired a separate domicil in New York, and had been living there for about thirteen years.\n In discussing this question two propositions may be admitted at once, and discarded as having no relevancy to the case:\n\n 1. \nThat a judgment for damages in an action in personam is valid only when personal service has been made upon the \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 610]\n\u00a0\n defendant within the jurisdiction of the court rendering the judgment. This disposes at once of the cases of Pennoyer v. Neff, supra; and of Mississippi & M. R. Co. v. Ward, 2 Black, 485, 17 L. ed. 311, where an Iowa court had undertaken to abate a nuisance on the Illinois side of the Mississippi river; and of Delaware, L. & W. R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n198 U.S. 342\n, 49 L. ed. 1077, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 669, where a state had attempted to tax property having a permanent situs in another state.\n\n 2. \nThat the courts of one state may not grant a divorce against an absent defendant to any person who has not acquired a bona fide domicil in that state. The same rule applies if he has removed thither solely for the purpose of acquiring a domicil and obtaining a divorce for a cause which would have been insufficient in the state from which he removed. Andrews v. Andrews, \n188 U.S. 14\n, 47 L. ed. 366, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 237.\n The jurisdiction of the Connecticut court in this case is shown not by the facts as they appear in this case, but from the record in that case, and primarily from the petition, which, under the practice in that state, is incorporated with the summons. The allegations are:\n'On the first day of January, 1869, the defendant wilfully deserted the plaintiff, and has continued said desertion, with total neglect of all the duties of the marriage on her part to be performed to the date of this writ, being for more than three years, and during the plaintiff's residence in this state.'\n\n It is conceded that such desertion is good ground for a divorce in Connecticut, which may be granted to a plaintiff who has continuously resided in the state three years next before the date of the complaint. The complaint obviously made a case for divorce under the statute. The court found that the complaint and writ had been duly served on the defendant, pursuant to an order of notice made thereon by the clerk; that the allegations of the complaint had been sustained, and a divorce was granted.\n The case then resolves itself into the single question whether a divorce granted to a plaintiff lawfully domiciled within a \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 611]\n\u00a0\n state as against a defendant domiciled in another state, who has been served by publication or letter only, is a valid defense to a suit by the latter for a separation and alimony.\n Certain cases in this court tend strongly to support the proceedings in Connecticut. Strader v. Graham, 10 How. 82, 13 L. ed. 337, was an action to recover the value of certain slaves carried into Ohio, a free state. The case was dismissed, as involving a question of the local law of Kentucky, the court remarking: 'Every state has an undoubted right to determine the status, or domestic and social condition, of the persons domiciled within its territory, . . . and . . . it was exclusively in the power of Kentucky [wherein the suit was brought] to determine for itself whether their employment in another state should or should not make them free on their return.'\n In Barber v. Barber, 21 How. 582, 16 L. ed. 226, a New York court decreed a separation and alimony to the wife. The husband removed to Wisconsin for the purpose of placing himself beyond the jurisdiction of the court which could enforce it, and there obtained a divorce a vinculo upon the ground of abandonment. The sole question raised by the record was: 'Whether a wife divorced a mensa et thoro can acquire another domiciliation in a state of this Union different from that of her husband, to entitle her, by her next friend, to sue him in a court of the United States, having equity jurisdiction, to recover from him alimony due, and which he refuses to make arrangements to pay; and whether a court of equity is not a proper tribunal for a remedy in such a case.'\n It was a suit to recover upon a judgment obtained in New York before proceedings instituted in Wisconsin, and was sustained. Obviously, the Wisconsin divorce was no defense, but its validity was not impugned.\n Cheever v. Wilson, 9 Wall. 109, 19 L. ed. 604, turned upon certain rights of property, and incidentally upon a divorce obtained in Indiana, in a suit in which the defendant appeared. The case, however, is valuable for two questions decided: First, that a decree of divorce, valid and effectual by the laws of the state \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 612]\n\u00a0\n in which it was obtained, is valid and effectual in all other states; second, that a wife may acquire a domicil different from her husband's whenever it is necessary or proper that she should have such a domicil; and on such a domicil, if the case otherwise allow it, may institute proceedings for divorce, though it be neither her husband's domicil nor have been the domicil of the parties at the time of the marriage, or of the offense.\n Of course, it follows that if the wife may obtain a new domicil, her husband may do likewise, as was done in this case, after the separation or abandonment had taken place. In delivering the opinion, Mr. Justice Swayne observed: 'The decree [of divorce] was valid and effectual according to the law and adjudications in Indiana.'\n The Constitution and laws of the United States give the decree the same effect elsewhere which it had in Indiana. \"If a judgment is conclusive in the state where it is rendered, it is equally conclusive everywhere,' in the courts of the United States.'\n In Cheely v. Clayton, \n110 U.S. 701\n, 28 L. ed. 298, 4 Sup. Ct. Rep. 328, a divorce obtained in a territorial court, upon notice by publication insufficient under the laws of the territory, was held to be of no effect. The court, however, observing: 'If a wife is living apart from her husband without sufficient cause, his domicil is in law her domicil; and in the absence of any proof of fraud or misconduct on his part, a divorce obtained by him in the state of his domicil, after reasonable notice to her, either by personal service or by publication, in accordance with its laws, is valid, although she never in fact resided in that state,' citing Burlen v. Shannon, 115 Mass. 439, and Hunt v. Hunt, 72 N. Y. 217, 28 Am. Rep. 129.\n In Maynard v. Hill, \n125 U.S. 190\n, 31 L. ed. 654, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 723, a legislative divorce was upheld, and it was said that the fact that no cause existed for the divorce, and that it was obtained without the knowledge of the wife, cannot affect the validity of the act. It was further said that though the conduct of the husband merited the strongest reprobation, his abandonment of his wife, his loose \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 613]\n\u00a0\n morals, and shameless conduct could have no bearing upon the power of the assembly to pass the act.\n Four recent decisions in this court are too important to pass unnoticed. In Bell v. Bell, \n181 U.S. 175\n, 45 L. ed. 804, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 551, and in Streitwolf v. Streitwolf, \n181 U.S. 179\n, 45 L. ed. 807, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 550, it was held that a divorce obtained in a state in which neither party was domiciled, upon service by publication, and in another state, was entitled to no faith and credit. These decisions were unanimous. And in Andrews v. Andrews, supra, that a divorce obtained by one who had gone into another state to procure a divorce, in fraud of the law of the domicil, was also invalid.\n There remains the case of Atherton v. Atherton, \n181 U.S. 155\n, 45 L. ed. 794, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 544, a divorce obtained by a husband in Kentucky, which had been the matrimonial domicil, though the wife had been absent from the state for several months, and apparently had attempted to acquire a new domicil in New York. The court took care to confine the case to the one point decided, namely, the validity of a divorce obtained at the matrimonial domicil. The court, out of abundant caution, expressly disclaimed that the case involved the validity of a divorce granted, on constructive service, by the court of a state in which only one of the parties ever had a domicil; nor the question to what extent the good faith of the domicil may be afterwards inquired into. 'In this case, the divorce in Kentucky was by the court of the state which had always been the undoubted domicil of the husband, and which was the only matrimonial domicil of the husband and wife. The single question to be decided is the validity of that divorce, granted after such notice had been given as was required by the statutes of Kentucky.'\n While the Atherton Case, as already stated, was confined to a divorce obtained at the matrimonial domicil, the cases cited by Mr. Justice Gray in his opinion relate to divorces obtained in a state which was the domicil only of the complaining party, and are practically the same as those cited by him in his opinion as chief justice of Massachusetts in Burlen v. Shannon, 115 Mass. 438. In reading the two cases together one is \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 614]\n\u00a0\n strongly impressed with the idea that in the Atherton Case he had the former case in mind, and gave it such approval as the facts in the latter case would warrant. Not only had the court of appeals of Kentucky decided that a wife residing in that state was entitled to obtain a decree of divorce against her husband who had left the state (Rhyms v. Rhyms, 7 Bush, 316; Perzel v. Perzel, 91 Ky. 634, 15 S. W. 658), but a number of cases from other states were cited holding to the same principle.\n The opinion of the court in the present case admits that where the domicil of the husband is also the domicil of matrimony, the courts of that domicil may disregard an unjustifiable absence of the wife therefrom, and treat her as having her domicil there for the purpose of dissolving the marriage as to both parties, and that such dissolution would be recognized in all other states by virtue of the full faith and credit clause, citing to this effect Atherton v. Atherton, supra, and, as a corollary therefrom, it is admitted that no question can arise concerning the right of the state of Connecticut to give effect to a decree of divorce rendered in favor of the husband while domiciled in that state. The question is, undoubtedly, as stated, whether the Connecticut court, in virtue of the domicil of the husband in that state, had jurisdiction to render a decree against the wife which was entitled to be enforced in other states, under the full faith and credit clause.\n I deny, however, that the final question is whether this would be enforcing a personal judgment rendered in another state against the defendant, over whom the court rendering the judgment had not acquired jurisdiction. A proceeding for divorce is not in personam nor of an exceptional character, except so far as all proceedings in rem are governed by a different rule from that applicable to proceedings in personam. The validity of the latter class depends upon personal service of the defendant being obtained within the jurisdiction. The validity of the former depends upon the jurisdiction of the court over the res-in this case the marriage relation, the domicil of the plaintiff, and such jurisdiction over the defendant as as is consonant \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 615]\n\u00a0\n with the general principles of the Constitution with regard to due process of law.\n The propositions of the opinion, as we understand it, may be summarized as follows:\n That, if one government, by virtue of its authority over marriage, may dissolve the tie as to citizens of another government, that other government would have a similar power, and hence the right of every government over its own citizens might be rendered nugatory by the exercise of the power which every other government possesses. To illustrate by the present case: That, if the husband may desert his original domicil in New York, go to the state of Connecticut, acquire a domicil there, and procure a divorce which would be binding in New York as to the party there domiciled, it would follow that the power of the state of New York as to the dissolution of the marriage, as to its domiciled citizen, would be of no practical avail. The opinion, however, fails to state the logical result of this proposition, viz., that no divorce would be possible in either state without a personal service upon the other within the state. If the husband, having his domicil in Connecticut, could not obtain a divorce against his wife domiciled in New York without a personal service, it follows that the wife, domiciled in New York, could not obtain a divorce against her husband in that state without a personal service there.\n Undoubtedly the laws of some states are more liberal upon the subject of divorce than those of other states, but that does not affect the question. If the complaining party has acquired a domicil in the state in which he institutes proceedings, he is entitled to the benefit of the laws of that state with respect to the causes of divorce.\n It is argued that, as the Constitution delegated no authority to the government of the United States on the subject of marriage and divorce, yet, if the validity of the Connecticut divorce in this case be sustained, it follows that the destruction of the power of the states over the dissolution of marriage of its own citizens would be brought about by the full faith and credit \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 616]\n\u00a0\n clause of the Constitution. But this was the very point decided in the Atherton Case, where a divorce obtained in Kentucky by publication was held good in New York, as against a proceeding by the wife for a divorce in that state. It is true that the matrimonial domicil was in Kentucky. But this does not affect the proposition asserted in the opinion, that the decree did work a dissolution of the marriage, as to her, by the operation of the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution, and to that extent it did work a destruction of the power of the state of New York over the dissolution of the marriage. But the argument to that effect was not considered by this court to be sound. It does undoubtedly follow that the res, that is, the marriage relation, was as much in the state of New York as it was in the state of Connecticut, but it does not follow that the action of the Connecticut court with respect to that res is not as much obligatory in New York as in Connecticut. It is of the very essence of proceedings in rem that the decree of a court with respect to the res, whether it be a vessel, a tract of land, or the marriage relation, is entitled to be respected in every other state or country. The status fixed by the adjudication in the state of the former is operative everywhere. Indeed, the proposition is so elementary as not to need the citation of an authority.\n The conclusion of the argument is that the courts of New York, having the same power to decree a dissolution of the marriage at the suit of the wife that the courts of Connecticut would have to make a similar decree at the suit of the husband, it would become a mere race of diligence between the parties in seeking different forums in other states; or the celerity by which in such states judgments of divorce might be procured would have to be considered in order to decide which forum was controlling. Granting this to be the case, does not every plea of res judicata presuppose a prior judgment, and is it a defense to such plea that such judgment was obtained by superiority in a race of diligence? The whole doctrine is founded, if not upon the doctrine of superior diligence, at least upon the \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 617]\n\u00a0\n theory of a prior judgment, which fixes irrevocably the rights of the parties whenever and wherever these rights may come in question. Nor is the rule less operative where suits are in different states and the laws applicable to the questions therein arising are different. To illustrate: Suppose a note and mortgage were given for usurious interest, and the mortgage was sought to be foreclosed in a state where, by statute, usury would invalidate both principal and interest, and a decree were obtained dismissing the bill,-can it be doubted that if the note were sued upon in another state where usury did not invalidate the security the plea of res judicata, would be sustained upon the ground that the rights of the parties had been definitely fixed in the suit for the foreclosure of the mortgage? It seems to me the same rule applies in this case. So long as no proceedings are taken, the marriage would remain valid both by the laws of Connecticut and of New York. But if a suit be instituted by either party, by the husband for a divorce or by the wife for a maintenance, and the question of marriage or no marriage be made an issue, and decided in the case first brought, that decree is forever binding upon both parties. Had the wife in this case brought suit to dissolve the marriage, or for a maintenance in affirmation of the marriage, the decree of the court in New York would have been as binding upon the court in Connecticut as the decree obtained in Connecticut ought to be upon the wife in New York.\n The cases in the state courts, with a few exceptions, hereinafter noted, overwhelmingly preponderate in holding that where the plaintiff has acquired a bona fide domicil in a particular state he may lawfully appeal to the courts of that state for a dissolution of the marriage tie, for the causes permitted by its statutes, and may call in the nonresident defendant by publication. To abstract all these cases would unduly proiong this opinion.\n In many of them the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution does not seem to have been called to the attention of the court, and the case was disposed of upon principles of com- \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 618]\n\u00a0\n ity, which give to the court a certain latitude of discretion, whereas, under the full faith and credit clause, the consideration given to a decree in the state where it is rendered is obligatory in every other state.\n One of the earliest of these cases is that of Harding v. Alden, 9 Me. 140, 23 Am. Dec. 549, in which the parties separated, the husband going to North Carolina and the wife to Rhode Island. She began proceedings there, which culminated in a divorce for adultery committed in North Carolina, the husband having been personally cited to appear, but refusing to do so. The divorce was held to be valid, the court observing that 'the protection of innocent parties and the purity of public morals require that divorces lawfully pronounced in one jurisdiction, and the new relations thereupon formed, should be recognized as operative and binding everywhere,' in the absence of fraud or collusion. The ruling was that the wife was entitled to dower in lands of which the husband was seised during coverture, the statute expressly giving the right where divorce was decreed for the cause of adultery, as if the husband were dead.\n In Barber v. Root, 10 Mass. 260, the parties, originally domiciled in Massachusetts, removed to Vermont, and established a permanent domicil there. The court, while repudiating the idea that a divorce could be granted to a person who was not domiciled in Vermont, held the divorce to be good.\n In Hood v. Hood, 11 Allen, 196, 87 Am. Dec. 709, a divorce obtained in Illinois by the husband for desertion, upon notice by publication in a newspaper, was held to be valid as against the wife, although she was then living in Massachusetts under an agreement on his part to pay her a certain sum per week; and although she had no actual notice of the proceedings, and was not in Illinois during the pendency thereof. It was further held that she could not, in a libel for divorce brought by her in Massachusetts, offer evidence that the Illinois decree was obtained by fraud, and upon facts which would not entitle her to a divorce in Massachusetts. In a subsequent case between the same par- \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 619]\n\u00a0\n ties (110 Mass. 463) the court again decided that the Illinois decree could not be impeached, and that she was not entitled to dower in any lands of which the husband was seised during the coverture.\n The whole subject was very carefully considered in Burlen v. Shannon, 115 Mass. 438, which was an action against the husband for board furnished the wife. The husband, whose wife was living apart from him without justifiable cause, removed to Indiana, acquired a domicil there, and obtained a decree of divorce by publication, and by leaving a summons at her abode in Massachusetts. The divorce was held to be valid in Massachusetts as to all persons, although the wife had never been in Indiana, never appeared in the suit there, had no knowledge that her husband contemplated going to that state, or had left Massachusetts, until after he had filed his libel for divorce. The authorities are reviewed by Mr. Justice Gray, and the conclusion reached that the divorce in Indiana was valid.\n Cummington v. Belchertown, 149 Mass. 223, 4 L. R. A. 131, 21 N. E. 435, was an action to recover expenses incurred by the plaintiff for the support of an insane pauper. The husband had removed to another state and procured a decree annulling the marriage on the ground of fraud in concealing from him the fact of insanity before their marriage. Notice of the proceedings was served upon her, but she was not represented, and it was held that the decree was insufficient to annul her marriage in Massachusetts. It was held, under the familiar rule that the jurisdiction of the foreign court may be inquired into, that the wife, when the proceedings were commenced and concluded, was utterly insane, and that the record of the New York courts showed her to have been so, and that no guardian was appointed. The case was disposed of as one over which the New York court had acquired no jurisdiction. It does not qualify in any way the previous case of Burlen v. Shannon.\n The case of Ditson v. Ditson, 4 R. I. 87, is directly in point, and I understand it to be so admitted. It was held that a \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 620]\n\u00a0\n divorce in Rhode Island on the ground of desertion was valid, though the husband had never been within the jurisdiction of Rhode Island, and only constructive notice of the pendency of the petition had been given him.\n The rule in Kentucky is settled in Rhyms v. Rhyms, 7 Bush, 316, in which a wife proceeded against her husband as a nonresident by a warning order, and it was held that the court had jurisdiction to grant her a divorce, Chief Justice Robertson remarking: 'It would be a reproach to our legislation if a faithless husband in Kentucky could by leaving the state, deprive his abandoned wife of the power of obtaining a divorce at home.' In Hawkins v. ragsdale, 80 Ky. 353, 44 Am. Rep. 483, it was held that a divorce obtained by the husband in Indiana by constructive service determined the status of the party in Kentucky, and under the statutes of that state it barred all claim to curtesy or dower in Kentucky lands. To the same effect is Perzel v. Perzel, 91 Ky. 634, 15 S. W. 658.\n The law of California is settled in Re Newman, 75 Cal. 213, 7 Am. St. Rep. 146, 16 Pac. 887, to the effect that a suit for divorce, so far as it affects the status of the parties and the custody of their children, is a proceeding in rem, and service by publication on a nonresident defendant is good. This ruling was repeated in Re James, 99 Cal. 374, 37 Am. St. Rep. 60, 33 Pac. 1122, where it is declared that such decree is equally valid in other states.\n Nowhere is the rule more strongly asserted than in Tennessee, where a decree obtained in Illinois by publication was sustained in Thomas v. King, 95 Tenn. 60, 31 S. W. 983, and where it seems to have been held that the decree could not be impeached, even by showing the absence of necessary residence.\n In Cooper v. Cooper, 7 Ohio, pt. 2, p. 238, it was held that a divorce granted in Indiana precluded an application for a divorce and alimony in Ohio. In Cox v. Cox, 19 Ohio St. 502, 2 Am. Rep. 415, the validity of a foreign decree of divorce obtained by constructive service, except so far as regarded the question of alimony, was sustained. The same ruling was made in Doerr v. Forsythe, 50 Ohio St. 726, 40 Am. St. Rep. 703, 35 N. E. 1055, holding that while the Indiana divorce was good, \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 621]\n\u00a0\n it did not affect the property rights of the wife in the state of Ohio.\n The rule in Missouri is stated in Gould v. Crow, 57 Mo. 200, that a divorce regularly obtained by the husband in Indiana on an order of publication operates as a divorce in his favor in Missouri, so as to prevent his wife from claiming dower in lands owned by him in that state. The decree so pronounced is a judgment in rum and is valid everywhere under the Constitution and laws of the United States. A like ruling was made in Anthony v. Rice, 110 Mo. 223, 19 S. W. 423.\n The law in Kansas is settled in Rodgers v. Rodgers, 56 Kan. 483, 43 Pac. 779, to the effect that the courts of a sister state may dissolve a marriage relation between a husband domiciled there and a wife domiciled in Kansas, by publication, although unknown to her; but that such courts have no power to settle the title of lands in Kansas or control the custody of children residing there. But it was also decided in Chapman v. Chapman, 48 Kan. 636, 29 Pac. 1071, that a wife having obtained a divorce in Ohio upon service by publication, was not entitled to dower in lands in Kansas fraudulently conveyed by her husband in fraud of her or others.\n In Smith v. Smith, 43 La. Ann. 1140, 10 So. 248, it is held that a wife may acquire a separate domicil from that of her husband, where his conduct has been such as to furnish ground for divorce, and her marriage status becomes subject to the jurisdiction of that domicil, and that the courts thereof may grant a divorce upon actual or constructive notice. The rights of the Louisiana courts to decree a divorce against an absentee by means of substituted service is again affirmed in Butler v. Washington, 45 La. Ann. 279, 19 L. R. A. 814, 12 So. 356.\n The law of Wisconsin is the same. Shafer v. Bushnell, 24 Wis. 372; Cook v. Cook, 56 Wis. 195, 43 Am. Rep. 706, 14 N. W. 33, 443, though in the latter case the right of the wife to an interest in her husband's lands in Wisconsin was preserved.\n In Thompson v. State, 28 Ala. 12, the right of the husband to emigrate and acquire a new domicil, and procure a \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 622]\n\u00a0\n divorce upon publication in the state of his domicil was also affirmed. See also Turner v. Turner, 44 Ala. 437. In the latter case it is indicated that a foreign divorce did not settle the rights of the wife to dower in his lands, or any other interests of a pecuniary character.\n In Kline v. Kline, 57 Iowa, 386, 42 Am. Rep. 47, 10 N. W. 825, a decree rendered in another state on service by publication was recognized, except so far as it attempted to fix the custody of the minor children. In Van Orsdal v. Van Orsdal, 67 Iowa, 35, 24 N. W. 579, the property rights of the wife were recognized, but this right was limited to property within the state, and which the husband owned at the time of the divorce, and not to what he subsequently acquired. In this case it was said; 'The divorce was granted . . . in May, 1880. In November, 1881, the defendant's father died in this state, possessed of certain property which the defendant inherited. Now, while it may be that the plaintiff might be entitled to alimony if the defendant had owned property in the state at the time the divorce was procured in Nebraska, she cannot be so entitled because he has subsequently acquired property. The plaintiff, if entitled to alimony, was so entitled at the time the divorce was granted. The relation of husband and wife then ceased, and neither party is entitled to any share or interest in property which may be subsequently acquired.'\n In Indiana the girht of a wife domiciled there to a divorce against the husband who never resided in that state, and upon whom service was only obtained by publication, is recognized in Tolen v. Tolen, 2 Blackf. 407, 20 Am. Dec. 742; Hood v. State, 56 Ind. 263, 26 Am. Rep. 21; and in Hilbish v. Hattle, 145 Ind. 59, 33 L. R. A. 783, 44 N. E. 20, it was held that the wife had no rights in his property by virtue of her marriage relations with the husband, though the court did not, in the divorce proceedings, adjudicate the property rights of the parties.\n In Garner v. Garner, 56 Md. 127, the power to grant a divorce against a nonresident, upon whom process had not been served, was recognized, but the right to a decree that the nonresident should not marry again was denied. \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 623]\n\u00a0\n In Thurston v. Thurston, 58 Minn. 279, 59 N. W. 1017, the divorce was recognized, though process was served outside of the state. But it was held that the question of alimony was not res judicata by reason of the judgment. The wife was allowed alimony out of the property in Minnesota.\n The validity of foreign divorces obtained without personal service is recognized in Illinois, in Knowlton v. Knowlton, 155 Ill. 158, 39 N. E. 595, and in Dunham v. Dunham, 162 Ill. 589, 35 L. R. A. 70, 44 N. E. 841.\n The law in New Jersey appeared at one time to favor the contention of the wife in this case. The gist of the decisions seemed to be that a foreign decree is enforceable in another state only on the ground of comity. This was indicated in Doughty v. Doughty, 28 N. J. Eq. 581, though the decree in that case was held to have been obtained by fraud. It was admitted that the decree obtained by the husband in Illinois was lawful and binding there, but is was held that it did not change the status of the wife in New Jersey, her citizenship there being admitted. The case was properly decided on the ground that the husband went to Illinois to obtain a divorce, and acquired no bona fide domicil there. The same rule was recognized in Flower v. Flower, 42 N. J. Eq. 152, 7 Atl. 669. These cases, however, seem to have been overruled in Felt v. Felt, 59 N. J. Eq. 606, 47 L. R. A. 546, 83 Am. St. Rep. 612, 45 Atl. 105, 49 Atl. 1071, where it was held that the domicil of the complainant in a foreign state was sufficient to give jurisdiction, notwithstanding the defendant had not been served with process there. The chief justice remarked in this case: 'A condition of the law which makes the intercourse of a man and woman either legitimate or adulterous as they happen to be within the limits of one state or another is not to be tolerated any further than is plainly required by public policy.' This case evidently puts New Jersey in line with the vast majority of other states.\n The cases of New York upon this subject are numerous and perhaps not wholly reconcilable, but we think that the law, as summarized in the last case of Winston v. Winston, 165 N. Y. 553, 59 N. E. 273, is adverse to the validity of a divorce obtained in another state without service of process within the jurisdiction. Of \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 624]\n\u00a0\n the same tenor are the cases in Pennsylvania: Colvin v. Reed, 55 Pa. 375; Reel v. Elder, 62 Pa. 308, 1 Am. Rep. 414. North Carolina: Irby v. Wilson, 21 N. C. (1 Dev. & B. Eq.) 568; Harris v.Harris, 115 N. C. 587, 44 Am. St. Rep. 471, 20 S. E. 187, South Carolina: McCreery v. Davis, 44 S. C. 195, 28 L. R. A. 655, 51 Am. St. Rep. 794, 22 S. E. 178.\n The law in this country, then, may be summarized as follows: In Maine, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Kentucky, California, Tennessee, Ohio, Missouri, Kansas, Louisiana, Wisconsin, Alabama, Iowa, Indiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Illinois, and New Jersey, the validity of a divorce obtained in another state by a party there domiciled, in a proceeding where constructive service upon the defendant only is obtained, is fully recognized. In Ohio, Iowa, and Minnesota, and perhaps also Louisiana and Alabama, her right to alimony and to dower is preserved. But the very cases which limit the effect of the divorce, so far as property rights are concerned, restrict such rights to dower in lands of which the husband was seised during coverture, and inferentially, at least, to alimony from such property. It is also limited to property within the state where suit is brought. That her rights in her husband's property should extend to property acquired by him long after the divorce is nowhere indicated.\n The only states in which it is held that a party domiciled in another state may not obtain a divorce there by constructive service are New York, Pennsylvania, North and South Carolina.\n A proceeding for divorce is a suit in rem, with which is often incorporated a suit in personam. The res is aptly stated in Ellison v. Martin, 53 Mo. 575, as 'the status of the plaintiff in relation to the defendant, to be acted on by the court. This relation being before the court in the person of the plaintiff, the court acts on it, and dissolves it by a judgment of divorce.' The fact subsequently ascertained, that it may have been procured by fraud or false testimony, is wholly beside the question, as we shall hereafter show. The fact that the husband changed his domicil to another state, after the cause of action \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 625]\n\u00a0\n arose, is also immaterial. The status of the husband in this case was irrevocably fixed by the decree. It is unnecessary to consider how far it affected the status of the wife in New York, which, in respect to other questions, may be subject to the local law; but her relations as against her husband are controlled by the decree which fixed his status. Indeed, it would be a reproach to our jurisprudence if an injured party residing in one state could not obtain a decree from the other party, without pursuing the offending party into another and distant state, where he or she may have chosen to establish a domicil.\n In this case the referee reported that the defendant abandoned the plaintiff without cause or justification. An exception was taken to this report, and the testimony was sent up, which shows that the parties separated on the day of their marriage and have never lived together since. The testimony leaves it doubtful whether it was a case of abandonment or of separation by mutual consent. It does, however, show that plaintiff took no steps to assert her marital rights for twenty-six years after her marriage. Her husband having in the meantime inherited a large amount of property from his father, she began suit for divorce a mensa et thoro and an allowance of alimony. This suit, however, was ineffectual so far as respects the alimony, as no personal service was obtained. She waited again for five years and began this proceeding both for a separation, which she had already obtained, and for alimony.\n We think the defendant may lawfully reply this: 'You are pursuing me as your husband for a separation de jure which has existed for thirty-one years de facto, and since 1894 de jure, and for an alimony which is obviously the sole object of your proceeding. Your only claim against me is as your husband. I am not your husband. Twenty-three years ago the superior court of Litchfield county, Connecticut, in which state I had an actual and bona fide domicil, and which had had sole jurisdiction over my marital status for twelve years, liberated me from the bonds of matrimony and pronounced me a free man. In the meantime I have married another woman, and if your \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 626]\n\u00a0\n position be a sound one, I am, at least in the state of New York, a bigamist, and my wife an adulteress.' It is difficult to conceive of a case calling more loudly for the application of the general doctrine.\n As no question is made as to the validity of the Connecticut decree and its legal effect in that state, and as this court has repeatedly decided that, under the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution, a judgment conclusive in the state where it is rendered is equally conclusive everywhere in the courts of the United States (Cheever v. Wilson, 9 Wall. 108, 19 L. ed. 604; Mills v. Duryee, 7 Cranch, 483, 3 L. ed. 412; D'Arcy v. Ketchum, 11 How. 165, 13 L. ed. 648), I do not understand how this decree can be denied the same effect in New York that it has in Connecticut without disregarding the constitutional provision in question. The result is that the husband, freed from the bonds of matrimony in Connecticut, was at liberty to contract another marriage there, while the wife cannot, even at this late day, contract another marriage in New York without being guilty of adultery.\n\n 3. \nIt is insisted, however, that the decree of the Connecticut court was obtained by the fraud of Haddock, in stating in his complaint that his wife had deserted him, when, in the present case, it appears from his own testimony that he, in fact, abandoned and refused to live with her, or that they separated by mutual consent.\n The evidence upon which the Connecticut decree was granted does not appear in the record, and it is possible that the case was made out by the testimony of other witnesses. But, however that may be, this decree cannot be impeached by evidence that it was obtained by false testimony, even though it be testimony of the plaintiff in that proceeding and the defendant in this. Hood v. Hood, 11 Allen, 196, 87 Am. Dec. 709, in which it was held that both parties had their domicil in Illinois, and were subject to the jurisdiction of its courts, and that the fact of desertion by the wife was conclusively settled between the parties by the decree in Illinois, and it was not competent for the wife to \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 627]\n\u00a0\n contradict it on a libel filed by her afterwards in Massachusetts. See same case, 110 Mass. 463.\n The rule is well settled that while a judgment or decree may sometimes be impeached for fraud, it can only be for a fraud extrinsic to the cause,-as, that the judgment was collusively obtained to defraud some other person; and that it cannot be impeached by either of the parties thereto by reason of false testimony given at the time, or which must have been given to establish the plaintiff's case, or even by perjury of one of the parties thereto. Granting that the testimony shows the absence of good faith, and even perjury, on the part of the husband, in the Connecticut suit, the decree cannot be opened for that reason, or for any reason, which would not logically involve a re-examination of the entire facts upon which the decree is obtained. Christmas v. Russell, 5 Wall, 290, 18 L. ed. 475; United States v. Throckmorton \n98 U.S. 61\n, 25 L. ed. 93; Simms v. Slacum, 3 Cranch, 300, 2 L. ed. 446; Ammidon v. Smith, 1 Wheat. 447, 4 L. ed. 132; Smith v. Lewis, 3 Johns. 157, 3 Am. Dec. 469; Marriot v. Hampton, 7 T. R. 269; Demerit v. Lyford, 27 N. H. 541, 546; Peck v. Woodbridge, 3 Day, 30; Dilling v. Murray, 6 Ind. 324, 63 Am. Dec. 385; Homer v. Fish, 1 Pick, 435, 11 Am. Dec. 218; Lewis v. Rogers, 16 Pa. 18; Sidensparker v. Sidensparker, 52 Me. 481, 83 Am. Dec. 527; Boston & W. R. Corp. v. Sparhawk, 1 Allen, 448, 79 Am. Dec. 750; Damport v. Sympson, Cro. Eliz. pt. 2, p. 520; Eyres v. Sedgewicke, Cro. Jac. 601; Mason v. Messenger, 17 Iowa, 261, 272; Walker v. Ames, 2 Cow. 428; White v. Merritt, 7 N. Y. 352, 57 Am. Dec. 527.\n When it is considered that the status of the defendant was fixed by the decree of the Connecticut court in 1881, in a proceeding of which his wife had due notice, that upon the faith of this decree he remarried the following year, and that the plaintiff made no move to establish her conjugal rights for thirteen years thereafter, and for twenty-six years after her marriage, the injustice of holding all these proceedings to be null and void, even upon the assumption of perjury committed by the defendant, becomes the more manifest. We think that at least the record should have been received.\n I regret that the court in this case has taken what seems to \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 628]\n\u00a0\n me a step backward in American jurisprudence, and has virtually returned to the old doctrine of comity, which it was the very object of the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution to supersede.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes, with whom concurred Mr. Justice Harlan, Mr. Justice Brewer, and Mr. Justice Brown, dissenting:\n I do not suppose that civilization will come to an end whichever way this case is decided. But as the reasoning which prevails in the mind of the majority does not convince me, and as I think that the decision not only reverses a previous wellconsidered decision of this court, but is likely to cause considerable disaster to innocent persons, and to bastardize children hitherto supposed to be the offspring of lawful marriage, I think it proper to express my views. Generally stated, the issue is whether, when a husband sues in the court of his domicil for divorce from an absent wife on the ground of her desertion, the jurisdiction of the court, if there is no personal service, depends upon the merits of the case. If the wife did desert her husband in fact, or if she was served with process, I understand it not to be disputed that a decree of divorce in the case supposed would be conclusive, and so I understand it to be admitted that if the court of another state, on a retrial of the merits, finds them to have been decided rightly, its duty will be to declare the decree a bar to its inquiry. The first form of the question is whether it has a right to inquire into the merits at all. But I think that it will appear directly that the issue is narrower even than that.\n In Atherton v. Atherton, \n181 U.S. 155\n, 45 L. ed. 794, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 544, a divorce was granted, on the ground of desertion divorce was granted, on the ground of desertion, a wife who had established herself in New York. She did not appear in the suit and the only notice to her was by mail. Before the decree was made she sued in New York for a divorce from bed and board, but pending the latter proceedings the Kentucky suit was brought to its end. The husband appeared \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 629]\n\u00a0\n in New York and set up the Kentucky decree. The New York court found that the wife left her husband because of his cruel and abusive treatment, without fault on her part, held that the Kentucky decree was no bar, and granted the wife her divorce from bed and board. The New York decree, after being affirmed by the court of appeals, was reversed by this court on the ground that it did not give to the Kentucky decree the faith and credit which it had by law in Kentucky. Of course, if the wife left her husband because of his cruelty, and without fault on her part, as found by the New York court, she was not guilty of desertion. Yet this court held that the question of her desertion was not open, but was conclusively settled by the Kentucky decree.\n There is no difference, so far as I can see, between Atherton v. Atherton and the present case, except that in Atherton v. Atherton the forum of the first decree was that of the matrimonial domicil, whereas in this the court was that of a domicil afterwards acquired. After that decision any general objection to the effect of the Connecticut decree on the ground of the wife's absence from the state comes too late. So does any general objection on the ground that to give it effect invites a race of diligence. I therefore pass such arguments without discussion, although they seem to me easy to answer. Moreover, Atherton v. Atherton decides that the jurisdiction of the matrimonial domicil, at least, to grant a divorce for the wife's desertion without personal service, does not depend upon the fact of her desertion, but continues even if her husaband's cruelty has driven her out of the state, and she has acquired a separate domicil elsewhere, upon the principles which we all agree are recognized by this court.\n I can see no ground for giving a less effect to the decree when the husband changes his domicil after the separation has taken place. The question whether such a decree should have a less effect is the only question open, and the issue is narrowed to that. No one denies that the husband may sue for divorce in his new domicil, or, as I have said, that if he gets a decree when \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 630]\n\u00a0\n he really has been deserted, it will be binding everywhere. Hawkins v. Ragsdale, 80 Ky. 353, 44 Am. Rep. 483, cited \n181 U.S. 162\n, 45 L. ed. 799, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 544; Cheely v. Clayton, \n110 \nU.S. 701, 705\n, 28 S. L. ed. 298, 299, 4 Sup. Ct. Rep. 328. It is unnecessary to add more cases. The only reason which I have heard suggested for holding the decree not binding as to the fact that he was deserted, is that if he is deserted, his power over the matrimonial domicil remains so that the domicil of the wife accompanies him wherever he goes, whereas if he is the deserter he has no such power. Of course this is a pure fiction, and fiction always is a poor ground for changing substantial rights. It seems to me also an inadequate fiction, since by the same principle, if he deserts her in the matrimonial domicil, he is equally powerless to keep her domicil there, if she moves into another state. The truth is that jurisdiction no more depends upon both parties having their domicil within the state, than it does upon the presence of the defendant there, as is shown not only by Atherton v. Atherton, but by the rights of the wife in the matrimonial domicil when the husband deserts.\n There is no question that a husband may establish a new domicil for himself, even if he has deserted his wife. Yet in these days of equality I do not suppose that it would be doubted that the jurisdiction of the court of the matrimonial domicil to grant a divorce for the desertion remained for her, as it would for him in the converse case. See Cheever v. Wilson, 9 Wall. 108, 19 L. ed. 604. Indeed, in Ditson v. Ditson, 4 R. I. 87, which, after a quotation of Judge Cooley's praise of it, is stated and relied upon as one of the pillars for the decision of Atherton v. Atherton, a wife was granted a divorce, without personal service, in the state of a domicil acquired by her after separation, on the sole ground that in the opinion of the court its decree would be binding everywhere. If that is the law it disposes of the case of a husband under similar circumstances,- that is to say, of the present case, a fortiori; for I suppose that the notion that a wife can have a separate domicil from her husband is a modern idea. At least Ditson v. Ditson confirms the assumption that jurisdiction is not dependent on the wife's actually residing in \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 631]\n\u00a0\n the same state as her husband, which has been established by this court. Atherton v. Atherton, supra; Maynard v. Hill, \n125 U.S. 190\n, 31 L. ed. 624, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 723; Cheerer v. Wilson, supra. When that assumption is out of the way, I repeat that I cannot see any ground for distinguishing between the extent of jurisdiction in the matrimonial domicil and that, admitted to exist to some extent, in a domicil later acquired. I also repeat and emphasize that if the finding of a second court, contrary to the decree, that the husband was the deserter, destroys the jurisdiction in the later acquired domicil because the domicil of the wife does not follow his, the same fact ought to destroy the jurisdiction in the matrimonial domicil if, in consequence of her husband's conduct, the wife has left the state. But Atherton v. Atherton decides that it does not.\n It is important to bear in mind that the present decision purports to respect, and not to overrule, Atherton v. Atherton. For that reason, among others, I spend no time in justifying that case. And yet it appears to me that the whole argument which prevails with the majority of the court is simply an argument that Atherton v. Atherton is wrong. I have tried in vain to discover anything tending to show a distinction between that case and this. It is true that in Atherton v. Atherton, Mr. Justice Gray confined the decision to the case before the court. Evidently, I should say, from internal evidence, in defence to scruples which he did not share. But a court, by announcing that its decision is confined to the facts before it, does not decide in advance that logic will not drive it further when new facts arise. New facts have arisen. I state what logic seems to me to require if that case is to stand, and I think it reasonable to ask for an articulate indication of how it is to be distinguished.\n I have heard it suggested that the difference is one of degree. I am the last man in the world to quarrel with a distinction simply because it is one of degree. Most distinctions, in my opinion, are of that sort, and are none the worse for it. But the line which is drawn must be justified by the fact that it is \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 632]\n\u00a0\n a tittle nearer than the nearest opposing case to one pole of an admitted antithesis. When a crime is made burglary by the fact that it was committed thirty seconds after one hour after sunset, ascertained according to mean time in the place of the act, to take an example from Massachusetts (Rev. Laws, chap. 219,  10), the act is a little nearer to midnight than if it had been committed one minute earlier, and no one denies that there is a difference between night and day. The fixing of a point when day ends is made inevitable by the admission of that difference. But I can find no basis for giving a greater jurisdiction to the courts of the husband's domicil when the married pair happens to have resided there for a month, even if with intent to make it a permanent abode, than if they had not lived there at all.\n I may add, as a consideration distinct from those which I have urged, that I am unable to reconcile with the requirements of the Constitution, article 4,  1, the notion of a judgment being valid and binding in the state where it is rendered, and yet depending for recognition to the same extent in other states of the Union upon the comity of those states. No doubt some color for such a notion may be found in state decisions. State courts do not always have the Constitution of the United States vividly present to their minds. I am responsible for language treating what seems to me the fallacy as open, in Blackinton v. Blackinton, 141 Mass. 432, 436, 55 Am. Rep. 485, 5 N. E. 830. But there is no exception in the words of the Constitution. 'If the judgment is conclusive in the state where it was pronounced, it is equally conclusive everywhere.' Christmas v. Russell, 5 Wall. 290, 302, 18 L. ed. 475, 478. Marshall, Ch. J., in Hampton v. M'Connel, 3 Wheat. 234, 4 L. ed. 378; Mills v. Duryee, 7 Cranch, 481, 485, 3 L. ed. 411, 413; Story, Const.  1313. See also Hancock Nat. Bank v. Farnum, \n176 \nU.S. 640, 644\n, 645 S., 44 L. ed. 619, 621, 622, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 506. I find no qualification of the rule in Wisconsin v. Pelican Ins. Co. \n127 U.S. 265\n, 32 L. ed. 239, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1370. That merely decided, with regard to a case not within the words of the Constitution, that a state judgment could not be sued upon when the facts which it established were not a cause of action outside the state. It did not decide or even remotely suggest that the judgment \n\n[201 U.S. 562, 633]\n\u00a0\n would not be conclusive as to the facts if in any way those facts came in question. It is decided as well as admitted that a decree like that rendered in Connecticut in favor of a deserting husband is binding in the state where it is rendered. Maynard v. Hill, supra. I think it enough to read that case in order to be convinced that at that time the court had no thought of the divorce being confined in its effects to the territory where it was granted, and enough to read Atherton v. Atherton to see that its whole drift and tendency now are reversed and its necessary consequences denied. \n\n\n\n","66":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHALE v. HENKEL(1906)\nNo. 340\nArgued: Decided: March 12, 1906\n\n\n\n\n[201 U.S. 43, 44]\n\u00a0\n This was an appeal from a final order of the circuit court, made June 18, 1905, dismissing a writ of habeas corpus, and remanding the petitioner, Hale, to the custody of the marshal.\n The proceeding originated in a subpoena duces tecum, issued April 28, 1905, commanding Hale to appear before the grand jury at a time and place named, to 'testify and give evidence \n\n[201 U.S. 43, 45]\n\u00a0\n in a certain action now pending . . . in the circuit court of the United States for the southern district of New York, between the United States of America and the American Tobacco Company and MacAndrews & Forbes Company, on the part of the United States, and that you bring with you and produce at the time and place aforesaid:'\n\n 1. \nAll understandings, agreements, arrangements, or contracts, whether evidenced by correspondence, memoranda, formal agreements, or other writings, between MacAndrews & Forbes Company and six other firms and corporations named, from the date of the organization of the said MacAndrews & Forbes Company.\n\n 2. \nAll correspondence by letter or telegram between MacAndrews & Forbes Company and six other firms and corporations.\n\n 3. \nAll reports made or accounts rendered by these six companies or corporations to the principal company.\n\n 4. \nAny agreements or contracts, or arrangements, however evidenced, between MacAndrews & Forbes Company and the Amsterdam Supply Company or the American Tobacco Company or the Continental Company or the Consolidated Tobacco Company.\n\n 5. \nAll letters received by the MacAndrews & Forbes Company since the date of its organization from thirteen other companies named, located in different parts of the United States, and also copies of all correspondence with such companies.\n Petitioner appeared before the grand jury in obedience to the subpoena, and, before being sworn, asked to be advised of the nature of the investigation in which he had been summoned; whether under any statute of the United States, and the specific charge, if any had been made, in order that he might learn whether or not the grand jury had any lawful right to make the inquiry, and also that he be furnished with a copy of the complaint, information, or proposed indictment upon which they were acting; that he had been informed that there was no action pending in the circuit court, as stated in the subpoena, and that the grand jury was investigating no specific charge against \n\n[201 U.S. 43, 46]\n\u00a0\n anyone, and he therefore declined to answer: First, because there was no legal warrant for his examination, and, second, because his answers might tend to incriminate him.\n After stating his name, residence, and the fact that he was secretary and treasurer of the MacAndrews & Forbes Company, he declined to answer all other questions in regard to the business of the company, its officers, the location of its office, or its agreement or arrangements with other companies. He was thereupon advised by the assistant district attorney that this was a proceeding under the Sherman act to protect trade and commerce against unlawful restraint and monopolies; that, under the act of 1903, amendatory thereof, no person could be prosecuted or subjected to any penalty or forfeiture on account of any matter or thing concerning which he might testify or produce documentary evidence in any prosecution under said act, and that he thereby offered and assured appellant immunity from punishment. The witness still persisted in his refusal to answer all questions. He also declined to produce the papers and documents called for in the subpoena:\n First. Because it would have been a physical impossibility to have gotten them together within the time allowed. Second. Because he was advised by counsel that he was under no legal obligations to produce anything called for by the subpoena. Third. Because they might tend to incriminate him.\n Whereupon the grand jury reported the matter to the court, and made a presentment that Hale was in contempt, and that the proper proceedings should be taken. Thereupon all the parties appeared before the circuit judge, who directed the witness to answer the questions and produce the papers. Appellant still persisting in his refusal, the circuit judge held him to be in contempt, and committed him to the custody of the marshal until he should answer the questions and produce the papers. A writ of habeas corpus was thereupon sued out, and a hearing had before another judge of the same court, who discharged the writ and remanded the petitioner.\n\n Mr. Justice Brown delivered the opinion of the court:\n Two issues are presented by the record in this case, which are so far distinct as to require separate consideration. They depend upon the applicability of different provisions of the Constitution, and, in determining the question of affirmance or reversal, should not be confounded. The first of these involves the immunity of the witness from oral examination; the second, the legality of his action in refusing to produce the documents called for by the subpoena duces tecum.\n\n 1. \nThe appellant justifies his action in refusing to answer the \n\n[201 U.S. 43, 47]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. De Lancey Nicoll, Junius Parker, and John D. Lindsay for appellant.\n\n\n\n[201 U.S. 43, 51]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Henry W. Taft, Felix H. Levy, and Attorney General Moody for appellee.\n\n\n\n[201 U.S. 43, 58]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Brown, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court.\n Two issues are presented by the record in this case, which are so far distinct as to require separate consideration. They depend upon the applicability of different provisions of the Constitutiuon, and, in determining the question of affirmance or reversal, should not be confounded. The first of these involves the immunity of the witness from oral examination; the second, the legality of his action in refusing to produce the documents called for by the subpoena duces tecum.\n The appellant justifies his action in refusing to answer the \n\n[201 U.S. 43, 59]\n\u00a0\n questions propounded to him, 1st, upon the ground that there was no specific 'charge' pending before the grand jury against any particular person; 2d, that the answers would tend to criminate him.\n The first objection requires a definition of the word 'charge' as used in this connection, which it is not easy to furnish. An accused person is usually charged with crime by a complaint made before a committing magistrate, which has fully performed its office when the party is committed or held to bail, and is quite unnecessary to the finding of an indictment by a grand jury; or by an information of the district attorney, which is of no legal value in prosecutions for felony; or by a presentment, usually made, as in this case, for an offense committed in the presence of the jury; or by an indictment which, as often as not, is drawn after the grand jury has acted upon the testimony. If another kind of charge be contemplated, when and by whom must it be preferred? Must it be in writing, and if so, in what form? Or may it be oral? The suggestion of the witness, that he should be furnished with a copy of such charge, if applicable to him, is applicable to other witnesses summoned before the grand jury. Indeed, it is a novelty in criminal procedure with which we are wholly unacquainted, and one which might involve a betrayal of the secrets of the grand jury room.\n Under the ancient English system, criminal prosecutions were instituted at the suit of private prosecutors, to which the King lent his name in the interest of the public peace and good order of society. In such cases the usual practice was to prepare the proposed indictment and lay it before the grand jury for their consideration. There was much propriety in this, as the most valuable function of the grand jury was not only to examine into the commission of crimes, but to stand between the prosecutor and the accused, and to determine whether the charge was founded upon credible testimony or was dictated by malice or personal ill will.\n We are pointed to no case, however, holding that a grand jury \n\n[201 U.S. 43, 60]\n\u00a0\n cannot proceed without the formality of a written charge. Indeed, the oath administered to the foreman, which has come down to us from the most ancient times, and is found in Shaftesbury's Trial, 8 How. St. Tr. 769, indicates that the grand jury was competent to act solely on its own volition. This oath was that 'you shall diligently inquire and true presentments make of all such matters, articles, and things as shall be given you in charge, as of all other matters, and things as shall come to your own knowledge touching this present service,' etc. This oath has remained substantially unchanged to the present day. There was a difference, too, in the nomenclature of the two cases of accusations by private persons and upon their own knowledge. In the former case their action was embodied in an indictment formally laid before them for their consideration; in the latter case, in the form of a presentment. Says Blackstone in his Commentaries, bk. 4, p. 301:\n'A presentment, properly speaking, is the notice taken by a grand jury of any offense from their own knowledge or observation, without any bill of indictment laid before them at the suit of the King, as the presentment of a nuisance, a libel, and the like; upon which the officer of the court must afterwards frame an indictment, before the party presented can be put to answer it.'\n\n Substantially the same language is used in 1 Chitty, Crim. Law, 162.\n In United States v. Hill, 1 Brock. 156, Fed. Cas. No. 15,364, it was indicated by Chief Justice Marshall that a presentment and indictment are to be considered as one act, the second to be considered only as an amendment to the first, and that the usage of this country has been to pass over, unnoticed, presentments on which the attorney does not think it proper to institute proceedings.\n In a case arising in Tennessee the grand jury without the agency of the district attorney, had called witnesses before them, whom they interrogated as to their knowledge concerning the then late Cuban expedition. Mr. Justice Catron sustained the legality of the proceeding and compelled the witnesses \n\n[201 U.S. 43, 61]\n\u00a0\n to answer. His opinion is reported in Wharton's Criminal Pleading & Practice, 8th ed.  337. He says: 'The grand jury have the undoubted right to send for witnesses and have them sworn to give evidence generally, and to found presentments on the evidence of such witnesses; and the question here is whether a witness thus introduced is legally bound to disclose whether a crime has been committed, and also who committed the crime.' His charge contains a thorough discussion of the whole subject.\n While presentments have largely fallen into disuse in this country, the practice of grand juries acting upon notice, either of their own knowledge or upon information obtained by them, and incorporating their findings in an indictment, still largely obtains. Whatever doubts there may be with regard to the early English procedure, the practice in this country, under the system of public prosecutions carried on by officers of the state appointed for that purpose, has been entirely settled since the adoption of the Constitution. In a lecture delivered by Mr. Justice Wilson of this court, who may be assumed to have known the current practice, before the students of the University of Pennsylvania, he says (Wilson's Works, vol. 2, p. 213):\n'It has been alleged that grand juries are confined, in their inquiries, to the bills offered to them, to the crimes given them in charge, and to the evidence brought before them by the prosecutor. But these conceptions are much too contracted; they present but a very imperfect and unsatisfactory view of the duty required from grand jurors, and of the trust reposed in them. They are not appointed for the prosecutor or for the court; they are appointed for the government and for the people; and of both the government and people it is surely the concernment that, on one hand, all crimes, whether given or not given in charge, whether described or not described with professional skill, should receive the punishment which the law denounces; and that, on the other hand, innocence, however strongly assailed by accusations drawn up in regular form, and \n\n[201 U.S. 43, 62]\n\u00a0\n by accusers, marshaled in legal array, should, on full investigation, be secure in that protection which the law engages that she shall enjoy inviolate.\n\n'The oath of a grand juryman-and his oath is the commission under which he acts-assigns no limits, except those marked by diligence itself, to the course of his inquiries: Why, then, should it be circumscribed by more contracted boundaries? Shall diligent inquiry be enjoined? And shall the means and opportunities of inquiry be prohibited or restrained?'\n\n Similar language was used by Judge Addison, president of the court of common pleas, in charging the grand jury at the session of the common pleas court, in 1791:\n'If the grand jury, of their own knowledge, or the knowledge of any of them, or from the examination of witnesses, know of any offense committed in the county, for which no indictment is preferred to them, it is their duty either to inform the officer who prosecutes for the state, of the nature of the offense, and desire that an indictment for it be laid before them, or, if they do not, or, if no such indictment be given them, it is their duty to give such information of it to the court; stating, without any particular form, the facts and circumstances which constitute the offense. This is called a presentment.'\n\n The practice, then, prevailing, with regard to the duty of grand juries, shows that a presentment may be based, not only upon their own personal knowledge, but from the examination of witnesses.\n While no case has arisen in this court in which the question has been distinctly presented, the authorities in the state courts largely preponderate in favor of the theory that the grand jury may act upon information received by them from the examination of witnesses without a formal indictment, or other charge previously laid before them. An analysis of cases approving of this method of procedure would unduly burden this opinion, but the following are the leading ones upon the subject: Ward v. State, 2 Mo. 120, 22 Am. Dec. 449; State v. Terry, 30 Mo. 368; Ex \n\n[201 U.S. 43, 63]\n\u00a0\n parte Brown, 72 Mo. 83, 37 Am. Rep. 426; Com. v. Smyth, 11 Cush. 473; State v. Wolcott, 21 Conn. 272-280; State v. Magrath, 44 N. J. L. 227; Thompson & M. Juries,  615-617. In Blaney v. State, 74 Md. 153, 21 Atl. 547, the court said:\n'However restricted the functions of grand juries may be elsewhere, we hold in this state they have plenary inquisitorial powers, and may lawfully themselves, and upon their own motion, originate charges against offenders, though no preliminary proceedings have been had before a magistrate, and though neither the court nor the state's attorney has laid the matter before them.'\n\n The rulings of the inferior Federal courts are to the same effect. Mr. Justice Field, in charging a grand jury in California (2 Sawy. 667, Fed. Cas. No. 18,255), said of the grand jury acting upon their own knowledge:\n'Not by rumors and reports, but by knowledge acquired from the evidence before you, and from your own observations. Whilst you are inquiring as to one offense, another and a different offense may be proved, or witnesses before you may, in testifying, commit the crime of perjury.'\n\n Similar language was used in United States v. Kimball, 117 Fed. 156- 161; United States v. Reed, 2 Blatchf. 449, Fed. Cas. No. 16,134; United States v. Terry, 39 Fed. 355. And in Frisbie v. United States, \n157 U.S. 160\n, 39 L. ed. 657, 15 Sup.Ct.Rep. 586, it is said by Mr. Justice Brewer:\n'But in this country it . . . is for the grand jury to investigate any alleged crime, no matter how or by whom suggested to them, and after determining that the evidence is sufficient to justify putting the party suspected on trial, to direct the preparation of the formal charge or indictment.'\n\n There are doubtless a few cases in the state courts which take a contrary view, but they are generally such as deal with the abuses of the system, as the indiscriminate summoning of witnesses with no definite object in view, and in a spirit of meddlesome inquiry. In the most pertinent of these cases (Re Lester, 77 Ga. 143), the mayor of Savannah, who was also ex \n\n[201 U.S. 43, 64]\n\u00a0\n officio the presiding judge of a court of record, was called upon to bring into the superior court the 'Information Docket' of his court, to be used as evidence by the state in certain cases pending before the grand jury. It was held 'that the powers of the body are inquisitorial to a certain extent is undeniable; yet they have to be exercised within well-defined limits. . . . The grand jury can find no bill nor make any presentment except upon the testimony of witnesses sworn in a particular case, where the party is charged with a specified offense.'\n This case is readily distinguishable from the one under consideration, in the fact that the subpoena in this case did specify the action as one between the United States and the American Tobacco Company and the MacAndrews-Forbes Company; and that the Georgia Penal Code prescribed a form of oath for the grand jury, 'that the evidence you shall give the grand jury on this bill of indictment (or presentment, as the case may be, here state the case) shall be the truth,' etc. This seems to confine the witness to a charge already laid before the jury.\n In Lewis v. Wake County, 74 N. C. 194, the English practice, which requires a preliminary investigation where the accused can confront the accuser and witnesses with testimony, was adopted as more consonant to principles of justice and personal liberty. It was further said that none but witnesses have any business before the grand jury, and that the solicitor may not be present, even to examine them. The practice in this particular in the Federal courts has been quite the contrary.\n Other cases lay down the principle that it must be made to appear to the grand jury that there is reason to believe that a crime has been committed, and that they have not the power to institute or prosecute an inquiry on the chance that some crime may be discovered. Re Morse, 18 N. Y. Crim. Rep. 312, 87 N. Y. Supp. 721; State v. Adams, 2 Lea, 647, an unimportant case, turning upon a local statute. In Pennsylvania, grand juries are somewhat more restricted in their powers than is usual in other states (McCullough v. Com. 67 Pa. \n\n[201 U.S. 43, 65]\n\u00a0\n 30; Rowand v. Com. 82 Pa. 405; Com. v. Green, 126 Pa. 531, 12 Am. St. Rep. 894, 17 Atl. 878), and in Tennessee inquisitorial powers are granted in certain cases and withheld in others (State v. Adams, supra; State v. Smith, Meigs, 99, 33 Am. Dec. 132).\n We deem it entirely clear that under the practice in this country, at least, the examination of witnesses need not be preceded by a presentment or indictment formally drawn up, but that the grand jury may proceed, either upon their own knowledge or upon the examination of witnesses, to inquire for themselves whether a crime cognizable by the court has been committed; that the result of their investigations may be subsequently embodied in an indictment, and that, in summoning witnesses, it is quite sufficient to apprise them of the names of the parties with respect to whom they will be called to testify, without indicating the nature of the charge against them. So valuable is this inquisitorial power of the grand jury that, in states where felonies may be prosecuted by information as well as indictment, the power is ordinarily reserved to courts of impaneling grand juries for the investigation of riots, frauds, and nuisances, and other cases where it is impracticable to ascertain in advance the names of the persons implicated. It is impossible to conceive that in such cases the examination of witnesses must be stopped until a basis is laid by an indictment formally preferred, when the very object of the examination is to ascertain who shall be indicted. As criminal prosecutions are instituted by the state through an officer selected for that purpose, he is vested with a certain discretion with respect to the cases he will call to their attention, the number and character of the witnesses, the form in which the indictment shall be drawn, and other details of the proceedings. Doubtless abuses of this power may be imagined, as if the object of the inquiry were merely to pry into the details of domestic or business life. But were such abuses called to the attention of the court, it would doubtless be alert to repress them. While the grand jury may not indict upon current rumors or unverified reports, they may act upon knowledge acquired either from their own observations \n\n[201 U.S. 43, 66]\n\u00a0\n or upon the evidence of witnesses, given before them.\n\n 2. \nAppellant also invokes the protection of the 5th Amendment to the Constitution, which declares that no person 'shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself,' and in reply to various questions put to him he declined to answer, on the ground that he would thereby incriminate himself.\n The answer to this is found in a proviso to the general appropriation act of February 25, 1903 (32 Stat. at L. 854-904, chap. 755, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1905, p. 602), that 'no person shall be prosecuted or be subjected to any penalty or forfeiture for or on account of any transaction, matter, or thing concerning which he may testify or produce evidence, documentary or otherwise, in any proceeding, suit, or prosecution under said acts,' of which the antitrust law is one, providing, however, that 'no person so testifying shall be exempt from prosecution or punishment for perjury committed in so testifying.'\n While there may be some doubt whether the examination of witnesses before a grand jury is a suit or prosecution, we have no doubt that it is a 'proceeding' within the meaning of this proviso. The word should receive as wide a construction as is necessary to protect the witness in his disclosures, whenever such disclosures are made in pursuance of a judicial inquiry, whether such inquiry be instituted by a grand jury, or upon the trial of an indictment found by them. The word 'proceeding' is not a technical one, and is aptly used by the courts to designate an inquiry before a grant jury. It has received this interpretation in a number of cases. Yates v. Queen, L. R. 14 Q. B. Div. 648; Hogan v. State, 30 Wis. 428, 11 Am. Rep. 575.\n The object of the amendment is to establish in express language and upon a firm basis the general principle of English and American jurisprudence, that no one shall be compelled to give testimony which may expose him to prosecution for crime. It is not declared that he may not be compelled to testify to facts which may impair his reputation for probity, or even tend to disgrace him; but the line is drawn at testimony that may expose \n\n[201 U.S. 43, 67]\n\u00a0\n him to prosecution. If the testimony relate to criminal acts long since past, and against the prosecution of which the statute of limitations has run, or for which he has already received a pardon or is guaranteed an immunity, the amendment does not apply.\n The interdiction of the 5th Amendment operates only where a witness is asked to incriminate himself,-in other words, to give testimony which may possibly expose him to a criminal charge. But if the criminality has already been taken away, the amendment ceases to apply. The criminality provided against is a present, not a past, criminality, which lingers only as a memory, and involves no present danger of prosecution. To put an extreme case, a man in his boyhood or youth may have committed acts which the law pronounces criminal; but it would never be asserted that he would thereby by be made a criminal for life. It is here that the law steps in and says that if the offense be outlawed or pardoned, or its criminality has been removed by statute, the amendment ceases to apply. The extent of this immunity was fully considered by this court in Counselman v. Hitchcock, \n142 U.S. 547\n, 35 L. ed. 1110, 3 Inters. Com. Rep. 816, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 195, in which the immunity offered by Rev. Stat.  860 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 661), was declared to be insufficient. In consequence of this decision an act was passed applicable to testimony before the Interstate Commerce Commission in almost the exact language of the act of February 25, 1903, above quoted. This act was declared by this court in Brown v. Walker, \n131 U.S. 591\n, 40 L. ed. 819, 5 Inters. Com. Rep. 369, 16 Sup.Ct.Rep. 644, to afford absolute immunity against prosecution for the offense to which the question related, and deprived the witness of his constitutional right to refuse to answer. Indeed, the act was passed apparently to meet the declaration in Counselman v. Hitchcook (586, L. ed. 1122, Inters. Com. Rep. 828, Sup.Ct.Rep. 206), that 'a statutory enactment, to be valid, must afford absolute immunity against future prosecution for the offense to which the question relates.' If the constitutional amendment were unaffected by the immunity statute, it would put if within the power of the witness to be his own judge as to what would tend to incriminate him, and would justify him in refusing to answer almost \n\n[201 U.S. 43, 68]\n\u00a0\n any question in a criminal case, unless it clearly appears that the immunity was not set up in good faith.\n We need not restate the reasons given in Brown v. Walker, both in the opinion of the court, and in the dissenting opinion, wherein all the prior authorities were reviewed, and a conclusion reached by a majority of the court, which fully covers the case under consideration.\n The suggestion that a person who has testified compulsorily before a grand jury may not be able, if subsequently indicted for some matter concerning which he testified, to procure the evidence necessary to maintain his plea, is more fanciful than real. He would have not only his own oath in support of his immunity, but the notes often, though not always, taken of the testimony before the grand jury, as well as the testimony of the prosecuting officer, and of every member of the jury present. It is scarcely possible that all of them would have forgotten the general nature of his incriminating testimony or that any serious conflict would arise therefrom. In any event, it is a question relating to the weight of the testimony, which could scarcely be considered in determining the effect of the immunity statute. The difficulty of maintaining a case upon the available evidence is a danger which the law does not recognize. In prosecuting a case, or in setting up a defense, the law takes no account of the practical difficulty which either party may have in procuring his testimony. It judges of the law by the facts which each party claims, and not by what he may ultimately establish.\n The further suggestion that the statute offers no immunity from prosecution in the state courts was also fully considered in Brown v. Walker, and held to be no answer. The converse of this was also decided in Jack v. Kansas, \n199 U.S. 372\n, ante, 73, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 73,-namely, that the fact that an immunity granted to a witness under a state statute would not prevent a prosecution of such witness for a violation of a Federal statute did not invalidate such statute under the 14th Amendment. It was held both by this court and by the supreme court of Kansas that \n\n[201 U.S. 43, 69]\n\u00a0\n the possibility that information given by the witness might be used under the Federal act did not operate as a reason for permitting the witness to refuse to answer, and that a danger so unsubstantial and remote did not impair the legal immunity. Indeed, if the argument were a sound one it might be carried still further and held to apply not only to state prosecutions within the same jurisdiction, but to prosecutions under the criminal laws of other states to whcih the witness mignt have subjected himself. The question has been fully considered in England, and the conclusion reached that the only danger to be considered is one arising within the same jurisdiction and under the same sovereignty. Queen v. Boyes, 1 7 St. Tr. N. S. 1049, 1068; State v. 7 St. Tr. N. S. 1049, 1068; State v. March, 46 N. C. (1 Jones, L.) 526; State v. Thomas, 98 N. C. 599, 2 Am. St. Rep. 351, 4 S. E. 518. The entire question of immunity is also exhaustively treated in Wigmore on Evidence,  2255-2259.\n The case of United States v. Saline Bank, 1 Pet. 100, 7 L. ed. 69, is not in conflict with this. That was a bill for discovery, filed by the United States against the cashier of the Saline Bank, in the district court of the Virginia district, who pleaded that the emission of certain unlawful bills took place within the state of Virginia, by the law whereof penalties were inflicted for such emissions. It was held that defendants were not bound to answer and subject them to those penalties. It is sufficient to say that the prosecution was under a state law which imposed the penalty, and that the Federal court was simply administering the state law, and no question arose as to a prosecution under another jurisdiction.\n But it is further insisted that, while the immunity statute may protect individual witnesses, it would not protect the corporation of which appellant was the agent and representative. This is true, but the answer is that it was not designed to do so. The right of a person under the 5th Amendment to refuse to incriminate himself is purely a personal privilege of the witness. It was never intended to permit him to plead the fact that some third person might be incriminated by his testimony, even \n\n[201 U.S. 43, 70]\n\u00a0\n though he were the agent of such person. A privilege so extensive might be used to put a stop to the examination of every witness who was called upon to testify before the grand jury with regard to the doings or business of his principal, whether such principal were an individual or a corporation. The question whether a corporation is a 'person' within the meaning of this amendment really does not arise, except, perhaps, where a corporation is called upon to answer a bill of discovery, since it can only be heard by oral evidence in the person of some one of its agents or employees. The amendment is limited to a person who shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself; and if he cannot set up the privilege of a third person, he certainly cannot set up the privilege of a corporation. As the combination or conspiracies provided against by the Sherman antitrust act can ordinarily be proved only by the testimony of parties thereto, in the person of their agents or employees, the privilege claimed would practically nullify the whole act of Congress. Of what use would it be for the legislature to declare these combinations unlawful if the judicial power may close the door of access to every available source of information upon the subject? Indeed, so strict is the rule that the privilege is a personal one that it has been held in some cases that counsel will not be allowed to make the objection. We hold that the questions should have been answered.\n\n 3. \nThe second branch of the case relates to the nonproduction by the witness of the books and papers called for by the subpoena duces tecum. The witness put his refusal on the ground, first, that it was impossible for him to collect them within the time allowed; second, because he was advised by counsel that, under the circumstances, he was under no obligation to produce them; and finally, because they might tend to incriminate him.\n Had the witness relied solely upon the first ground, doubtless the court would have given him the necessary time. The last ground we have already held untenable. While the second ground does not set forth with technical accuracy the real reason \n\n[201 U.S. 43, 71]\n\u00a0\n for declining to produce them, the witness could not be expected to speak with legal exactness, and we think is entitled to assert that the subpoena was an infringement upon the 4th Amendment to the Constitution, which declares that 'the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, paper, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.'\n The construction of this amendment was exhaustively considered in the case of Boyd v. United States, \n116 U.S. 616\n, 29 L. ed. 746, 6 Sup.Ct.Rep. 524, which was an information in rem against certain cases of plate glass, alleged to have been imported in fraud of the revenue acts. On the trial it became important to show the quantity and value of the glass contained in a number of cases previously imported; and the district judge, under  5 of the act of June 22, 1874, [18 Stat. at L. 187, chap. 391, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2018], directed a notice to be given to the claimants, requiring them to produce the invoice of these cases under penalty that the allegations respecting their contents should be taken as confessed. We held (page 622, L. ed. p. 748, Sup.Ct.Rep. p. 528) 'that a compulsory production of a man's private papers to establish a criminal charge against him, or to forfeit his property, is within the scope of the 4th Amendment to the Constitution, in all cases in which a search and seizure would be,' and that the order in question was an unreasonable search and seizure within that amendment.\n The history of this provision of the Constitution and its connection with the former practice of general warrants, or writs of assistance, was given at great length, and the conclusion reached that the compulsory extortion of a man's own testimony, or of his private papers, to connect him with a crime of a forfeiture of his goods, is illegal (p. 634, L. ed. p. 752, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 534), 'is compelling a man to be a witness against himself, within the meaning of the 5th Amendment to the Constitution, and is the equivalent of a search and seizure-and an unreasonable search and seizure-within the meaning of the 4th Amendment. \n\n[201 U.S. 43, 72]\n\u00a0\n Subsequent cases treat the 4th and 5th Amendments as quite distinct, having different histories, and performing separate functions. Thus, in the case of Interstate Commerce Commission v. Brimson, \n154 U.S. 447\n, 38 L. ed. 1047, 4 Inters. Com. Rep. 545, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1125, the constitutionality of the interstate commerce act, so far as it authorized the circuit courts to use their processes in aid of inquiries before the Commission, was sustained, the court observing in that connection:\n'It was clearly competent for Congress, to that end, to invest the Commission with authority to require the attendance and testimony of witnesses, and the production of books, papers, tariffs, contracts, agreements, and documents relating to any matter legally committed to that body for investigation. We do not understand that any of these propositions are disputed in this case.'\n\n The case of Adams v. New York, \n192 U.S. 585\n, 48 L. ed. 575, 24 Sup. Ct.Rep. 372, which was a writ of error to the supreme court of the state of New York, involving the seizure of certain gambling paraphernalia, was treated as involving the construction of the 4th and 5th Amendments to the Federal Constitution. It was held, in substance, that the fact that papers pertinent to the issue may have been illegally taken from the possession of the party against whom they are offered was not a valid objection to their admissibility; that the admission as evidence in a criminal trial or papers found in the execution of a valid search warrant prior to the indictment was not an infringement of the 5th Amendment, and that, by the introduction of such evidence, defendant was not compelled to incriminate himself. The substance of the opinion is contained in the following paragraph. It was contended that: 'If a search warrant is issued for stolen property, and burglars' tools be discovered and seized, they are to be excluded from testimony by force of these amendments. We think they were never intended to have that effect, but are rather designed to protect against compulsory testimony from a defendant against himself in a criminal trial, and to punish wrongful invasion of the home of the citizen or the unwarranted seizure of his papers and property, and to \n\n[201 U.S. 43, 73]\n\u00a0\n render invalid legislation or judicial procedure having such effect.'\n The Boyd Case must also be read in connection with the still later case of Interstate Commerce Commission v. Baird, \n194 U.S. 25\n, 48 L. ed. 860, 24 Sup.Ct.Rep. 563, which arose upon the petition of the Commission for orders requiring the testimony of witnesses and the production of certain books, papers, and documents. The case grew out of a complaint against certain railway companies that they charged unreasonable and unjust rates for the transportation of anthracite coal. Objection was made to the production of certain contracts between these companies upon the ground that it would compel the witnesses to furnish evidence against themselves, in violation of the 5th Amendment, and would also subject the parties to unreasonable searches and seizures. It was held that the circuit court erred in holding the contracts to be irrelevant, and in refusing to order their production as evidence by the witnesses who were parties to the appeal. In delivering the opinion of the court the Boyd Case was again considered in connection with the 4th and 5th Amendments, and the remark made by Mr. Justice Day that the immunity statute of 1893 'protects the witness from such use of the testimony given as will result in his punishment for crime or the forfeiture of his estate.'\n Having already held that, by reason of the immunity act of 1903, the witness could not avail himself of the 5th Amendment it follows that he cannot set up that amendment as against the production of the books and papers, since, in respect to these, he would also be protected by the immunity act. We think it quite clear that the search and seizure clause of the 4th Amendment was not intended to interfere with the power of courts to compel, through a subpoena duces tecum, the production, upon a trial in court, of documentary evidence. As remarked in Summers v. Moseley, 2 Cromp. & M. 477, it would be 'utterly impossible to carry on the administration of justice' without this writ. The following authorities are conclusive upon this question: Amey v. Long, 9 East, 473; Bull v. Loveland, \n\n[201 U.S. 43, 74]\n\u00a0\n 10 Pick. 9; United States Exp. Co. v. Henderson, 69 Iowa, 40, 28 N. W. 426; Greenl. Ev. 469a.\n If, whenever an officer or employee of a corporation were summoned before a grand jury as a witness he could refuse to produce the books and documents of such corporation, upon the ground that they would incriminate the corporation itself, it would result in the failure of a large number of cases where the illegal combination was determinable only upon the examination of such papers. Conceding that the witness was an officer of the corporation under investigation, and that he was entitled to assert the rights of corporation with respect to the production of its books and papers, we are of the opinion that there is a clear distinction in this particular between an individual and a corporation, and that the latter has no right to refuse to submit its books and papers for an examination at the suit of the state. The individual may stand upon his constitutional rights as a citizen. He is entitled to carry on his private business in his own way. His power to contract is unlimited. He owes no duty to the state or to his neighbors to divulge his business, or to open his doors to an investigation, so far as it may tend to criminate him. He owes no such duty to the state, since he receives nothing therefrom, beyond the protection of his life and property. His rights are such as existed by the law of the land long antecedent to the organization of the state, and can only be taken from him by due process of law, and in accordance with the Constitution. Among his rights are a refusal to incriminate himself, and the immunity of himself and his property from arrest or seizure except under a warrant of the law. He owes nothing to the public so long as he does not trespass upon their rights.\n Upon the other hand, the corporation is a creature of the state. It is presumed to be incorporated for the benefit of the public. It receives certain special privileges and franchises, and holds them subject to the laws of the state and the limitations of its charter. Its powers are limited by law. It can make no contract not authorized by its charter. Its rights to \n\n[201 U.S. 43, 75]\n\u00a0\n act as a corporation are only preserved to it so long as it obeys the laws of its creation. There is a reserved right in the legislature to investigate its contracts and find out whether it has exceeded its powers. It would be a strange anomaly to hold that a state, having chartered a corporation to make use of certain franchises, could not, in the exercise of its sovereignty, inquire how these franchises had been employed, and whether they had been abused, and demand the production of the corporate books and papers for that purpose. The defense amounts to this: That an officer of a corporation which is charged with a criminal violation of the statute, may plead the criminality of such corporation as a refusal to produce its books. To state this proposition is to answer it. While an individual may lawfully refuse to answer incriminating questions unless protected by an immunity statute, it does not follow that a corporation, vested with special privileges and franchises, may refuse to show its hand when charged with an abuse of such privileges.\n It is true that the corporation in this case was chartered under the laws of New Jersey, and that it receives its franchise from the legislature of that state; but such franchises, so far as they involve questions of interstate commerce, must also be exercised in subordination to the power of Congress to regulate such commerce, and in respect to this the general government may also assert a sovereign authority to ascertain whether such franchises have been exercised in a lawful manner, with a due regard to its own laws. Being subject to this dual sovereignty, the general government possesses the same right to see that its own laws are respected as the state would have with respect to the special franchises vested in it by the laws of the state. The powers of the general government in this particular in the vindication of its own laws are the same as if the corporation had been created by an act of Congress. It is not intended to intimate, however, that it has a general visitatorial power over the state corporations.\n\n 4. \nAlthough, for the reasons above stated, we are of the \n\n[201 U.S. 43, 76]\n\u00a0\n opinion that an officer of a corporation which is charged with a violation of a statute of the state of its creation, or of an act of Congress passed in the exercise of its constitutional powers, cannot refuse to produce the books and papers of such corporation, we do not wish to be understood as holding that a corporation is not entitled to immunity, under the 4th Amendment, against unreasonable searches and seizures. A corporation is, after all, but an association of individuals under an assumed name and with a distinct legal entity. In organizing itself as a collective body it waives no constitutional immunities appropriate to such body. Its property cannot be taken without compensation. It can only be proceeded against by due process of law, and is protected, under the 14th Amendment, against unlawful discrimination. Gulf, C. & S. F. R. Co. v. Ellis, \n165 \nU.S. 150, 154\n, 41 S. L. ed. 666, 667, 17 Sup.Ct.Rep. 255, and cases cited. Corporations are a necessary feature of modern business activity, and their aggregated capital has become the source of nearly all great enterprises.\n We are also of opinion that an order for the production of books and papers may constitute an unreasonable search and seizure within the 4th Amendment. While a search ordinarily implies a quest by an officer of the law, and a seizure contemplates a forcible dispossession of the owner, still, as was held in the Boyd Case, the substance of the offense is the compulsory production of private papers, whether under a search warrant or a subpoena duces tecum, against which the person, be he individual or corporation, is entitled to protection. Applying the test of reasonableness to the present case, we think the subpoena duces tecum is far too sweeping in its terms to be regarded as reasonable. It does not require the production of a single contract, or of contracts with a particular corporation, or a limited number of documents, but all understandings, contracts, or correspondence between the MacAndrews & Forbes Company, and no less than six different companies, as well as all reports made and accounts rendered by such companies from the date of the organization of the MacAndrews & Forbes Company, \n\n[201 U.S. 43, 77]\n\u00a0\n as well as all letters received by that company since its organization from more than a dozen different companies, situated in seven different states in the Union.\n If the writ had required the production of all the books, papers, and documents found in the office of the MacAndrews & Forbes Company, it would scarcely be more universal in its operation or more completely put a stop to the business of that company. Indeed, it is difficult to say how its business could be carried on after it had been denuded of this mass of material, which is not shown to be necessary in the prosecution of this case, and is clearly in violation of the general principle of law with regard to the particularity required in the description of documents necessary to a search warrant or subpoena. Doubtless many, if not all, of these documents may ultimately be required, but some necessity should be shown, either from an examination of the witnesses orally, or from the known transactions of these companies with the other companies implicated, or some evidence of their materiality produced, to justify an order for the production of such a mass of papers. A general subpoena of this description is equally indefensible as a search warrant would be if couched in similar terms. Ex parte Broun, 72 Mo. 83, 37 Am. Rep. 426; Shaftsbury v. Arrowsmith, 4 Ves. Jr. 66; Lee v. Angas, L. R. 2 Eq. 59.\n Of course, in view of the power of Congress over interstate commerce, to which we have adverted, we do not wish to be understood as holding that an esamination of the books of a corporation, if duly authorized by act of Congress, would constitute an unreasonable search and seizure within the 4th Amendment.\n But this objection to the subpoena does not go to the validity of the order remanding the petitioner, which is, therefore, affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan, concurring:\n I concur entirely in what is said in the opinion of the court \n\n[201 U.S. 43, 78]\n\u00a0\n in reference to the powers and functions of the grand jury and as to the scope of the 5th Amendment of the Constitution: I concur also in the affirmance of the judgment; but must withhold my assent to some of the views expressed in the opinion. It seems to me that the witness was not entitled to assert, as a reason for not obeying the order of the court, that the subpoena duces tecum was infringement of the 4th Amendment, which declares that 'the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, paper, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.' It may be, I am inclined to think, as a matter of procedure and practice, that the srbpoena duces tecum was too broad and indefinite. But the action of the court in that regard was, at the utmost, only error, and that error did not affect its jurisdiction to make the order, nor authorize the witness- whose personal rights, let it be observed, were in nowise involved in the pending inquiry-to refuse compliance with the subpoena, upon the ground that it involved an unreasonable search and seizure of the books, papers, and records of the corporation whose conduct, so far as it related to the Sherman antitrust act, was the subject of the examination. It was not his privilege to stand between the corporation and the government in the investigation before the grand jury. In my opinion, a corporation-'an artificial being, invisible, intangible, and existing only in contemplation of law'-cannot claim the immunity given by the 4th Amendment; for it is not a part of the 'people,' within the meaning of that Amendment. Nor is it embraced by the word 'persons' in the Amendment. If a contrary view obtains, the power of the government, by its representatives, to look into the books, records, and papers of a corporation of its own creation, to ascertain whether that corporation has obeyed or is defying the law, will be greatly curtailed, if not destroyed. If a corporation, when its affairs are under examination by a grand jury \n\n[201 U.S. 43, 79]\n\u00a0\n proceeding in its work under the orders of the court, can plead the immunity given by the 4th Amendment against unreasonable searches and seizures, may it not equally rely upon that Amendment to protect it even against a statute authorizing or directing the examination by the agents of the government creating it, of its papers, documents, and records, unless they specify the particular papers, documents, and records to be examined? If the order of the court below is to be deemed invalid as an unreasonable search and seizure of the papers, books, and records of the corporation, could it be deemed valid if made under the express authority of an act of Congress? Congress could not, any more than a court, authorize an unreasonable seizure or search in violation of the 4th Amendment. In my judgment when a grand jury, seeking, in the discharge of its public duties, to ascertain whether a corporation has violated the law in any particular, requires the production of the books, papers, and records of such corporation, no officer of that corporation can rightfully refuse, when ordered to do so by the court, to produce such books, papers, and records in his official custody, upon the ground simply that the order was, as to the corporation, an unreasonable search and seizure within the meaning of the 4th Amendment.\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna, concurring:\n I concur in the judgment, but not in all the propositions declared by the court. I think the subpoena is sufficiently definite. The charge pending was a violation of the antitrust act of 1890. [26 Stat. at L. 209, chap. 647, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3200.] The documents and papers sought were the understandings and agreements of the accused companies. That the documents commanded were many or evidenced transactions occurring through a period of time are not circumstances fatal to the validity of the subpoena. If there was a violation of the antitrust act, that is, combinations in restraint of trade, it would be probably evidenced by formal agreements, but it might also be evidenced or its transactions alluded to in telegrams \n\n[201 U.S. 43, 80]\n\u00a0\n and letters sent during the time the combination operated. Each telegram, each letter, would contribute proof, and therefore material testimony. Why, then, should they not be produced? What answer is given? It is said the subpoena is tantamount to requiring all the books, papers, and documents found in the office of the MacAndrews & Forbes Company, and an embarrassment is conjectured as a result to its business. These, then, I assume, are the detrimental consequences that will be produced by obedience to the subpoena. If such consequences could be granted, they are not fatal to the subpoena. But they may be denied. There can be, at most, but a temporary use of the books, and this can be accommodated to the convenience of parties. It is matter for the court, and we cannot assume that the court will fail of consideration for the interest of parties, or subject them to more inconvenience than the demands of justice may require.\n I cannot think that the consequences mentioned are important or necessary to the argument. A more serious matter is the application of the 4th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.\n It is said 'a search implies a quest by an officer of the law; a seizure contemplates a forcible dispossession of the owner.' Nothing can be more direct and plain; nothing more expressive to distinguish a subpoena from a search warrant. Can a subpoena lose this essential distinction from a search warrant by the generality or speciality of its terms? I think not. The distinction is based upon what is authorized or directed to be done,-not upon the form of words by which the authority or command is given. 'The quest of an officer' acts upon the things themselves,-may be secret, intrusive, accompanied by force. The service of a subpoena is but the delivery of a paper to a party,-is open and aboveboard. There is no element of trespass or force in it. It does not disturb the possession of property. It cannot be finally enforced except after challenge, and a judgment of the court upon the challenge. This is a safeguard against abuse the same as it is of other processes of the \n\n[201 U.S. 43, 81]\n\u00a0\n law; and it is all that can be allowed without serious embarrassment to the administration of justice. Of course, it constrains the will of parties, subjects their property to the uses of proof. But we are surely not prepared to say that such uses are unreasonable, or are sacrifices which the law may not demand.\n However, I may apprehend consequences that the opinion does not intend. It seems to be admitted that many, if not all, of the documents may ultimately be required, but it is said, 'some necessity should be shown, either from an examination of the witnesses orally, or from the known transactions of these companies with the other companies implicated, or some evidence of their materiality produced, to justify an order for the production.' This intimates a different objection to the order of the court than the generality of the subpoena, and, if good at all, would be good even though few in stead of many documents had been required or described ever so specifically. I am constrained to dissent from it. The materiality of his testimony is not open to a witness to dertermine, and the order of proof is for the court. Besides, if a grand jury may investigate without specific charge, may investigate upon the suggestion of one of its members, must it demonstrate the materiality of every piece of testimony it calls for before it can require the testimony? So limit the power to a grand jury and you may make it impotent in cases where it needs power most and in which its function can best be exercised.\n But what does the record show? It shows that Hale refused to give the testimony that, this court says, should have preceded the order under review. He refused to answer what the business of the MacAndrew & Forbes Company was, or where its office was, or whether there was an agreement with the company and the American Tobacco Company in regard to the products of their respective businesses, or whether the company he represented sold its products throughout the United States. The ground of refusal was that there was no legal warrant or authority for his examination,-not that the documents or testimony \n\n[201 U.S. 43, 82]\n\u00a0\n was not material, or not shown to be material. Besides, after objection made to the laying of a foundation, complaint cannot be made that no foundation was laid. And it seems to be an afterthought in the proceedings on habeas corpus that the ground objection to examination did not exclusively refer to the want of power in the grand jury.\n By virtue of its dominion over interstate commerce Congress has power, the opinion of the court asserts, over corporations engaged in that commerce. And the power is the same as if the corporations had been created by Congress. And yet it is said to be a power subject to the limitation of the 4th Amendment. To this I am not prepared to assent. I have already pointed out the essential distinction between a subpoena duces tecum and a search warrant, and, it may be, the case at bar demands from me no expression of opinion of the 4th Amendment. And I am mindful, too, of the reservation in the opinion of the court of the power of Congress to require by direct legislation the fullest disclosures of their affairs from corporations engaged in interstate commerce. While recognizing this may be true, and, that until such power is exercised, there may be reasons for holding that corporations are entitled to the protection of the 4th Amendment, there are reasons against the contention, and I wish to guard against any action which would preclude against their consideration in cases where the 4th Amendment may be a more determining factor than it is in the case at bar. There are certainly strong reasons for the contention that, if corporations cannot plead the immunity of the 5th Amendment, they cannot plead the immunity of the 4th Amendment. The protection of both amendments, it can be contended, is against the compulsory production of evidence to be used in criminal trials. Such warrants are used in aid of public prosecutions (Cooley, Const. Lim., 6th ed. 364), and in Boyd v. United States, \n116 U.S. 616\n, 29 L. ed. 746, 6 Sup.Ct.Rep. 524, a relation between the 4th Amendment and the 5th Amendment was declared. It was said the amendments throw great light on each other, 'for the 'unreasonable searches and seizures condemned \n\n[201 U.S. 43, 83]\n\u00a0\n in the 4th Amendment are almost always made for the purpose of compelling a man to give evidence against himself, which, in criminal cases, is condemned in the 5th Amendment; and compelling a man 'in a criminal case to be a witness against himself,' which is condemned in the 5th Amendment, throws light on the question as to what is an 'unreasonable search and seizure' within the meaning of the 4th Amendment. And we have been unable to perceive that the seizure of a man's private books and papers, to be used in evidence against him, is substantially different from compelling him to be a witness against himself.' Boyd v. United States is still recognized, and if its reasoning remains unimpaired, and the purpose and effect of the 4th Amendment receives illumination from the 5th, or, to express the idea differently, if the amendments are the complements of each other, directed against the different ways by which a man's immunity from giving evidence against himself may be violated, it would seem a strong, if not an inevitable, conclusion, that, if corporations have not such immunity, they can no more claim the protection of the 4th Amendment than they can of the 5th.\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer, dissenting:\n With what is said in the opinion of the court of the necessity of a 'charge,' with the proposition that the immunity granted by the Federal statute is sufficient protection against both the nation and the several states, with the holding that the protection accorded by the 5th Amendment to the Constitution is personal to the individual, and does not extend to an agent of an individual, or justify such agent in refusing to give testimony incriminating his principal, and also that the subpoena duces tecum cannot be sustained, I fully agree.\n Further, I desire to emphasize certain truths which in this and other cases decided to-day seem to be ignored or depreciated. The immunities and protection of articles 4, 5, and 14 \n\n[201 U.S. 43, 84]\n\u00a0\n of the amendments to the Federal Constitution are available to a corporation so far as, in the nature of things, they are applicable. Its property may not be taken for public use without just compensation. It cannot be subjected to unreasonable searches and seizures. It cannot be deprived of life or property without due process of law.\n It may be well to compare the words of description in articles 4 and 5 with those in article 14:\n'Article 4. The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, paper, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\n\n'Article 5. No person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor to be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.'\n\n'Article 14. Nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.'\n\n In Santa Clara County v. Southern P. R. Co. \n118 \nU.S. 394, 396\n, 30 S. L. ed. 118, 6 Sup.Ct.Rep. 1132, Mr. Chief Justice Waite said:\n'The court does not wish to hear argument on the question whether the provision in the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, which forbids a state to deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws, applies to these corporations. We are all of opinion that it does.'\n\n See also Pembina Consol. Silver Min. & Mill. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n125 U.S. 181\n, 31 L. ed. 650, 2 Inters. Com. Rep. 24, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 737; Missouri P. R. Co. v. Mackey, \n127 U.S. 205\n, 32 L. ed. 107, 8 Sup.Ct.Rep. 1161; Minneapolis & St. L. R. Co. v. Beckwith, \n129 U.S. 26\n, 32 L. ed. 585, 9 Sup.Ct.Rep. 207; Charlotte, C. & A. R. Co. v. Gibbes, \n142 U.S. 386\n, 35 L. ed. 1051, 12 Sup.Ct.Rep. 255; Monongahela Nav. Co. v. United States, \n148 U.S. 312\n, 37 L. ed. 463, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 622; Gulf, C. & S. F. R. Co. v. Ellis, \n165 \nU.S. 150, 154\n, 41 S. L. ed. 666, 667, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 255, \n\n[201 U.S. 43, 85]\n\u00a0\n and cases cited; Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Chicago, \n166 U.S. 226\n, 41 L. ed. 979, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 581.\n These decisions were under the 14th Amendment; but if the work 'person' in that amendment includes corporations, it also includes corporations when used in the 4th and 5th Amendments.\n By the 4th Amendment the 'people' are guaranteed protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. 'Citizens,' is a descriptive word; no broader, to say the least, than 'people.'\n As repeatedly held, a corporation is a citizen of a state for purposes of jurisdiction of Federal courts, and, as a citizen, it may locate mining claims under the laws of the United States (McKinley v. Sheeler, \n130 U.S. 630\n, 32 L. ed. 1048, 9 Sup.Ct.Rep. 638) and is entitled to the benefit of the Indian depredation acts (United States v. Northwestern Express Stage, & Transp. Co. \n164 U.S. 686\n, 41 L. ed. 599, 17 Sup.Ct.Rep. 206). Indeed, it is essentially but an association of individuals, to which is given certain rights and privileges, and in which is vested the legal title. The beneficial ownership is in the individuals, the corporation being simply an instrumentality by which the powers granted to these associated individuals may be exercised. As said by Chief Justice Marshall in Providence Bank v. Billings, 4 Pet. 514, 562, 7 L. ed. 939, 956: 'The great object of an incorporation is to bestow the character and properties of individuality on a collective and changing body of men.'\n United States v. Amedy, 11 Wheat. 392, 6 L. ed. 502, was the case of an indictment under an act of Congress for destroying a vessel with intent to prejudice the underwriters. The act of Congress declared that 'if any person shall . . . wilfully and corruptly cast away . . . any ship or vessel . . . with intent or design to prejudice any person or persons that hath underwritten or shall underwrite any policy,' etc. [2 Stat. at L. 290, chap. 40,  2, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 364.] The indictment charged an intent to defraud an incorporated insurance company, and the court held that a corporation is a person within the meaning of the act, saying (p. 412, L. ed. p. 507):\n'The mischief intended to be reached by the statute is the \n\n[201 U.S. 43, 86]\n\u00a0\n same, whether it respects private or corporate persons. That corporations are, in law, for civil purposes, deemed persons, is unquestionable. And the citation from 2 Inst. 736, establishes that they are so deemed within the purview of penal statutes. Lord Coke, there, in commenting on the statute of 31 Eliz. chap. 7, respecting the erection of cottages, where the word used is, 'no person shall,' etc., says: 'This extends as well to persons politic and incorporate, as to natural persons whatsoever.\"\n\n Neither does the fact that a corporation is engaged in the interstate commerce in any manner abridge the protection and applicable immunities accorded by the amendments. The corporation of which the petitioner was an officer was chartered by a state, and over it the general government has no more control than over an individual citizen of that state. Its power to regulate commerce does not carry with it a right to dispense with the 4th and 5th Amendments, to unreasonably search or seize the papers of an individual or corporation engaged in such commerce, or deprive him or it of any immunity or protection secured by either amendment.\n It is true that there is a power of supervision and inspection of the inside workings of a corporation, but that belongs to the creator of the corporation. If a state has chartered it, the power is lodged in the state. If the nation, then in the nation; and it cannot be exercised by any other authority. It is in the nature of the power of visitation.\n In Angell & Ames on Corporations, 9th ed., chap. 19,  684, 685, the authors say:\n'To render the charters or constitutions, ordinances and by-laws of corporations of perfect obligation, and generally to maintain their peace and good government, these bodies are subject to visitation; or, in other words, to the inspection and control of tribunals recognized by the laws of the land. Civil corporations are visited by the government itself, through the medium of the courts of justice; but the internal affairs of ecclesiastical and eleemosynary corporations are, in general, inspected and controlled by a private visitor. . . . \n\n[201 U.S. 43, 87]\n\u00a0\n 'In this country, where there is no individual founder or donor, the legislature are the visitors of all corporations founded by them for public purposes, and may direct judicial proceedings against them for abuse or neglects which, at common law, would cause a forfeiture of their charters.'\n\n The matter is discussed in Blackstone's Commentaries, in par. 3, chap. 18, bk. 1, and he says:\n'I proceed, therefore, next to inquire, how these corporations may be visited. For corporations being composed of individuals, subject to human frailties, are liable, as well as private persons, to deviate from the end of their institution. And for that reason the law has provided proper persons to visit, inquire into, and correct all irregularities that arise in such corporations, either sole or aggregate and whether ecclesiastical, civil, or eleemosynary.'\n\n And in respect to civil corporations he adds, same paragraph and chapter (*782):\n'The law having by immemorial usage appointed them to be visited and inspected by the King, their founder, in His Majesty's Court of King's Bench, according to the rules of the common law, they ought not to be visited elsewhere, or by any other authority.'\n\n In 2 Kent, Com. *300, the author says:\n'The visitation of civil corporations is by the government itself, through the medium of the courts of justice.'\n\n In Amherst Academy v. Cowls, 6 Pick. 427, 433, 17 Am. Dec. 387, it was held that:\n'Without doubt the legislature are them visitors of all corporations founded by them for public purposes, where there is no individual founder or donor, and may direct judicial process against them for abuses or neglects which by common law would cause a forfeiture of their charters.'\n\n The right of visitation is for the purpose of control and to see that the corporation keeps within the limits of its powers. It would be strange if a corporation doing business in a dozen states was subject to the visitation of each of those states, and \n\n[201 U.S. 43, 88]\n\u00a0\n compelled to regulate its actions according to the judgments-perhaps the conflicting judgments-of the several legislatures. The fact that a state corporation may engage in business which is within the general regulating power of the national government does not give to Congress any right of visitation for of any power to dispense with the immunities and protection of the 4th and 5th Amendments. The national government has jurisdiction over crimes committed within its special territorial limits. Can it dispense in such cases with these immunities and protections? No more can it do so in respect to the acts and conduct of individuals coming within its regulating power. It has the same control over commerce with foreign nations as over that between the states. Boyd v. United States, \n116 U.S. 616\n, 29 L. ed. 746, 6 Sup.Ct.Rep. 524, arose under the revenue acts, and the applicability of the 4th and 5th Amendments was sustained. In that case is an elaborate opinion by Mr. Justice Bradley, speaking for the court, in which the origin of the 4th and 5th Amendments is discussed, their relationship to each other shown, and the necessity of a constant adherence to the underlying thought of protection expressed in them strenuously insisted upon. I quote his words (p. 635, L. ed. p. 752, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 535):\n'It may be that it [the proceeding in question] is the obnoxious thing in its mildest and least repulsive form; but illegitimate and unconstitutional practices get their first footing in that way; namely, by silent approaches and slight deviations from legal modes of procedure. This can only be obviated by adhering to the rule that constitutional provisions for the security of person and property should be liberally construed. A close and literal construction deprives them of half their efficacy, and leads to gradual depreciation of the right, as if it consisted more in sound than in substance. It is the duty of courts to be watchful for the constitutional rights of the citizens, and against any stealthy encroachments thereon. Their motto should be obsta principiis.'\n\n Finally, as the subpoena duces tecum was the initiatory step in the proceedings before the grand jury against this petitioner, \n\n[201 U.S. 43, 89]\n\u00a0\n as that is the major fact in those proceedings, and as it is agreed that it is not sustainable, it seems to me that the order adjudicating him in contempt should be set aside, and this notwithstanding that subsequently he improperly refused to answer certain questions.\n The case is not parallel to that of an indictment in two counts upon which a general judgment is entered, and one of which counts is held good and the other bad, for a writ of habeas corpus is not a writ of error, and the order to be entered thereon is for a discharge or a remand to custody. If a discharge is ordered, no punishment can be inflicted under the judgment as rendered; and if a new prosecution is instituted containing the good count, a plea of former conviction will be a full defense. But in the case at bar an order for a discharge will have no such result. The habeas corpus statute (Rev. Stat.  761, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 594) provides that 'the court or justice or judge shall proceed in a summary way . . . to dispose of the party as law and justice require.' Justice requires that he should not be subjected to the costs of this habeas corpus proceeding, or be punished for contempt, when he was fully justified in disregarding the principal demand made upon him.\n The order of the circuit court should be reversed and the case remanded with instructions to discharge the petitioner, leaving to the grand jury the right to initiate new proceedings not subject to the objections to this.\n I am authorized to say that the CHIEF JUSTICE concurs in these views. \n\n\n\n","67":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHALLENBORG v. COBRE GRANDE COPPER CO.(1906)\nNo. 87\nArgued: Decided: January 8, 1906\n\n\n\n This is a minority stockholder's suit. It was brought originally by Axel W. Hallenborg as owner of 8,617 shares of the Cobre Grande Copper Company, an Arizona corporation, and also as creditor of that corporation for advances to the amount of $50,005. The appellant Addicks owned 5,000 shares and was allowed to intervene at the trial, and adopted Hallenborg's complaint.\n In November, 1898, defendant (appellee) Greene owned certain mining properties in Sonora, Mexico, and had an option on other properties. He gave an option on these properties to defendant Mitchell. It was provided in the option that $12,500 should be paid in cash, and $237,500, as follows: $37,500 on or before November 26, 1899; $100,000 on or before November 26, 1900; $100,000 on or before November 26, 1901. \n\n[200 U.S. 239, 240]\n\u00a0\n In April, 1899, Greene, Mitchell, and other parties, under the laws of Arizona, organized the Cobre company. One hundred and ninety-nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five shares of the stock were turned over to Mitchell in consideration of his option from Greene, which option was assigned to the Cobre company, subject to Greene's rights. The Cobre company went into possession, and was in possession in September, 1899. In October of that year controversies arose between Greene and the company over the option and the right to possession of the properties, and Greene entered into possession of them. Thereupon the company instituted suits in the courts of Mexico to gain possession of the properties, and also instituted a suit in the district court of Maricopa county, Arizona, to restrain the delivery to Greene of the deeds which were put in escrow under the contract with Mitchell, which had been assigned to the Cobre company. In the latter suit an injunction was granted, restraining Greene from demanding or receiving the deeds. A suit was also brought in New York and one in Texas to recover the product of the mines. In the suit in Arizona the Cobre company alleged, among other things, in substance, all the facts set forth in paragraph three of the original complaint in the present suit, and prayed that Greene be required to account for the proceeds of the products of the mines and other property alleged to have been appropriated by him. Issue was joined by the defendants therein, the case tried, and a judgment entered dismissing the complaint. The judgment was not appealed from. At the time of the judgment the plaintiffs were stockholders of the Cobre company.\n While the litigation was pending, the stockholders of the Cobre company, or a majority of them, comprising stockholders to the number of 115,049 shares, entered into a pooling arrangement, whereby all of their stock was delivered to defendant Gage, with power to vote the same at all meetings of the stockholders. Subsequently Gage was granted the right to dispose of and sell the stock at his discretion. Several attempts were made by Gage to sell the stock at $2.50 a share, which \n\n[200 U.S. 239, 241]\n\u00a0\n failed on account of the other contracting parties not complying with their contracts. The plaintiff Hallenborg and John H. Costello opened negotiations with Gage for the stock at $2.50 a share. This also failed on account of objection by Costello to the contract which was drawn, although negotiations were kept up until December, 1900. Then Gage opened negotiations with Greene, who offered to buy the stock, upon better terms than anybody else had offered. Gage consulted the directors, and they urged him to enter into a contract with Greene. The stock represented by Gage represented the entire stock of the company, including Hallenborg's 8, 000 shares, except that owned by Greene and his associates, and about 6, 500 shares owned by other parties. Gage entered into a contract with Greene, December 12, 1900, and it was ratified in its entirety by the directors and by a majority vote of the stockholders. Hallenborg was present by attorney at the meeting, and protested against the ratification. The contract was complied with by Greene, and he paid the full purchase price for the shares, and they were delivered to him and the Greene Copper Company. All of the stockholders accepted the money so paid except Hallenborg, who returned the money sent him, and declined to be bound by the contract.\n The court finds that the contract was made with Greene in good faith, with full knowledge and consent of the directors, and upon the advice of counsel of the Cobre company, that the company could not successfully maintain the suit brought in Arizona, and with the full belief on the part of Gage that the contract was for the best interest of the company and its stockholders. And the court further finds that no agreement was made between Gage or other persons, whereby the directors-Adamson, Wood, O'Keefe, or any of them-were to derive benefit, or did derive any benefit whatsoever, except such as they derived from the sale of their stock.\n The contract of December 12, between Gage and Greene, provided for the payment of the stock in certain instalments. Greene was to pay to Gage $ 25,000 in cash in addition to the \n\n[200 U.S. 239, 242]\n\u00a0\n $2.50 per share, and also pay to Gage $30,000, and in addition 3,000 shares of the capital stock of the Greene Consolidated Copper Company, or, in lieu thereof, $30,000 in cash. Gage was given the privilege of taking, instead of $2.50 per share for shares of stock in the Cobre company, stock in the Greene Consolidated Copper Company,-four of the former for one of the latter,-the option to be exercised before payment of the second instalment on the stock of the Cobre company. Five thousand shares of the Greene Consolidated Copper Company were provided to be paid to Gage for his own use and benefit, and 5,000 shares for the use and benefit of L. H. Chalmers, Baker & Bennett, and Herndon & Norris, attorneys at law in Arizona.\n It, was also agreed that a certain promissory note given by J. H. Costello to the Cobre company, amounting to $23,000, was to be surrendered to Costello. This note was conditioned upon the Cobre company obtaining possession of its property in Mexico, and was not to be paid until ninety days after such recovery. It was also agreed that the suits brought by the Cobre company in New York, Texas, and Arizona should be dismissed. The other provisions of the contract are but incident to those before given, and may be omitted. The suits in New York are still pending. All the other suits were dismissed or otherwise disposed of by final judgment prior to this suit. The $25,000 mentioned in the contract of December 12 was for the purpose of taking up and discharging certain notes due by the Cobre company. It was so paid. The $30,000 mentioned was to be, and it was, turned into the treasury of the company to pay its debts. The 3,000 shares in the Greene Consolidated Company, or the alternative $30,000, was also for the purpose of paying the debts of the Cobre company outside of the $ 25,000 before mentioned. It was paid into the treasury. The 5,000 shares of stock in the Greene Consolidated Company was intended by all parties as compensation to Gage as president of the Cobre company, and for the time, labor, and trouble given to the company's business, and for \n\n[200 U.S. 239, 243]\n\u00a0\n money advanced for it, and expenses paid in attending to its affairs. Instead of shares, as provided, a cash payment of $50,000 was made to him. The shares paid to Chalmers and Baker & Bennett, Herndon & Norris, were intended to be paid as compensation as attorneys for the company for their services in various litigations. Instead of the shares, a cash payment of $ 50,000 was made, and it is found that their services were reasonably worth that sum. The note against Costello was surrendered to him.\n The court also finds that the only property in possession of the Cobre company within the jurisdiction of the court is the money paid into the treasury of the company in pursuance of the contract of December 12. And, finally, the court finds 'that the temporary restraining order granted in this action, enjoining defendants from carrying out the terms and provisions of the contract of December 12, 1900, and dismissing any and all of the actions then pending in behalf of the Cobre Grande, and enjoining defendant Phoenix National Bank from delivering up any of the papers and documents held by it in escrow, evidencing the title held by the Cobre Grande Copper Company in and to the mining property described in the complaint, was modified, and the part of it enjoining the Phoenix National Bank was dissolved upon the ground that the district court in and for Maricopa county had rendered its decision in the suit of the Cobre Grande Copper Company against Greene and others adversely to said Cobre Grande Copper Company, and that, as a part of the judgment of said court, the Phoenix National Bank was commanded to deliver up said papers and documents to said defendant Greene, and that, as this case now stands, there is nothing before the court except an application for the appointment of a receiver.'\n Mr. Alfred B. Cruikshank for appellants.\n Messrs. Aldis B. Browne, Alexander Britton, Ben Goodrich, Norton Chase, Eugene S. Ives, and M. E. Harvy for appellees.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice McKenna: \n\n[200 U.S. 239, 244]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna, after stating the case as above, delivered the opinion of the court:\n Both of the lower courts held that the suit had become one for the appointment of a receiver. The supreme court said: 'The purposes for which a receiver is asked are twofold, so far as the record is concerned: First, that he may take charge of the property of the company; second, that he may prosecute its litigation.' [(Ariz.) 74 Pac. 1052.] After some comment the court further observed that the district court was well within the exercise of a sound discretion in refusing to appoint a receiver, and 'that there was not any other relief which the court could properly grant the plaintiffs in this action.' We do not find it necessary to decide whether, if plaintiffs' complaint were true, they would not be entitled to greater relief than the appointment of a receiver. We rest our judgment on the merits. In other words, we think the complaint has not been established.\n The complaint charges a conspiracy between Greene and Mitchell, being at the time directors of the Cobre company, to deprive the company of its mines and property, and acquire it for themselves; and that, in pursuance of the conspiracy, they took possession of the company's property. No evidence was offered in the present suit to sustain the charge. Records of suits in which like charges were made cannot be regarded as such. The complaint also charges the contract of December 12, 1900, to be a 'fraudulent and corrupt contract and conspiracy of Greene with Gage and other directors of the Cobre company, to stop the litigation against defendants, and to secure to them the undisputed possession of the mines' from which the Cobre company had been evicted. Both of the lower courts found against the charge. They found that Gage entered into the contract with the knowledge of the directors of the Cobre company, and in good faith, upon the advice of counsel of the futility of further pursuing the litigation against Greene, and in the belief that 'the contract was to the best interest of said company and its stockholders.' It may be admitted that \n\n[200 U.S. 239, 245]\n\u00a0\n Greene's purpose was to stop the litigation against him, and quiet his possession of the property, but we cannot assume from this that he was guilty of fraud in making the contract of December 12, or that it was part of a conspiracy with the directors of the Cobre company to deprive the company of its property. Therefore any fraud in fact is out of the case.\n Plaintiffs, however, contend that the contract is fraudulent on its face, and that it was decided so to be by the supreme court of New York in Hallenborg v. Greene, 66 App. Div. 590, 73 N. Y. Supp. 403. The pleadings are not set out in the report of the case. We may assume, however, that the complaint was, in most part, as that in the case at bar.\n The case went to the supreme court on an appeal from an order granting a preliminary injunction and appointing a receiver. It was heard on the complaint and affidavits of the plaintiff. The affidavits of the defendants were, by stipulation, omitted from the record. Upon the showing thus made the court said:\n'According to the complaint and affidavits, the Cobre company was not only a solvent corporation, but its assets were exceedingly valuable; and through conspiracy, fraud, and bribery the defendants Greene and Mitchell have obtained the management and control thereof to further their own schemes in hostility to the interests of the other stockholders, and have actually obtained a contract from the Cobre company to transfer to these rival companies, controlled and managed by Greene and Mitchell, all its property and property rights, without even a nominal consideration. This fraudulent contract was being consummated with despatch at the time of the commencement of this action and the granting of the injunction herein. These allegations must be taken as true for the purposes of this appeal, and it is evident that the inevitable consequence will be not only that the stock of the Cobre company, of which the plaintiff is a large holder,- owning one twenty-fifth of the entire stock,-will be rendered worthless, but that there will \n\n[200 U.S. 239, 246]\n\u00a0\n be no assets with which to pay the claims of creditors, of whom also the plaintiff is one for a substantial amount.\n\n'It needs no refinement of the decisions to show that the cause thus presented is one for equitable cognizance.'\n\n The allegations of the plaintiffs were taken to be true; and, being so taken, the comments of the court may claim justification. In the case at bar the allegations of the complaint, as far as they are passed on, are found to be nutrue. The opinion of the supreme court of New York, therefore, is of no value to plaintiffs' contention.\n We are remitted, therefore, to the contract of December 12. What fraudulent element is there in that? It disposed of the shares of the stockholders, and it secured the payment of money to the corporation; it settled controversies which, as far as appears, the company had no means of prosecuting, and which, wherever they were tried, had been decided against the company; and where not decided, in the opinion of the company's attorney, would also be decided against the company. We may assume that the stockholders knew or could estimate the value of the properties. They deposited their stock with Gage to sell,-became, indeed, impatient at his delay. We may assume the price of the stock reflected the value of the properties,-Hallenborg bought his shares at $2.50. He had an option upon all that were in Gage's hands at that price. He let the option lapse, although negotiation was kept up with him from October to December. Gage then turned to Greene, who, it is found, offered to purchase the stock on better terms than anybody else ever offered. And there was no concealment. Gage was urged by the directors of the company and a large majority of the stockholders to make the contract. It was subsequently formally ratified by the directors and by a majority vote of the stockholders, at a stockholders' meeting.\n But there were three other elements from which plaintiffs deduce fraud. Gage was given $50,000 as compensation as president of the Cobre company and other services and expenses paid by him; the attorneys of the company were paid \n\n[200 U.S. 239, 247]\n\u00a0\n $50,000 for legal services, and there was surrendered to Costello the note which he owed the company. There was no secrecy about these items, and it is manifest from the findings and the evidence that they constituted no inducement to the contract. Whether Gage can be compelled to pay to the Cobre company the money received by him, we need not decide. Its receipt by him did not make the whole contract fraudulent. It did not take from the stockholders the power to sell their stock, nor from the directors of the company the power to control the litigation in which the company was involved, to abandon that litigation, or to compromise it. In the exercise of their power they could have done those things directly. It was a matter of form and procedure that it was done in the manner provided by the contract of December 12.\n It is deceptive to call or regard the action of the directors as a transfer of the property of the corporation without consideration, or for an inadequate consideration. The company had only a right to purchase the property, the conditions of which it had not fulfilled. It claimed legal excuse, and brought suits against Greene; but that it had legal excuse was disputed, and seems to have been doubted by all who were interested in the property but the plaintiffs. A jury in Texas had decided against the excuse; and the court in Arizona has also done so. That the latter was subsequent to the contract of December 12 does not militate against it as proof of good faith of the settlement.\n This view of the merits of the case renders it unnecessary to pass upon the contention of the defendants that a court of equity has no inherent power, in the absence of statutory authority, to appoint a receiver upon the application of a private person, under the circumstances presented by the complaint.\n There are assignments of error upon the rulings of the trial court on the admissions of testimony, oral and documentary, which we do not think call for discussion. It is enough to say that they are not well taken. \n\n[200 U.S. 239, 248]\n\u00a0\n There is also an assignment of error upon the refusal of the supreme court to make certain findings of fact. We think the findings made substantially cover those proposed; certainly to the extent necessary to the case as we have considered it.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","68":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHALSELL v. RENFROW(1906)\nNo. 254\nArgued: Decided: May 14, 1906\n\n\n\n Messrs. J. H. Everest and Henry H. Howard for appellants.\n\n\n[202 U.S. 287, 288]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John W. Shartel, James R.

The case was tried before a judge of the supreme court, and all the issues were found for the defendants. It then was taken before the full court, upon a transcript of the evidence and proceedings, and the judgment for the defendants was affirmed. 14 Okla. 674, 78 Pac. 118. Thereupon it was brought here by appeal.\n It is assumed by the parties that the statement of facts prefixed to the opinion in the record is not the finding required by the act of April 7, 1874, chap. 80,  2, 18 Stat. at L. 27, and we assume, for purposes of decision, that under the act of May 2, 1890, chap. 182,  9, 26 Stat. at L. 81, 86, no such finding of facts was necessary. See Oklahoma City v. McMaster, \n196 U.S. 529\n, 49 L. ed. 587, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 324; De la Rama v. De La Rama, \n201 U.S. 303\n, 50 L. ed. --, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 485. But when, as here, the court of first instance saw the witnesses, the full court of \n\n[202 U.S. 287, 292]\n\u00a0\n the territory would deal with its finding as it would with the verdict of a jury, and would not go beyond questions of the admissibility of evidence, and whether there was any evidence to sustain the conclusion reached. Ellison v. Beannabia, 4 Okla. 347, 352, 46 Pac. 477. This court naturally would go no further unless in an unusual case. See Sanford v. Sanford, \n139 U.S. 642\n, 35 L. ed. 290, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 666.\n In view of these preliminaries, if any statement is necessary here when the judgment sets forth that the court 'finds the issues in said cause in favor of the defendants,' a single matter would be enough. It appears from the petition that after the defendant Renfrow, who was the owner of the land, had broken off his dealings with the plaintiffs, he conveyed the premises to the defendant Edwards. In Edwards's answer it is alleged that he purchased for value and without notice. The answer of Renfrow, though less specific, is to like effect. This was one of the issues in the cause which was found for the defendants, as, upon the evidence, it well might be. Therefore it is not necessary to go further in order to show that the judgment cannot be reversed. For, of course, specific performance is impossible where the party to the contract has sold the property to one who is free from all equities. However, as the full court put its affirmation of the judgment upon other grounds, we will not stop at this point.\n The full court sustained the single judge on the ground that under the Oklahoma statute in force at the time no contract relating to real estate, other than for a lease for not over one year, 'shall be valid until reduced to writing and subscribed by the parties thereto' (Laws of 1897, chap. 8,  4), and that the statute had not been satisfied, or the case taken out of it by part performance. This statute, if taken literally and naturally, goes further than its English prototype. It is not satisfied by a memorandum made with a different intent, but requires an instrument drawn for the purpose of embodying the contract, and, in the case of an agreement to buy and sell, the subscription of both the buyer and seller, not merely that of 'the party to be charged therewith.' McCormick v. Bonfils, \n\n[202 U.S. 287, 293]\n\u00a0\n 9 Okla. 605, 618, 60 Pac. 296. There was no such instrument. We rather infer that the court below inclined toward the foregoing construction, but its discussion suggests that possibly a memorandum to be gathered from connected documents might be enough, and, therefore, again, we do not stop here.\n The case for the plaintiffs is this: Shields, an agent without authority in writing, as required by the Oklahoma statute, made an agreement to sell the land for $10,000, and received a check for $500. Material additions were made to this check afterwards by the plaintiffs, so that it is a question, at least, whether it was admissible in evidence. Wilson's Stat. Okla. 1903,  831. See Bacon v. Hooker, 177 Mass. 335, 337, 83 Am. St. Rep. 279, 58 N. E. 1078. The agent telegraphed to Renfrow that he had sold 'the 40 acres, ten thousand cash, five hundred forfeit,' and Renfrow telegraphed back confirming the sale. Later it turned out that a parcel of 50 by 100 feet had been conveyed to a third person. The parties met and it was agreed orally that $200 should be taken from the price for this. It was found further that one Springstine had or claimed possession of a part of the land under a lease. Renfrow was willing to convey and to take proceedings to turn Springstine out, but the plaintiffs refused to take a conveyance or to pay unless they were put into possession in thirty days. While matters stood thus, Renfrow signed a deed of the land, excepting the conveyed parcel, expressed to be in consideration of $10,000, sent it to a bank, and wrote to the plaintiff Halsell that he had done so, and had instructed the bank to deliver the deed upon his depositing $9,500 to Renfrow's credit and $500 to the credit of Shields within two days. This is the nearest approach to a memorandum that was made. Halsell replied to Renfrow that he had made a tender of $9,300, and that this with the $200 agreed to be allowed for the strip conveyed and the $500 held by Shields would make the $10,000. He further stated that he had requested delivery of possession, which had been refused, and that Renfrow could not expect the money without \n\n[202 U.S. 287, 294]\n\u00a0\n giving possession. Renfrow replied, stating that he had been willing to give such possession as he could, suggesting that he would have arranged in another way as to the $200, and that he regretted the termination of the matter. That was the end of the dealings, and directly afterwards the sale to Edwards took place.\n As the plaintiffs were unwilling to accept the deed unless a fuller and more undisputed possession were given than could be given at the time, Renfrow was justified in selling to another who would take the risk or rely upon his covenants. In fact, Edwards paid $500 to get possession, in addition to Renfrow's price of $10,000. Moreover, the plaintiffs' unwillingness shows that apart from the differences as to consideration, there was no agreement with regard to an essential term of the conveyance when the deed was sent to the bank. There may have been a previous oral agreement, such as is suggested by the letter and deed, but before any memorandum was made, and while Renfrow still was free, the plaintiffs were informed that Renfrow would undertake to do only what he could, and what we have stated. So far, therefore, as the writings convey the notion of an absolute undertaking to convey a present clear possession, they do not express the modified bargain to which Renfrow was willing to assent. The delivery of the deed was authorized only upon payment of the price, and acceptance of it would have been an assent to Renfrow's terms. But there was no such assent. The plaintiffs say now that the differences were only trifles, not going to the essence of the contract, but they were enough at the time to make them unwilling to accept the deed.\n In view of the findings of the trial judge it is difficult to see what is open as to part performance. As there was no agreement at the last stage, there can have been no part performance then. The few steps, if any, that were taken, while everything rested in parol, before the modification as to the amount of land and the price, and the arising of the difficulty as to possession, were disputed and obliterated by Springstine under his adverse \n\n[202 U.S. 287, 295]\n\u00a0\n claim as a lessee. We think that this matter does not deserve discussion at greater length.\n It is said that the defendant Renfrow is estopped by the payment of $ 500 to Shields by force of the act of 1897, chap. 8,  7, to the effect that any person 'having knowingly received and accepted the benefits, or any part thereof, of any conveyance, mortgage, or contract relating to real estate shall be concluded thereby, and estopped to deny the validity of such conveyance, mortgage, or contract, or the power or authority to make and execute the same, except on the ground of fraud.' But here again we are met by the findings and the facts. The check given to Shields was not a payment to Renfrow. Shields had not even oral authority to convey or to receive the purchase money. The terms of Renfrow's letter to Halsell about the deed show that he had not accepted the delivery of the check as a payment then, and since then it would seem that neither party to the litigation has been willing to accept the money.\n It appears to us unnecessary to amplify further the reasons for affirming the judgment below.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","69":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHAZELTON v. SHECKELS(1906)\nNo. 225\nArgued: April 21, 1906Decided: April 23, 1906\n\n\n\n Mr. Heber J. May for appellant.\n\n\n[202 U.S. 71, 75]\n\u00a0\n Mr. J. J. Darlington for appellee.\n\n\n[202 U.S. 71, 76]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a bill for the specific performance of a contract dated \n\n[202 U.S. 71, 77]\n\u00a0\n December 11, 1902, to sell for $9,000, at any time during the then present session of Congress, 'and such additional time as may be necessary for settlement under appropriation by that Congress,' part of a lot in a square which Congress now has voted to acquire for the erection of a hall of records.\n The bill was brought against one Miller. Recently Miller's death was suggested and his heirs and devisees were substituted, but, for convenience, Miller will be referred to as the defendant.\n The contract provided that if Hazelton should 'fail to take advantage of and accept this offer as above within the time mentioned, then this agreement shall be null and void.' The bill alleges that a part of the consideration for the contract 'was services rendered both before and after the making of said contract, by the plaintiff, in bringing the property to the attention of the committees of Congress as a suitable and appropriate site for a hall of records.' It sets forth that the plaintiff, before and after the same date, expended much time, labor, and money in rendering those services, and what they were, viz., collecting and printing facts for the information of the committees and members of Congress, making briefs and arguments, and drawing a bill for the purchase or condemnation of the square. The bill passed at the session named in the contract. After its passage the plaintiff negotiated, and finally, in August, 1903, concluded, a sale of the property in question for $14,395.50, subject to examination of the title and arrangements for payment. It is alleged that the time for settlement under the appropriation has not expired. The bill further alleges that the defendant has notified the plaintiff that he does not intend to keep his contract, but means to convey directly to the United States, and to demand the full price agreed upon by the government. The defendant has tendered a deed to the United States, which has not been accepted. The plaintiff has offered to the defendant a deed, to be executed by the latter and his wife, and tendered $ 9,000, but the defendant has refused to execute the same. There was a general \n\n[202 U.S. 71, 78]\n\u00a0\n demurrer to the bill, and this was sustained by the supreme court of the District and the court of appeals, and the bill was dismissed. The plaintiff appealed to this court.\n We assume that the bill sufficiently shows an acceptance of the defendant's offer within the time, although it does not allege it in terms. We assume also that the consideration is alleged sufficiently, subject to the question whether it is one upon which a contract lawfully may be based. But the court is of opinion that that question must be answered in the negative. Every part of the consideration goes equally to the whole promise, and therefore, if any part of it is contrary to public policy, the whole promise falls. Pickering v. Ilfracombe R. Co. L. R. 3 C. P. 235, 250; Harrington v. Victoria Graving Dock Co. L. R. 3 Q. B. Div. 549; Woodruff v. Hinman, 11 Vt. 592, 34 Am. Dec. 712; Clark v. Ricker, 14 N. H. 44; McMullen v. Hoffman, \n174 U.S. 639\n, 43 L. ed. 1117, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 839; Bishop v. Palmer, 146 Mass. 469, 474, 4 Am. St. Rep. 339, 16 N. E. 299. According to the bill, and, no doubt, according to the fact, a part of the consideration was services, as we have quoted, and therefore it is not true, as argued, that the plaintiff could have demanded a conveyance on tendering the $9,000 alone. But the services contemplated as a partial consideration of the promise to convey were services in procuring legislation upon a matter of public interest, in respect of which neither of the parties had any claim against the United States. An agreement upon such a consideration was held bad in Providence Tool Co. v. Norris, 2 Wall. 45, 17 L. ed. 868. Of course, we are not speaking of the prosecution of a lawful claim.\n It will be noticed further that the conveyance was in substance a contingent fee. The plaintiff was not bound to accept it, and naturally would not do so unless he could agree, as he did with the government, for a larger price. The real inducement offered to him was that he would receive all that he could persuade the government to pay above the sum named. It is true that if we take the inartificial statements of the bill literally, the part of the consideration which we are discussing was the services, not a promise to render them. The promise to \n\n[202 U.S. 71, 79]\n\u00a0\n convey did not become binding until the services were rendered, and, when rendered, according to the allegations of the bill, they were legitimate. We assume that they were legitimate, but the validity of the contract depends on the nature of the original offer, and, whatever their form, the tendency of such offers is the same. The objection to them rests in their tendency, not in what was done in the particular case. Therefore a court will not be governed by the technical argument that when the offer became binding, it was cut down to what was done, and was harmless. The court will not inquire what was done. If that should be improper, it probably would be hidden, and would not appear. In its inception, the offer, however intended, necessarily invited and tended to induce improper solicitations, and it intensified the inducement by the contingency of the reward. Marshall v. Baltimore & O. R. Co. 16 How. 314, 335, 336, 14, L. ed. 953, 962, 963.\n The general principle was laid down broadly in Providence Tool Co. v. Norris, 2 Wall. 45, 54, 17 L. ed. 868, 870, that an agreement for compensation to procure a contract from the government to furnish its supplies could not be enforced, irrespective of the question whether improper means were contemplated or used for procuring it. McMullen v. Hoffman, \n174 \nU.S. 639, 648\n, 43 S. L. ed. 1117, 1121, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 839. And it was said that there is no real difference in principle between agreements to procure favors from legislative bodies, and agreements to procure favors in the shape of contracts from the heads of departments. 2 Wall. 55, 17 L. ed. 870. In Marshall v. Baltimore & O. R. Co. 16 How. 314, 336, 14 L. ed. 953, 962, it was said that all contracts for a contingent compensation for obtaining legislation were void, citing, among other cases, Clippinger v. Hepbaugh, 5 Watts & S. 315, 40 Am. Dec. 519, and Wood v. McCann, 6 Dana, 366. See also Mills v. Mills, 40 N. Y. 543, 100 Am. Dec. 535. There are other objections which would have to be answered before the bill could be sustained, but that which we have stated goes to the root of the contract and is enough to dispose of the case under the decisions heretofore made.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","70":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHERRICK v. BOQUILLAS LAND & CATTLE CO.(1906)\nNo. 105\nArgued: Decided: January 2, 1906\n\n\n\n Mr. Ben Goodrich for appellants.\n Mr. Francis J. Henley for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is an action of ejectment, commenced in August, 1901, by the appellee, to recover a tract of land containing 17,355.86 \n\n[200 U.S. 96, 97]\n\u00a0\n acres, and damages for the alleged unlawful withholding of possession. It was alleged that the plaintiff was the owner and entitled to the possession of the described land, and that title had been in it or in its grantors and predecessors in interest ever since January 1, 1875; and the defendants thirty in number-were alleged to have unlawfully withheld possession of the premises in dispute from about November 28, 1900. Some of the defendants filed disclaimers or failed to answer. The appellants and others jointly answered, relying solely on rights alleged to result from an asserted adverse possession by each of them of a portion of the demanded premises for more than twenty years prior to the bringing of the action. The case was tried to the court without a jury. The court made findings of fact and stated its conclusions of law thereon. Thereupon judgment was entered in favor of the plaintiff. On appeal, the supreme court of the territory affirmed the judgment; and the opinions delivered on the original hearing and on a rehearing are reported in 71 Pac. 924 and 76 Pac. 612. The supreme court adopted the findings of fact made by the trial court. The findings thus adopted as to the title and right of possession of the plaintiff were as follows:\n'That on the 8th day of May, A. D. 1833, the Mexican government, by good and sufficient grant, conveyed to plaintiff's grantors and predecessors in interest the lands and premises herein described, being the lands and premises in controversy.\n\n'That on the 14th day of December, in the year of our Lord, one thousand and nine hundred, the government of the United States, by its letters patent, recognized and confirmed the validity of the said grant of lands in plaintiff's complaint, and hereinafter particularly described, to Ygnacio Elias Gonzales and Nepumoceno Felix, and to their heirs, successors in interest, and assigns forever; and found and decreed that W. R. Hearst and Phebe A. Hearst had acquired an undivided interest in such lands and premises of the said two grantees.\n\n'That on the 3d day of July, 1901, the said W. R. Hearst and Phebe A. Hearst, by deed in writing, conveyed all of their \n\n[200 U.S. 96, 98]\n\u00a0\n said interest in and to the said lands and premises to the plaintiff herein, and that plaintiff has not since disposed of its title so acquired, or any part thereof, to said lands and premises.'\n\n In addition, the trial court, among its conclusions of law, incorporated the following:\n'That plaintiff and its predecessors and grantors in interest have been, since the 1st day of January, 1875, and ever since have been, and still are, the owners and entitled to the possession of the lands and premises in plaintiff's complaint, and hereinafter particularly described, and each and every part and portion thereof.'\n\n The supreme court of the territory, in its opinion on the rehearing, held this latter statement to be not a mere conclusion of law, but the finding of an ultimate fact; and the court therefore adopted it as part of the findings of fact upon which it based the decree of affirmance. As to possession by the defendants, it was found as follows:\n'That each and every of said defendants in this cause were, on the 14th of December, 1900, and had been for more than ten years next preceding that date, occupying various portions of the said lands and premises, and each and every of the said defendants who have failed to appear and answer herein have, since the last named date, withheld possession of divers portions of said lands and premises from the plaintiff and its grantors and predecessors in interest, and still and now so withhold the same; that since the said December 14, 1900, the annual value of the rents, issues, and profits of that part of said lands and premises so withheld from plaintiff by the said defendants is as follows, to wit: . . .'\n\n This appeal was prosecuted.\n On appeal from the supreme court of a territory our jurisdiction, apart from exceptions duly taken to rulings on the admission or rejection of evidence, is limited to determining whether the findings of fact support the judgment. Harrison v. Perea, \n168 \nU.S. 311, 323\n, 42 S. L. ed. 478, 482, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 129, and cases cited. As on this record there is no question presented as to rulings of the court in re- \n\n[200 U.S. 96, 99]\n\u00a0\n spect to the admission or rejection of evidence, we can alone consider the sufficiency of the findings.\n The errors assigned are sixteen in number, and resolve themselves into three classes:\n\n 1. \nThose which assert that the supreme court of the territory refused to consider the findings made by the trial court, and this embraces the 1st, 2d, and 5th assignments. But these assignments disregard the opinion of the supreme court of the territory, delivered on the rehearing, and do not require further notice.\n\n 2. \nThose which question the sufficiency of the evidence to support the findings of fact. These are numbered 8 and 13, and likewise need not be further referred to, as they address themselves to a matter not open for our consideration.\n\n 3. \nAssignments which, in various modes of statement, attack the sufficiency of the findings made by the trial court, and adopted by the supreme court of the territory, which include all of the assignments not already disposed of.\n The contentions concerning the insufficiency of the findings to support the judgment are resolvable into two propositions, which we shall separately consider:\n First. That, irrespective of the adequacy or inadequacy of the possession asserted by the defendants below, the findings are insufficient to sustair the legal conclusion of title in the plaintiff. This proposition rests upon the premise that the matter included in the conclusions of law of the trial court, which the supreme court held to be a finding of fact, and which it adopted as such, was but a mere conclusion of law, and, therefore, cannot be considered in determining the sufficiency of the findings of fact to sustain the deduction of law made by the court below as to title in the plaintiff. And with this premise it is insisted that if the findings of fact proper are alone considered, they are insufficient to establish title in the plaintiff, because, although they show the Mexican grant, and its confirmation and a conveyance by William R. and Phebe A. Hearst to the plaintiff of an undivided interest in the land, the findings fail as against \n\n[200 U.S. 96, 100]\n\u00a0\n defendant to show any title whatever in William R. and Phebe Hearst, or in the plaintiff as their grantee, derived from the grantees of the Mexican government.\n Conceding, merely for the sake of argument, the correctness of the premise, we think the proposition based thereon is without merit, since the findings, without reference to the action of the court in adopting the particular finding referred to, sustain as against the defendants the conclusion as to title. Those findings are that the plaintiff held title to an interest in the land in controversy, acquired by reason of a conveyance made on the 3d day of July, 1901, by William R. and Phebe A. Hearst. They, moreover, established that the land thus conveyed was originally acquired by the predecessors and grantors of the plaintiff through a grant made by the Mexican government in 1833, and that 'on the 14th day of December, in the year 1900, the government of the United States, by its letters patent, recognized and confirmed' said Mexican grant to two named individuals, 'and to their heirs, successors in interest, and assigns forever; and found and decreed that W. R. Hearst and Phebe A. Hearst had acquired an undivided interest in such lands and premises of the said two grantors.'\n It is urged that the statement in the finding as to it having been decreed that there was an undivided interest in William R. and Phoebe A. Hearst was adopted from a decree to that effect rendered by the court of private land claims, established under the act of March 3, 1891. 26 Stat. at L. 854, chap. 539, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 765. From this it is deduced that the recital in the patent as to the title in W. R. and Phebe A. Hearst was res inter alios, and that, in the absence of an express and substantive finding of title in the parties named from the grantee of the Mexican government, the mere recital on the subject in the patent furnished no support whatever for the legal conclusion that there was title. This is based upon the terms of  8 and 13 of the act establishing the court of private land claims, wherein it was provided that the effect of the confirmation of a grant by that court should be \n\n[200 U.S. 96, 101]\n\u00a0\n only to quitclaim the title, and not to affect the interests of third parties. But, conceding that the patent, as asserted, is based on a decree of the court of private land claims, and that its recitals are controlled by the terms of the act creating that tribunal, the proposition is without merit. Knight v. United Land Asso. \n142 \nU.S. 161, 188\n, 189 S., 35 L. ed. 974, 984, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 258. In that case it was held that although a patent which had been issued in consequence of the report of a tribunal appointed by Congress merely quitclaimed the rights of the United States, and saved the rights of third parties, it nevertheless was conclusive as to the existence of a record title upon those claiming to hold under rights which originated subsequent to the cession, and, a fortiori, as to a person claiming title by mere possession. By the application of this doctrine it follows that the judgment confirming the land grant and the patent thereunder, which specifically decreed an interest in the confirmed grant to the parties named, was adequate to establish a record title as against persons asserting the character of rights upon which the defendants relied.\n Second. It is further insisted that, in view of the finding of the court below as to possession of the defendant for more than ten years prior to the commencement of the action, the findings are inadequate to sustain the legal conclusion of the right of the plaintiff to recover, because of the force and effect of the period of limitation prescribed in paragraph 2938 of the Revised Statutes of Arizona for 1901. That paragraph is as follows:\n'Any person who has a right of action for recovery of any lands, tenements, or hereditaments against another having peaceable and adverse possession thereof, cultivating, using, and enjoying the same, shall institute his suit therefor within ten years next after his cause of action shall have accrued, and not afterward.'\n\n The court below held, and its ruling on this subject is not questioned, that prior to the adoption of this revision of the Arizona statutes there was no statute of limitations in that territory barring a right of action for the recovery of lands by \n\n[200 U.S. 96, 102]\n\u00a0\n one claiming title against another holding merely by peaceable and adverse possession. The revision went into effect on September 1, 1901, and the present action was brought a few days prior to such date, viz., on August 26, 1901\n\n\n In approaching the question whether paragraph 2938 was applicable to the case, the court below assumed that the effect of the finding as to possession by defendants was to show peaceable and adverse possession by them for the period of ten years. The court, however, decided that under no canon of construction or rule giving a retroactive effect to a new statute of limitation could paragraph 2938 be made to apply to this case. Thus, suggesting the possible construction which might be claimed for the paragraph, it was said that if construed as absolutely barring causes of action existing at the time of its passage it was unconstitutional,-citing Sohn v. Waterson, 17 Wall, 596, 21 L. ed. 737. Further, that even if the statute were construed as providing that all actions existing at the time of the passage of the statute should be barred if not sued upon within the time which elapsed between the date of such passage and the date fixed for the going into effect thereof, this action was brought within such period, and the statute could not operate as a bar,-citing Wrightman v. Boone County, 82 Fed. 413, and various state decisions therein referred to. And, lastly, it was decided that if the paragraph was construed as not applying to a suit which, though commenced after the passage of the act, was pending at the time the same took effect, the statute had no application,- citing State, Vreeland, Prosecutor, v. Bergen 34 N. J. L. 438.\n We think the supreme court of the territory was clearly right in the views which it thus expressed, and therefore it committed no error in determining that under no possible hypothesis could the limitation prescribed in paragraph 2938 of the Revised Statutes of Arizona operate to bar the plaintiff's action, in view of the findings of fact in respect to the title of plaintiff.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","71":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHEYMANN v. SOUTHERN RY. CO.(1906)\nNo. 32\nArgued: Decided: December 3, 1906\n\n\n\n Messrs. \n\n[203 U.S. 270, 271]\n\u00a0\n Milton Strasburger and Samuel H. Myers for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Joseph B. Cumming for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n In March, 1902, P. B. Wise and H. D. Harkins, residents of Charleston, South Carolina, each ordered a cask of whisky from Paul Heymann, a wholesale liquor dealer in Augusta, Georgia. The price of the whisky accompanied the orders, which were given upon the understanding that if, for any cause, delivery was not made to the consignees, the purchase price would be refunded.\n The two casks of whisky, consigned to the respective purchasers at Charleston, were delivered to the Southern Railway Company at Augusta. In due course the packages of liquor reached Charleston, and were by the railroad company at once unloaded into its warehouse, ready for delivery. The record does not show that the consignees were notified of the arrival of the goods. Shortly after the goods were so placed in the warehouse of the railroad company they were seized and taken from its possession. The seizures were made without any warrant or other process, by constables asserting their right to do so under the authority of what is known as the dispensary law of South Carolina, which law was considered in Vance v. W. A. Vandercook Co. \n170 U.S. 438\n, 42 L. ed. 1100, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 674. The agent of the railroad company did not resist the seizure.\n Thereafter, Heymann, the consignor, sued the railroad company for failing to make the deliveries as contracted in the bills of lading, and in the superior court of Richmond county, on appeal from a justice's court, obtained a verdict and judgment. The cause was appealed to the supreme court of Georgia, and by that court the judgment was reversed and the case remanded. 118 Ga. 616, 45 S. E. 491. On the second trial the defendant had a verdict and judgment; and on appeal the \n\n[203 U.S. 270, 272]\n\u00a0\n judgment was affirmed by the supreme court of Georgia upon the authority of its previous opinion. The case was then brought here.\n The act of Congress of August 8, 1890 [26 Stat. at L. 313, chap. 728, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3177], commonly known as the Wilson act, provides that all intoxicating liquors 'transported into any state or territory, or remaining therein for use, consumption, sale, or storage therein, shall, upon arrival in such state or territory, be subject to the operation and effect of the laws of such state or territory, enacted in the exercise of its police powers, to the same extent and in the same manner as though such liquids or liquors had been produced in such state or territory, and shall not be exempt therefrom by reason of being introduced therein in original packages or otherwise.'\n The supreme court of Georgia held-although the goods had not been delivered to the consignees, and although there was no showing of notice to them from the carrier, or even if notice by the local law was unnecessary, of the lapse of a reasonable time for the consignees to call for and accept delivery-that the interstate transportation of the goods ended when they were placed in the warehouse, and the carrier was thenceforward liable only as a warehouseman, and that the goods ceased to be under the shelter of the interstate commerce clause of the Constitution. This was based upon the conclusion that goods warehoused under the circumstances stated must be considered as having arrived, within the meaning of the wilson act, and therefore the packages of liquor in question were lawfully seized because subject to the police authority of the state of South Carolina. The meaning thus affixed to the word 'arrival,' as employed in the Wilson act, was adopted after consideration of the opinion in Rhodes v. Iowa, \n170 U.S. 412\n, 42 L. ed. 1088, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 664. While it was conceeded by the learned court that language contained in the opinion in that case indicated that this court deemed delivery essential to constitute 'arrival' within the Wilson act, yet, the expressions in the opinion to that effect were not binding, as they were merely obiter, since the \n\n[203 U.S. 270, 273]\n\u00a0\n Rhodes Case was only concerned with whether goods had come under the state authority on reaching their place of destination and before they had been warehoused by the carrier.\n We cannot concur in the view taken by the learned court of the decision in the Rhodes Case. In that case a railroad employee at a town in Iowa was indicted under the law of that state because, after an interstate shipment of liquors had reached the depot of the final carrier, at the point of destination, he moved the package from the platform, where it had been placed on being unloaded, to a freight warehouse belonging to the railroad company, a few feet away. It was insisted on behalf of the state of Iowa that the effect of the Wilson act was to confer upon that state the power to subject to state regulations merchandise shipped from another state the moment it reached the boundary line of the state of Iowa. On the other hand, it was contended that an interstate shipment of liquor did not arrive within that state within the meaning of the Wilson act until the consummation of the shipment by delivery at its destination to the consignee. The case, therefore, necessarily involved deciding the meaning of the word 'arrival' in the Wilson act, and this required an ascertainment of when goods shipped from one state to another, generally speaking, ceased to be controlled by the interstate commerce clause of the Constitution, and how far the general rule resulting from the power of Congress to regulate commerce had been limited, if at all, by the provisions of the Wilson act. Considering the first question, the elementary and long-settled doctrine was reiterated that delivery and sale in the original package was necessary to terminate interstate commerce, so far as the police regulations of the states were concerned. In passing upon the second question the court, referring to a previous case involving the Wilson law (Re Rahrer [Wilkerson v. Rahrer] \n140 U.S. 545\n, 35 L. ed. 572, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 865), pointed out that the contention which was made in that case, that the Wilson act was repugnant to the Constitution of the United States because it was an abdication by Congress of its power to regulate commerce, \n\n[203 U.S. 270, 274]\n\u00a0\n was held to be untenable, because the Wilson act was simply legislation by Congress creating a uniform rule applicable to all the states, by which liquor, when the subject of interstate commerce, could come under the power of a state at an earlier date than it otherwise would have done. Contemplating the grounds of the previous ruling upholding the constitutionality of the Wilson act, and coming to precisely determine the meaning of the word 'arrival' as used in that act, it was said in the Rhodes Case (p. 426, L. ed. p. 1096, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 669):\n'Interpreting the statute by the light of all its provisions, it was not intended to and did not cause the power of the state to attach to an interstate commerce shipment whilst the merchandise was in transit under such shipment, and until its arrival at the point of destination, and delivery there to the consignee.'\n\n And as a result of this ascertainment of the meaning of the Wilson act it was held that, as the act of moving the goods preceded the period affixed by the Wilson act at which the state power could attach, the conviction was erroneous.\n The Rhodes Case involved, of necessity, a construction of the import of the Wilson act, and the mere fact that the particular conduct which happened in that case to be the subject of complaint occurred prior to the delivery did not operate to cause the affirmative construction which was given to the Wilson act, and which it was necessary to give, to be obiter, and therefore subject to be disregarded. And a case decided by this court on the same day as the Rhodes Case leaves no room for controversy concerning the affirmative construction given to the Wilson act in the Rhodes Case. The case referred to is Vance v. W. A. Vandercook Co. \n170 U.S. 438\n, 42 L. ed. 1100, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 674. The court said (p. 451, L. ed. p. 1105, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 679):\n'The interstate commerce clause of the Constitution guarantees the right to ship merchandise from one state into another, and protects it until the termination of the shipment by delivery at the place of consignment, and this right is wholly unaffected by the act of Congress which allows state \n\n[203 U.S. 270, 275]\n\u00a0\n authority to attach to the original package before sale, but only after delivery. Scott v. Donald, \n165 \nU.S. 58, 107\n, 41 S. L. ed. 632, 648, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 265, 262, and Rhodes v. Iowa, supra. It follows that under the Constitution of the United States every resident of South Carolina is free to receive for his own use liquor from other states, and that the inhibitions of a state statute do not operate to prevent liquors from other states from being shipped into such state, on the order of a resident, for his use.'\n\n And in subsequent cases the construction adopted in the previous cases of the word 'arrival' as employed in the Wilson act has been reaffirmed and applied. Thus, in American Exp. Co. v. Iowa, \n196 U.S. 133\n, 49 L. ed. 417, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 182, in reviewing the Rhodes Case, the meaning of the Wilson act was again reiterated, the court saying (p. 142, L. ed. p. 421, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 184):\n'The contention was that, as by the Wilson act the power of the state operated upon the property the moment it passed the state boundary line, therefore the state of Iowa had the right to forbid the transportation of the merchandise within the state, and to punish those carrying it therein. This was not sustained. The court declined to express an opinion as to the authority of Congress, under its power to regulate commerce, to delegate to the states the right to forbid the transportation of merchandise from one state to another. It was, however, decided that the Wilson act manifested no attempt on the part of Congress to exert such power, but was only a regulation of commerce, since it merely provided, in the case of intoxicating liquors, that such merchandise, when transported from one state to another, should lose its character as interstate commerce upon completion of delivery under the contract of interstate shipment, and before sale in the original packages.'\n\n Again, in Foppiano v. Speed, \n199 U.S. 501\n, 50 L. ed. 288, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 138, referring to the Wilson act and its previous construction, it was declared (p. 517, L. ed. p. 291, Sup. Ct. Rep. 140).\n'This act was held to be constitutional in the case of Re Rahrer, supra, and that by virtue of said act state \n\n[203 U.S. 270, 276]\n\u00a0\n statutes might operate upon the original packages of intoxicating liquors before sale in the state. Rhodes v. Iowa and Vance v. W. A. Vandercook Co. supra, held that the state statute must permit the delivery of the liquors to the party to whom they were consigned within the state, but that, after such delivery, the state had power to prevent the sale of the liquors, even in the original package.'\n\n As the general principle is that goods moving in interstate commerce cease to be such commerce only after delivery and sale in the original package, and as the settled rule is that the Wilson law was not an abdication of the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce, since that law simply affects an incident of such commerce by allowing the state power to attach after delivery, and before sale, we are not concerned with whether, under the law of any particular state, the liability of a railroad company as carrier ceases and becomes that of a warehouseman on the goods reaching their ultimate destination, before notice and before the expiration of a reasonable time for the consignee to receive the goods from the carrier. For, whatever may be the divergent legal rules in the several states concerning the precise time when the liability of a carrier, as such, in respect to the carriage of goods, ends, they cannot affect the general principle as to when an interstate shipment ceases to be under the protection of the commerce clause of the Constitution, and thereby comes under the control of the state authority.\n Of course, we are not called upon in this case, and do not decide, if goods of the character referred to in the Wilson act, moving in interstate commerce, arrive at the point of destination, and, after notice and full opportunity to receive them, are designedly left in the hands of the carrier for an unreasonable time, that such conduct on the part of the consignee might not justify, if affirmatively alleged and proven, the holding that goods so dealt with have come under the operation of the Wilson act, because constructively delivered. We say we \n\n[203 U.S. 270, 277]\n\u00a0\n are not called upon to consider this question, for the reason that no facts are shown by the record justifying passing on such a proposition. And as in this case we deal only with the power of the state to enforce its police regulations against goods of the character of those enumerated in the Wilson act, the subject of interstate commerce, before delivery, we must not be understood as in any way limiting or restricting the ruling made in Vance v. W. A. Vandercook Co., supra, upholding the right of a citizen of one state to bring from another state into the state of his residence, and keep therein, for his personal use, the merchandise referred to in the Wilson act. In other words, as in the case at bar, delivery had not taken place when the seizures were made, and the control of the state over the goods had not attached, we are not called upon to consider whether, if the power of the state had attached by delivery, the state might not have levied upon the goods on the charge that they had not been bona fide brought into the state, and were not held by the consignees for their personal use, and, therefore, were not within the ruling in Vance v. W. A. Vandercook Co., supra.\n The conclusion that the court below erred in declining to follow the prior rulings of this court construing the Wilson act disposes of the entire controversy arising on the record before us, for the following reasons: In its answer filed in the trial court the railroad company substantially defended alone upon the ground that the seizure was rightful. And the supreme court of Georgia treated the liability of the defendant as depending solely upon the validity of the seizure. The court said:\n'If [the goods] . . . were still in the course of interstate transportation, the seizure by the constable was not even prima facie legal, for the very law under which the seizure was made had, prior to such seizure, been declared by the Supreme Court of the United States to be unconstitutional in so far as it interfered with interstate commerce. Scott v. Donald, \n165 U.S. 58\n, 41 L. ed. 632, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 265. It therefore follows that if the shipment had not \n\n[203 U.S. 270, 278]\n\u00a0\n been completed at the time the goods were seized, the railroad company would have no right to defend on the ground that it submitted to the superior authority, granting that such a defense, if established, would relieve it from liability.'

BANK & LOAN SOC. v. SAN FRANCISCO(1906)\nNo. 154\nArgued: Decided: January 29, 1906\n\n\n\n\n This was an action by the plaintiff in error, begun in the state superior court, to recover certain taxes paid under protest upon two checks or orders for $120,000 and $1,875, respectively, signed by the Treasurer of the United States, and addressed to the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer of the United States, for interest accrued upon certain registered bonds of the United States, owned by the plaintiff. These checks were issued in compliance with Rev. Stat.  3698, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2479, which requires that 'the Secretary of the Treasury shall cause to be paid, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, any interest falling due or accruing on any portion of the public debt authorized by law.' These checks, \n\n[200 U.S. 310, 311]\n\u00a0\n which were payable at the United States Treasury at San Francisco at any time within four months from their dete, were not presented immediately for payment, but were withheld by the plaintiff until the first Monday in March, 1899, the day when the status of property, for the purpose of taxation, is determined. Plaintiff did not list these two checks for assessment; but the assessor, in making up his roll for the ensuing year, included them, and, after a fruitless effort to be relieved from the assessment, plaintiff paid the amount of the tax, and brought this suit to recover it back. There were claims for other taxes included in the action, upon which plaintiff was successful; but, in respect to the tax upon the two orders above mentioned, judgment went for the defendant, which was affirmed by the supreme court. 139 Cal. 205, 96 Am.

Brobeck for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Brown: \n\n[200 U.S. 310, 313]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Brown delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case involves the question whether the two checks or orders upon which the tax was imposed are exempt from state taxation under Rev. Stat.  3701, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2480, declaring that 'all stocks, bonds, Treasury notes, and other obligations of the United States, shall be exempt from taxation by or under state or municipal or local authority.' The basis of this exemption is the fact that a tax upon the obligations of the United States is virtually a tax upon the credit of the government, and upon its power to raise money for the purpose of carrying on its civil and military operations. The efficiency of the government service cannot be impaired by a taxation of the agencies which it employs for such service, and, as one of the most valuable and best known of these agencise is the borrowing of money, a tax which diminishes in the slightest degree the value of the obligations issued by the government for that purpose impairs pro tanto their market value.\n The inability of the states to tax the official agencies of the Federal government, whether in the form of banks chartered under its authority, or of obligations issued by it as a means of providing a revenue, or for the payment of its debts, was applied in M'Culloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 4 L. ed. 579, to a stamp tax upon notes of the United States bank; in Weston v. Charleston, 2 Pet. 449, 7 L. ed. 481, and in New York ex rel. Bank of Commerce v. Tax Comrs. 2 Black, 620, 17 L. ed. 451, to stock issued for loans made to the government of the United States; and in the Bank Tax Case (New York ex rel. Bank of Commonwealth v. Tax & A. Comrs.) 2 Wall. 200, 17 L. ed. 793, to a tax laid on banks on a valuation equal to the amount of their capital stock, when their property consisted of stocks of the Federal government; in The Banks v. New York (New York ex rel. Bank of N. Y. Nat. Bkg. Asso. v. Connelly) 7 Wall. 16, 19 L. ed. 57, to certificates of indebtedness of the United States, issued to \n\n[200 U.S. 310, 314]\n\u00a0\n the creditors of the government for supplies furnished in carrying on the Civil War; in Bank of New York v. New York County (New York ex rel. Bank of New York v. New York County) 7 Wall. 26, 19 L. ed. 60, to notes of the United States intended to circulate as money; and in Van Brocklin v. Tennessee (Van Brocklin v. Anderson) \n117 U.S. 151\n, 29 L. ed. 845, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 670, to land purchased by the United States, for the amount of a direct tax laid thereon.\n The principle, however, upon which this exemption is claimed, does not apply to obligations such as checks and warrants, intended for immediate use, and designed merely to stand in the place of money until presented at the Treasury, and the money actually drawn thereon. In such case the tax is virtually a tax upon the money which may be drawn immediately upon presentation of the checks. As was said by Mr. Justice Miller in First Nat. Bank v. Kentucky, 9 Wall. 353, 362, 19 L. ed. 701, 703: 'That limitation [upon the power to tax] is, that the agencies of the Federal government are only exempted from state legislation, so far as that legislation may interfere with, or impair, their efficiency in performing the functions by which they are designed to serve that government.'\n In Union P. R. Co. v. Peniston, 18 Wall. 5, 21 L. ed. 787, it was insisted by the plaintiff in error that the property of the Union Pacific Railroad Company was exempt from state taxation by virtue of the incorporation of the company by the United States, as a means for the performance of certain public duties of the government, enjoined and authorized by the Constitution. It was said, however, by Mr. Justice Strong, in delivering the opinion of the court, that no constitutional implications prohibited a state tax upon the property of an agent of the government merely because it is the property of such agent, but 'that the agencies of the Federal government are uncontrollable by state legislation, so far as it may interfere with, or impair, their efficiency in performing the functions by which they are designed to serve that government. It is, therefore, manifest that exemption of Federal agencies from state taxation is dependent, not upon the nature of the agents, or upon the mode of their constitution, or upon \n\n[200 U.S. 310, 315]\n\u00a0\n the fact that they are agents, but upon the effect of the tax; that is, upon the question whether the tax does, in truth, deprive them of power to serve the government as they were intended to serve it, or does hinder the efficient exercise of their power. A tax upon their property has no such necessary effect. It leaves them free to discharge the duties they have undertaken to perform. A tax upon their operations is a direct obstruction to the exercise of Federal powers.'\n Had the government, in the absence of money for the immediate payment of interest upon its bonds, issued new obligations for the payment of this interest at a future day, it might well be claimed that these were not taxable, as the taxation of such notes would, to the extent of the tax, impair their value and negotiability in the hands of the holder. This was practically the case in The Banks v. New York (New York ex rel. Bank of N. Y. Nat. Bkg. Asso. v. Connelly) 7 Wall. 16, 19 L. ed. 57, where certificates were issued at a time when the government had no money to pay its obligations, and made use of its credit to obtain further time. But where checks are issued payable immediately, they merely stand in the place of coin, which may be immediately drawn thereon. As observed by the court below, the checks were, for all practical purposes, the money itself. People v. Stockton & V. R. Co. 45 Cal. 306, 313; Metropolitan Nat. Bank v. Sirret, 97 N. Y. 320, 325; Re Staten Island Rapid Transit R. Co. 38 Hun, 382, 101 N. Y. 636. A check may be given in evidence under the money counts. Wells v. Brigham, 6 Cush. 6, 52 Am. Dec. 750; Cruger v. Armstrong, 3 Johns. Cas. 5, 2 Am. Dec. 126.\n While Congress has not amended Rev. Stat.  3701, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2480, upon which plaintiff relies in this case, it did, by act approved August 13, 1894 (28 Stat. at L. 278, chap. 281, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2398), declare 'that circulating notes of national banking associations and United States legal tender notes, and other notes and certificates of the United States, payable on demand, and circulating, or intended to circulate, as currency, . . . shall be subject to [state] taxation as money on hand or on deposit.'\n Although the checks in question were not intended to circu- \n\n[200 U.S. 310, 316]\n\u00a0\n late as money, and therefore do not fall within the letter of the statute, the reasons that apply to that class of obligations we think apply with equal force to checks intended for immdiate payment, though not intended to circulate as money. While the checks are obligations of the United States, and within the letter of  3701, they are not within its spirit, and are proper subjects of taxation.\n Had the plaintiff drawn the money immediately upon these checks, it would have become at once a part of the general property of the bank; and the fact that the money had been derived from the United States, and paid to the bank as interest on its obligations, would not have prevented its becoming part of the general property of the bank, and subject to state taxation.

Willcox for defendant in error.\n\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case was decided on demurrer in the court below. It was held that no cause of action was stated by the plaintiffs, and judgment was rendered accordingly. Plaintiffs brought action as partners against the American Surety Company upon a bond given in pursuance of the act of August 13, 1894. 28 Stat. at L. 278, chap. 280, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2523. The allegations of the petition, so far important as to be noticed here, are: The defendant is a corporation duly authorized to do a general insurance and bonding business. On February 14, 1891, the New Jersey Foundry & Machine Company \n\n[200 U.S. 197, 200]\n\u00a0\n entered into a written contract with the United States, for the construction of four observation towers, for the agreed compensation of $2, 575. That, among other things, it was stipulated in the contract 'that the said New Jersey Foundry & Machine Company shall be responsible for and pay all liabilities incurred in the prosecution of the work for labor and material,' the work to be completed within seven months from date of contract. The United States required of the said New Jersey Foundry & Machine Company a bond, which was executed by the company and the American Surety Company as surety, on the 14th day of February, 1901, in the penal sum of $4,000, to be paid unto the United States of America, which bond contained the condition: 'Now, therefore, if the above bounden New Jersey Foundry & Machine Company shall and will in all respects duly and fully observe and perform all and singular the covenants, conditions, and agreements in and by said contract agreed and convenanted by said New Jersey Foundry & Machine Company to be observed and performed, according to the true intent and meaning of said contract, and as well during any period of extension of said contract that may be granted on the part of the United States, as during the original terms of the same, and shall promptly make full payments to all persons supplying it labor or materials in the prosecution of the work provided for in said contract, then the above obligation shall be void and of no effect; otherwise, to remain in full force and virtue.' That afterwards the said New Jersey Foundry & Machine Company entered into a contract with the Richard Manufacturing Company for certain portions of the work, and said Richard Manufacturing Company entered upon the performance of the contract, and in the performance thereof between the 3d day of April and the 17th day of May, of the same year, Daniel H. Hill, and Howard H. Hill, the plaintiffs, the special instance and request of the said Richard Manufacturing Company, scraped and painted the four observation towers, to be constructed under the contract with the said New Jersey Foundry & Machine Company, for which said \n\n[200 U.S. 197, 201]\n\u00a0\n Richard Manufacturing Company agreed to pay the said plaintiffs the sum of $ 246.80, of which there is unpaid the sum of $141.80. That on the 11th day of August, 1903, plaintiffs made the affidavit required by the statute, and procured from the Secretary of War of the United States certified copies of the original contract and bonds; that the said New Jersey Foundry & Machine Company, the Richard Manufacturing Company, and the United States accepted the said scraping and painting so done and performed by the plaintiffs in the necessary prosecution of the work required by the original contract.\n The statute under consideration is entitled 'An Act for the Protection of Persons Furnishing Materials and Labor for the Construction of Public Works.' It provides, in substance, that persons entering into formal contracts with the United States for the construction or repair of public buildings and works shall be required, before performing such work, to execute the usual penal bond with good and sufficient surety, with the additional obligation 'that such contractor or contractors shall promptly make payments to all persons supplying him or them labor and materials in the prosecution of the work provided for in such contract.' The statute further provides for the furnishing of a copy of the contract and bond to persons furnishing an affidavit that labor and materials for the prosecution of such work have been supplied by him or them, and giving a right of action in the name of the United States for the benefit and use of said person or persons against the contractor and his sureties.\n We may remark, before considering the construction to be given this act, that it has been materially amended by the act of February 24, 1905. 33 Stat. at L. 811, chap. 778.1 The amended act makes provision for preference in payment in favor of the United States, limits the time in which actions may be brought, provides for bringing all the creditors into one action, and for the prosecution of the same in the name of the United States in the circuit courts of the United States in the district in which the contract was to be performed, and not elsewhere. In respect to the persons entitled to the benefit of the bond, there has been \n\n[200 U.S. 197, 202]\n\u00a0\n no material change in the act. While not governing the present action, the amended statute has some bearing in construing the act in question, as it shows the consistent purpose of Congress to protect those who furnish labor or material in the prosecution of public work.\n In considering the statute and determining the scope of the bond, divergent views have been urged upon the court. Upon the one hand it is insisted that the bond is to be strictly construed, and a recovery limited to those who have furnished material or labor directly to the contractor, and, upon the other, that a more liberal construction be given, and a recovery permitted to those who have furnished labor and materials which have been used in the prosecution of the work, whether furnished under the contract directly to the contractor, or to a subcontractor.\n This statute was before this court in United States Fidelity & G. Co. v. Golden Pressed & Fire Brick Co. \n191 U.S. 416\n, 48 L. ed. 242, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 142, and while the question whether surety companies which are such for compensation are entitled to the same strict construction of their rights and obligations as is accorded to private sureties, who become such withour reward or profit, was left open, it was nevertheless said: 'The rule of strictissimi juris is a stringent one, and is liable at times to work a practical injustice. It is one which ought not to be extended to contracts not within the reason of the rule, particularly when the bond is underwritten by a corporation which has undertaken for a profit to insure the obligee against a failure of performance on the part of the principal obligor. Such a contract should be interpreted liberally in favor of the subcontractor, with a view of furthering the beneficent object of the statute. Of course, this rule would not extend to cases of fraud or unfair dealing on the part of a subcontractor, as was the case in United States use of Heise v. American Bonding & T. Co. 89 Fed. 921; 89 Fed. 925, 32 C. C. A. 420, or to cases not otherwise within the scope of the undertaking.'\n The courts of this country have generally given to statutes intending to secure to those furnishing labor and supplies for \n\n[200 U.S. 197, 203]\n\u00a0\n the construction of buildings a liberal interpretation, with a view of effecting their purpose to require payment to those who have contributed by their labor or material to the erection of buildings to be owned and enjoyed by those who profit by the contribution of such labor or materials. Flagstaff Silver Min. Co. v. Cullins, \n104 \nU.S. 176, 177\n, 26 S. L. ed. 704, 705. And the rule which permits a surety to stand upon his strict legal rights, when applicable, does not prevent a construction of the bond with a view to determining to fair scope and meaning of the contract in the light of the language used and the circumstances surrounding the parties Ulster County Sav. Inst. v. Young, 161 N. Y. 23, 30, 55 N. E. 483.\n As against the United States, no lien can be provided upon its public buildings or grounds, and it was the purpose of this act to substitute the obligation of a bond for the security which might otherwise be obtained by attaching a lien to the property of an individual. The purpose of the law is, an its title declares: 'For the protection of persons furnishing materials and labor for the construction of public works.' If literally construed, the obligation of the bond might be limited to secure only persons supplying labor or materials directly to the contractor, for which he would be personally liable. But we must not overlook, in construing this obligation, the manifest purpose of the statute to require that material and labor actually contributed to the construction of the public building shall be paid for, and to provide a security to that end.\n Statutes are not to be so literally construed as to defeat the purpose of the legislature. 'A thing which is within the intention of the makers of the statute is as much within the statute as if it were within the letter.' United States v. Freeman, 3 How. 556, 11 L. ed. 724. 'The spirit as well as the letter of a statute must be respected, and where the whole context of the law demonstrates a particular intent in the legislature to effect a certain object, some degree of implication may be called in to aid that intent.' Chief Justice Marshall, in Durousseau v. United States, 6 Cranch, 308, 3 L. ed. 232.\n Looking to the terms of this statute in its original form, and \n\n[200 U.S. 197, 204]\n\u00a0\n as amended in 1905, we find the same congressional purpose to require payment for material and labor which have been furnished for the construction of public works. The affidavit to be filed with the head of the department under the direction of which the work has been prosecuted requires the affiant to state that labor or materials for the prosecution of such work has been supplied by him, for which payment has not been made, and such persons are given the right of action on the bond in the name of the United States. Language could hardly be plainer to evidence the intention of Congress to protect those whose labor or material has contributed to the prosecution of the work. There is no language in the statute nor in the bond which is therein authorized limiting the right of recovery to those who furnish material or labor directly to the contractor but all persons supplying the contractor with labor or materials in the prosecution of the work provided for in the contract are to be protected. The source of the labor or material is not indicated or circumscribed It is only required to be 'supplied' to the contractor in the prosecution of the work provided for. How supplied is not stated, and could only be known as the work advanced and the labor and material are furnished.\n If a construction is given to the bond so limiting the obligation incurred as to permit only those to recover who have contracted directly with the principal, it may happen that the material and labor which have contributed to the structure will not be paid for, owing to the default of subcontractors, and the manifest purpose of the statute to require compensation to those who have supplied such labor or material will be defeated.\n We cannot conceive that this construction works any hardship to the surety. The contractor gets the benefit of such work or material. It is distinctly averred in this case that the original contractor received the benefit of the work done, and it was used in part performance of his contract. It is easy for the contractor to see to it that he and his surety are secured against loss by requiring those with whom he deals to give security by bond, or otherwise, for the payment of such persons as furnish \n\n[200 U.S. 197, 205]\n\u00a0\n work or labor to go into the structure. In view of the declared purpose of the statute, in the light of which this bond must be read, and considering that the act declares in terms the purpose to protect those who have furnished labor or material in the prosecution of the work, we think it would be giving too narrow a construction to its terms to limit its benefits to those only who supply such labor or materials directly to the contractor. The obligation is 'to make full payments to all persons supplying it with labor or materials in the prosecution of the work provided for in said contract.' This language, read in the light of the statute, looks to the protection of those who supply the labor or materials provided for in the contract, and not to the particular contract or engagement under which the labor or materials were supplied. If the contractor sees fit to let the work to a subcontractor, who employs labor and buys materials which are used to carry out and fulfil the engagement of the original contract to construct a public building, he is thereby supplied with the materials and lobor for the fulfilment of his engagement as effectually as he would have been had he directly hired the labor or bought the materials.\n We reach the conclusion that the labor and materials furnished in this case were within the obligation of the surety company on the bond, and in that view the judgment of the Superior Court is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] U.

Unless, therefore, the 13th Amendment vests in the nation the jurisdiction claimed, the remedy must be sought through \n\n[203 U.S. 1, 15]\n\u00a0\n state action and in state tribunals, subject to the supervision of this court by writ of error in proper cases.\n In the Slaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 76, 21 L. ed. 394, 408, in defining the privileges and immunities of citizens of the several states, this is quoted from the opinion of Mr. Justice Washington in Corfield v. Coryell, 4 Wash. C. C. 371, Fed. Cas. No. 3230:\n\"The inquiry,' he says, 'is, What are the privileges and immunities of citizens of the several states? We feel no hesitation in confining these expressions to those privileges and immunities which are fundamental; which belong of right to the citizens of all free governments, and which have at all times been enjoyed by citizens of the several states which compose this Union, from the time of their becoming free, independent, and sovereign. What these fundamental principles are, it would be more tedious than difficult to enumerate. They may all, however, be comprehended under the following general heads: protection by the government, with the right to acquire and possess property of every kind, and to pursue and obtain happiness and safety, subject, nevertheless, to such restraints as the government may prescribe for the general good of the whole.\"\n\n And after referring to other cases this court added (p. 77, L. ed. p. 409):\n'It would be the vainest show of learning to attempt to prove by citations of authority, that up to the adoption of the recent amendments no claim or pretense was set up that those rights depended on the Federal government for their existence or protection, beyond the very few express limitations which the Federal Constitution imposed upon the states,-such, for instance, as the prohibition against ex post facto laws, bills of attainder, and laws impairing the obligation of contracts. But, with the exception of these and a few other restrictions, the entire domain of the privileges and immunities of citizens of the states, as above defined, lay within the constitutional and legislative power of the states, and without that of the Federal government.' \n\n[203 U.S. 1, 16]\n\u00a0\n Notwithstanding the adoption of these three amendments, the national government still remains one of enumerated powers, and the 10th Amendment, which reads, 'the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.' is not shorn of its vitality. True, the 13th Amendment grants certain specified and additional power to Congress, but any congressional legislation directed against individual action which was not warranted before the 13th Amendment must find authority in it. And in interpreting the scope of that Amendment it is well to bear in mind the words of Mr. Chief Justice Marshall, shall, in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 188, 6 L. ed. 23, 68, which, though spoken more than four score years ago, are still the rule of construction of constitutional provisions:\n\n'As men whose intentions require no concealment generally employ the words which most directly and aptly express the ideas they intend to convey, the enlightened patriots who framed our Constitution, and the people who adopted it, must be understood to have employed words in their natural sense, and to have intended what they have said.'\n\n The 13th Amendment reads:\n'Sec. 1. Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.\n\n'Sec. 2. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.'\n\n The meaning of this is as clear as language can make it. The things denounced are slavery and involuntary servitude, and Congress is given power to enforce that denunciation. All understand by these terms a condition of enforced compulsory service of one to another. While the inciting cause of the Amendment was the emancipation of the colored race, yet it is not an attempt to commit that race to the care of the nation. It is the denunciation of a condition, and not a decla- \n\n[203 U.S. 1, 17]\n\u00a0\n ration in favor of a particular people. It reaches every race and every individual, and if in any respect it commits one race to the nation, it commits every race and every individual thereof. Slavery or involuntary servitude of the Chinese, of the Italian, of the Anglo-Saxon, are as much within its compass as slavery or involuntary servitude of the African. Of this Amendment it was said by Mr. Justice Miller in Slaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall. 69, 21 L. ed. 406: 'Its two short sections seem hardly to admit of construction.' And again: 'To withdraw the mind from the contemplation of this grand yet simple declaration of the personal freedom of all the human race within the jurisdiction of this government . . . requires an effort, to say the least of it.'\n A reference to the definitions in the dictionaries of words whose meaning is so thoroughly understood by all seems an affectation, yet in Webster slavery is defined as 'the state of entire subjection of one person to the will of another,' and a slave is said to be 'a person who is held in bondage to another.' Even the secondary meaning given recognizes the fact of subjection, as 'one who has lost the power of resistance; one who surrenders himself to any power whatever; as a slave to passion, to lust, to strong drink, to ambition,' and servitude is by the same authority declared to be 'the state of voluntary or compulsory subjection to a master.'\n It is said, however, that one of the disabilities of slavery, one of the indicia of its existence, was a lack of power to make or perform contracts, and that when these defendants, by intimidation and force, compelled the colored men named in the indictment to desist from performing their contract, they, to that extent, reduced those parties to a condition of slavery,-that is, of subjection to the will of defendants, and deprived them of a freeman's power to perform his contract. But every wrong done to an individual by another, acting singly or in concert with others, operates pro tanto to abridge some of the freedom to which the individual is entitled. A freeman has a right to be protected in his person from an assault and battery. He is entitled to hold his property safe from tres- \n\n[203 U.S. 1, 18]\n\u00a0\n pass or appropriation; but no mere personal assault or trespass or appropriation operates to reduce the individual to a condition of slavery. Indeed, this is conceded by counsel for the government, for in their brief ( after referring to certain decisions of this court) it is said:\n'With these decisions, and many others that might be cited, before us, it is vain to contend that the Federal Constitution secures to a citizen of the United States the right to work at a given occupation or particular calling free from injury, oppression, or interference by individual citizens.\n\n'Even though such right be a natural or inalienable right, the duty of protecting the citizen in the enjoyment of such right, free from individual interference, rests alone with the state.\n\n'Unless, therefore, the additional element, to wit, the infliction of an injury upon one individual citizen by another, solely on account of his color, be sufficient ground to redress such injury, the individual citizen suffering such injury must be left for redress of his grievance to the state laws.'\n\n The logic of this concession points irresistibly to the contention that the 13th Amendment operates only to protect the African race. This is evident from the fact that nowhere in the record does it appear that the parties charged to have been wronged by the defendants had ever been themselves slaves, or were the descendants of slaves. They took no more from the Amendment than any other citizens of the United States. But if, as we have seen, that denounces a condition possible for all races and all individuals, then a like wrong perpetrated by white men upon a Chinese, or by black men upon a white man, or by any men upon any man on account of his race, would come within the jurisdiction of Congress, and that protection of individual rights which, prior to the 13th Amendment, was unquestionably within the jurisdiction solely of the states, would, by virtue of that Amendment, be transferred to the nation, and subject to the legislation of Congress. \n\n[203 U.S. 1, 19]\n\u00a0\n But that it was not the intent of the Amendment to denounce every act done to an individual which was wrong if done to a free man, and yet justified in a condition of slavery, and to give authority to Congress to enforce such denunciation, consider the legislation in respect to the Chinese. In slave times in the slave states not infrequently every free negro was required to carry with him a copy of a judicial decree or other evidence of his right to freedom or be subject to arrest. That was one of the incidents or badges of slavery. By the act of May 5, 1892 [27 Stat. at L. 25, chap. 60, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1319], Congress required all Chinese laborers within the limits of the United States to apply for a certificate, and any one who, after one year from the passage of the act, should be found within the jurisdiction of the United States without such certificate, might be arrested and deported. In Fong Yue Ting v. United States, \n149 U.S. 698\n, 37 L. ed. 905, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1016, the validity of the Chinese deportation act was presented, elaborately argued, and fully considered by this court. While there was a division of opinion, yet at no time during the progress of the litigation, and by no individual, counsel, or court connected with it, was it suggested that the requiring of such a certificate was evidence of a condition of slavery, or prohibited by the 13th Amendment.\n One thing more: at the close of the Civil War, when the problem of the emancipated slaves was before the nation, it might have left them in a condition of alienage, or established them as wards of the government, like the Indian tribes, and thus retained for the nation jurisdiction over them, or it might, as it did, give them citizenship. It chose the latter. By the 14th Amendment it made citizens of all born within the limits of the United States and subject to its jurisdiction. By the 15th it prohibited any state from denying the right of suffrage on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude, and by the 13th it forbade slavery or involuntary servitude anywhere within the limits of the land. Whether this was or was not the wiser way to deal with the great problem is not a matter for the courts to \n\n[203 U.S. 1, 20]\n\u00a0\n consider. It is for us to accept the decision, which declined to constitute them wards of the nation or leave them in a condition of alienage where they would be subject to the jurisdiction of Congress, but gave them citizenship, doubtless believing that thereby in the long run their best interests would be subserved, they taking their chances with other citizens in the states where they should make their homes.\n For these reasons we think that the United States court had no jurisdiction of the wrong charged in the indictment. The judgments are reversed, and the case remanded with instructions to sustain the demurrer to the indictment.\n Mr. Justice Brown concurs in the judgments.\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan (with whom concurs Mr. Justice Day), dissenting. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The plaintiffs in error were indicted with eleven others in the district court of the United States, eastern district of Arkansas, for the crime of having knowingly, wilfully, and unlawfully conspired to oppress, threaten, and intimidate Berry Winn, Dave Hinton, Percy Legg, Joe Mardis, Joe McGill, Dan Shelton, Jim Hall, and George Shelton, persons of African descent and citizens of the United States and of Arkansas, in the free exercise and enjoyment of the right and privilege-alleged to be secured to them respectively by the Constitution and laws of the United States-of disposing of their labor and services by contract and of performing the terms of such contract without discrimination against them because of their race or color, and without illegal interference or by violent means. 2 \n\n[203 U.S. 1, 21]\n\u00a0\n The indictment was based primarily upon  5508 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3712), which provides: ' 5508. If two or more persons conspire to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any citizen in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States, or because of his having so exercised the \n\n[203 U.S. 1, 22]\n\u00a0\n same; or if two or more persons go in disguise on the highway, or on the premises of another, with intent to prevent or hinder his free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege so secured, they shall be fined not more than five thousand dollars, and imprisoned not more than ten years, and shall, moreover, be thereafter ineligible to any office or place of honor, profit, or trust created by the Constitution or laws of the United States.'\n Other sections of the statutes relating to civil rights, and referred to in the discussion at the bar, although not, perhaps, vital to the decision of the present case, are as follows: ' 1977 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1259). All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every state and territory to make and enforce contracts, to sue, and be parties, give evidence, and to the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and property as is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be subject to like punishment, pains, penalties, taxes, licenses, and exactions of every kind, and to no other.  1978. All citizens of the United States shall have the same right, in every state and territory, as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof, to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property.  1979. Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage of any state or territory, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Consti-\n___ compelling said Berry Winn, Dave Hinton, Percy Legg, Joe Mardis, Joe McGill, Dan Shelton, Jim Hall, and George Shelton to quit said work and abandon said place and cease the free enjoyment of all advantages under said contracts, the same being so done by said defendants and each of them for the purpose of driving the said Berry Winn, Dave Hinton, Percy Legg, Joe Mardis, Joe McGill, Dan Shelton, Jim Hall, and George Shelton from said place of business and from their labor because they were colored men and citizens of African descent, contrary to the form of the statute in such case made and provided, and against the peace and dignity of the United States.' \n\n[203 U.S. 1, 23]\n\u00a0\n tution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.' ' 5510 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3713). Every person who, under color of any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, or custom, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any inhabitant of any state or territory to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities, secured or protected by the Constitution and laws of the United States, or to different punishments, pains, or penalties, on account of such inhabitant being an alien, or by reason of his color or race, than are prescribed for the punishment of citizens, shall be punished by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars, or by imprisonment not more than one year, or by both.'\n A demurrer to the indictment was overruled, and the defendants having pleaded not guilty, they were tried before a jury, and some of them-the present plaintiffs in error-were convicted of the crime charged, were each fined $100, and ordered to be imprisoned for one year and a day. A motion for new trial having been denied, they have brought the case to this court.\n In our consideration of the questions now raised it must be taken, upon this record, as conclusively established by the verdict and judgment,--\n That certain persons-the said Berry Winn and others above named with him-citizens of the United States, and of Arkansas, and of African descent, entered into a contract whereby they agreed to perform, for compensation, service and labor in and about the manufacturing business in that state of a private individual;\n That those persons, in execution of their contract, entered upon and were actually engaged in performing the work they agreed to do, when the defendants-the present plaintiffs in error-knowingly and wilfully conspired to injure, oppress, threaten, and intimidate such laborers, solely because of their having made that contract, and because of their race and color, in the free exercise of their right to dispose of their labor, and \n\n[203 U.S. 1, 24]\n\u00a0\n prevent them from carrying out their contract to render such service and labor;\n That, in the prosecution of such conspiracy, the defendants, by violent means, compelled those laborers, simply, 'because they were colored men and citizens of African descent,' to quit their work and abandon the place at which they were performing labor in execution of their contract; and\n That, in consequence of those acts of the defendant conspirators, the laborers referred to were hindered and prevented, solely because of their race and color, from enjoying the right by contract to dispose of their labor upon such terms and to such persons as to them seemed best.\n Was the right or privilege of these laborers thus to dispose of their labor secured to them 'by the Constitution or laws of the United States?' If so, then this case is within the very letter of  5508 of the Revised Statutes, and the judgment should be affirmed if that section be not unconstitutional.\n But I need not stop to discuss the constitutionality of  5508. It is no longer open to question, in this court, that Congress may, by appropriate legislation, protect any right or privilege arising from, created or secured by, or dependent upon, the Constitution or laws of the United States. That is what that section does. It purports to do nothing more. In Ex parte Yarbrough, \n110 U.S. 651\n, 28 L. ed. 274, 4 Sup. Ct. Rep. 152, it was distinctly adjudged that  5508 was a valid exercise of power by Congress. In Logan v. United States, \n144 \nU.S. 263, 286\n, 293 S., 36 L. ed. 429, 437, 439, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 617, 623, 626, this court stated that the validity of  5508 had been sustained in the Yarbrough Case, and, speaking by Mr. Justice Gray, said: 'In United States v. Reese, \n92 \nU.S. 214, 217\n, 23 S. L. ed. 563, 564, decided at October term, 1875, this court, speaking by Chief Justice Waite, said: 'Rights and immunities created by or dependent upon the Constitution of the United States can be protected by Congress. The form and the manner of the protection may be such as Congress, in the legitimate exercise of its legislative discretion, shall provide. These may be varied to meet the necessities of the particular right to be \n\n[203 U.S. 1, 25]\n\u00a0\n protected.\" After referring to prior adjudications the court in the Logan Case also unanimously declared: 'The whole scope and effect of this series of decisions is that, while certain fundamental rights, recognized and declared, but not granted or created, in some of the amendments to the Constitution, are thereby guaranteed only against violation or abridgment by the United States or by the states as the case may be, and cannot therefore be affirmatively enforced by Congress against unlawful acts of individuals, yet that every right created by, arising under, or dependent upon, the Constitution of the United States, may be protected and enforced by Congress, by such means and in such manner as Congress, in the exercise of the correlative duty of protection, or of the legislative powers conferred upon it by the Constitution, may, in its discretion, deem most eligible and best adapted to attain the object.'\n In Motes v. United States, \n178 U.S. 458\n, 44 L. ed. 1150, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 993, the language of the court was: 'We have seen that by  5508 of the Revised Statutes it is made an offense against the United States for two or more persons to conspire to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any citizen in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States,- the punishment prescribed being a fine of not more than $5,000, imprisonment not more than ten years, and ineligibility to any office or place of honor, profit, or trust created by the Constitution or laws of the United States. And by  5509 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3712), it is provided that if, in committing the above offense, any other felony or misdemeanor be committed, the offender shall suffer such punishment as is attached to such felony or misdemeanor by the laws of the state in which the offense is committed. No question has been made-indeed, none could successfully be made-as to the constitutionality of these statutory provisions. Ex parte Yarbrough, supra; United States v. Waddell, \n112 U.S. 76\n, 28 L. ed. 673, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 35. Referring to those provisions and to the clause of the Constitution giving Congress authority to pass all laws \n\n[203 U.S. 1, 26]\n\u00a0\n necessary and proper for carrying into execution the powers specifically granted to it, and all other powers vested in the government of the United States, . . . this court has said: 'In the exercise of this general power of legislation, Congress may use any means appearing to it most eligible and appropriate, which are adapted to the end to be accomplished, and are consistent with the letter and the spirit of the Constitution.' Logan v. United States, \n144 \nU.S. 263, 283\n, 36 S. L. ed. 429, 435, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 617, 622.'\n In view of these decisions it is unnecessary to examine the grounds upon which the constitutionality of  5508 rests; and I may assume that the power of the national government, by appropriate legislation, to protect a right created by, derived from, or dependent in any degree upon, the Constitution of the United States, cannot be disputed.\n I come now to the main question,-whether a conspiracy or combination to forcibly prevent citizens of African descent, solely because of their race and color, from disposing of their labor by contract upon such terms as they deem proper, and from carrying out such contract, infringes or violates a right or privilege created by, derived from, or dependent upon, the Constitution of the United States.\n Before the 13th Amendment was adopted the existence of freedom or slavery within any state depended wholly upon the Constitution and laws of such state. However abhorrent to many was the thought that human beings of African descent were held as slaves and chattels, no remedy for that state of things as it existed in some of the states could be given by the United States in virtue of any power it possessed prior to the adoption of the 13th Amendment. That condition, however, underwent a radical change when that Amendment became a part of the supreme law of the land, and, as such, binding upon all the states and all the people, as well as upon every branch of government, Federal and state. By the Amendment it was ordained that 'neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for \n\n[203 U.S. 1, 27]\n\u00a0\n crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States or any place subject to their jurisdiction;' and 'Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.' Although in words and form prohibitive, yet, in law, by its own force, that Amendment destroyed slavery and all its incidents and badges, and established freedom. It also conferred upon every person within the jurisdiction of the United States (except those legally imprisoned for crime) the right, without discrimination against them on account of their race, to enjoy all the privileges that inhere in freedom. It went further, however, and by its 2d section, invested Congress with power, by appropriate legislation, to enforce its provisions. To that end, by direct, primary legislation, Congress may not only prevent the re- establishing of the institution of slavery, pure and simple, but may make it impossible that any of its incidents or badges should exist or be enforced in any state or territory of the United States. It therefore became competent for Congress, under the 13th Amendment, to make the establishing of slavery, as well as all attempts, whether in the form of a conspiracy or otherwise, to subject anyone to the badges or incidents of slavery, offenses against the United States, punishable by fine or imprisonment or both. And legislation of that character would certainly be appropriate for the protection of whatever rights were given or created by the Amendment. So, legislation making it an offense against the United States to conspire to injure or intimidate a citizen in the free exercise of any right secured by the Constitution is broad enough to embrace a conspiracy of the kind charged in the present indictment. 'A right or immunity, whether created by the Constitution or only guaranteed by it, may be protected by Congress.' This court so adjudged in Strauder v. West Virginia, \n100 \nU.S. 303, 310\n, 25 S. L. ed. 664, 666, as it had previously adjudged in Prigg v. Pennsylvania, 16 Pet. 539, 10 L. ed. 1060, and in United States v. Reese, \n92 U.S. 214\n, 23 L. ed. 563. The colored laborers against whom the conspiracy in question was directed \n\n[203 U.S. 1, 28]\n\u00a0\n owe their freedom as well as their exemption from the incidents and badges of slavery alone to the Constitution of the United States. Yet it is said that their right to enjoy freedom and to be protected against the badges and incidents of slavery is not secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States.\n It may be also observed that the freedom created and established by the 13th Amendment was further protected against assault when the 14th Amendment became a part of the supreme law of the land; for that Amendment provided that no state shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. To deprive any person of a privilege inhering in the freedom ordained and established by the 13th Amendment is to deprive him of a privilege inhering in the liberty recognized by the 14th Amendment. It is true that the present case is not one of the deprivation, by the Constitution or laws of the state, of the privilege of disposing of one's labor as he deems proper. But it is one of a combination and conspiracy by individuals acting in hostility to rights conferred by the Amendment that ordained and established freedom and conferred upon every person within the jurisdiction of the United States ( not held lawfully in custody for cirme) the privileges that are fundamental in a state of freedom, and which were violently taken from the laborers in question solely because of their race and color.\n Let us see whether these principles do not find abundant support in adjudged cases.\n One of the earliest cases arising under the 13th Amendment was that of United States v. Cruikshank, 1 Woods, 308, 318, 320, Fed. Cas. No. 14, 897. It became necessary in that case for Mr. Justice Bradley, holding the circuit court, to consider the scope and effect of the 13th Amendment and the extent of the power of Congress to enforce its provisions. Referring to the 13th Amendment, that eminent jurist said that 'this is not merely a prohibition against the passage \n\n[203 U.S. 1, 29]\n\u00a0\n or enforcement of any law inflicting or establishing slavery or involuntary servitude, but it is a positive declaration that slavery shall not exist. . . . So, undoubtedly, by the 13th Amendment, Congress has power to legislate for the entire eradication of slavery in the United States. This Amendment had an affirmative operation the moment it was adopted. It enfranchised four millions of slaves, if, indeed, they had not previously been enfranchised by the operation of the Civil War. Congress, therefore, acquired the power not only to legislate for the eradication of slavery, but the power to give full effect to this bestowment of liberty on these millions of people. All this it essayed to do by the civil rights bill passed April 9, 1866 (14 Stat. at L. 27, chap. 31), by which it was declared that all persons born in the United States, and not subject to a foreign power (except Indians, not taxed), should be citizens of the United States; and that such citizens, of every race and color, without any regard to any previous condition of slavery or involuntary servitude, should have the same right, in every state and territory, to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, and give evidence to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property, and to full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and property, as is enjoyed by white citizens, and should be subject to like punishment, pains, and penalties, and to none other, any law, etc., to the contrary notwithstanding. It was supposed that the eradication of slavery and involuntary servitude of every form and description required that the slave should be made a citizen and placed on an entire equality before the law with the white citizen, and, therefore, that Congress had the power, under the amendment, to declare and effectuate these objects. . . . Conceding this to be true (which I think it is), Congress then had the right to go further and to enforce its declaration by passing laws for the prosecution and punishment of those who should deprive or attempt to deprive any person of the rights thus conferred upon them. Without having this power, \n\n[203 U.S. 1, 30]\n\u00a0\n Congress could not enforce the amendment. It cannot be doubted, therefore, that Congress had the power to make it a penal offense to conspire to deprive a person of, or to hinder him in, the exercise and enjoyment of the rights and privileges conferred by the 13th Amendment and the laws thus passed in pursuance thereof. But this power does not authorize Congress to pass laws for the punishment of ordinary crimes and offenses against persons of the colored race or any other race. That belongs to the state government alone. All ordinary murders, robberies, assaults, thefts and offenses whatsoever are cognizable only in the state courts, unless, indeed, the state should deny to the class or persons referred to the equal protection of the laws. . . . To illustrate: If in a community or neighborhood composed principally of whites, a citizen of African descent, or of the Indian race, not within the exception of the Amendment, should propose to lease and cultivate a farm, and a combination should be formed to expel him and prevent him from the accomplishment of his purpose on account of his race or color, it cannot be doubted that this would be a case within in power of Congress to remedy and redress. It would be a case of interference with that person's exercise of his equal rights as a citizen because of his race. But if that person should be injured in his person or property by any wrongdoer for the mere felonious or wrongful purpose of malice, revenge, hatred, or gain, without any design to interfere with his rights of citizenship or equality before the laws, as being a person of a different race and color from the white race, it would be an ordinary crime, punishable by the state laws only.'\n This was followed by the Civil Rights Cases, \n109 \nU.S. 3, 20\n, 22 S., 27 L. ed. 835, 842, 843, 3 Sup. Ct. Rep. 18, 28, 29, in which the court passed upon the constitutionality of an act of Congress providing for the full and equal enjoyment by every race equally, of the accommodations, advantages, and facilities of theaters and public conveyances, and other places of public amusement; and in which the court also considered the scope and effect of the 13th Amendment. In that case the court, speaking by Mr. Justice Brad- \n\n[203 U.S. 1, 31]\n\u00a0\n ley,-who, as we have seen, delivered the judgment in the case just cited,- said: 'By its own unaided force and effect it abolished slavery and established universal freedom. Still, legislation may be necessary and proper to meet all the various cases and circumstances to be affected by it, and to prescribe proper modes of redress for its violation in letter or spirit. And such legislation may be primary and direct in its character; for the Amendment is not a mere prohibition of state laws establishing or upholding slavery, but an absolute declaration that slavery or involuntary servitude shall not exist in any part of the United States. It is true that slavery cannot exist without law, any more than property in lands and goods can exist without law; and, therefore, the 13th Amendment may be regarded as nullifying all state laws which establish or uphold slavery. But it has a reflex character also establishing and decreeing universal civil and political freedom throughout the United States; and it is assumed that the power vested in Congress to enforce the article by appropriate legislation clothes Congress with power to pass all laws necessary and proper for abolishing all badges and incidents of slavery in the United States. . . .\n The long existence of African slavery in this country gave us very distinct notions of what it was and what were its necessary incidents. Compulsory service of the slave for the benefit of the master, restraint of his movements except by the master's will, disability to hold property, to make contracts, to have a standing in court, to be a witness against a white person, and such like burdens and incapacities, were the inseparable incidents of the institution. Severer punishments for crimes were imposed on the slave than on free persons guilty of the same offenses. . . . We must not forget that the province and scope of the 13th and 14th Amendments are different; the former simply abolished slavery; the latter prohibited the states from abridging the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States, by depriving them of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, and \n\n[203 U.S. 1, 32]\n\u00a0\n from denying to any the equal protection of the laws. The Amendments are different, and the powers of Congress under them are different. What Congress has power to do under one, it may not have power to do under the other. Under the 13th Amendment it has only to do with slavery and its incidents. Under the 14th Amendment it has power to counteract and render nugatory all state laws and proceedings which have the effect to abridge any of the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States, or to deprive them of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, or to deny to any of them the equal protection of the laws. Under the 13th Amendment, the legislation, so far as necessary or proper to eradicate all forms and incidents of slavery and involuntary servitude, may be direct and primary, operating upon the acts of individuals, whether sanctioned by state legislation or not; under the 14th, as we have already shown, it must necessarily be and can only be corrective in its character, addressed to counteract and afford relief against state regulations or proceedings.'\n I participated in the decision of the Civil Rights Cases, but was not able to concur with my brethren in holding the act there involved to be beyond the power of Congress. But I stood with the court in the declaration that the 13th Amendment not only established and decreed universal, civil and political freedom throughout this land, but abolished the incidents or badges of slavery, among which, as the court declared, was the disability, based merely on race discrimination, to hold property, to make contracts, to have a standing in court, and to be a witness against a white person.\n One of the important aspects in the present discussion of the Civil Rights Cases is that the court there proceeded distinctly upon the ground that although the Constitution and statutes of a state may not be repugnant to the 13th Amendment, nevertheless, Congress, by legislation of a direct and primary character, may, in order to enforce the Amendment, reach and punish individuals whose acts are in hos- \n\n[203 U.S. 1, 33]\n\u00a0\n tility to rights and privileges derived from, or secured by, or dependent upon, that Amendment.\n These views were explicitly referred to and reaffirmed in the recent case of Clyatt v. United States, \n197 U.S. 207\n, 49 L. ed. 726, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 429. That was an indictment against a single individual for having unlawfully and knowingly returned, forcibly and against their will, two persons from Florida to Georgia, to be held in the latter state in a condition of peonage, in violation of the statutes of the United States ( Rev. Stat. 1990, 5526, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 1266, 3715). A person arbitrarily or forcibly held against his will for the purpose of compelling him to render personal services in discharge of a debt is in a condition of peonage. It was not claimed in that case that peonage was sanctioned by or could be maintained under the Constitution or laws either of Florida or Georgia. The argument there on behalf of the accused was, in part, that the 13th Amendment was directed solely against the states and their laws, and that its provisions could not be made applicable to individuals whose illegal conduct was not authorized, permitted, or sanctioned by some act, resolution, order, regulation, or usage of the state. That argument was rejected by every member of this court, and we all agreed that Congress had power, under the 13th Amendment, not only to forbid the existence of peonage, but to make it an offense against the United States for any person to hold, arrest, return, or cause to be held, arrested or returned, or who in any manner aided in the arrest or return, of another person, to a condition of peonage. After quoting the above sentences from the opinion in the Civil Rights Cases, Mr. Justice Brewer, speaking for the court, said: 'Other authorities to the same effect might be cited. It is not open to doubt that Congress may enforce the 13th Amendment by direct legislation, punishing the holding of a person in slavery or in involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime. In the exercise of that power Congress has enacted these sections denouncing peonage, and punishing one who holds another in that condition of involuntary servitude. \n\n[203 U.S. 1, 34]\n\u00a0\n This legislation is not limited to the territories or other parts of the strictly national domain, but is operative in the states and wherever the sovereignty of the United States extends. We entertain no doubt of the validity of this legislation, or of its applicability to the case of any person holding another in a state of peonage, and this whether there be municipal ordinance or state law sanctioning such holding. It operates directly on every citizen of the republic, wherever his residence may be.' The Clyatt Case proceeded upon the ground that, although the Constitution and laws of the state might be in perfect harmony with the 13th Amendment, yet the compulsory holding of one individual by another individual for the purpose of compelling the former, by personal service, to discharge his indebtedness to the latter, created a condition of involuntary servitude or peonage, was in derogation of the freedom established by that Amendment, and, therefore, could be reached and punished by the nation. Is it consistent with the principle upon which that case rests to say that an organized body of individuals who forcibly prevent free citizens, solely because of their race, from making a living in a legitimate way, do not infringe any right secured by the national Constitution, and may not be reached or punished by the nation? One who is shut up by superior or overpowering force, constantly present and threatening, from earning his living in a lawful way of his own choosing, is as much in a condition of involuntary servitude as if he were forcibly held in a condition of peonage. In each case his will is enslaved, because illegally subjected, by a combination that he cannot resist, to the will of others in respect of matters which a freeman is entitled to control in such way as to him seems best. It would seem impossible, under former decisions, to sustain the view that a combination or conspiracy of individuals, albeit acting without the sanction of the state, may not be reached and punished by the United States, if the combination and conspiracy has for its object, by force, to prevent or burden the free exercise or enjoyment \n\n[203 U.S. 1, 35]\n\u00a0\n of a right or privilege created or secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States.\n The only way in which the present case can be taken out of  5508 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3712), is to hold that a combination or conspiracy of individuals to prevent citizens of African descent, because of their race, from freely disposing of their labor by contract, does not infringe or violate any right or privilege secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States. But such a proposition, I submit, is inadmissible, if regard be had to former decisions. As we have seen, this court has held that the 13th Amendment, by its own force, without the aid of legislation, not only conferred freedom upon every person (not legally held in custody for crime) within the jurisdiction of the United States, but the right and privilege of being free from the badges or incidents of slavery. And it has declared that one of the insuperable incidents of slavery, as it existed at the time of the adoption of the 13th Amendment, was the disability of those in slavery to make contracts. It has also adjudged-no member of this court holding to the contrary-that any attempt to subject citizens to the incidents or badges of slavery could be made an offense against the United States. If the 13th Amendment established freedom, and conferred, without the aid of legislation, the right to be free from the badges and incidents of slavery, and if the disability to make or enforce contracts for one's personal services was a badge of slavery, as it existed when the 13th Amendment was adopted, how is it possible to say that the combination or conspiracy charged in the present indictment, and conclusively established by the verdict and judgment, was not in hostility to rights secured by the Constitution?\n I have already said that the liberty protected by the 14th Amendment against state action inconsistent with due process of law is neither more nor less than the freedom established by the 13th Amendment. This, I think, cannot be doubted. In Allgeyer v. Louisiana, \n165 \nU.S. 578, 589\n, 41 S. L. ed. 832, 835, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 427, 431, \n\n[203 U.S. 1, 36]\n\u00a0\n we said that such liberty 'means not only the right of the citizen to be free from the mere physical restraint of his person, as by incarceration, but the term is deemed to embrace the right of the citizen to be free in the enjoyment of all his faculties; to be free to use them in all lawful ways; to live and work when he will; to earn his livelihood by any lawful calling; to pursue any livelihood or avocation, and for that purpose to enter into all contracts which may be proper, necessary, and essential to his carrying out to a successful conclusion the purposes above mentioned.' All these rights, as this court adjudged in the Allgeyer Case, are embraced in the liberty which the 14th Amendment protects against hostile state action, when such state action is wanting in due process of law. They are rights essential in the freedom conferred by the 13th Amendment. If, for instance, a person is prevented, because of his race, from living and working where and for whom he will, or from earning his livelihood by any lawful calling that he may elect to pursue, then he is hindered in the exercise of rights and privileges secured to freemen by the Constitution of the United States. If secured by the Constitution of the United States, then, unquestionably, rights of that class are embraced by such legislation as that found in  5508.\n The opinion of the court, it may be observed, does not, in words, adjudge  5508 to be unconstitutional. But if its scope and effect are not wholly misapprehended by me, the court does adjudge that Congress cannot make it an offense against the United States for individuals to combine or conspire to prevent, even by force, citizens of African descent, solely because of their race, from earning a living. Such is the import and practical effect of the present decision, although the court has heretofore unanimously held that the right to earn one's living in all legal ways, and to make lawful contracts in reference thereto, is a vital part of the freedom established by the Constitution, and although it has been held, time and again, that Congress may, by appropriate \n\n[203 U.S. 1, 37]\n\u00a0\n legislation, grant, protect, and enforce any right, derived from, secured or created by, or dependent upon, that instrument. These general principles, it is to be regretted, are now modified, so as to deny to millions of citizen-laborers of African descent, deriving their freedom from the nation, the right to appeal for national protection against lawless combinations of individuals who seek, by force, and solely because of the race of such laborers, to deprive them of the freedom established by the Constitution of the United States, so far as that freedom involves the right of such citizens, without discrimination against them because of their race, to earn a living in all lawful ways, and to dispose of their labor by contract. I cannot assent to an interpretation of the Constitution which denies national protection to vast numbers of our people in respect of rights derived by them from the nation. The interpretation now placed on the 13th Amendment is, I think, entirely too narrow, and is hostile to the freedom established by the Supreme Law of the land. It goes far towards neutralizing many declarations made as to the object of the recent Amendments of the Constitution, a common purpose of which, this court has said, was to secure to a people theretofore in servitude, the free enjoyment, without discrimination merely on account of their race, of the essential rights that appertain to American citizenship and to freedom.

Rep. 18.\n The objections urged to the view taken by the court are not met by the suggestion that this court may revise the final judgment of the state court, if it should deny to the complaining party a right secured by the Federal Constitution; for the revisory power of this court would be of no avail to the complaining party if it be true, as seems now to be adjudged, that a conspiracy to deprive colored citizens, solely because of \n\n[203 U.S. 1, 38]\n\u00a0\n their race, of the right to earn a living in a lawful way, infringes no right secured to them by the Federal Constitution.\n As the nation has destroyed both slavery and involuntary servitude everywhere within the jurisdiction of the United States, and invested Congress with power, by appropriate legislation, to protect the freedom thus established against all the badges and incidents of slavery as it once existed; as the disability to make valid contracts for one's services was, as this court has said, an inseparable incident of the institution of slavery which the 13th Amendment destroyed; and as a combination or conspiracy to prevent citizens of African descent, solely because of their race, from making and performing such contracts, is thus in hostility to the rights and privileges that inhere in the freedom established by that Amendment,-I am of opinion that the case is within  5508, and that the judgment should be affirmed.\n For these reasons, I dissent from the opinion and judgment of the court. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Dissent announced May 28, 1906, but not filed until October 24, 1906. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] The indictment charged that 'the said Berry Winn, Dave Hinton, Percy Legg, Joe Mardis, Joe McGill, Dan Shelton, Jim Hall, and George Shelton, being then and there persons of African descent, and citizens of the United States and of the state of Arkansas, had then and there \n made and entered into contracts and agreements with James A.

CO. v. MAYES(1906)\nNo. 198\nArgued: Decided: April 2, 1906\n\n\n This was an action begun by Mayes in the district court of Llano county, Texas, against the Houston & Texas Central Railroad Company to recover a penalty of $475, by reason of defendant's failure to furnish seventeen stock cars, applied for in \n\n[201 U.S. 321, 322]\n\u00a0\n writing by the plaintiff under the provisions of certain statutes of Texas hereinafter referred to, for the purpose of shipping plaintiff's cattle from Llano, Texas, to Red Rock, Oklahoma, and for damages occasioned by defendant's negligence.\n The petitioner alleged that the defendant company formed with two other railroad companies a continuous line from Llano to Red Rock, and were engaged as common carriers in the business of shipping live stock and other freight; that on April 9, 1903, plaintiff, being the owner of six hundred and twenty-five head of cattle, made application in writing to the local agent of the road for seventeen stock cars, to be delivered on April 20, and deposited with the agent one fourth of the freight on the same, namely, $268.82, promising to pay the remainder on demand, and that he afterwards paid the same; that upon the day named, April 20, he had cattle sufficient to load the cars, delivered them to the defendant at its stock pens at Llano for shipment, but the defendant failed to furnish the cars, and did not furnish the same until the afternoon of the 21st April, 1903\n\n\n The trial resulted in a judgment in favor of the plaintiff for $425 penalty for delay, and $500 damages to the stock while in the pens at Llano. This judgment was affirmed by the court of civil appeals, and an application for a writ of error to the supreme court of the state was overruled.\n Messrs. Maxwell Evarts, James A. Baker, Robert S. Lovett, and Gordon M. Buck for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n[201 U.S. 321, 325]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. T. W. Gregory and McLean & Spears for defendant in error. \n\n[201 U.S. 321, 326]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Brown delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case involves the constitutionality of certain articles of the Revised Statutes of Texas, set forth in the margin, the\n'Art. 4497. When the owner, manager, or shipper of any freight of any kind shall make application in writing to any superintendent, agent, or person in charge of transportation, to any railway company, receiver, or trustee operating a line of railway at the point the cars are desired upon which to ship any freight, it shall be the duty of such railway company, receiver, trustee, or other person in charge thereof to supply the number of cars so required, at the point indicated in the application, within a reasonable time thereafter, not to exceed six days from the receipt of such application, and shall supply such cars to the persons so applying therefor, in the order in which such applications are made, without giving preference to any person; provided, if the application be for ten cars or less, the same shall be furnished in three days; and provided further, that if the application be for fifty cars or more, the railway company may have ten full days in which to supply the cars. (As amended by the act of 1899, page 67.)\n\n'Art. 4498. Said application shall state the number of cars desired, the place at which they are desired, and the time they are desired; provided, that the place designated shall be at some station or switch on the railiroad.\n\n'Art. 4499. When cars are applied for under the provisions of this chapter, if they are not furnished, the railway company so failing to furnish them shall forfeit to the party or parties so applying for them the sum of $25 per day for each car failed to be furnished, to be recovered in any court of competent jurisdiction, and all actual damages such applicant may sustain.\n\n'Art. 4500. Such applicant shall, \n\n[201 U.S. 321, 327]\n\u00a0\n material requirement of which is that when the shipper of freight shall make a requisition in writing for a number of cars to be furnished at any point indicated within a certain number of days from the receipt of the application, and shall deposit one fourth of the freight with the agent of the company, the company failing to furnish them shall forfeit $25 per day for each car failed to be furnished, the only proviso being that the law 'shall not apply in cases of strikes or other public calamity.'\n\n The defense was that this statute was not applicable to demands made for cars to be sent out of the state and to be used in interstate commerce; and as the shipment was intended for Oklahoma, the act did not apply, and the defendant was not liable. The question is whether the statute, applied, as it is, \n\n[201 U.S. 321, 328]\n\u00a0\n by the Texas court, to interstate shipments, is an infringement upon the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce.\n That, notwithstanding the exclusive nature of this power, the states may, in the exercise of their police power, make reasonable rules with regard to the methods of carrying on interstate business, the precautions that shall be used to avoid danger, the facilities for the comfort of passengers and the safety of freight carried, and, to a certain extent, the stations at which stoppages shall be made, is settled by repeated decisions of this court. Of course, such rules are inoperative if conflicting with regulations upon the same subject enacted by Congress, and can be supported only when consistent with the general requirement that interstate commerce shall be free and unobstructed, and not amounting to a regulation of such commerce. As the power to build and operate railways, and to acquire land by condemnation, usually rests upon state authority, the legislatures may annex such conditions as they please with regard to intrastate transportation, and such other rules regarding interstate commerce as are not inconsistent with the general right of such commerce to be free and unobstructed.\n The exact limit of lawful legislation upon this subject cannot, in the nature of things, be defined. It can only be illustrated from decided cases, by applying the principles therein enunciated, determining from these whether, in the particular case, the rule be reasonable or otherwise.\n That states may not burden instruments of interstate commerce, whether railways or telegraphs, by taxation, by forbidding the introduction into the state of articles of commerce generally recognized as lawful, or by prohibiting their sale after introduction, has been so frequently settled that a citation of authorities is unnecessary. Upon the other hand, the validity of local laws designed to protect passengers or employees, or persons crossing the railroad tracks, as well as other regulations intended for the public good, are generally recognized. An analysis of all the prior important cases upon this point will be found in the opinion of the court in Cleveland, C. C. & St. L. R. Co. v. \n\n[201 U.S. 321, 329]\n\u00a0\n Illinois, \n177 U.S. 514\n, 44 L. ed. 868, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 722, wherein a requirement that express trains intended only for through passengers should stop at every county seat, when ample accommodations were provided by local trains, was held to be an unreasonable burden. Other similar cases regulating the stoppage of trains are Illinois C. R. Co. v. Illinois, \n163 U.S. 142\n, 41 L. ed. 107, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1096; Gladson v. Minnesota, \n166 U.S. 427\n, 41 L. ed. 1064, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 627; Lake Shore & M. S. R. Co. v. Ohio, \n173 U.S. 285\n, 43 L. ed. 702, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 465. In the same line is the more recent case of Wisconsin, M. & P. R. Co. v. Jacobson, \n179 U.S. 287\n, 45 L. ed. 194, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 115.\n While there is much to be said in favor of laws compelling railroads to furnish adequate facilities for the transportation of both freight and passengers, and to regulate the general subject of speed, length, and frequency of stops, for the heating, lighting, and ventilation of passenger cars, the furnishing of food and water to cattle and other live stock, we think an absolute requirement that a railroad shall furnish a certain number of cars at a specified day, regardless of every other consideration except strikes and other public calamities, transcends the police power of the state, and amounts to a burden upon interstate commerce. It makes no exception in cases of a sudden congestion of traffic, an actual inability to furnish cars by reason of their temporary and unavoidable detention in other states, or in other places within the same state. It makes no allowance for interference of traffic occasioned by wrecks or other accidents upon the same or other roads, involving a detention of traffic, the breaking of bridges, accidental fires, washouts, or other unavoidable consequences of heavy weather.\n A dereliction of the road in this particular, which may have occurred from circumstances wholly beyond the control of its officers, is made punishable not only by damages actually incurred by the shipper in the detention of his stock, but, in addition thereto, by an arbitrary penalty of $25 per car for each day of detention. The penalty which was assessed in this case, though the detention was only for one day, amounted to nearly as much as the damages, and might, in another case, amount to far more. \n\n[201 U.S. 321, 330]\n\u00a0\n While perhaps the road may have no right to complain of that portion of the statute which assumes to provide for its own protection, it is illustrative of its general spirit that, if the shipper does not fully load his cars within forty-eight hours after their arrival, he shall forfeit $25 for each car, or if the consignee shall fail to unload them within forty-eight hours after their delivery, at the place of consignment, which, in the case of interstate shipments, would be in another state, he shall also forfeit $25 per day for each car unloaded.\n In this connection the recent case of Central R. Co. v. Murphy, \n196 U.S. 194\n, 49 L. ed. 444, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 218, is instructive. In that case we held that the imposition by a state statute, upon the initial or any connecting carrier, of the duty of tracing the freight and informing the shipper, in writing, when, where, or how, and by which carrier, the freight was lost, damaged, or destroyed, and of giving the names of the parties and their official position, if any, by whom the truth of the facts set out in the information could be established, is, when applied to interstate commerce, a violation of the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution; and an act of the legislature of Georgia imposing such a duty on common carriers was held void as to shipments made from points in Georgia to other states.\n Although the statute in question may have been dictated by a due regard for the public interest of the cattle raisers of the state, and may have been intended merely to secure promptness on the part of the railroad companies in providing facilities for speedy transportation, we think that in its practical operation it is likely to work a great injustice to the roads, and to impose heavy penalties for trivial, unintentional, and accidental violations of its provisions, when no damages could actually have resulted to the shippers.\n It should be borne in mind that the act does not apply to cattle alone, but to all cases 'when the owner, manager, or shipper of any freight of any kind shall make application in writing,' etc. The duty of the railroad company to furnish the cars within the time limited is peremptory and admits of \n\n[201 U.S. 321, 331]\n\u00a0\n no excuses, except such as arise from strikes and other public calamities. If, for instance, the owner of a large quantity of cotton should make a requisition under the act for a number of cars, the railways company would be bound to furnish them upon the day named, or incur a penalty of $25 for each car, though the detention of the cotton involved no expense to the owner or may even have resulted in a benefit to him through a rise in the market.\n While railroad companies may be bound to furnish sufficient cars for their usual and ordinary traffic, cases will inevitably arise where, by reason of an unexpected turn in the market, a great public gathering, or an unforeseen rush of travel, a pressure upon the road for transportation facilities may arise, which good management and a desire to fulfil all its legal requirements cannot provide for, and against which the statute in question makes no allowance.\n Although it may be admitted that the statute is not far from the line of proper police regulation, we think that sufficient allowance is not made for the practical difficulties in the administration of the law, and that, as applied to interstate commerce, it transcends the legitimate powers of the legislature.\n The judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals is, therefore, reversed, and the cause remanded to that court for further proceedings.\n Mr. Justice White, not having heard the argument, took no part in the decision of this case.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice Harlan, and Mr. Justice McKenna dissented. \n\nFootnotes\n at the time of applying for such car or cars, deposit with the agent of such company one fourth of the amount of the freight charge for the use of such cars, unless the said road shall agree to deliver said cars without such deposit. And such applicant shall, within forty-eight hours after such car or cars have been delivered and placed as hereinbefore provided, fully load the same, and upon failure to do so he shall forfeit and pay to the company the sum of $25 for each car not used; provided, that where applications are made on several days, all of which are filed upon the same day, the applicant shall have forty-eight hours to load the car or cars furnished on the first application, and the next forty-eight hours to load the car or cars furnished on the next application, and so on; and the penalty prescribed shall not accrue as to any car or lot of cars applied for on any one day until the period within which they may be loaded has expired. And if the said applicant shall not use such cars so ordered by him, and shall notify the said company or its agent, he shall forfeit and pay to said railroad company, in addition to the penalty herein prescribed, the actual damages that such company may sustain by the said failure of the applicant to use said cars.' (As amended by the act of 1899, page 67.)\n Act 4502 contains the following proviso: 'That the provisions of this law shall not apply in cases of strikes or other public calamity.' \n\n\n\n\n","76":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHOWARD v.

Morris for defendant in error.\n\n\n[200 U.S. 164, 170]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n The plaintiff in error seeks to review the judgment of the court of appeals of the commonwealth of Kentucky affirming a conviction and sentence of murder against him. He was indicted, with others, for killing one William Goebel. The grounds of review by this court are based upon certain rulings of the trial court which, plaintiff in error contends, were repugnant to the due process clause of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.\n It appears from the record that eleven jurors, including one J. C. Alexander, had been accepted by the parties. The commonwealth had exhausted three of its peremptory challenges, and plaintiff in error eleven of his,-he was given by the statutes fifteen. At this point the commonwealth's attorney suggested that Alexander had formed and expressed an opinion on the merits of the case, and had improperly conversed with a person, not a member of the jury, on a subject connected with the case. The commonwealth's attorney then made a motion to discharge Alexander from the jury, in support of which he filed the following affidavit of one Ben Hackett, who had been excluded as a juror in the case:\n The affiant, Ben Hackett, says that after the killing of William Goebel he and Mr. J. C. Alexander, who has been accepted on the jury to try this case, had many conversations and arguments \n\n[200 U.S. 164, 171]\n\u00a0\n about the said killing, this affiant expressing and urging the opinion that there had been a conspiracy to murder Goebel, among those who were charged with his murder, and Mr. Alexander expressing and urging the opinion that there had not been a conspiracy at all to murder him. These arguments and conversations occurred at different times and places in Woodford county during the time that has elapsed since the murder of Mr. Goebel, were frequent, and much earnest interest and feeling was expressed by both this affiant and Mr. Alexander therein.\n This affiant further says that on yesterday afternoon, late, after Mr. Alexander had been accepted as a juror to try the case, and after this affiant had been excused, after those accepted as jurors had been charged and admonished by the court, immediately after adjournment for supper, and as the jury was being conducted by the sheriff away from the courthouse, affiant by accident met the jury as they were passing out through the courthouse yard, when, in passing, Mr. Alexander said to this affiant: 'Hello, Ben, I am glad they cut you off this jury, as I did not want to serve on this jury with you.'\n Affiant, Ben Hackett, says the foregoing statements are true.\n (Signed) Ben F. Hackett.\n The following proceedings were then had, as appears from the order of the court, from which we quote:\n'It was agreed by counsel on either side that the court might, in the absence of the defendant and counsel, question the said Alexander as to the truth of the said statements, contained in said Hackett's affidavit, that he said to said Hackett while in the custody of the sheriff, 'Hello, Ben, I am glad they cut you off of this jury, as I did not want to serve on this jury with you,' and the said Alexander having admitted the truth of said statement, but claimed the said statement was made in a jocular way, and the court being of the opinion that such conduct on the part of said Alexander was a violation of the admonitions of the court, when he was placed in the custody of the sheriff, it was ordered and adjudged that said Alexander be, and he is \n\n[200 U.S. 164, 172]\n\u00a0\n now, excused as a juror in this case, and he is now ordered to be discharged; and the court, being thus advised, overruled defendant's objection, and discharged and excused said Alexander, and defendant, by counsel, excepts.\n\n'Thereupon defendant moved the court to discharge the entire panel remaining, which was objected to by the attorney for the commonwealth, and the court being advised, sustained said objection, and refused to discharge said entire panel, to which ruling defendant, by counsel, excepts.'\n\n By these rulings, it is contended that plaintiff in error was deprived of due process of law. Error is assigned under the 5th, 6th, and 14th Amendments of the Constitution of the United States.\n Plaintiff in error cannot avail himself of the provisions of the 5th and 6th Amendments, for reasons we have so often expressed that it would be the extreme of superfluity to repeat them. It is enough to say that those amendments do not apply to proceedings in the state courts. The invocation of the 14th Amendment is attempted to be justified on two grounds: (1) That the trial court, in discharging Alexander, acted beyond its power, and that the court of appeals of Kentucky, in holding that, by reason of  281 of the Criminal Code of the state, it cannot reverse on account of such error, deprives plaintiff in error of his liberty without due process of law. (2) By the common law, which has been adopted by Kentucky, and by the Constitution and statutes of the state, an accused has not only the right to be present, but must be present during the whole of the trial. 'His presence is not only an inalienable right, but a jurisdictional fact, and cannot be waived.'\n The argument of plaintiff in error is very elaborate, but there is scarcely any phase of it which has not been answered adversely to his contention by decisions of this court.\n He seems to make an issue with the court of appeals of the state upon the law of the state, and to contend that the court erred in the interpretation and application of that law. This contention encounters the ruling in Re Converse, 137 U. S. \n\n[200 U.S. 164, 173]\n\u00a0\n 624, 631, 34 L. ed. 796, 799, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 191, and other cases, which hold that 'state cannot be deemed guilty of a violation of its obligations under the Constitution of the United states because of a decision, even if erroneous, of its highest court, while acting within its jurisdiction.'\n We cannot assume error in the decision of the court of appeals. We accept it, as we are bound to do, as a correct exposition of the law of the state,-common, statutory, and constitutional. Our inquiry can only be, Did the state law, as applied, afford plaintiff in error due process, as those words are used in the 14th Amendment? We think it did. It is not necessary to enter into a lengthy discussion of what constitutes due process of law. That has been done in a number of cases and there is nothing in the present case which calls for a repetition and an extension of the discussion. It may be admitted that the words 'due process of law,' as used in the 14th Amendment, protect fundamental rights. What those are cannot ever be the cause of much dispute. In giving them protection, however, it was not designed, as was observed by the Chief Justice in Re Converse, 'to interfere with the power of the state to protect the lives, liberty, and property of its citizens; not with the exercise of that power in the adjudications of the courts of a state in administering the process provided by the law of the state.' These words are apposite in the present case. Of what does plaintiff in error complain? The discharge of a juror before he was sworn, and the absence of the plaintiff in error from the examination of the juror by the presiding judge. But plaintiff in error consented through his counsel to the examination, and there is not an intimation that the juror selected in Alexander's place was not as competent as he. Nor can we say that the discharge of Alexander took from the other jurors who had been chosen their competency to try the case or to give to plaintiff in error the right to a new panel. In Hayes v. Missouri, \n120 U.S. 68\n, 30 L. ed. 578, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 350, it was said 'the accused cannot complain if he is still tried by an impartial jury. He can demand nothing more. Northern P. R. Co. v. Herbert, \n\n[200 U.S. 164, 174]\n\u00a0\n \n116 U.S. 642\n, 29 L. ed. 755, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 590. The right to challenge is the right to reject, not to select, a juror. If, from those who remain, an impartial jury is obtained, the constitutional right of the accused is maintained.' Brown v. New Jersey, \n175 U.S. 172\n, 44 L. ed. 119, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 77.\n In passing on the action of the trial court in examining Alexander in the absence of plaintiff in error, the court of appeals said that the court had been compelled to relax the rule prescribed by the statute that 'the defendant must be present and shall remain in custody during trial,' and cited Hite v. Com. 14 Ky. L. Rep. 308, 20 S. W. 217; Meece v. Com. 78 Ky. 586. In the first case, absence from the court room by the accused for a few minutes at a time, on account of sickness, the trial continuing in his absence, it was held did not prejudice the substantial rights of the accused.\n In Meece v. Com., upon the jury coming back to the court room for further instructions, the court made certain alterations in the instructions in absence of the accused, but in the presence of his counsel. It was held not to be error, the court saying:\n'While we recognize the fact that the accused, when on trial for a criminal offense, should be present during the entire trial, and that no evidence should be heard or instructions given or amended without his presence either before or after the submission of the cause to the jury, still this court is only authorized to reverse in cases where the substantial rights of the accused have been prejudiced in the court below; and in order to ascertain whether errors have been committed to the prejudice of the accused, the facts as well as the law of the case should be considered. While one charged with a criminal offense has the constitutional right to be tried by a jury, the right of appeal from the verdict and judgment against him does not exist except by reason of the legislation of the state on the subject; and, when permitting an appeal, the lawmaking power has the right to determine for what cause a reversal may be had.'\n\n The court of appeals also said, in passing on the contention of plaintiff in error, based on the examination of Alexander: \n\n[200 U.S. 164, 175]\n\u00a0\n 'It has also been held by this court that a trial for felony begins when the jury is sworn. Willis v. Com. 85 Ky. 68, 2 S. W. 654. At the time the examination of Alexander took place, and when he was discharged, the jury had not only not been sworn, but it had not been completed.\n'There are many rights, some of them guaranteed by the Constitution, which one charged with crime may not waive, and should not be permitted by the courts to waive,-such as the right of trial by jury, the right to be heard by himself and counsel, to demand the nature and cause of the accusation against him; and yet others, the assertion of which may unexpectedly become necessary for his protection during the progress of the trial. But we are unwilling to say that one charged with felony, and being in court, as was the appellant, with counsel at hand ready and competent to advise him of his rights, may not, in advance of the swearing of the jury, and before he is placed in jeopardy, consent to a private examination by the court of a juror against whom complaint has been made, for the purpose of ascertaining whether he was qualified to retain his place as one of the jury to try the case. Nor do we think it is affirmatively shown by the record in this case that any injury resulted to the substantial rights of the appellant by Alexander's dismissal from the jury.'\n\n It is manifest, therefore, that it is the law of Kentucky that occasional absence of the accused from the trial, from which no injury results to his substantial rights, is not reversible error. And we think, in applying that rule to the case at bar, plaintiff in error was not deprived of due process of law within the meaning of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.\n It will be observed that the court of appeals also decided that, even though the exclusion of Alexander had been error, a reversal of the case was forbidden by  281 of the Criminal Code of the state, and cited Curtis v. Com. 110 Ky. 845, 62 S. W. 886; Turner v. Com. 25 Ky. L. Rep. 981, 76 S. W. 853; Alderson v. Com. 25 Ky. L. Rep. 32, 74 S. W. 679. See also Powers v. Com. \n\n[200 U.S. 164, 176]\n\u00a0\n 114 Ky. 237, 70 S. W. 644, 1050, 71 S. W. 494, where  281 was construed the same way. The court, in its construction of  281, followed the construction established by prior cases, and did not make a discriminating application of that section against plaintiff in error. He was, therefore, not deprived of the equal protection of the laws.\n Judgment affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan, concurring:\n The record does not, in my judgment, show an absence of the due process of law enjoined by the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, as that amendment has been interpreted by this court. For that reason, without approving all that is said in the opinion of the court, I concur in the judgment of affirmance. \n\n\n\n","77":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHOWARD v. PERRIN(1906)\nNo. 110\nArgued: Decided: January 2, 1906\n\n\n\nStatement by Mr. Justice Brewer:\n This action was commenced on July 13, 1898, in the district court of Coconino county, Arizona, to recover possession of a quarter section of land, together with damages for its detention. The defendant, in addition to the denials in his answer of plaintiff's title, filed a cross complaint, praying a decree in his favor on account of certain alleged water rights. A trial resulted in a judgment for plaintiff, which was affirmed by the supreme court of the territory, to review which judgment this appeal was taken. A statement of facts was prepared by the supreme court, which statement was in substance that the land was within the place limits and a part of the land granted to the Atlantic & Pacific Railroad Company by act of Congress, approved July 27, 1866 (14 Stat. at L. 292, chap. 278); that the grant was accepted by the company, a map of definite location duly filed \n\n[200 U.S. 71, 72]\n\u00a0\n and approved, and the railroad completed and accepted in the year 1884; that in April, 1894, the lands along this part of the road were surveyed and this tract found to be the northwest 1\/4 of section 15, township 25 north, range 3 west, of Gila and Salt river meridian; that the survey was accepted and approved by the Surveyor General, and also by the Commissioner of the General Land Office; that on June 27, 1896, this tract, together with others, was duly and regularly selected by the railroad company as a portion of the lands to which it was entitled under the act of Congress; that on July 27, 1896, the filing of the list of such selections was allowed by the register and receiver of the United States land office at Prescott, Arizona, by them approved, the land certified to be public lands of the United States within the place limits of the grant, and free from all other claims; that thereupon such list so certified was forwarded to the Land Department at Washington, and has since remained on file in that office; that the cost of the survey and all fees allowed by law had been paid; that the land is nonmineral in character, neither swamp land nor claimed as such, nor within any reservation, and that there is no valid claim against it on file or of record in the land office of the district in which it is situated; and that on January 13, 1897, the railroad company conveyed the land to the plaintiff. The statement of fact further shows that the only water upon the land is percolating water, oozing through the soil beneath the surface, in an undefined and unknown channel; that in 1889 the defendant's grantor entered upon the land, then unoccupied and unsurveyed, sank a well, and by running tunnels therefrom collected water in an arroyo, and conveyed the same by pipes to troughs and a reservior for watering stock; that in 1892 the defendant's grantor conveyed the land to him by quitclaim deed, and that on July 16, 1895, he posted on the dwelling house on the premises a notice in accordance with the territorial act of 1886 (Arizona Laws, 1893, p. 135), that he had appropriated all the water in a certain defined underground channel, and recorded a copy of such notice in the public records; that the \n\n[200 U.S. 71, 73]\n\u00a0\n defendant and his grantor had been in the exclusive, open, and notorious possession, with the knowledge of plaintiff, of the land, improvements, and water ever since the year 1889, claiming by right of possession only; that they had never diverted any water from the land, or used, or caused the same to be used, elsewhere by any person.\n Mr. Everett E. Ellinwood for appellant.\n Mr. Edward M. Doe for appellee.\n\n\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n The statement of facts discloses a title in the plaintiff (now appellee) sufficient to sustain the judgment for the recovery of possession, although no patent had been issued. Deseret Salt Co. v. Tarpey, \n142 U.S. 241\n, 35 L. ed. 999, 12 Sup.Ct.Rep. 158.\n The certified copy of the records and papers in the General Land Office was competent evidence. Rev. Stat.  891, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 672. This section determines the question of competency, but not of materiality. Some of the letters, between the officials of the railroad company may not have been material, but there was nothing in them prejudicial. The certificate of the local land officers was competent to show that on the records of their office were no homestead, pre-emption, or other valid claims, and that the land had not been returned or denominated as swamp or mineral land. It is true there was no positive evidence that there were no minerals in the land, and, of course, nothing to show affirmatively that a mine might not be discovered prior to the issue of the patent, but the same could have been said of the showing in Deseret Salt Co. v. Tarpey, \n142 U.S. 241\n, 35 L. ed. 999, 12 Sup.Ct.Rep. 158. While the question of mineral was not discussed at that time, and was first fully considered in Barden v. Northern P. R. Co. \n154 U.S. 288\n, 38 L. ed. 992, 14 Sup.Ct.Rep. 1030, it appears from the opinion of the majority in the latter case that there was no intention to disturb the former \n\n[200 U.S. 71, 74]\n\u00a0\n ruling. Neither is there anything in Corinne Mill, Canal, & Stock Co. v. Johnson, \n156 U.S. 574\n, 39 L. ed. 537, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 409, to the contraty. In that case a judgment of the supreme court of Utah against a grantee of the railroad company was affirmed, but it was affirmed on the ground that the record did not purport to contain all the evidence, and, under those circumstances, we could not assume that there was not evidence to fully sustain the judgment of the territorial court, or that it was not in fact based upon an adjudication by the Land Department of the presence of mineral.\n It must also be noticed that this land was within the place limits of the Atlantie & Pacific Company, and that, therefore, on the completion of the road, and without any selection or approval thereof by the Secretary of the Interior, the title passed unless the tract was within the excepted classes, and there was no testimony tending to show that it was. On the contrary, the testimony pointed in the other direction.\n It is further claimed by appellant that he was protected by a statute of limitations of the territory, paragraph 2301, Arizona Rev. Stat. 1887, re-enacted as par. 2941, Arizona Rev. Stat. 1901, which reads:\n'(2941) Sec. 7. In all cases when the party in possession claims real property by right of possession only, suits to recover the possession from him shall be brought in two years after the right of action accrues, and not afterwards, and in such case the defendant is not required to show title or color of title from and under the sovereignty of the soil, as provided in the preceding section, as against the plaintiff who shows no better right.'\n\n But this applies only in cases of mere possessory rights, and is without force after the passing of the full legal or equitable title from the government. Such was the construction placed on the statute by the supreme court of Arizona, and is undoubtedly correct. The language is clear. The claim of the defendant is a 'right of possession only,' and the limitation applies solely against a 'plaintiff who shows no better right.' To hold that the section gives to a mere occupation of public \n\n[200 U.S. 71, 75]\n\u00a0\n land a title by prescription against one subsequently acquired from the United States would limit the full control of the government over its landed property, and qualify or destroy the effect of its patent or grant. Toltec Ranch Co. v. Cook, \n191 U.S. 532\n, 48 L. ed. 291, 24 Sup.Ct.Rep. 166, does not conflict with this, for there a possession sufficient for the running of the statute of limitations was held after the full equitable title had passed from the government; and when such title has passed the land comes under the dominion of the state, and is subject to its laws. But in this case the possession had not been long enough to create under the Arizona laws a defense to a title, legal or equitable; and the sole reliance was upon this section, which only applies to contests between possessory rights.\n The remaining question arises under the cross complaint of the appellant, who claims a prior appropriation of all the water flowing in a subterranean stream which had been reached by digging a well, relying on these provisions of the Arizona Revised Statutes of 1887:\n'(3199) Sec. 1. All rivers, creeks, and streams of running water in the territory of Arizona are hereby declared public, and applicable to the purposes of irrigation and mining, as hereinafter provided.'\n\n'(3201) Sec. 3. All the inhabitants of this territory, who own or possess arable and irrigable lands, shall have the right to construct public or private acequias, and obtain the necessary water for the same from any convenient river, creek, or stream of running water.'\n\n We need not stop to inquire whether these sections apply to subterranean streams, because the finding of fact, which is sustained by the testimony, is 'that the only water upon said land is percolating water, oozing through the soil beneath the surface in an undefined and unknown channel.' Of course this excludes the idea of a 'river, creek, or stream of running water.'\n We see no error in the record, and the judgment of the Supreme Court of Arizona is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","78":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHULBERT v. CITY OF CHICAGO(1906)\nNo. 248\nArgued: Decided: May 14, 1906\n\n\n\n Mr. George W. Wilbur for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[202 U.S. 275, 276]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. James Hamilton Lewis, Charles H. Mitchell, and Frank Johnston, Jr., for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[202 U.S. 275, 278]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n Error to the judgment of the supreme court of the state of Illinois affirming a judgment of the county court of Cook county, confirming an assessment to defray the cost of paving a street in the city of Chicago.\n The proceeding was commenced by a petition filed by the city in the county court of Cook county, in accordance with law of the state. The petition recited an ordinance of the city providing for the improvement of the street, and prayed 'that steps be taken to levy a special assessment for said improvements in accordance with the provisions of said ordinance, and in the manner prescribed by law.'\n An order was made in accordance with the prayer. An assessment and report thereon were duly made with an assessment roll attached, which exhibited the property of plaintiff in error as assessed and the amount for which it was assessed.\n In pursuance of notice given to all parties to file objections to the confirming of the assessment roll, plaintiff in error filed objections thereto. Among his objections were the following:\n'Said act concerning local improvements, passed June 14, 1897, and all amendments thereto, are not only contrary to the Constitution of Illinois, but they are also contrary to the Constitution of the United States and to the 14th Amendment thereof.\n\n'Said act concerning local improvements, said ordinance, which is the basis of the present proceedings, and all documents and orders relating thereto, are contrary to the Constitution of the United States, and to the 14th Amendment thereof, because such act, ordinance, document, and orders seek to deprive objector of property without due process of law. \n\n[202 U.S. 275, 279]\n\u00a0\n 'Said ordinance and proceedings are in other respects illegal, unconstitutional, and void.\n\n'The proceedings herein and said act are contrary to the Constitution of the United States, and to the 14th Amendment thereof, because the petitioner herein, under and by virtue of said act and of said proceedings, seeks to deprive these objectors of their property without due process of law. Said proceedings and said act are also contrary to the Constitution of the United States, and to the 14th Amendment thereof, for the reasons set forth in the several foregoing objections.'\n\n The case came on for hearing before the court, the right of a jury on the question of benefits having been expressly waived.\n Petitioner (defendant in error) introduced the petition, assessment roll, and notice. They were received in evidence, though objected to as not complying with or meeting the requirements of the statute.\n Plaintiff in error, to sustain the issues 'on the question of the legal objections,' offered in evidence the various resolutions and proceedings before the board of local improvements. They are set out in the record, but it is not necessary to quote them. No other evidence was offered. The court overruled the objections.\n On the question of benefits the same evidence was offered by the respective parties. Plaintiff in error objected to the documents offered by the city, on the ground that the ordinance was illegal and void, because the first resolution of the board of local improvements in regard to assessments did not contain an itemized estimate of the cost of the improvements, made by the engineer, in the manner and form required by the statute.\n The objection was overruled and the assessment confirmed, with some modification, not necessary to notice. The judgment was affirmed by the supreme court of the state.\n The bill of exceptions shows that plaintiff in error did not bring to the attention of the trial court that the act of the state under which the assessment was made, or any of the proceed- \n\n[202 U.S. 275, 280]\n\u00a0\n ings were contrary to the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, nor did he assign as error on appeal to the supreme court that the rulings of the trial court or its judgments infringed that amendment.\n All the questions submitted to the supreme court and all the questions passed on by it depended upon the construction of the statute or the compliance of the proceedings with the statute, except that it was contended that the sections of the act which provided for the division of the assessment into instalments and the issue of bonds to anticipate the payment of the instalments, to bear 5 per cent interest, was unconstitutional, in that the legislature had no power to fix the rate of interest, and that by so doing a lower rate of interest was prevented, and plaintiff in error thereby deprived of his property without due process of law. The court decided against both contentions, holding that 'the legislature had the right to fix the rate of interest which said instalments and bonds when issued should bear,' and  42 and 86 of the local improvement act 'are not in conflict with the Constitution.' That is, the Constitution of the state.\n We do not think that the plaintiff in error complied with  709 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 575), in setting up a right under the Constitution of the United States. The mere claim in the objections to the confirming of the assessment, never afterwards brought to the attention of the trial court or of the supreme court, was not sufficient. There is no evidence in the record to show that the decision of either of the courts was invoked by plaintiff in error upon a right claimed under the Constitution of the United States.\n It is urged that in the writ of error and petition for citation it is stated that certain rights and privileges were claimed under the Constitution of the United States, and that the supreme court of the state of Illinois decided against such rights and privileges, and, it is further urged, that the chief justice of the court allowed the writ of error. This is not sufficient. Marvin v. Trout, \n199 \nU.S. 212, 223\n, 50 S. L. ed. --, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 31. \n\n[202 U.S. 275, 281]\n\u00a0\n Nor was a right under the Constitution of the United States necessarily involved in the determination of the cause. And the supreme court was justified by its rulings in omitting the consideration of rights under the Constitution of the United States. According to the practice of the court, an error not assigned is not open to review. Berry v. Chicago, 192 Ill. 154, 155, 61 N. E. 498. Errors assigned, but not noticed or relied on in the brief or argument of counsel, will be regarded as waived or abandoned. Keyes v. Kimmel, 186 Ill. 109, 114, 57 N. E. 851. And such rule of practice will be recognized by this court. Erie R. Co. v. Purdy, \n185 \nU.S. 148, 153\n, 46 S. L. ed. 847, 850, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 605. It follows that this court has not jurisdiction of this writ of error. Oxley Stave Co. v. Butler County, \n166 U.S. 648\n, 41 L. ed. 1149, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 709; Capital City Dairy Co. v.

That the company knew or could have known, by the exercise of reasonable care, that the cattle had infectious germs when unloaded, having been brought from an infected district, in conflict with well-known quarantine laws.\n A general demurrer was interposed by defendant and overruled.\n After an answer of general denial the defendant filed an amended answer:\n'Further answering herein, the defendant says that the claims of the plaintiff herein asserted are based upon a certain alleged act of Congress of the United States of America approved February 2, 1903, entitled 'An Act to Enable the Secretary of Agriculture to More Effectually Suppress and Prevent the Spread of Contagious and Infectious Diseases of Live Stock, and for Other Purposes,' which act is published and contained in volume 32, United States Statutes at Large, beginning at page 791, chapter 349, and also in a supplement to the United States Compiled Statutes issued in 1903, by the West Publishing Company, St. Paul, Minnesota, beginning at page 372 of said volume (U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1905, p. 613), and said claims are further based upon certain alleged regulations adopted and promulgated by the Secretary of Agriculture on March 13, 1903, pursuant to the authority attempted to be conferred upon him by said alleged act of Congress above mentioned, approved February 2, 1903.\n\n'The defendant says that said act of Congress hereinbefore mentioned, and said regulations adopted by the Secretary of Agriculture, as hereinbefore stated, are each and all of them repugnant to and in contravention of the Constitution of the United States of America, and in excess of the powers of Congress and of the Secretary of Agriculture under the Con- \n\n[203 U.S. 514, 516]\n\u00a0\n stitution of the United States, and they are each and all, therefore, unconstitutional and void, and, under the Constitution of the United States, this defendant has the right, privilege, and immunity of being exempt from the assertion or prosecution of any claims against it based upon or arising under such act of Congress or said regulation, or any of them, and this defendant, as permitted by  709 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 575), hereby specially sets up and claims and pleads in defense of this action the right and privilege and immunity which is secured to it by the Constitution of the United States, to be exempt from all suits and prosecutions and all claims against it based upon or arising under such unconstitutional and void act of Congress and regulations adopted or promulgated by the Secretary of Agriculture.'\n\n A demurrer was filed by the plaintiff to the amended answer.\n The plaintiff filed an amended petition, the affirmative allegations of which were controverted.\n This amended petition sets forth:\n'The plaintiff, J. U. McKendree, comes, and by leave of the court amends his petition, and says that the defendant, Illinois Central Railroad Company, on the 13th day of June, 1903, received one car of cattle at Grand Junction, Tennessee, to be transported to the town of Arlington, Kentucky, and on the 13th day of said month unloaded them in the stock pens in said town.\n\n'That the town of Arlington is a small town, located on defendant's road in this, Carlisle county, and defendant's stock pens are located adjacent to the public highway and commons, and that Grand Junction, Tennessee, is located on defendant's road and south of the quarantine line that was established on the 14th day of March, 1903, by and under the existing quarantine laws, and that said quarantine line, 'beginning on the Mississippi river, at the southeast corner of the state of Missouri, at the western boundary of Tennessee.' [Here follows a description of the quarantine line through the body of the state of Tennessee as set forth in amendment No. 4 to B. A. I., \n\n[203 U.S. 514, 517]\n\u00a0\n Order No. 107.] And that the defendants received said cattle south of said quarantine line, and transported them north and out of a quarantine district, and south of the said quarantine line, and transported them north through the state of Tennessee into this county and state, and unloaded them in the town of Arlington, and placed them in their stock pens adjacent to the public highway and commons, where plaintiff's cows came in contact with the germ of Texas cow fever that said cattle had on them when put in the pens as aforesaid; that said stock pens were suffered and permitted to remain open and exposed to cattle after the removal of said cattle, without disinfecting, or any other effort to protect exposed stock, and plaintiff's cows contracted Texas cow fever from said germs produced from said cattle while in said stock pens, to the damage of plaintiff.\n\n'Wherefore he prays as in his original petition.'\n\n The court sustained the demurrer to the amended answer of the defendant, and upon the issue joined, the case was sent to the jury. A verdict and judgment were rendered against the railroad company, and in favor of the plaintiff below.\n There was no dispute as to the transportation of the cattle from a point south of the quarantine line to a point north thereof, and the placing of them in pens at Arlington. The court, over the defendant's objection, submitted the case to the jury upon the questions of whether the transported cattle were infected, and, if so, whether the plaintiff's cattle contracted the disease from them while they were in the pens of the defendant company at Arlington.\n The presiding judge of the Carlisle circuit court filed the following certificate:\n'I, R. J. Bugg, sole presiding judge of the circuit court of Carlisle county, in the state of Kentucky, now and at the time of the trial of the above entitled cause, do hereby certify:\n\n'That, upon the trial of said cause, the defendant, Illinois Central Railroad Company, relied for its defense upon certain rights, privileges, and immunities specially claimed by it under \n\n[203 U.S. 514, 518]\n\u00a0\n the Constitution of the United States of America, and it insisted upon its said rights, privileges, and immunities throughout the trial of said action, and in the assertion of them it claimed and contended that the various regulations and orders made and promulgated by the Secretary of Agriculture, and offered in evidence on behalf of the plaintiff herein over the objections of defendant, were unconstitutional, null, and void, as being in excess of the powers conferred, or which could be conferred, by act of Congress upon the Secretary of Agriculture under the Constitution of the United States of America, and that the said act of Congress, approved February 2, 1903, under which the Secretary of Agriculture assumed to promulgate said orders and regulations, was itself unconstitutional, null, and void, as being in conflict with the Constitution of the United States of America, and in excess of the powers conferred by it upon the Congress.\n\n'Said defendant, Illinois Central Railroad Company, further contended throughout the trial of said cause that no right of action against it accrued to the plaintiff by reason of any of the alleged regulations or orders made or promulgated by the Secretary of Agriculture, and offered in evidence upon the trial of this action, or by reason of the alleged failure on the part of the defendant to observe or to comply with any of said regulations or orders, off the ground that the said regulations or orders did not assume or attempt to give, and that the said act of Congress did not assume or attempt to give, to the plaintiff herein, or to any other in like situation, a remedy by way of civil action against the defendant herein for its alleged breach of any of said regulations or orders made or promulgated by the Secretary of Agriculture, and throughout the trial of said action the defendant, Illinois Central Railroad Company, specially set up and claimed, even if said act of Congress and said regulations and orders were valid under the Constitution and laws of the United States, still it had a right, privilege, or immunity under the said act of Congress or the said regulations or orders, from any liability to the plain- \n\n[203 U.S. 514, 519]\n\u00a0\n tiff, J. U. McKendree, in a civil action for damages claimed on account of its alleged breach of said regulations or orders.\n\n'In allowing the said regulations or orders of the Secretary of Agriculture to be given in evidence before the jury, and in overruling the motion of defendant to peremptorily instruct the jury to return a verdict in its favor, the Carlisle circuit court disallowed the various contentions made as above stated on behalf of the Illinois Central Railroad Company, and denied the claims made by it of the rights, privileges, or immunities specially claimed by it as above stated, and held that the various claims made by it were not well founded in law under the Constitution and laws of the United States of America, and the claims of the plaintiff herein were established and a judgment in his favor rendered solely by reason of defendant's alleged breach of said regulations and orders.'\n\n The testimony tended to show that the cows of the plaintiff came in contact with cattle transported by the railroad company from a point south of the quarantine line set forth in the amended petition.\n On March 13, 1903, the Secretary of Agriculture, acting under cover of the act of February 2, 1903 (32 Stat. at L. 791, chap. 349, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1905, p. 613), entitled 'An Act to Enable the Secretary of Agriculture to More Effectually Suppress and Prevent the Spread of Contagious and Infectious Diseases of Live Stock, and for Other Purposes,' established a quarantine line from west to east throughout the United States, from California to Maryland, and forbidding the transportation of cattle from points south of the line to points north of the line, except in the manner in the said order specified.\n Section 9 of the order provided: '9. Violation of these regulations is punishable by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars nor more than one thousand dollars, or by imprisonment not more than one year, or by both such fine and imprisonment.'\n By amendment of March 14, 1904, the Secretary of Agriculture adopted as a quarantine line a line running from west \n\n[203 U.S. 514, 520]\n\u00a0\n to east of the state of Tennessee, from the south of which the cattle said to have infected those of the plaintiff were transported and placed in pens in a manner not in conformity with the order.\n Messrs. J. M. Dickinson, Edmund F. Trabue, and Blewett Lee for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[203 U.S. 514, 522]\n\u00a0\n Attorney General Moody, Solicitor General Hoyt, and Assistant Attorney General McReynolds for the United States.\n No brief was filed for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[203 U.S. 514, 524]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n The government objects to the jurisdiction of this court to entertain the writ of error upon the ground that no Federal question is raised within the intent and meaning of  709 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 575). But we are of opinion that such questions were raised, and that we are required upon this record to review the judgment of the state court.\n An inspection of the record shows that the case as made by the plaintiff below upon the amended petition was to recover damages for the infection of his cattle because of coming in contact with cattle transported by the railroad company from a point south to a point north of the quarantine line established by the Secretary of Agriculture, in a manner violative of regulations for the transportation and keeping of cattle established by the Secretary's order.\n It was not an action to recover for negligence upon common-law principles. The complaint was amended in such form as to count upon the supposed right of action accruing to the \n\n[203 U.S. 514, 525]\n\u00a0\n plaintiff because of the violation of the Department's order. The demurrer of the plaintiff to the answer of the railroad company, setting forth the unconstitutionality of the law and the action of the Secretary thereunder, was sustained.\n The certificate of the court below is given as to the extent and character of the Federal rights and immunities claimed by the defendant and clearly states that the defendant alleged the unconstitutionality of the statute and order, that the order was in excess of the power given the Secretary, and that the statute gave no remedy in damages.\n The court left the case to the jury under instructions to find a verdict for the plaintiff if it had been shown that the plaintiff's cattle were infected by coming in contact with those transported by the railroad company. It therefore necessarily decided that the act was constitutional and gave a right to recover damages for breach of the requirements of the Secretary made in pursuance thereof, and that the Secretary's order was not in excess of the statutory power given. The amended complaint, as we have said, counted upon the liability in this form. The traverse of the amended complaint made the issue. The certificate did not originate the Federal question. 'It is elementary that the certificate of a court of last resort of a state may not import a Federal question into a record, where otherwise such question does not arise; it is equally elementary that such a certificate may serve to elucidate the determination whether a Federal question exists.' Rector v. City Deposit Bank Co. \n200 U.S. 405\n- 412, 50 L. ed. 527-529, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 289, 290; Marvin v. Trout, \n199 \nU.S. 212, 223\n, 50 S. L. ed. 157, 161, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 31.\n This case comes within the principle decided in Nutt v. Knut, \n200 U.S. 12\n, 50 L. ed. 348, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 216, in which the court said:\n'A party who insists that a judgment cannot be rendered against him consistently with the statutes of the United States may be fairly held, within the meaning of  709, to assert a right and immunity under such statutes, although the statutes may not give the party himself a personal or affirmative right that could be enforced by direct suit against his ad- \n\n[203 U.S. 514, 526]\n\u00a0\n versary. Such has been the view taken in many cases where the authority of this court to review the final judgment of the state courts was involved. Logan County Nat. Bank v. Townsend, \n139 U.S. 67\n, 35 L. ed. 107, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 496; Dubuque & S. C. R. Co. v. Richmond, 15 Wall. 3, 21 L. ed. 118; Swope v. Leffingwell, \n105 U.S. 3\n, 26 L. ed. 939; Anderson v.

Kennedy, \n167 U.S. 362\n, 42 L. ed. 198, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 831.'\n\n To the same effect is Rector v. City Deposit Bank Co., supra.\n Upon this record, read in the light of the certificate, we think the defendant raised Federal questions as to the constitutionality of the law, and, if constitutional, whether the Secretary's order was within the power therein conferred, and the right to a personal action for damages, in such manner as to give this court jurisdiction of them under  709, Rev. Stat.\n The railroad company, by the proceedings and judgment in this case, was denied the alleged Federal rights and immunities specially set up in the proceedings, in the enforcement of a statute and departmental orders averred to be beyond the constitutional power of Congress and the authority of the Secretary of Agriculture, and in the rendition of a judgment for damages in an action under the statute and order, in opposition to the insistence of the defendant that, even if constitutional, the statute did not confer such power or authorize a judgment for damages.\n The constitutional objections urged to the validity of the statute of February 2, 1903, and the Secretary's order, No. 107, purporting to be made under authority of the statute, raise questions of far-reaching importance as to the power of Congress to authorize the head of an executive department of the government to make orders of this character, alleged to be an attempted delegation of the legislative power solely vested by the Constitution in Congress. These questions, it is suggested by the counsel for the government, have become \n\n[203 U.S. 514, 527]\n\u00a0\n academic by reason of the passage of the later act of March 3, 1905, to enable the Secretary of Agriculture to establish and maintain quarantine districts, to permit and regulate the movement of cattle and other live stock therefrom, and for other purposes. 33 Stat. at L. 1264, chap. 1496, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1905, p. 617.\n But we are of opinion that it is unnecessary to determine them in this case. We think the defendant was right in the contention that, if the act of February 2, 1903, was constitutional, and rightfully conferred the power upon the Secretary of Agriculture to make orders and regulations concerning interstate commerce, there was no power conferred upon the Secretary to make regulations concerning intrastate commerce, over which Congress has no control, and concerning which we do not think this act, if it could be otherwise sustained, intended to confer power upon him. Assuming, then, for this purpose, that the Secretary was legally authorized to make orders and regulations concerning interstate commerce, we find that on March 13, 1903, he adopted, in the order No. 107, the following regulation:\n'2. Whenever any state or territory located above or below said quarantine line, as above designated, shall duly establish a different quarantine line, and obtain the necessary legislation to enforce said lastmentioned line strictly and completely within the boundaries of said state or territory, and said last above-mentioned line and the measures taken to enforce it are satisfactory to the Secretary of Agriculture, he may, by a special order, temporarily adopt said state or territory line.\n\n'Said adoption will apply only to that portion of said line specified, and may cease at any time the Secretary may deem it best for the interests involved, and in no instance shall said modification exist longer than the period specified in said special order; and, at the expiration of such time, said quarantine line shall revert, without further order, to the line first above described. \n\n[203 U.S. 514, 528]\n\u00a0\n 'Whenever any state or territory shall establish a quarantine line, for above purposes, differently located from the above described line, and shall obtain by legislation the necessary laws to enforce the same completely and strictly, and shall desire a modification of the Federal quarantine line to agree with such state or territory line, the proper authorities of such state or territory shall forward to the Secretary of Agriculture a true map or description of such line and a copy of the laws for enforcement of the same, duly authenticated and certified.'\n\n And afterward, on March 14, 1903, the Secretary adopted the quarantine line agreed to be established by the state of Tennessee, and said to run about the middle of the state, and from the south of which the cattle in this case were transported, and provided:\n'And whereas said quarantine line, as above set forth, is satisfactory to this Department, and legislation has been enacted by the state of Tennessee to enforce said quarantine line, therefore the above line is adopted for the state of Tennessee by this Department for the period beginning with the date of this order and ending December 31, 1903, in lieu of the quarantine line described in the order of March 13, 1903, for said area unless otherwise ordered.'\n\n The terms of order 107 apply to all cattle transported from the south of this line to parts of the United States north thereof. It would, therefore, include cattle transported within the state of Tennessee from the south of the line as well as those from outside that state; there is no exception in the order, and in terms it includes all cattle transported from the south of the line, whether within or without the state of Tennessee. It is urged by the government that it was not the intention of the Secretary to make provision for intrastate commerce, as the recital of the order shows an intention to adopt the state line, when the state by its legislature has passed the necessary laws to enforce the same completely and strictly. But the order in terms applies alike to inter- \n\n[203 U.S. 514, 529]\n\u00a0\n state and intrastate commerce. A party prosecuted for violating this order would be within its terms if the cattle were brought from the south of the line to a point north of the line within the state of Tennessee. It is true the Secretary recites that legislation has been passed by the state of Tennessee to enforce the quarantine line, but he does not limit the order to interstate commerce coming from the south of the line, and, as we have said, the order in terms covers it. We do not say that the state line might not be adopted in a proper case, in the exercise of Federal authority, if limited in its effect to interstate commerce coming from below the line, but that is not the present order, and we must deal with it as we find it. Nor have we the power to so limit the Secretary's order as to make it apply only to interstate commerce, which it is urged is all that is here involved. For aught that appears upon the face of the order, the Secretary intended it to apply to all commerce, and whether he would have made such an order, if strictly limited to interstate commerce, we have no means of knowing. The order is in terms single and indivisible. In United States v. Reese, \n92 \nU.S. 214, 221\n, 23 S. L. ed. 563, 565, upon this subject, this court said:\n'We are, therefore, directly called upon to decide whether a penal statute, enacted by Congress, with its limited powers, which is in general language broad enough to cover wrongful acts without as well as within the constitutional jurisdiction, can be limited by judicial construction so as to make it operate only on that which Congress may rightfully prohibit and punish. For this purpose we must take these sections of the statute as they are. We are not able to reject a part which is unconstitutional and retain the remainder, because it is not possible to separate that which is unconstitutional, if there be any such, from that which is not. The proposed effect is not to be attained by striking out or disregarding words that are in the section, but by inserting those that are not now there. Each of the sections must stand as a whole, or fall altogether. The language is plain. There is no room for construction, \n\n[203 U.S. 514, 530]\n\u00a0\n unless it be as to the effect of the Constitution. The question, then, to be determined, is whether we can introduce words of limitation into a penal statute so as to make it specific, when, as expressed, it is general only.'\n\n And the court declined to make such limitation.\n And in Trade-Mark Cases, \n100 \nU.S. 82, 99\n, 25 S. L. ed. 550, 553, the court said:\n'If we should, in the case before us, undertake to make, by judicial construction, a law which Congress did not make, it is quite probable we should do what, if the matter were now before that body, it would be unwilling to do; namely, make a trademark law which is only partial in its operation, and which would complicate the rights which parties would hold, in some instances, under the act of Congress, and in others under state law. Cooley, Const. Lim. 178, 179; Com. v. Hitchings, 5 Gray, 482.'\n\n And see United States v. Ju Toy, \n198 \nU.S. 253, 262\n, 49 S. L. ed. 1040, 1043, 1044, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 644.\n We think these principles apply to the case at bar, and that this order of the Secretary, undertaking to make a stringent regualtion with highly penal consequences, is single in character, and includes commerce wholly within the state, thereby exceeding any authority which Congress intended to confer upon him by the act in question, if the same is a valid enactment. We, therefore, find it unnecessary to pass upon the other questions which were thought to be involved in the case at bar.\n The judgment of the state court will be reversed and the cause remanded to it for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Mr. Justice McKenna concurs in the result. \n\n\n\n","80":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nIN RE LINCOLN(1906)\nNo. 21\nArgued: Decided: May 14, 1906\n\n\n\n The petitioner was convicted in the district court for the district of Nebraska on an indictment charging that he did 'wrongfully and unlawfully introduce into Indian country, to wit, into and upon the Winnebago Indian reservation, a reservation set apart for the exclusive use and benefit of certain tribes of the Winnebago Indians, certain spirituous, vinous, malt, and other intoxicating liquors.\n Upon this conviction he was sentenced to pay a fine of $100 and the costs of prosecution, and to be imprisoned in the jail of Douglas county, Nebraska, for the term of sixty days, and until said fine and costs were paid. The imprisonment commenced on February 19, 1906. Without pursuing his remedy by writ of error, the petitioner, on April 2, 1906, filed in this court his application for a writ of habeas corpus, alleging that the United States has no police power or Jurisdiction over the Winnebago reservation, and that the law under which the \n\n[202 U.S. 178, 179]\n\u00a0\n indictment was drawn is unconstitutional and void in so far as it applies to the said Winnebago reservation, and that the United States district court was wholly without jurisdiction in the premises. The indictment was found under the act of Congress of January 30, 1897. 29 Stat. at L. 506, chap. 109. April 30, 1906, the case was submitted on petition, return, and a stipulation of facts.\n Messrs. Thomas L. Sloan and Williamson S. Summers for petitioner.\n Solicitor General Hoyt for respondent.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Brewer:\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n The sixty days named as the term of imprisonment had expired before the case was submitted, and, indeed, had almost expired before the application was made for the writ. There is nothing to show whether the fine and costs have been collected upon execution, as the sentence authorizes. If not so collected, and if they cannot be collected, then, though possibly still in jail, he can shortly be discharged on taking the poor debtor's oath. Rev. Stat.  1042, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 724. This section authorizes a discharge after a confinement of thirty days on account of the nonpayment of fine and costs. So that within ninety days from February 19, the time the sentence took effect, the petitioner can secure his discharge either by paying the fine and costs, or by taking the poor debtor's oath, as above stated.\n In Ex parte Baez, \n177 U.S. 378\n, 44 L. ed. 813, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 673, which was an application for a writ of habeas corpus, it appeared that before a return to the writ could be made, or other action taken, the restraint of which the petitioner complained would terminate, and it was held that the application for the writ should be denied. lndeed, the case at bar in principle is not unlike Mills v. Green, \n159 U.S. 651\n, 40 L. ed. 293, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 132; Flour Inspectors v. Glover, \n160 U.S. 170\n, 40 L. ed. 382, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 321; Kimball v. Kimball, \n174 U.S. 158\n, 43 L. ed. 932, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 639; and Jones v. Montague, \n\n[202 U.S. 178, 180]\n\u00a0\n \n194 U.S. 147\n, 48 L. ed. 913, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 611, in each of which, intermediate the ruling below and the time for decision here, events had happened which prevented the granting of the relief sought, and the appeals or writs of error were dismissed on the ground that this court did not spend its time in deciding a moot case.\n While the full jurisdiction of this court in habeas corpus may be conceded, there is in every case a question whether the exercise of such jurisdiction is appropriate. In Ex parte Royall, \n117 U.S. 241\n, 29 L. ed. 868, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 734, Royall, who was held under state process for trial on an indictment charging an offense against the laws of the state, filed his petition in habeas corpus in the circuit court of the United States, praying release from that custody. The circuit court refused to order his discharge, and from its ruling he appealed, and at the same time filed an original petition in this court. P. 254, 29 L. ed. 872, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 734. The question was fully considered, and it was held that while the Federal courts, circuit and Supreme, had jurisdiction in the premises, there was a discretion whether in any case, a writ should be issued, Mr. Justice Harlan, speaking for the court, saying (p. 251, 29 L. ed. 871, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 740):\n'That discretion should be exercised in the light of the relations existing under our system of government, between the judicial tribunals of the Union and of the states, and in recognition of the fact that the public good requires that those relations be not disturbed by unnecessary conflict between courts equally bound to guard and protect rights secured by the Constitution. When the petitioner is in custody by state authority for an act done or omitted to be done in pursuance of a law of the United States, or of an order, process, or decree of a court or judge thereof; or where, being a subject or citizen of a foreign state, and domiciled therein, he is in custody, under like authority, for an act done or omitted under any alleged right, title, authority, privilege, protection, or exemption claimed under the commission or order or sanction of any foreign state, or under color thereof, the validity and effect whereof depend upon the law of nations,-in such and like cases of urgency, involving the authority and operations of the gen- \n\n[202 U.S. 178, 181]\n\u00a0\n eral government, or the obligations of this country to, or its relations with, foreign nations, the courts of the United States have frequently interposed by writs of habeas corpus, and discharged prisoners who were held in custody under state authority.'\n\n And again, after commenting on the relations of state and national courts (p. 252, 29 L. ed. 872, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 741):\n'That these salutary principles may have full operation, and in harmony with what we suppose was the intention of Congress in the enactments in question, this court holds that where a person is in custody, under process from a state court of original jurisdiction, for an alleged offense against the laws of such state, and it is claimed that he is restrained of his liberty in violation of the Constitution of the United States, the circuit court has a discretion whether it will discharge him upon habeas corpus in advance of his trial in the court in which he is indicted; that discretion, however, to be subordinated to any special circumstances requiring immediate action. When the state court shall have finally acted upon the case, the circuit court has still a discretion whether, under all the circumstances then existing, the accused, if convicted, shall be put to his writ of error from the highest court of the state, or whether it will proceed by writ of habeas corpus summarily to determine whether the petitioner is restrained of his liberty in violation of the Constitution of the United States.'\n\n The propositions thus laid down have been upheld by repeated decisions of this court.

California, \n168 U.S. 640\n, 42 L. ed. 610, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 242; Whitney v. Dick. \n202 U.S. 132\n, 50 L. ed. --, 26 Sup. Ct.

Several of these cases, it is true, were applications for habeas corpus prior to final decisions in the lower courts, and the refusal of the writs was based partly, at least, upon the proposition that the orderly administration of justice would be better subserved by declining to exercise our jurisdiction until the conclusion of the proceedings below. in Ex parte Mirzan, however, this court declined to issue a writ of habeas corpus after a conviction, holding that it might be issued by the proper circuit court, and that application should be made to that court except in cases where there were some special circumstances making immediate action by this court necessary or expedient. In the case at bar, if there was any error in the proceedings of the trial court, it could have been corrected by writ of error from the court of appeals, and no reason is given why that remedy should not have been pursued, except the request of the district judge, who decided the \n\n[202 U.S. 178, 183]\n\u00a0\n case. Reference is made to a decision of the court of appeals of the eighth circuit (Re Boyd, 1 C. C. A. 156, 4 U. S. App. 73, 49 Fed. 48), but that only announced the doctrine of some of the cases cited above,-that ordinarily, prior to final judgment a writ of habeas corpus ought not to be issued.\n It is true that we issued a writ of habeas corpus in a case in some respects like the present (Re Heff, \n197 U.S. 488\n, 49 L. ed. 848, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 506), and it is relied upon by petitioner as authority for this application; but it was shown in that case that there was a direct conflict between the state and local Federal courts in the precise point of law involved, each asserting jurisdiction over the same offense; that the court of appeals had already decided the question adversely to the contention of petitioner, so that a writ of error from that court would have accomplished nothing; and further, that the matter involved opened up inquiry into questions of great significance affecting the respective jurisdiction of the nation and the states over large numbers of Indians. There were special reasons, therefore, for our issuing a writ of habeas corpus and investigating the matter in that case. But it does not follow from the action then taken that it is necessary or proper for this court to issue a habeas corpus in every case involving the question of the legality of a sale of liquor to Indians or the bringing of liquor into the Indian country. It is enough that the cases be disposed of in the orderly and customary mode of procedure. It may be assumed that the trial courts will follow the rulings of this court, and if there be, in any case, a departure therefrom, the proper appellate court will correct the error. To permit every petty criminal case to be brought directly to this court upon habeas corpus, on the ground of an alleged misconception or disregard of our decisions, would be a grievous misuse of our time, which should be devoted to a consideration of the more important legal and constitutional questions which are constantly arising and calling for our determination.\n For these reasons the petition for a writ of habeas corpus is denied. \n\n\n\n","81":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nIN RE MORAN(1906)\n\nArgued: October 15, 1906Decided: November 5, 1906\n\n\n\n\n[203 U.S. 96, 97]\n\u00a0\n Messrs.

A rule to show cause was issued and the case \n\n[203 U.S. 96, 103]\n\u00a0\n was heard on the petition and answer. The various grounds upon which the petition is supported are alleged to go to the jurisdiction of the trial court. Ex parte Harding, \n120 U.S. 782\n, 30 L. ed. 824, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 780. See New v. Oklahoma, \n195 U.S. 252\n, 49 L. ed. 182, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 68. A writ of habeas corpus for the same causes was heard by the circuit court of appeals and discharged. Ex parte Moran, 144 Fed. 594. The judgment also was affirmed by the supreme court of the territory in which the petitioner was tried. 14 Okla. 544, 78 Pac. 111.\n The petitioner was tried in the district court for Comanche county in the territory of Oklahoma. The first ground now relied upon is that the court was not duly organized under the act of Congress requiring the supreme court to define the judicial districts, and to fix the times and places at each county seat where the district court shall be held. The order of the supreme court went no further in the way of fixing the place than to specify Lawton for the county of Comanche. This order was made on January 15, 1902, about six months after the land, which had been Indian territory, was opened for settlement and the county created. At that time and at the time of the trial there were no county or court buildings in the county. The order of the supreme court was as precise as the circumstances permitted it to be, and the failure to specify a building did not go to the jurisdiction of the trial court. There is no pretense that the petitioner lost any opportunities by reason of no building being named.\n The next ground argued is that the laws of the territory were not followed in the selection of the grand jury, because the persons selected were not elecors of the territory, and some of them were nonresidents, with other subordinate matters. The order for the summons stated the reason, which was that there had been no election held in the county, and there were no names of jurors in the jury box; whereupon the presiding judge ordered the sheriff to summon twenty persons from the body of the county. We have heard no answer to the material portion of the reasoning of the circuit court of appeals \n\n[203 U.S. 96, 104]\n\u00a0\n upon this point. If the legislature of Oklahoma had prescribed the method of selection followed, that method would not have violated the Constitution or any law or treaty of the United States. If it did prescribe a different one, a departure from that was a violation of the territorial enactment alone. The acts of the legislature of Oklahoma are not laws of the United States within the meaning of Rev. Stat.  753, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 592. If any laws have been violated it is the latter one. Therefore the petitioner is not entitled to release on this ground under Rev. Stat.  753. The 5th Amendment, requiring the presentment or indictment of a grand jury, does not take up unto itself the local law as to how the grand jury should be made up, and raise the latter to a constitutional requirement. See Rawlins v. Georgia, \n201 U.S. 638\n, 50 L. ed. 899, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 560. It is unnecessary to consider whether the judge went beyond his powers under the circumstances. See Clawson v. United States, \n114 U.S. 477\n, 29 L. ed. 179, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 949. But it is proper to add that while the reason which we have given is logically the first to be considered by this court, we do not mean to give any countenance to the notion that, if the law was disobeyed, it affected the jurisdiction of the court. Ex parte Harding, \n120 U.S. 782\n, 30 L. ed. 824, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 780; Re Wilson, \n140 U.S. 575\n, 35 L. ed. 513, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 870.\n The third ground on which the jurisdiction of the trial court is denied is that, on August 4, 1901, the date of the commission of the crime, the place was within territory not embraced in any organized county, and was attached for judicial purposes to Canadian county. By the Oklahoma organic act, May 2, 1890, chap. 182,  9 (26 Stat. at L. 85, 86), this is provided for, and by  10 such offenses shall be tried in the county to which the territory 'shall be attached.' It is argued that there had been no law passed changing the place of trial or affecting the order of the supreme court attaching the territory to Canadian county. But the very words quoted from  10 look to the state of things at the time of trial. At that time Comanche county had been organized, and a term of court fixed for it by the order of the supreme court dated January 15, 1902. The meaning of this order, so far as the \n\n[203 U.S. 96, 105]\n\u00a0\n power of the supreme court went, is plain. The statute gave the petitioner no vested right to be tried in Canadian county, and his trial in Comanche county conformed to its intent. See Post v. United States, \n161 U.S. 583\n, 40 L. ed. 816, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 611.\n The fourth ground is that, as the crime was committed on August 4, 1901, two days before the opening of the land for settlement, the place was still under the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States, and therefore the crime was punishable under Rev. Stat.  5339, U. S. Comp. Stat, 1901, p. 3627, alone. The order of the President with regard to the conditions of settlement and entry are referred to as confirming the argument. But those orders were intended merely to carry out the acts of Congress governing the matter. There is no doubt that congress was exercising control so far as settlement was concerned. But there is equally little doubt that the title to the territory had passed, that it had become part of the territory of Oklahoma, and, as such, no longer under the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States within Rev. Stat.  5339. Act of May 2, 1890, chap. 182,  1,4,6,26 Stat. at L. 81; act of June 6, 1900, chap. 813, 31 Stat. at L. 677; act of March 3, 1901, chap. 846, 31 Stat. at L. 1093. See Bates v.

Therefore the application of the territorial statute was not excluded and the murder was a violation of the territorial law.\n Finally it is contended that the petitioner was compelled to be a witness against himself, contrary to the 5th Amendment, because he was compelled to stand up and walk before the jury, and because, during a recess, the jury was stationed so as to observe his size and walk. If this was an error, as to which we express no opinion, it did not go to the jurisdiction of the court. Felts v. Murphy, \n201 U.S. 123\n, 50 L. ed. 689, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 366.\n Rule discharged.

Morse and William M. Richardson for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. G. Philip Wardner and Edward E. Blodgett for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is an action on contract brought in the circuit court of the United States for the district of Massachusetts, for rent alleged to be due under the terms of a lease made by Henry Parkman and others to the Broadway National Bank.\n The original lessors sold the land and building leased to the International Trust Company, plaintiff in error. Defendant \n\n[203 U.S. 364, 365]\n\u00a0\n in error is agent of the shareholders of the Broadway National Bank.\n The premises leased were the first floor of the building and the basement under the same, 'to be used as the business offices of said corporation and for no other purpose.' The lease contained a provision for re-entry upon breach of any covenant. 'And there-upon the lessors may, at their discretion, relet the premises, at the risk of the lessee, who shall remain for the residue of said term responsible for the rent herein reserved, and shall be credited with such amounts only as shall be by the lessors actually realized.'\n On December 16, 1899, the bank became insolvent, and the Comptroller of the Currency appointed a receiver. On February 15, 1900, the Comptroller released the estate of the bank to defendant in error as the stockholders' agent. Between December 16, 1899, and January 5, 1900, the trust company entered upon the premises and repossessed itself of the same as of its former estate. The receiver occupied the premises for a while, but it was stipulated that such occupation was not to affect the rights of the parties. Defendant in error occupied the premises until May 19, 1900. He contended in defense of the action that upon the termination of the lease it was the duty of the trust company to use all reasonable effort to relet the premises, so as to minimize the damages, and that the company had not done so. And further, that suitable and responsible parties were willing at various times to hire the premises at a rent as great or greater than the rent reserved in the lease.\n At the first trial of the case the circuit court took the opposite of defendant in error's contention, and held that, by force of the lease, the trust company did not assume any risk, and was only required to use its discretion 'with some degree of reasonableness and with some degree of justice, and have some regard to the rights of the position of the other parties concerned.' The court further held that the evidence did not show that the company had abused its discretion, and \n\n[203 U.S. 364, 366]\n\u00a0\n directed a verdict for it, less certain payments made by the occupant of the basement, formerly the bank's tenant. This was reversed by the circuit court of appeals. 60 C. C. A. 236, 125 Fed. 371. The latter court held that a lessor had the right to re-enter and might exercise his discretion to relet the premises at the risk of the lessee. The lessor, it was said, need not go through the form of reletting, but an honest and reasonable attempt to relet should be made, and whether so made was a question for the jury.\n Upon the second trial of the case in the circuit court the trust company expressed its contentions in requests for instructions to the jury as follows: (1) That it was entitled to rent the premises and relet them at the risk of the bank; (2) that there was no obligation upon it to notify the bank of its election so to do, or to relet the premises or attempt to relet them. The court declined to give the instructions, but instructed the jury in accordance with the principle expressed by the circuit court of appeals. The jury returned a verdict for defendant in error, upon which judgment was duly entered. It was affirmed by the circuit court of appeals.\n\n\n (1)\n It is objected by defendant in error that the circuit court had no jurisdiction of this action. We think otherwise. The action is clearly one to wind up the affairs of the bank. Re Chetwood, \n165 \nU.S. 443, 459\n, 41 S. L. ed. 782, 787, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 385; Guarantee Co. v. Hanway, 44 C. C. A. 312, 104 Fed. 369.\n\n\n (2)\n The fact that the trust company did not make a reasonable effort to relet the premises was settled by the verdict of the jury against it, and the case is reduced to the simple question whether the company can recover by virtue of the provisions of the lease without any attempt whatsoever to relet the premises.\n It is said in argument that the provision in controversy has been found in the usual form of lease in Massachusetts for a generation, and yet its meaning, as now brought in dispute, has not come up for or received explicit decision. To this absence of contention and decision both parties refer with \n\n[203 U.S. 364, 367]\n\u00a0\n equal confidence to establish that their respective constructions have been so indisputable as never to have been questioned. However, there are some indications of a judgment between the two constructions in the case of Edmands v. Rust & R. Drug Co. 191 Mass. 123, 77 N. E. 713, which may be turned to in passing on a question so essentially local.\n The lease passed on contained a provision for an entry by the lessors to terminate the lease for the breach of covenants, followed by this language: 'But the lessee covenants to be responsible for any loss or diminution of rent sustained by the lessors in consequence till the end of the lease.' The defendant in the case requested instructions, expressing it to be the duty of the lessor to accept any tenant that was satisfactory financially to defendant. His instructions were refused, and the court instructed the jury, among other things, as follows: 'In general, the effort must be that which a reasonable landholder would make under the circumstances. Not every proposed tenant need be accepted, but an unreasonable refusal to accept a suitable tenant will be deemed an abandonment of the election to relet at the risk of the lessee.' Commenting on the instructions the supreme judicial court said that 'the jury were left to decide between the parties, in a way of which the defendant has no reason to complain.'\n It is manifest from this decision that the lessor, after entry, has not the absolute discretion to relet or not to relet the premises, but that it is his duty to 'prevent unnecessary loss or diminution of rent in consequence of the termination of the lease.'\n In Bowditch v. Raymond, 146 Mass. 109, 15 N. E. 285, the liability of the lessor, under the provision of a lease such as that in controversy, was denied against an insolvent lessee on the ground that it was dependent upon a contingency, not merely as to the amount of liability, but as to whether it would ever attach or arise out of the covenant. 'The lessors,' the court said, 'in their discretion might not relet the premises, but resume possession of them.' This case rests on the principle \n\n[203 U.S. 364, 368]\n\u00a0\n expressed by judge Lowell, speaking for the circuit court of appeals, that if the lessor avail himself of the covenant and re-enter he may exercise his discretion to relet the premises at risk of the lessee or occupy them. If he elect to relet he must make 'an honest and reasonable attempt to relet.' And this is a reasonable and just exaction. It is the spirit as well as the letter of the covenant, fulfilling its security without unnecessary loss to the lessee.\n Whether the bank could have made a lease to extend beyond its charter life we need not decide.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","83":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJAMES v. U S(1906)\nNo. 215\nArgued: Decided: May 21, 1906\n\n\n\n Messrs. Morgan H. Beach and A. A. Hoehling, Jr., for appellant.\n Assistant Attorney General Van Orsdel and Mr. Felix Brannigan for appellee. \n\n[202 U.S. 401, 402]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n Charles P. James was an associate justice of the supreme court of the District of Columbia. On December 1, 1892, being over seventy years of age and having served for more than ten years, he resigned his office. He died on August 8, 1899. This suit was brought by the administratrix of the estate of Justice James, on June 30, 1900, to recover $6,688.90, on the ground that the salary of Justice James at the time of his resignation was $ 5,000 per annum, and that, after his resignation and up to the time of his death, he was paid, under the provisions of Rev. Stat.  714, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 578, only at the rate of $4,000 per annum, upon the erroneous theory that that sum was the rate of salary fixed by law at the time of the resignation. From a judgment rejecting the claim (38 Ct. Cl. 615) this appeal was prosecuted.\n To comprehend the contentions pressed at bar it is necessary briefly to refer to the statutes fixing the salary of the justices of the supreme court of the District of Columbia in force at the time of, and after the date of, the resignation of Justice James.\n By the 2d section of the act of June 1, 1866 (14 Stat. at L. 55, chap. 104), the annual salary of the chief justice of the supreme court of the District of Columbia was fixed at $4,500, and of each associate justice at $ 4,000. This provision continued in force up to and including the fiscal year ending June 30, 1891. The act (26 Stat. at L. 947, chap. 541) making appropriations for judicial salaries, etc., for the fiscal year commencing July 1, 1891, and ending June 30, 1892, contained the following provision:\n'For salaries of the chief justice of the supreme coutr of the District of Columbia and the five associate judges, at the rate of five thousand dollars per annum each; thirty thousand dollars.'\n\n The law containing this provision had the enacting clause usually found in appropriation acts, declaring that the appro- \n\n[202 U.S. 401, 403]\n\u00a0\n priations were made in full compensation for the services of the fiscal year to which the acts related, and the last section or the act repealed all acts or parts of acts inconsistent or in conflict with its provisions. Under this act Justice James was paid for the fiscal year referred to a salary at the rate of $5,000 per annum.\n The appropriation act for the following fiscal year, commencing July 1, 1892, and ending June 30, 1893, contained an appropriation of a lump sum of $24,500 to pay the salaries of the chief justice and associate justices of the supreme court of the District of Columbia. [ 27 Stat. at L. 223, chap. 196.] The sum thus appropriated was only adequate to pay the salaries of the associate justices at the rate of $4,000 per annum each, and this act also contained the general enacting and concluding clauses above referred to.\n For the five months of the year covered by this last act, up to his resignation, viz., from July 1, 1892, to December 1, 1892, Justice James was paid at the rate of $4,000 per annum. Shortly after his resignation, before the expiration of the fiscal year covered by the lump appropriation for the year commencing July 1, 1892, and ending June 30, 1893, Congress, by the act of February 9, 1893 (27 Stat. at L. 436, chap. 74), created the court of appeals of the District of Columbia. By the terms of the act its provisions were not to take effect until April 3, 1893. It was provided in the 14th section of the act that 'justices of the supreme court of the District of Columbia shall hereafter receive an annual salary of five thousand dollars, each, payable quarterly at the Treasury of the United States.' As the lump appropriation made in the act above referred to for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1893, was adequate only to pay the salaries at the rate of $4,000 per annum, it followed that the existing appropriation was not adequate to pay the salaries of the justices of the supreme court of the District of Columbia at the rate of $5,000 per annum from the date fixed for the going into effect of the court of appeals act, that is, from April 3, 1893, to the end of the \n\n[202 U.S. 401, 404]\n\u00a0\n fiscal year. To remedy this, in the deficiency appropriation act of March 3, 1893 (27 Stat. at L. 653, chap. 210, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3349), there was appropriated a sum which added to the previous lump appropriation, was adequate to pay to the justices of the supreme court of the District a salary at the rate of $5,000 per annum from April 3, 1893, to the end of the fiscal year. For the following fiscal years, it is conceded, regular appropriations were made for the salaries of the justices of the supreme court of the District of Columbia at the rate of $ 5,000 per annum. The deficiency appropriation act of March 2, 1895, contained an appropriation (28 Stat. at L. 851, chap. 187) 'to pay the chief justice and five associate justices of the supreme court of the District of Columbia the difference between the rate of compensation received by them and five thousand dollars per annum for the fiscal year eighteen hundred and ninety three.' In virtue of this appropriation Justice James was paid for the portion of the fiscal year (from July 1, 1892, to June 30, 1893) covered by the lump appropriation, that is, up to the time of his resignation, on December 1, 1892, a sum which, added to the $4,000 appropriated in the lump appropriation act for that fiscal year, made his salary at the rate of $5,000 per annum.\n On behalf of the administratrix the contention is that the appropriation at the rate of $5,000 per annum made for the fiscal year from July 1, 1891, to June 30, 1892, operated as an increase of the salary to that amount, and that this increase was not repealed by the subsequent legislation, or, if intended to be repealed, the repealing act was void, because the supreme court of the District of Columbia was an inferior court of the United States within the meaning of  1, article 3, of the Constitution, and therefore, as Congress had increased the salary to $5, 000 it was without power to reduce it.\n The opposing contention is that the only effect of the appropriation for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1892, was to temporarily raise the salary for that year, and that, as in the \n\n[202 U.S. 401, 405]\n\u00a0\n subsequent year only a lump sum adequate to pay at the rate of $4,000 per annum was appropriated, the general law of 1866 governed, and that amount became the salary which, by law, was payable to Justice James at the time of his resignation. And it is insisted that Congress was vested with power to increase and diminish at pleasure the compensation paid to a justice of the supreme court of the District of Columbia because that court was not one of the courts referred to in  1 of article 3 of the Constitution. Indeed, irrespective of the question of what was the rate of salary payable to Justice James at the time of his resignation, the government contends that the judgment below should be affirmed, because, in any event, the supreme court of the District of Columbia was not a court of the United States within the intendment of Rev. Stat.  714, and, in consequence, the judges of that court were not entitled, on resignation, to the benefits intended to be conferred thereby.\n From the view we take of the case it is unnecessary to consider the constitutional questions which are raised by the opposing parties. We say this because, if the result of an analysis of the legislation of Congress be to establish that the salary by law payable to Justice James at the time of his resignation was $5,000 per annum, it will be superfluous, on that branch of the case, to intimate any opinion as to whether the supreme court of the District of Columbia is a court of the United States within the meaning of  1 of article 3 of the Constitution. Likewise, on the second branch of the case, if it be concluded that the justices of the supreme court of the District of Columbia are embraced within the provisions of  714 of the Revised Statutes, irrespective of whether that court is or is not an inferior court within the meaning of the constitutional provision above referred to, it will be likewise superfluous to consider the question of constitutional power.\n It is not disputed that, by the express terms of the appropriation act for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1892, the sal- \n\n[202 U.S. 401, 406]\n\u00a0\n aries of the justices of the supreme court of the District of Columbia were increased to $5,000 per annum, at least for that year. As, nowever, the appropriation for the next fiscal year-the one in which Justice James resigned-was only of a lump sum adequate to pay $4,000 per annum, it is insisted that that amount was the salary payable to Justice James at the date of his resignation. Whether, if the act appropriating the lump sum stood alone, it would sustain the contention based upon it we are not called upon to decide, since we may not merely consider the lump appropriation but must also take into view the act of March 2, 1895 (28 Stat. at L. 851, chap. 187) relating to the identical subject, viz., the salary for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1893, payable by law to the justices of the supreme court of the District.\n The act of March 2, 1895, appropriated to pay as a deficiency to the chief justice and the five associate justices of the supreme court of the District of Columbia a sum representing the difference between the rate of compensation theretofore received by them and $5,000 per annum for the fiscal year 1893, the year in which Justice James resigned. Now that act is susceptible of only one of two constructions; viz., either that it was a legislative declaration to the effect that the increase of salary operated by the specific provision contained in the appropriation act for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1892, was a permanent provision, and had not been repealed by the lump appropriation made in the act of the following year, or that it was intended retroactively to fix the salaries of the justices of the supreme court of the District of Columbia for the fiscal year 1893 at the sum of $5,000,-a power which Congress undoubtedly possessed. Stockdale v. Atlantic Ins. Co. 20 Wall. 323, 331, 332, 22 L. ed. 348, 351. Whichever view is adopted, the legal proposition inevitably arises that the salary of the justices of the supreme court of the District of Columbia payable by law for the fiscal year of 1893 was the sum of $5,000. Indeed, as a matter of fact, under the operation of the deficiency appropriation, the salary \n\n[202 U.S. 401, 407]\n\u00a0\n actually paid to Justice James for the portion of the fiscal year up to the time of his resignation was at the rate of $5,000 per annum. It is no answer to this deduction to say that as the effects just indicated arose from the act of 1895, therefore they could not have existed in the fiscal year of 1893, when Justice James resigned; for this would be but to deny efficacy to the act of 1895, either as a congressional interpretation of the prior legislation or as a retroactive statute, fixing the salaries for the year 1893\n\n\n As Congress had the power, wholly irrespective of the prior legislation, retroactively to fix the salary payable to a justice of the supreme court of the District of Columbia for an antecedent year, and as the effect of the act of 1895 was necessarily a determination by Congress that the salary payable to Justice James for the year during which he resigned was $5,000, we are not at liberty to disregard the retroactive effect of the act of Congress by holding that the salary payable to him by law for the year during which he retired was a less sum than the amount which Congress, in the exercise of its plenary authority in the premises, has declared was the lawful salary.\n The salary of Justice James for the period just referred to being, then, at the rate of $5,000 per annum, it is obvious that he was within the terms of Rev. Stat.  714, if the provisions of that section applied to justices of the supreme court of the District of Columbia. That section is as follows:\n'Sec. 714. When any judge of any court of the United States resigns his office, after having held his commission as such at least ten years, and having attained the age of seventy years, he shall, during the residue of his natural life, receive the same salary which was by law payable to him at the time of his resignation.'\n\n On behalf of the government it is, as we have said, contended that Justice James was not entitled to the benefit of this statute, because that statute only embraced judges of such courts of the United States as were within the purview of  \n\n[202 U.S. 401, 408]\n\u00a0\n of article 3 of the Constitution, and it is insisted the supreme court of the District of Columbia was not so embraced. We think the premise upon which this contention rests is wholly devoid of merit. The words of the statute, 'when any judge of any court of the United States resigns his office,' are broad enough to embrace all courts created by the United States, without taking into view the particular constitutional authority which was exercised in such creation. It is true that the statute excludes the conception that it was intended to apply to judges of courts created by Congress when the term of office was of a limited duration. Conversely, however, in our opinion, the text of the statute leaves no room for question that its provisions were intended to apply to a judge of any court of the United States holding his office by a life tenure, such as during good behavior. Indeed, as it is conceded at bar that, from the period of the enactment of the statute down to the present time, it has, without interruption or deviation, been construed by the legislative and executive departments of the government as applicable to justices of the supreme court of the District of Columbia, we do not deem it necessary to determine whether the supreme court of the District of Columbia is an inferior court within the meaning of  1 of article 3 of the Constitution, since, even if it be not a court of that character, it is nevertheless a court of the United States within the meaning of Rev. Stat.  714.\n The judgment is reversed and the case remanded, with directions to enter a judgment for the petitioner. \n\n\n\n","84":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJOHN WOODS & SONS v. CARL(1906)\nNo. 102\nArgued: Decided: December 3, 1906\n\n\n\n Messrs. Charles F. Wilson,\nHomer C. Mechem, and Edward Mechem for plaintiffs in error.\n Messrs. John Fletcher and W. C. Ratcliffe for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Peckham delivered the opinion of the court:\n This action was brought in the proper court of the state of Arkansas by the plaintiffs in error to recover the amount of a promissory note which was given by the defendant in error on the sale to him of a patented machine and of the right to the patent in the state of Arkansas. Before the \n\n[203 U.S. 358, 359]\n\u00a0\n maturity of the note it was indorsed by the payee and transferred to plaintiffs in error. The note was not executed as provided for by the statute of that state relating to the sale of rights under a patent. Act of April 23, 1891, Kirby's Dig.  513. The section reads as follows:\n'Sec. 513. Any vendor of any patented machine, implement, substance, or instrument of any kind or character whatsoever, when the said vendor of the same effects the sale of the same to any citizen of this state on a credit, and takes any character of negotiable instrument in payment of the same, the said negotiable instrument shall be executed on a printed form, and show upon its face that it was executed in consideration of a patented machine, implement, substance, or instrument, as the case may be, and no person shall be considered an innocent holder of the same, though he may have given value for the same before maturity, and the maker thereof may make defense to the collection of the same in the hands of any holder of said negotiable instrument, and all such notes not showing on their face for what they were given shall be absolutely void.'\n\n The defendant set up the violation of the statute as a defense. The verdict was for the defendant, and the judgment entered thereon having been affirmed by the supreme court, the plaintiffs have brought the case here by writ of error.\n The sole question involved is the validity of the statute. The opinion of the supreme court of Arkansas is reported in 75 Ark. 328, 87 S. W. 621. See also Wyatt v. Wallace, 67 Ark. 575, 55 S. W. 1105; State v. Cook, 107 Tenn. 499, 62 L.R.A. 174, 64 S. W. 720. This case is governed by the immediately preceding one, although the statute of Arkansas renders the note void if given for a patent right if the note does not show on its face for what it was given. The difference is not so material as to call for a different decision. The judgment is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice Day dissents. \n\n\n\n","85":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJOY v. CITY OF ST. LOUIS(1906)\nNo. 204\nArgued: March 9, 1906Decided: April 2, 1906\n\n\n\n This is an action of ejectment to recover certain lands in the city of St. Louis, state of Missouri, described in the petition, which was filed in the circuit court of the United States for the eastern district of Missouri. The petition was dismissed by \n\n[201 U.S. 332, 333]\n\u00a0\n the court solely upon the ground that the court was without jurisdiction, and the trial judge so certified the fact. The plaintiff sued out a writ of error and brought the case directly here for review under the 5th section of the act of 1891. 26 Stat. at L. 827, chap. 517, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 549.\n The petition sets forth in detail the title of the plaintiff in error to the premises which he seeks to recover in this action. It is therein stated that a confirmation of a concession was made by the commissioners appointed pursuant to an act of Congress approved March 2, 1805 [2 Stat. at L. 324, chap. 26], entitled 'An Act for Ascertaining and Adjusting the Titles and Claims to Land within the Territory of Orleans and the District of Louisiana,' such concession having been made to one Louis Labeaume, of 360 arpents of land, by the lieutenant governor of the Spanish province of Upper Louisiana, on February 15, 1799, and it was duly surveyed and certified April 10, 1799. The land remained an outlot, adjoining and belonging to the former town or village (now city) of St. Louis, and said outlot was owned, claimed, inhabited, cultivated, and possessed by Labeaume prior to the 20th day of December, 1803. By virtue of the 1st section of an act of Congress, approved June 13, 1812 [2 Stat. at L. 748, chap. 99], entitled 'An Act Making Further Provision for Settling the Claims to Land in the Territory of Missouri,' the title in fee simple to said concession, survey, confirmation, and outlot was confirmed and granted to Labeaume.\n Pursuant to an act of Congress approved March 3, 1807 [2 Stat. at L. 440, chap. 36], letters patent of the United States were issued to Labeaume, bearing date the 25th day of March, 1852, which letters purported and were sufficient to grant to Labeaume, or his legal representatives, the premises mentioned in the patent. On the 6th day of June, 1874, those from and under whom plaintiff derives title to the real estate sued for were the owners of the concession, and by an act of Congress, entitled 'An Act Obviating the Necessity of Issuing Patents for Certain Private Land Claims in the State of Missouri, and for Other Purposes' [18 Stat. at L. 62, chap. 223, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1512], approved June 6, 1874, it is provided that the right, title, and \n\n[201 U.S. 332, 334]\n\u00a0\n interest of the United States in and to all of the lands in the state of Missouri, which had been confirmed by Congress, or officers acting under and by authority of Congress, were granted, released, and relinquished by the United States, in fee simple, to the respective owners of the equitable titles thereto, their heirs and assigns, forever, as fully and completely in every respect whatever as could be done by patents issued therefor according to law.\n By virtue of these matters and by mesne conveyances from Labeaume it was averred that plaintiff became the owner of the land in question, and that a controversy had arisen between the plaintiff and the defendants herein as to the proper construction and legal effect of the letters patent and the acts of Congress approved June 13, 1812, and June 6, 1874, and the plaintiff herein averred in his petition-- 'that under and by virtue of said confirmation, act of Congress approved June 13th, 1812, letters patent, and act of Congress approved June 6th, 1874, said river ( Mississippi) is the western boundary of said outlot, confirmation to Louis Labeaume, and said Soulard survey and survey number 3333, and that the said Louis Labeaume or his legal representatives were thereby granted all of the land lying on said west bank of said river, between the northern and southern boundary lines of said outlot, confirmation, Soulard's survey, and United States survey number 3333, to said river, and that they were thereby constituted riparian proprietors and owners of all the land along said river bank between said north and south lines of said outlot, confirmation, and surveys, and were thereby vested with the title to, and ownership of, all land thereafter formed by accretions or gradual deposits from the said river along said west bank thereof, between said north and south lines of said outlot, confirmation, and surveys, where a largo body of land was formed by accretions to said outlot, confirmation, and surveys.\n'That said claim of plaintiff as to the proper construction and legal effect of said confirmation, acts of Congress approved \n\n[201 U.S. 332, 335]\n\u00a0\n June 13th, 1812, and June 6th, 1874, respectively, and patent, is disputed by defendants, and contested by them in regard to the title of the land hereinafter described, and which land is a portion of the land formed by accretions or gradual deposits from said river, along said west bank thereof, between said north and south lines of said outlot, confirmation, and surveys, and which thereby became a portion of the land granted by said letters patent and acts of Congress approved June 13th, 1812, and June 6th, 1874, respectively, and is the land herein sued for.'\n\n It is then averred that the proper construction and legal effect of the confirmation, acts of Congress, and letters patent constitute the controlling question in the case, upon the correct decision of which plaintiff's title to the premises sought to be recovered herein depends, and he 'therefore avers that this suit arises under the law of the United States, and said confirmation made and letters patent issued in pursuance thereof, and said acts of Congress approved June 13, 1812, and June 6, 1874, respectively.'\n'He further states that as such legal owner of the premises he was entitled to the possession of the same under and by virtue of said confirmation, letters patent, and acts of Congress approved June 13, 1812, and June 6, 1874, respectively, on the 16th day of June 1896, which are described as follows:' The plaintiff then gives a description of the land in controversy, which he alleges to be a portion of the accretions of the outlot, confirmation, and surveys, already mentioned.\n\n It was also alleged that the defendants entered upon the premises on the 16th of June, 1896, claiming to own the same as a wharf, under and by virtue of  9 of an act of Congress approved June 12, 1866, entitled 'An Act Authorizing Documentary Evidence of Titles to be Furnished to the Owners of Certain Lands in the City of St. Louis.' [14 Stat. at L. 63, chap. 96.]\n Plaintiff then demanded judgment for the recovery of the premises, and $5,000 for the unlawful withholding the same, and $100 for monthly rents and \n\n[201 U.S. 332, 336]\n\u00a0\n profits, from the rendition of judgment until the possession of the premises is delivered to plaintiff.\n The manufacturing company defendant filed an answer, denying each and every allegation of the petition. It also set up that it held the premises under the city of St Louis and that the city (and the defendant holding under it) has had open, continuous, notorious, and adverse possession of the premises, under claim and color of title for more than ten years next before the filing of said petition.\n The city of St. Louis filed a separate plea to the jurisdiction of the court, and asserted that it had no jurisdiction to try and determine the cause, because no Federal question or question of any kind giving jurisdiction to the court under the statutes and laws of the United States is involved in the issues in this cause. It further set up the facts in relation to the case of Sweringen v. St. Louis, in which the plaintiff therein claimed title to and possession of the property next immediately north of the premises herein claimed by plaintiff, under the same patent of the United States as that under which the plaintiff herein claims, and the history of the litigation is given, and the decision of the case in this court is referred to, which is to be found reported in \n185 U.S. 38\n, 46 L. ed. 795, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 569.\n Mr. E. P. Johnson for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[201 U.S. 332, 338]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles Claflin Allen, Henry W. Allen, and Charles W. Bates for defendants in error.\n\n\n\n[201 U.S. 332, 340]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Peckham, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n There is no diversity of citizenship in this case, and the only ground of jurisdiction claimed is that the action arises under the laws of the United States. The case is a pure action of ejectment, and the general rule in such actions, as to the complaint, is that the only facts necessary to be stated therein are, that plaintiff is the owner of the premises described, and entitled to the possession, and that defendant wrongfully withholds such possession, to plaintiff's damage in an amount stated. Setting out the source of the plaintiff's title, as was done with so much detail in this case, was unnecessary, but it does not alter the case, because a claim that the title comes from the United States does not, for that reason merely, raise a Federal question.\n It is a long-settled rule, evidenced by many decisions of this court, that the plaintiff cannot make out a case as arising under the Constitution or the laws of the United States unless it necessarily appears by the complaint or petition or bill in stating plaintiff's cause of action. In Little York Gold-Washing & Water Co. v. Keyes, \n96 U.S. 199\n- 203, 24 L. ed. 656-658, it was said that before the circuit court can be required to retain a cause under its jurisdiction, under  5, act of 1875 [ 18 Stat. at L. 472, chap. 137, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 511], it must in some form appear upon the record, by a statement of facts, in legal and logical form, such as is required in good pleading, that the suit is one which really and substantially involves a dispute or controversy as to a right which depends upon the construction or effect of the Constitution, or some law or treaty of the United States. That was a case of a petition for a removal of a suit from the state to the Federal court. But it has been held that whether there is a right of removal in such cases depends upon whether the circuit court could have exercised original jurisdiction. Third Street & Suburban R. Co. v. Lewis, \n173 U.S. 457\n, 43 L. ed. 766, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 451; Arkansas v. Kansas & T. Coal Co. \n\n[201 U.S. 332, 341]\n\u00a0\n \n183 U.S. 185\n, 46 L. ed. 144, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 47; Boston & M. Consol. Copper & S. Min. Co. v. Montana Ore Purchasing Co. \n188 U.S. 632\n-640, 47 L. ed. 626-632, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 434. This original jurisdiction, it has been frequently held, must appear by the plaintiff's statement of his own claim, and it cannot be made to appear by the assertion in the plaintiff's pleading that the defense raises or will raise a Federal question. As has been stated, the rule is a reasonable and just one that the complainant, in the first instance, shall be confined to a statement of his cause of action, leaving to the defendant to set up in his answer what his defense is, and, if anything more than a denial of plaintiff's cause of action, imposing upon the defendant the burden of proving such defense. This principle was given effect to in Tennessee v. Union & Planters' Bank, \n152 U.S. 454\n, 38 L. ed. 511, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 654; Muse v. Arlington Hotel Co. \n168 U.S. 430\n, 42 L. ed. 531, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 109; Third Street & Suburban R. Co. v. Lewis and Arkansas v. Kansas & T. Coal Co. supra; Filhiol v. Maurice, \n185 U.S. 108\n, 46 L. ed. 827, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 560; Boston & M. Consol. Copper & S. Min. Co. v. Montana Ore Purchasing Co. supra.\n The mere fact that the title of plaintiff comes from a patent or under an act of Congress does not show that a Federal question arises. It was said in Blackburn v. Portland Gold Min. Co. \n175 U.S. 571\n, 44 L. ed. 276, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 222, that 'this court has frequently been vainly asked to hold that controversies in respect to lands, one of the parties to which had derived his title directly from an act of Congress, for that reason alone presented a Federal question.' The same principle was held in Shoshone Min. Co. v. Rutter, \n177 U.S. 505\n, 44 L. ed. 864, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 726, and also in DeLamar's Nevada Gold Min. Co. v. Nesbitt, \n177 U.S. 523\n, 44 L. ed. 872, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 715.\n To say that there is a dispute between the parties as to the construction of the patent or of the several acts of Congress referred to does not raise a Federal question, because a statement that there is such dispute is entirely unnecessary in averring or proving plaintiff's cause of action. His source of title, as set forth in the petition, might not be disputed, and the defense might rest upon the defense of adverse possession, as set up in the answer. If defendants contented themselves on the trial with proof of such defense, then no question of a Federal nature would have been tried or decided. \n\n[201 U.S. 332, 342]\n\u00a0\n In those cases where the dispute necessarily appears in the course of properly alleging and proving the plaintiff's cause of action, the situation is entirely different. In this case the real dispute, as stated by the plaintiff, is whether plaintiff is entitled to the land formed by accretion, which has taken place many years since the patent was issued and since the acts of Congress were passed. There is no dispute as to the terms of the patent or of the acts of Congress. The language of the averment in the petition (which is set out in full in the foregoing statement of facts) shows that the controversy in dispute is not at all in regard to the land covered by the letters patent or by the acts of Congress, and no dispute is alleged to exist as to such land, but the dispute relates to land, 'which land is a portion of the land formed by accretions or gradual deposits from said river, along said west bank thereof, between said north and south lines of said outlot, confirmation, and surveys, and which thereby became a portion of the land granted by said letters patent and acts of Congress approved June 13th, 1812, and June 6th, 1874, respectively.'\n Now, whether the land contained in the original patent reached to the Mississippi river as its eastern boundary, under the distances called for by the patent, would be a question of fact, as was stated in Sweringen v. St. Louis, \n185 U.S. 38\n, 46 L. ed. 795, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 569, and whether the plaintiff is, upon the facts set forth, entitled to the accretion, is a question of local or state law, and is not one of a Federal nature. St. Anthony Falls Water Power Co. v. St. Paul Water Comrs. \n168 U.S. 349\n-359, 42 L. ed. 497-501, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 157, and cases cited. In Packer v. Bird, \n137 U.S. 661\n, 34 L. ed. 819, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 210, it was held that while the Federal court would construe grants of the general government without reference to the rules of construction adopted by the states for grants by them, yet whatever incidents or rights attached to the ownership of the property conveyed by the United States bordering on a navigable stream would be determined by the states in which it is situated, subject to the limitation that their rules do not impair the efficacy of the grant, or the use and enjoyment of the property by the grantee. To the same effect is \n\n[201 U.S. 332, 343]\n\u00a0\n Shively v. Bowlby, \n152 U.S. 1\n, 38 L. ed. 331, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 548. In the opinion in that case, at page 57, L. ed. p. 352, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 567, it is said: 'By the law of the state of Oregon, therefore, as enacted by its legislature and declared by its highest court, the title in the lands in controversy is in the defendants in error; and, upon the principles recognized and affirmed by a uniform series of recent decisions of this court, above referred to, the law of Oregon governs the case.'\n As this land in controversy is not the land described in the letters patent or the acts of Congress, but, as is stated in the petition, is formed by accretions or gardual deposits from the river, whether such land belongs to the plaintiff is, under the cases just cited, a matter of local or state law, and not one arising under the laws of the United States.\n The question before us is wholly different from the case of a writ of error to a state court founded upon  709 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 575). A Federal question may appear in the course of the trial, and some right specially claimed or set up under a Federal statute may have been denied, and the party against whom the decision was made can have the question reviewed by this court under that section.\n In Cooke v. Avery, \n147 U.S. 375\n, 37 L. ed. 209, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 340, this question was not decided. It was not referred to in the course of the opinion, and it is no authority for the plaintiff's contention herein. It was simply held that there was an issue between the parties which depended upon the laws of the United States and the rules of the circuit court, and their construction and application were directly involved.\n In any aspect in which this case may be viewed, we think it was not one over which the Circuit Court had jurisdiction, and for that reason its order dismissing the petition is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","86":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKEEN v. KEEN(1906)\nNo. 188\nArgued: Decided: April 2, 1906\n\n\n\n This was an action of ejectment begun by Sophronia K. Keen in the circuit court of St. Charles county against Ellis Keen, to recover a tract of land in that county to which plaintiff averred she was lawfully entitled. The petition was in the usual form of a declaration in ejectment, and the answer a general denial.\n Eli Keen was the common source of title, plaintiff claiming one half of the land, subject to the payment of debts, under  2939 of the Revised Statutes of Missouri, upon the ground that she was the widow of Eli Keen, who died in \n\n[201 U.S. 319, 320]\n\u00a0\n 1901, leaving, as plaintiff alleged, no children capable of inheriting.\n Defendant claimed to be the legitimate child of an alleged common-law marriage between Eli Keen, a white man, and Phoebe, a negro woman.\n There was judgment below for the plaintiff, which was affirmed by the supreme court. 184 Mo. 358, 83 S. W. 526.\n Mr. David P. Dyer for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Charles W. Bates, John F. McGinnis, and C. W. Wilson for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Brown:\n\n Mr. Justice Brown delivered the opinion of the court:\n The court deduced, as a conclusion of law from certain facts found, that no marriage at common-law had ever existed between Eli Keen and Phoebe, a former slave of Eli's father, and that the former died without leaving any child or children or other descendants capable of inheriting from him, and hence that plaintiff was entitled to recover possession of an undivided half of the lands as his wife. No ceremonial marriage was claimed.\n It is difficult to see any facts upon which to found our jurisdiction of the case. No Federal question appears in the pleadings or in the testimony, a transcript of which is contained in the record. The first glimmer of one appears in the motion for a new trial in the circuit court, in which it is charged that the judgment deprived the defendant of his property without due process of law, and also denied him the equal protection of the laws, contrary to the 14th Amendment to the Constitution. But no allegation is made as to why the judgment had this effect. No notice was taken of the constitutional point in the opinion of the supreme court, although the writ of error from this court was allowed by the presiding \n\n[201 U.S. 319, 321]\n\u00a0\n judge. In the assignment of errors filed in this court the only error charged is that, although the court below found there was no common-law marriage between Eli Keen and Phoebe, yet, in its special findings, it found all the facts required to establish such common-law marriage between them, and that from the facts so found the law presumed a null and void marriage between said Eli Keen and Phoebe Keen, the issue of which was capable of inheriting, under the statutes of Missouri. Rev. Stat.  2918. No reference is made to the Constitution of the United States in this connection. In addition to this, the question what facts constitute a common-law marriage is purely a local one. We have searched the record for a Federal question, but have found none. The writ of error is, therefore, dismissed. \n\n\n\n","87":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKNOXVILLE WATER CO. v. CITY OF KNOXVILLE(1906)\nNo. 123\nArgued: Decided: January 2, 1906\n\n\n\n\n[200 U.S. 22, 23]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles T. Cates, Jr., R. E. L. Mountcastle, and Samuel G. Shields for appellant.\n\n\n\n[200 U.S. 22, 25]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John W. Green and J. W. Culton for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan delivered the opinion of the court:\n This suit was brought by the Knoxville Water Company, a corporation of Tennessee, against the city of Knoxville, a municipal corporation of the same state, and against certain individual \n\n[200 U.S. 22, 26]\n\u00a0\n citizens of Tennessee, constituting the waterworks commission of that city.\n Are the rights which the plaintiff sought to protect secured by the Constitution of the United States in any such sense as to make the case- the parties all being citizens of Tennessee-one arising under that instrument, and therefore one of which the circuit court could take original cognizance? An answer to these questions, it would seem, requires for their intelligent solution a somewhat extended statement of the facts.\n The water company, by its charter granted in 1877, was authorized to establish waterworks of sufficient capacity to furnish the corporate authorities and inhabitants of Knoxville with water. To that end it was empowered to lay down pipes through the streets, lanes, and alleys of the city; bringing into the city a sufficent supply of water by means of pipes or tanks, or in any other way; construct reservoirs; supply with water the inhabitants of the city and its environs, and all who may be along the lines of the company's pipes; erect hydrants or fire plugs; and contract with the inhabitants and with the corporate authorities of the city or any incorporated companies for the use of water, charging such price for the same as might be agreed upon between the company and the parties.\n Prior to 1882,-taking the allegations of the bill to be true, since the case went off in the circuit court upon demurrer to the bill,-the city of Knoxville determined to establish a system of waterworks, and to that end it purchased certain real estate. But that scheme having been abandoned, or having been ascertained to be unwise and impracticable at that time, the city advertised for bids and proposals by responsible parties for the erection of waterworks, which, after being built, it was to have the option of purchasing at a time to be agreed upon.\n The advertisement brought two competitive propositions, one by the city water company and the other by the present plaintiff. The proposition of the plaintiff was accepted, and thereupon the city and the plaintiff, on the 1st day of July, \n\n[200 U.S. 22, 27]\n\u00a0\n 1882, entered into an agreement or contract which is the foundation of this suit.\n By that agreement the water company stipulated (omitting many minor details): That it would erect and establish on the land acquired by the city a system of waterworks, with reservoir and all necessary mains, pipes, hydrants, machinery, buildings, and other appurtenances and incidents sufficient to supply the city with water to be taken from the Tennessee river at the site purchased by the city for that purpose,-the waterworks and fixtures throughout to be of first-class materials, capable of furnishing 2,000,000 gallons of water every twenty-four hours, and affording an uninterrupted daily supply to the city of such quantity as might be required, not exceeding the amount above specified, and the reservoir to be built on a specified site, and to have a capacity of 3,200, 000 gallons of water. The company was to furnish water free of charge ( except the rental of hydrants) from hydrants for the sprinkling of streets and flushing of gutters and sewers along, on, or under such streets as were curbed, guttered, or sewered; also, free of charge, water for all purposes of the fire department and for supplying the city hall buildings, office, and prison. It was to purchase at the price of $7,800 the property then already acquired by the city for the purpose of erecting waterworks, including lands, plans, specifications, drawings, maps, etc., and to pay therefor within thirty days from the execution of the agreement, and before the construction of said works. It engaged to supply private consumers with water at a rate not to exceed 5 cents per hundred gallons, the cost of introducing from the mains, and the cost of meter when used, to be borne by such private parties. The work of construction was to be commenced within thirty days from the execution of the agreement, and the works to be completed, ready for use, within twelve months thereafter. The company was to maintain the waterworks stipulated to be built by it in such condition as would enable it to comply with its undertakings for the period of thirty years from January 1st, 1883, unless the city should become the owner of the same \n\n[200 U.S. 22, 28]\n\u00a0\n within that period. At its own expense it was to establish with the waterworks a system of telegraphic fire alarms of such quality and efficiency as those in general use in cities, consisting of two alarm boxes in each of the (then) eight wards of the city, with proper telegraphic connections with a central station.\n In consideration of the promises and undertakings by the water company, as set out in the above agreement, the city covenanted and agreed, among other things, 'not to grant to any other person or corporation, any contract or privilege to furnish water to the city of Knoxville, or the privilege of erecting upon the public streets, lanes, or alleys, or other public grounds, for the purpose of furnishing said city or the inhabitants thereof with water for the full period of thirty years from the 1st day of August, A. D. 1883, provided the company comply with the requirements and obligations imposed and assumed by them under and by virtue of this agreement;' also, 'to pay to said company for rent of the seventy-five hydrants hereinbefore stipulated to be erected $50 each per annum, payable in quarterly instalments on the last day of each quarter, beginning on the day upon which the city shall commence receiving a supply of water from said works, and for any additional hydrants erected for the use of the city it will pay in the same manner at the rate of not more than $50 each per annum. . . .' Recognizing the benefit and advantage accruing to it and to its citizens from the construction of the waterworks and the erection of hydrants, the city also covenanted and agreed with the water company 'to pay, in addition to the annual rent of $50, as hereinbefore provided, and as an additional annual rent for the said seventy-five hydrants, a sum equal to that which, under the laws of the state and the ordinances and resolutions of the city, would be annually assessed as taxes for city purposes and uses on property of the same kind, quantity, and value as that owned by the said water company within the corporate limits of the city of Knoxville: Provided, that the said additional annual rental shall only \n\n[200 U.S. 22, 29]\n\u00a0\n be paid for the term of five years next following 1st of August, 1894, and no longer.'\n It was further mutually agreed and understood between the parties that at the expiration of fifteen years from the time fixed for the completion of the waterworks, the city should have the right, upon giving one year's notice of such purpose and intention, to purchase from the company the waterworks provided for, and all the property, rights, franchises, and privileges thereto belonging; by negotiations, if the terms could in that way be agreed upon, or if not, then at any time for a consideration to be fixed and determined by appraisers; and if not purchased at the end of fifteen years, the waterworks plant, franchises, rights, privileges, etc., could be purchased by the city upon the same terms and conditions, and in the same way, at the expiration of each and every year thereafter. But in no case was such right of purchase to exist or be exercised unless due notice thereof was given one year before the expiration of the period aforesaid or either of them. If the parties differed as to price, the matter, the agreement provided, was to be determined by appraisers designated in a particular way, and whose award should be final and conclusive. It was further stipulated that the water company should not transfer, set over, or assign the agreement for the construction of the waterworks to any company, corporation, or individual whatsoever.\n By an ordinance adopted October 20th, 1899, the city consented to the consolidation of the Knoxville Water Company and the Lonsdale-Beaumont Water Company, and made certain changes both in the contract between the latter company and the town of West Knoxville and in the above agreement of 1882. It is not necessary to set out these changes.\n We come now to the act of the Tennessee legislature of February 2d, 1903, passed avowedly for the purpose of enabling the city to exercise the option it had under the agreement of 1882 and the ordinance of 1899 to purchase and acquire the plant and property of the water company, and maintain it for the benefit of its people. To that end the act authorized the city \n\n[200 U.S. 22, 30]\n\u00a0\n to issue bonds to an amount sufficient for that purpose, upon the agreed valuation of the parties, or, in default of same, upon a valuation to be ascertained and fixed by appraisers, and to such additional amount as would be necessary in making additions to the plant, including real estate required for such additions. It was, however, provided that bonds should not be issued unless approved by the assent of two thirds of the qualified voters of the city, expressed at an election duly held to ascertain their wishes. The execution of the provisions of the act was committed to a waterworks commission, to be created by the city council, and to have the power to make all contracts for the maintenance and extension of the plant.\n Subsequently, the legislature passed the act of April 3d, 1903, (also amending the above act of February 2d, 1903), whereby the city was authorized to acquire, own, and operate a system of waterworks, either by purchase or construction, and for that purpose power was given to issue interestbearing coupon bonds to an amount not exceeding $750,000, under the restrictions named in the act. The act created a waterworks commission of five members, to be elected by the city council, and to have the entire supervision, under prescribed restrictions, of the purchase or construction, operation and maintenance, of any system of waterworks established under the sanction of the act. The act embodied, among others, a provision authorizing and directing the commissioners to obtain from the water company a written proposition for the sale of its plant, franchises, etc., to the city of Knoxville, giving the price and terms of payment, together with the opinion of competent, disinterested experts as to the cost and present value of the plant; the commission to secure plans, specifications, and estimates of the cost of the construction of a new system of waterworks, and to report all matters to the city council for its consideration, but not to close any contract for the purchase or construction of waterworks until it had been duly authorized to do so by the city council after 239 votes against, an issue of bonds for a vote of the people. \n\n[200 U.S. 22, 31]\n\u00a0\n If the city determined to construct, equip, and maintain its own system of waterworks, then, for the purpose of securing sites for pumping stations and other necessary purposes, including the laying of mains and water pipes, and sites for reservoirs and filtering galleries, extensions, improvements and alterations, it was given the right of condemnation of grounds within and without its corporate limits.\n There is no need to refer to other provisions of the agreement of 1882. But it may be said in this connection that an election was held on the 2d day of July, 1903; and the city council-having express authority to declare the result of the election-declared, by ordinance, that 1,818 votes had been cast in favor of, and only 230 votes against, an issue of bonds for the construction by the city of a system of waterworks. It may be also stated, in this connection, that after the passage of the two acts of 1903, and before the above election, some correspondence ensued between the water commission and the water company in reference to the purchase of the latter's plant. But the parties failed to agree as to the mode of ascertaining the value of the company's plant, and negotiations ceased. It is not important to inquire which side, if either, was to blame in this matter. Suffice it to say that the city council, on or about May 20th, 1904, conceived and was about to enter a plan of establishing a system of city waterworks wholly independent of, and in competition with, that maintained by the water company.\n The present suit was brought upon the theory that the legislative enactments of 1903 were laws impairing the obligations of the contract of 1882 between the water company and the city, as well as upon the theory that the maintenance by the city of a system of waterworks in competition with those of the water company would inevitably destroy the value of the latter's property, and be a taking, under the sanction of the state, of the company's property for public use without compensation, in violation of the due process of law enjoined by the 14th Amendment. \n\n[200 U.S. 22, 32]\n\u00a0\n The substantial relief asked was a perpetual injunction restraining the city, its agents or officers, and the waterworks commission, from entering into any contract for the construction of a separate, independent, and competing plant, and from issuing any bonds for such a purpose.\n Upon the question of the jurisdiction of the circuit court to take cognizance of this case, without regard to the citizenship of the parties, but little need be said. The water company, as we have seen, insists that the agreement of 1882 constituted a contract, whereby it acquired, for a given period, an exclusive right, by means of pipes laid in the public ways and a system of works established for that purpose, to supply water for the use of the city and its inhabitants. It also insists, as just stated, that the obligation of this contract will be impaired if the city, proceeding under the acts of the legislature and under the ordinances in question, establishes and maintains an independent, separate system of waterworks in competition with those of the water company. These questions having been aptly raised by the company's bill, the case is plainly one arising under the Constitution of the United States.\n The fundamental question in the case is whether the city, by the agreement of 1882, or in any other way, has so tied its hands by contract that it cannot, consistently with the constitutional rights of the water company, establish and maintain, a separate system of waterworks of its own. If the city made no such contract, that will be an end of the case; for, in the absence of a contract protected by the Constitution of the United States, the circuit court could not take cognizance of the dispute between the parties, all citizens of Tennessee; and it could not be said that any taking of private property for public use could arise merely from the construction and maintenance by the city of a waterworks plant.\n The principles which must control in determining the scope and obligations of the agreement of 1882 have been clearly outlined in our decisions. We may assume, for purposes of the present discussion, but without deciding, that the city of Knoxville \n\n[200 U.S. 22, 33]\n\u00a0\n was invested by the legislature with full authority, or that, under its general municipal powers, it could bind itself by contract, to give to a single corporation or company the exclusive right, for a specified period, to supply water for the use of itself and its inhabitants. It will yet be conceded that whatever authority it possessed in this matter was granted solely for the public good, and that in every substantial, legal sense the agreement with the water company is to be deemed a public grant, entitling that company to exercise certain public functions that appertain to the city as a municipal corporation.\n Although the doctrines which must centrol in determining the scope of such a grant are clearly settled and are familiar, it may be well to recall the words of some of the adjudged cases. In Charles River Bridge v. Warren Bridge, 11 Pet. 420, 544, 547, 548, 9 L. ed. 773, 822, 824, the doctrine announced was that government, possessing powers that affect the public interests, and having entered into a contract involving such interests, is not, by means merely of implications or presumptions, to be disarmed of powers necessary to accomplish the objects of its existence; that any ambiguity in the terms of such a contract must operate against the corporation, and in favor of the public, and the corporation can claim nothing but what is clearly given by the act; that it can never be assumed that the government intended to diminish its powers of accomplishing the ends of its creation; and that those who insist that the government has surrendered any of its powers, or agreed that they may be diminished, must find clear warrant for such a contention before it can be heeded. 'Grants of franchises and special privileges are always to be construed most strongly against the donee, and in favor of the public.' Such were the words of this court in St. Clair County Turnp. Co. v. Illinois, \n96 \nU.S. 63, 68\n, 24 S. L. ed. 651, 652. The universal rule in doubtful cases-this court said in Oregon R. & Nav. Co. v. Oregonian R. Co. \n130 \nU.S. 1, 26\n, 32 S. L. ed. 837, 842, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 409-is that 'the construction shall be against the grantee, and in favor of the government.' As late as Coosaw Min. Co. v. South Carolina, \n144 \nU.S. 550, 562\n, 36 S. L. ed. 537, 542, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 689, 691, this court said: 'The doctrine is firmly established that only \n\n[200 U.S. 22, 34]\n\u00a0\n that which is granted in clear and explicit terms passes by a grant of property, franchises, or privileges in which the government or the public has an interest. \n1\n Statutory grants of that character are to be construed strictly in favor of the public, and whatever is not unequivocally granted is withheld; nothing passes by mere implication. \n2\n This principle, it has been said, 'is a wise one, as it serves to defeat any purpose concealed by the skilful use of terms to accomplish something not apparent on the face of the act, and thus sanctions only open dealing with legislative bodies.' Slidell v. Grandjean, \n111 \nU.S. 412, 438\n, 28 S. L. ed. 321, 330, 4 Sup. Ct. Rep. 475.' We have never departed from or modified these principles, but have reaffirmed them in many cases. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n It is true that the cases to which we have referred involved in the main the construction of legislative enactments. But the principles they announce apply with full force to ordinances and contracts by municipal corporations in respect of matters that concern the public. The authorities are all agreed that a municipal corporation, when exerting its functions for the general mere implication. If, by contract or otherwise mere implication. Iv, by contract or otherwise, it may, in particular circumstances, restrict the exercise of its public powers, the intention to do so must be manifested by words so clear as not to admit of two different or inconsistent meanings.\n Turning, now, to the agreement of 1882, we fail to find in it any words necessarily importing an obligation on the part of the city not to establish and maintain waterworks of its own during the term of the water company. It is said that the \n\n[200 U.S. 22, 35]\n\u00a0\n company could not possibly have believed that the city would establish waterworks to be operated in competition with its system, for such competition would be ruinous to the water company, as its projectors, on a moment's reflection, could have perceived when the agreement of 1882 was made. On the other hand, the city may, with much reason, say that, having once thought of having its own waterworks, the failure to insert in that agreement a provision precluding it, in all circumstances, and during a long period, from having its own separate system, shows that it was not its purpose to so restrict the exercise of its powers, but to remain absolutely free to act as changed circumstances or the public exigencies might demand. The stipulation in the agreement that the city would not, at any time during the thirty years commencing August 1st, 1883, grant to any person or corporation the same privileges it had given to the water company, was by no means an agreement that it would never, during that period, construct and maintain waterworks of its own. For some reason, not distinctly disclosed by the record, the city abandoned the scheme it had at one time formed, of constructing its own system of waterworks. And it may be that it did not, in 1882, intend or expect ever again to think favorably of such a scheme. It may also be that the water company, having knowledge of what the city had done or attempted prior to 1882, deliberately concluded to risk the possibility of municipal competition, if the city would agree not to give to other persons or corporations the same privileges it had given to that company. The city did so agree, and thereby bound itself by contract to the extent just stated, omitting, as if purposely, not to bind itself further. The agreement, as executed, is entirely consistent with the idea that while the city, at the time of making the agreement of 1882, had no purpose or plan to establish and operate its own waterworks in competition with those of the water company, it refrained from binding itself not to do so, although willing to stipulate, as it did stipulate, that the grant to the water company should be exclusive as against all other persons or corporations. We are therefore \n\n[200 U.S. 22, 36]\n\u00a0\n constrained by the words of the agreement to hold that the city did not assume, by any contract protected by the Constitution of the United States, to restrict its right to have a system of waterworks, independent altogether of the system established and maintained by the water company. If this interpretation of the contract will bring hardship and loss to the water company, and to those having an interest in its property and bonds, the result (omitting now any consideration of the question of power) is due to the absence from the agreement between the parties of any stipulation binding the city not to do what, unless restrained, it now proposes to do.\n While there is no case precisely like the present one in all its facts, the adjudged cases lead to no other conclusion than the one just indicated. We may well repeat here what was said in a somewhat similar case, where a municipal corporation established gas works of its own in competition with a private gas company which, under previous authority, had placed its pipes, mains, etc., in public streets to supply, and was supplying, gas for a city and its inhabitants: 'It may be that the stockholders of the plaintiff supposed, at the time it became incorporated, and when they made their original investment, that the city would never do what evidently is contemplated by the ordinance of 1889. And it may be that the erection and maintenance of gas works by the city at the public expense, and in competition with the plaintiff, will ultimately impair, if not destroy, the value of the plaintiff's works, for the purposes for which they were established. But such considerations cannot control the determination of the legal rights of parties. As said by this court in Curtis v. Whitney, 13 Wall. 68, 70, 20 L. ed. 513, 514: 'Nor does every statute which affects the value of a contract impair its obligation. It is one of the contingencies to which parties look now in making a large class of contracts, that they may be affected in many ways by state and national legislation.' If parties wish to guard against contingencies of that kind they must do so by such clear and explicit language as will take their contracts out of the established rule that public grants, \n\n[200 U.S. 22, 37]\n\u00a0\n susceptible of two constructions, must receive the one most favorable to the public.' Hamilton Gaslight & Coke Co. v. Hamilton, \n146 \nU.S. 258, 268\n, 36 S. L. ed. 963, 968, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 90; Skaneateles Waterworks Co. v. Skaneateles, \n184 \nU.S. 354, 363\n, 46 S. L. ed. 585, 590, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 400.\n So in Joplin v. Southwest Missouri Light Co. \n191 \nU.S. 150, 156\n, 48 S. L. ed. 127, 129, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 43, which involved the question whether a city could establish its own electric plant in competition with that of a private corporation, the court said: 'The limitation contended for is upon a governmental agency, and restraints upon that must not be readily implied. The appellee concedes, as we have seen, that it has no exclusive right, and yet contends for a limitation upon the city which might give it ( the appellee) a practical monopoly. Others may not seek to compete with it, and if the city cannot, the city is left with a useless potentiality, while the appellee exercises and enjoys a practically exclusive right. There are presumptions, we repeat, against the granting of exclusive rights, and against limitations upon the powers of government.'\n Again, in the recent case of Helena Waterworks Co. v. Helena, \n195 \nU.S. 383, 392\n, 49 S. L. ed. 245, 250, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 40, where a city established its own system of waterworks in competition with that of a private company, the court, observing that the city had not specifically bound itself not to construct its own plant, said: 'Had it been intended to exclude the city from exercising the privilege of establishing its own plant, such purpose could have been expressed by apt words, as was the case in Walla Walla v. Walla Walla Water Co. \n172 U.S. 1\n, 43 L. ed. 341, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 77. It is doubtless true that the erection of such a plant by the city will render the property of the water company less valuable and, perhaps, unprofitable; but if it was intended to prevent such competition, a right to do so should not have been left to argument or implication, but made certain by the terms of the contract.' To the same effect, as to the principle involved, are Washington & C. Turnp. Co. v. Maryland, 3 Wall. 210, 213, 18 L. ed. 180, 182; Stein v. Bienville Water Supply Co. \n141 \nU.S. 67, 81\n, 35 S. L. ed. 622, 628, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 892; Long Island Water Supply Co. v. Brooklyn, \n166 U.S. 685\n, 41 L. ed. 1165, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 718.\n It is, we think, important that the courts should adhere firmly \n\n[200 U.S. 22, 38]\n\u00a0\n to the salutary doctrine underlying the whole law of municipal corporations and the doctrines of the adjudged cases, that grants of special privileges affecting the general interests are to be liberally construed in favor of the public, and that no public body, charged with public duties, be held, upon mere implication or presumption, to have devested itself of its powers.\n As, then, the city of Knoxville cannot be held to have precluded itself by contract from establishing its own independent system of waterworks, it becomes unnecessary to consider any other question in the case. The judgment of that court dismissing the bill must be affirmed.\n It is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice Brown, Mr. Justice White, Mr. Justice Peckham, and Mr. Justice Holmes dissented. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Rice v.

HOADLEY(1906)\nNo. 91\nArgued: Decided: January 2, 1906\n\n\n\nStatement by Mr. Justice Brown:\n This was an appeal from a decree of the circuit court in favor of the plaintiff, Charlotte E. Hoadley, a citizen of Massachusetts, against Abraham L. Day and other defendants, among whom were Fred H. Kolze, administrator of the estate of Friederich Kolze, deceased, Lina Kolze, his widow, Louisa Kolze, his daughter, and Charles E. Stade, trustee, all citizens of Illinois, foreclosing three trust deeds given by Day to secure \n\n[200 U.S. 76, 77]\n\u00a0\n promissory notes in the aggregate amount of $5,400. The appeal was granted solely upon the question of jurisdiction.\n The point involved requires a statement of facts at some length. They are substantially as follows:\n Friederich Kolze sold and conveyed certain real estate to Day by warranty deed dated and acknowledged November 15, 1897, for a stated consideration of $45,000,-namely, $1,000 in cash and the remainder in notes secured by trust deeds. To secure such notes, Day executed three trust deeds to one Stade as trustee, conveying the real estate in question, which were dated November 17, and acknowledged and recorded November 24, 1897. Kolze thereupon intrusted the notes and trust deeds to Stade, a nephew, in whom he seemed to have great confidence, the notes being executed by Day to his own order, and by him indorsed in blank.\n On February 17, 1898, Stade took the notes and trust deeds securing the same, and pledged them to Charlotte E. Hoadley as collateral security to his own notes, upon which Hoadley then advanced, or secured to be advanced, a large sum of money.\n By deed dated and acknowledged November 23, 1897, but not delivered or recorded until June 30, 1898, Day reconveyed the premises to Kolze, and by deed of release, dated and acknowledged October 27, 1898, and recorded October 29, 1898, Stade, as trustee, fraudulently released said three trust deeds to Kolze, reciting a consideration of $1 and other valuable considerations, and further reciting that the notes secured thereby had been canceled.\n By deed dated October 29, 1898, Kolze, now deceased, and the appellant Lina Kolze, his wife, conveyed said premises to Louisa Kolze, their daughter, upon an expressed consideration of $12,000, although the grantee was not a bona fide purchaser, and said conveyance was made to her to hold for the benefit of the family.\n For the ostensible purpose of securing the payment of the purchase money, said Louisa Kolze executed a trust deed to \n\n[200 U.S. 76, 78]\n\u00a0\n secure her promissory note of $10,000, to Percy V. Castle, as trustee. This deed was dated October 27, 1898, acknowledged October 28, 1898, and recorded October 29, 1898, the appellant Fred H. Kolze, as administrator of the estate of his father, being the owner of said notes and trust deeds, subject, as was alleged, to the rights of the plaintiff, Hoadley.\n Subsequently, on or about April 21, 1899, the notes and trust deeds of Day, upon default by Stade in the payment of his note, were sold in accordance with the terms of the collateral note, and were bought in by, and became the property of, the appellee, Hoadley.\n The bill prayed that the release deed executed by Stade to Friederich Kolze be declared fraudulent and void as against the notes and trust deeds executed by Day and now owned by the plaintiff; that the rights of all the defendants be declared subject to those of the plaintiff under the notes and deeds held by her; that a receiver be appointed and an account had, and the defendants be decreed to pay whatever was due under the notes and trust deeds, and, in default thereof, that the premises be sold and the defendants be held liable for any deficiency upon such sale, and that they all be foreclosed of their right of redemption.\n The defendants moved to dismiss the amended bill for want of a proper allegation of diversity of citizenship, which was overruled; and thereupon defendants interposed a plea to the jurisdiction upon the ground that the defendants were all citizens of the state of Illinois; that the suit was brought by plaintiff as the assignee of one William P. Smith, to whom the notes had been hypothecated by Stade to secure his (Stade's) note, and also to secure Smith for the faithful performance by Stade of a certain contract of employment; that upon the failure of Stade to pay his note and carry out his contract, said mortgage notes and trust deeds signed by Day were sold on or about April 21, 1899, and were bought in by and became the property of the plaintiff; that State and Smith, 'the successive assignors' of the appellee, were citizens of the \n\n[200 U.S. 76, 79]\n\u00a0\n state of Illinois, the same state of which Day, the maker of the notes, was also a resident, and that by reason of the fact that said suit could not have been prosecuted in a Federal court if no transfer or assignment had been made, the circuit court had no jurisdiction of the case.\n This plea was held to be insufficient, and the defendants, failing to answer, were defaulted, and a decree thereafter entered to the effect that Stade, as trustee, had fraudulently released the trust deeds; that the trust deeds were valid as liens upon the premises; that the rights of Louisa Kolze, subsequent grantee under the warranty deed, as well as the deed of Kolze, were subject and subsequent to the rights of the plaintiff as the owner of the notes and deeds signed by Day; that the property be sold and the defendants foreclosed of their equity of redemption.\n Thereupon defendants appealed to this court solely upon the question of jurisdiction.\n Mr. John T. Richards for appellants. \n\n[200 U.S. 76, 80]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Herman W. Stillman for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n[200 U.S. 76, 82]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Brown delivered the opinion of the court:\n The sole question presented by the record in this case is whether this is a suit to recover the contents of a chose in action in favor of an assignee, which could not have been prosecuted if no assignment or transfer had been made.\n By  1 of the act of August 13, 1888 [25 Stat. at L. 434, chap. 866, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 508], it is provided that no circuit nor district court shall 'have cognizance of any suit . . . to recover the contents of any promissory note or other chose in action in favor of any assignee, or of any subsequent holder, . . . unless such suit might have been prosecuted in such court to recover the said contents if no assignment of transfer had been made.' This language is taken from the original judiciary act of 1789 [1 Stat. at L. 73, chap. 20,  11, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 508], and has been in force, except for a few years, since the foundation of the government.\n In construing this clause the decisions of this court have settled the following propositions:\n\n 1. \nThat a suit to recover the contents of a promissory note or other chose in action is a suit to recover the amount due upon such note, or the amount claimed to be due upon an account, personal contract, or other chose in action. Sere v. Pitot, 6 Cranch, 332, 3 L. ed. 240; Deshler v. Dodge, 16 How. 622, 631, 14 L. ed. 1084, 1088; Bushnell v. Kennedy, 9 Wall. 387, 19 L. ed. 736; Shoecraft v. Bloxham, \n124 U.S. 730\n, 31 L. ed. 574, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 686. \n\n[200 U.S. 76, 83]\n\u00a0\n In Corbin v. Black Hawk County, \n105 U.S. 659\n, 26 L. ed. 1136, a suit to compel the specific performance of a contract was held to be within the statute, Mr. Justice Blatchford observing (page 665, L. ed. 1138): 'The contents of a contract, as a chose in action, in the sense of  629 (U. S. Comp, Stat, 1901, p. 503), are the rights created by it in favor of a party in whose behalf stipulations are made in it which he has a right to enforce in a suit founded on the contract; and a suit to enforce such stipulations is a suit to recover such contents.'\n\n 2. \nThat a suit to foreclose a mortgage is within the inhibition of the act, and can only be maintained where the assignor was competent to file the bill. Sheldon v. Sill, 8 How. 441, 12 L. ed. 1147; Blacklock v. Small, \n127 U.S. 96\n, 32 L. ed. 70, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1096\n\n\n 3. That the bill or other pleading must contain an averment showing that the suit could have been maintained by the assignor if no assignment had been made. Turner v. Bank of North America, 4 Dall, 8, 1 L. ed. 718; Mollan v. Torrance, 9 Wheat. 537, 6 L. ed. 154; Bradley v. Rhines (Bradley v. Hunt) 8 Wall. 393, 19 L. ed. 467; Anderson v.

Northwestern Fuel Co. \n130 U.S. 341\n, 32 L. ed. 905, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 552.\n\n 4. \nThat a suit may be maintained between the immediate parties to a promissory note as indorser and indorsee, provided the requisite diversity of citizenship appears as between them, or upon a new contract arising subsequently to the execution of the original, notwithstanding a suit could not have been maintained upon the original contract. In such case the original contract may be considered to ascertain the amount of the damages. Young v. Bryan, 6 Wheat. 146, 5 L. ed. 228; Bank of United States v. Moss, 6 How. 31, 12 L. ed. 331; Superior v. Ripley, \n138 U.S. 93\n, 34 L. ed. 914, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 288; Mollan v. Torrance, 9 Wheat. 537, 6 L. ed. 154; Marine & River Phosphate Min. & Mfg. Co. v. Bradley, \n105 U.S. 175\n, 26 L. ed. 1034.\n This is primarily a suit to foreclose certain mortgages. Instead of setting up the mortgages, their maturity and nonpayment, and their assignment to plaintiff, leaving to the defendants to plead the release by Stade of October, 1898, as an extinguishment of the mortgages, she has chosen to set forth the entire facts, to attack the release as fraudulent as against \n\n[200 U.S. 76, 84]\n\u00a0\n her, and to insist that the original notes and trust deeds are valid in her hands, and to pray for a foreclosure of the same.\n The gravamen of the suit and the object to be obtained are unaffected by the form of her bill. The suit is still, in substance, a suit to foreclose the trust deeds, and to remove the release as a cloud upon her title to them.\n It may be that an action for fraud might have lain against the parties implicated, regardless of the citizenship of the parties from whom the plaintiff traced her title, or possibly a bill in equity to cancel the release deed of Stade and remove a cloud from the title. But where a bill is filed to foreclose a mortgage, and it appears by the bill itself that the mortgage has been fraudulently released to the mortgagor by a deed of which plaintiff had no notice, and the fraud is a mere incident, the bill is still one to recover the contents of a mortgage, within the meaning of the act, and will not lie in a Federal court unless the plaintiff's assignor might have maintained the bill if no assignment or transfer had been made. It would advantage the plaintiff nothing to obtain a cancelation of the release without also foreclosing the mortgage in the same or a subsequent suit, while a right to foreclose the mortgage could not be established without incidentally avoiding the release.\n In this aspect of the case it would seem to me immaterial whether the plaintiff derived her title directly from Stade, to whom she had advanced money and afterwards purchased the notes and trust deeds, as alleged in the bill, or through William P. Smith, who had obtained the notes and trust deeds from Stade, his debtor, since both Stade and Smith were citizens of the state of Illinois, and the inhibition of the statute would apply in either case.\n The case of Blacklock v. Small, \n127 U.S. 97\n, 32 L. ed. 70, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1096, is similar, and, we think, practically decisive of the one under consideration. A suit was brought in the circuit court for South Carolina by two daughters of John F. Blacklock, who were citizens of Georgia, against certain defendants, who were citizens of South Carolina. It seems that Blacklock had sold a house and lot in \n\n[200 U.S. 76, 85]\n\u00a0\n Charleston to the defendant Small, who had given back a bond and mortgage to secure a portion of the purchase money; that Blacklock subsequently assigned the bond to Alexander Robinson in trust, for his (Blacklock's) children; that Small pretended to pay the bond by making payment to Robinson in Confederate treasury notes; that upon receipt thereof, Robinson satisfied the mortgage and delivered up the bond to Small; that Robinson, in receiving such payment, violated his duty, and was guilty of a breach of trust; that Small, in attempting to pay the debt in illegal currency, with full notice of the trust, had not paid the debt; that the satisfaction of the mortgage was void; that its lien was still subsisting, and that Small was still liable for the amount due upon the bond. It was held that, as the suit was one against Small, founded upon contract, namely, his bond and mortgage in favor of plaintiffs, who claimed only under the assignment made by their father, John F. Blacklock, to the defendant Robinson, such suit would not lie, inasmuch as plaintiffs' assignor, John F. Blacklock, was a citizen of South Carolina and of the same state as Small. In answer to this it was insisted that the suit should not be considered as one founded upon the contract of Small, but as one for the delivery of the bond and mortgage by Small to the plaintiffs, founded on their wrongful detention, and that the foreclosure and sale of the premises prayed for was merely ancillary and incidental. The contention was held to be unsound, Mr. Justice Blatchford saying that the bill was clearly one for a decree for the amount of the bond and a sale of the mortgaged premises. In other words, the foreclosure and sale were treated as the main objects of the bill, and the breach of trust of Small as a mere incident. The cases of Deshler v. Dodge, 16 How. 622, 14 L. ed. 1084, and Bushnell v. Kennedy, 9 Wall. 387, 19 L. ed. 736, were cited and distinguished.\n By analogy to Blacklock v. Small, we think the gravamen of this case must be treated as the foreclosure of the trust deeds in question, and the prayer for a cancelation of the release given by Stade to Friederich Kolze as a mere clearing of the way \n\n[200 U.S. 76, 86]\n\u00a0\n to a decree establishing the title of the plaintiff to the notes and trust deeds. As the plaintiff is thus compelled to trace her title through Stade or Smith, who are both citizens of Illinois, and neither of whom could have prosecuted this suit, she is affected by the same incompetency.\n The case of Holmes v. Goldsmith, \n147 U.S. 150\n, 37 L. ed. 118, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 288, on which the plaintiff relies, is not in point. That was an action by a nonresident against the maker of a note, who had signed it entirely for the benefit of the payee, who was really the party for whose use it was made. The maker and payee were citizens of the same state. The plaintiff, a bona fide holder, had paid full value for it to the payee, who had indorsed it to him. It was held the court had jurisdiction; that evidence showing the real relation of the parties was admissible, and that the jurisdiction of the circuit court 'was properly put by the court below upon the proposition that the true meaning of the restriction in question was not disturbed by permitting the plaintiffs to show that, notwithstanding the terms of the note, the payee was really a maker or original promisor, and did not, by his indorsement, assign or transfer any right of action held by him against the accommodation makers.'\n The decree of the Circuit Court is therefore reversed, and the case remanded to that court, with instructions to dismiss the bill. \n\n\n\n","89":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLANDRAM v.

Kearney.\n\n\n[203 U.S. 56, 60]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is an appeal from a decree of the court of appeals of the District of Columbia affirming a decree of the supreme court upon a bill of review brought by Gabriella K. Jordan, the appellee. The decree under review was rendered in a suit for the construction of the will of Thomas Kearney and for the determination of the validity of a trust created by it, so far as the same concerned land in the District of Columbia. That decree declared the trust bad as attempting to create a perpetuity. Under the bill of review the decree was modified, on demurrer, to the extent of the interest of Gabriella K. Jordan, and the trust was declared valid as to her. 25 App. D. C. 291. The executors of the testator's heirs and a daughter of the said heir appealed to this court.\n Thomas Kearney died on July 5, 1896. The will disposes of land in various places. In item 3 it enumerates the tes- \n\n[203 U.S. 56, 61]\n\u00a0\n tator's property in Washington. In item 5 it devises this and other property upon a trust to be continued until January 1, 1928, and there and elsewhere, with the following exception, makes a fund from the Washington rents and profits to be disposed of as directed in the will. Item 6 is as follows:\n'I hereby authorize and direct that my said trustee shall, during the natural life of my beloved niece, Gabriella K. Jordan, pay over to her regularly each month, as soon as collected, all rents and revenues collected or derived from that certain property described in the third item hereof as lot No. 611 'M' Street, N. W., Washington, D. C.; but, in case said rents and revenues shall at any time be less than the sum of $40 for any one or more months, then my said trustees are hereby authorized and instructed to add to the sum so collected a sufficient amount to make the said amount of $40 for each and every month; it being my desire that she shall have a regular income of at least $40 per month, and that the same shall be paid over to her monthly; but if the income derived from said premises shall amount to a sum in excess of $40 per month, she shall have the whole thereof.' (Rec. 10.)\n\n Item 7 directs the trustee to let all the Washington property, except 611 M street, and out of the rents to pay $90 a month to the testator's daughter, Constance K. Vertner, as ordered in item 5; the residue, so far as necessary, to be applied to the support and education of her three children, named, with further provisions. Item 8 gives the remainder in fee of 611 M street to the testator's grandson, provided that if Gabriella Jordan dies before January 1, 1928, he shall only receive the rents and profits, and if she dies before the grandson reaches the age of twenty-two the rents shall be disposed of as provided in item 7 as to other Washington property. In item 21, the testator, 'for fear that there may be some difficulty in construing the different provisions' of the will, states his intention that all the money \n\n[203 U.S. 56, 62]\n\u00a0\n arising from the Washington rents, 'except that which is to go to Gabriella K. Jordan, shall be placed in a common fund for the payment (1) of taxes, insurance and repairs on said property and of the premises at Luray, Virginia; (2) of (90) ninety dollars per month to my said daughter, Constance K. Vertner. during her natural life; (3) for the support, education, and maintenance of my said three Vertner grandchildren until Lillie K. Vertner shall have arrived at the age of nineteen years, and until Edmund K. and Thomas K. shall have arrived at the age of twenty-two years respectively.'\n The persons in whose favor were made the provisions which were adjudged bad were one of the testator's heirs, his daughter, Constance K. Vertner, and the children of Constance. The daughter pleaded that the other heir, Edmund Kearney, also provided for in the will, died, leaving her his heir, that the trust was bad, and, by implication, that she was entitled to the property which it embraced. She now is dead. By the original decree the whole trust fund, including that given to Gabriella Jordan, went to the testator's heirs as property undisposed of by the will. The only person dissatisfied with that decree was Gabriella Jordan, and, on the other hand, the executors and the children of Constance are the only appellants from the decree on review. According to the rule that has been laid down in this court, Gabriella, as she did not appeal, cannot go beyond supporting the decree and opposing every assignment of error. Mt. Pleasant v. Beckwith, \n100 \nU.S. 514, 527\n, 25 S. L. ed. 699, 702; The Stephen Morgan (The Stephen Morgan v. Good) \n94 U.S. 599\n, 24 L. ed. 266; Chittenden v. Brewster, 2 Wall. 191, 196, 17 L. ed. 839, 841; Field v. Barber Asphalt Paving Co. \n194 \nU.S. 618, 621\n, 48 S. L. ed. 1142, 1153, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 784. We assume this rule to be correct. Although her counsel attempted to argue the validity of the trust as a whole, and other questions, we assume, without deciding, the decree to be unimpeachable and right except so far as appealed from. Therefore we shall confine ourselves to considering whether the gift to Gabriella is so intimately connected with the failing scheme as to fail with it. \n\n[203 U.S. 56, 63]\n\u00a0\n It would be a strong thing to say that we gather from this will an intent that, if the trust so far as it concerns the testatator's descendants should fail because they prefer to take the property by intestacy free from the limitations of the will, therefore the one gift outside his family should be defeated also. The trust is not a metaphysical entity or a Prince Rupert's drop which flies to pieces if broken in any part. It is a provision to benefit descendants and a niece. There is no general principle by which the benefits must stand or fall together. It is true that all the Washington property was given to the trustees in one clause and that a part of the scheme in favor of the testator's grandchildren was the creation of a fund from the rents. But, as is stated in item 21, 611 M street was excepted from the scheme, and the whole income of this lot, or, in other words, an equitable estate in the specified land, is given to Gabriella Jordan for life by item 6. If that were all we see no reason for a doubt that that gift would be good, whether the gift to the other beneficiaries were good or not. The fact that the testator's daughter takes all the rest of the property, instead of her children getting a postponed interest in a part, is no ground for denying to the niece the life estate given to her in an identified and excepted piece of land. It does not make the case any worse that a part of the property thus going to the testator's daughter is the remainder in the estate given to his niece.\n The appellants lay hold of the instructions to the trustees to add to the rents enough to make Gabriella's income up to $40 a month, and argue as if the gift were in substance only a gift of $40 a month from a fund that cannot be established. Such is not the fact. The gift is primarily and in any event a gift of the income of 611 M street. But whatever may be the fate of the rest of the trust we see nothing to hinder the trustees from keeping the income up to $40 from the other property devised to them. Of course, they could not derive income from property not included in the trust, and only the property included is charged with \n\n[203 U.S. 56, 64]\n\u00a0\n the liability. The decree may be modified by inserting after the words 'against his entire estate' the words 'in the District of Columbia.'\n It is objected in argument, although not in the pleadings, that the widow of Edmund Kearney has a right of dower in the Washington estate which descended to him, and that she should have been made party to the bill of review. The fact of the widow's existence does not appear of record as against the appellees, and we agree with the court of appeals that the objection is made too late.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","90":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLINCOLN v.

Supp. 1905, p. 391),  2, we were of opinion that the ratification of 'the actions of the authorities taken in accordance with the provisions of said order and subsequent amendments' was confined to actions which were taken in accordance with the provisions of the order and amendments, which these exactions were not. May 29, 1905, we allowed petitions for rehearing to be filed addressed solely to the matter of ratification, and subsequently ( November 13) a rehearing was granted 'as to the question whether Congress ratified the collection of the sums sought to be recovered in these suits.'\n The cases were reargued January 18 and 19 on that question.\n That the moneys exacted from plaintiffs in error and appellants were illegally exacted is not open to question under our order, unless the act of July 1, 1902, operated to the contrary. The second section of that act reads as follows: 'That the action of the President of the United States heretofore taken by virtue of the authority vested in him as Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy, as set forth in his order of July twelfth, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, whereby a tariff of duties and taxes as set forth by said order was to be levied and collected at all ports and places in the Philippine Islands upon passing into the occupation and possession of the forces of the United States, together with the subsequent amendments of said order, are hereby approved, ratified, and confirmed, and the actions of the authorities of the government of the Philip- \n\n[202 U.S. 484, 497]\n\u00a0\n pine Islands, taken in accordance with the provisions of said order and subsequent amendments, are hereby approved.\n The order of July 12, 1898, by President McKinley, as Commander in Chief, directed that, upon occupation of any ports or places in the Philippine Islands by the forces of the United States, an accompanying tariff of duties and taxes should be levied and collected as a military contribution, and that regulations for its administration should take effect and be in force in the ports and places occupied. Manila was captured August 13, and the next day the custom house was opened and taxes were collected according to the prior Spanish tariff up to November 10, 1898, until which date the order of July 12 had been suspended.\n On the rehearing an order of the military governor of the Philippines of October 26, 1898, which embodied the full text of the customs tariff and regulations, was brought forward, and was, in all essential respects, a repetition of the order of July 12.\n The Porto Rican cases were decided May 27, 1901, and in June the Secretary of War cabled the commission at Manila that: 'The most obvious distinction between the status of Porto Rico and the Philippines, after the cession, indicated in the opinions of the court, is in the fact that Porto Rico was, at the time of cession, in full peaceable possession, while a state of war has continued in the Philippines. As the question of the President's power to impose duties in the Philippine Islands under the existing conditions of military occupation has not been decided by the court, the President has determined to continue to impose duties as heretofore.'\n Undoubtedly the order of July 12, 1898, contemplated vessels from America as well as others, yet that order, having been made in time of war, for a military contribution, when the Philippines did not belong to us, must be taken to have contemplated them, as it contemplated those from other countries, as vessels foreign to the country, and to have imposed the tax upon them qua foreign. The military tax was, so to speak, a seizure of Spanish revenues. That was what the order meant \n\n[202 U.S. 484, 498]\n\u00a0\n when it was passed, and a change of circumstances did not change its meaning. Neither was the meaning changed by any amendment. The ground on which it was kept in force by the Secretary of War, June 8, 1901, was that the Philippines were still in a state of war. If that view had been correct the order would have applied and would have had lawful effect; but it turned out not to be correct.\n The ratification may be assumed to apply to the order as actually made, and not to have been limited to such an order or so much of this order as the President had a right to make. But it does not construe the order, and, as it confines the ratification to actions in accordance with the order and amendments, the question what actions were in accordance with them is for us. The statute does not ratify all actions or all collections of taxes, as it easily might have done, but only actions in accordance with the order. If the order, properly construed, did not purport to apply to vessels unless they were either enemy or foreign, then, when a vessel ceased to be foreign, the order did not apply, and a tax upon such a vessel, not being in accordance with the order, is not ratified by the act. This construction is favored by the consideration that the suits had been begun when the act of July 1, 1902, was passed, and that, even if Congress could deprive plaintiffs of their vested rights in process of being asserted (Hamilton v. Dillin, 21 Wall. 73, 22 L. ed. 528), still it is not to be presumed to do so on language which, literally taken, has a narrower sense.\n Moreover, the act of July, 1902, was passed with full knowledge and after careful consideration of the decisions of this court, and Congress was aware that grave doubt, at least, had been thrown upon its power to ratify a tax under circumstances like the present. De Lima v. Bidwell, \n182 \nU.S. 1, 199\n, 200 S., 45 L. ed. 1041, 1057, 1058, 21 Sup.Ct.Rep. 743. This affords a special reason for believing that if it had intended to encounter the limitations of that case, it would have done so in clear words from which there was no escape.\n It should also be remembered that there was a powerful opposition in Congress, and that the phraseology of the act prob- \n\n[202 U.S. 484, 499]\n\u00a0\n ably represents all that it was deemed safe to ask. Every consideration requires that the ambiguous language of the act should not be stretched beyond the exact and literal meaning of the words. In a literal sense they ratify only actions in accordance with the order, construed as it would have been construed by this court had it come before us upon the day when it was made.\n It is not a sufficient answer to say that the ratification was meaningless unless it embraced duties collected on imports from the United States after April 11, 1899, because the exactions before were legal. The instances are many where Congress, out of abundant caution, has ratified what did not need, or was afterwards found not to have needed, ratification. Cross v. Harrison, 16 How. 164, 14 L. ed. 889; Prize Cases, 2 Black, 635, 17 L. ed. 459.\n It would be inadmissible to lay down as a general rule that a particular ratification covered what was not, in the judgment of the courts, included or intended to be, simply because it might be thought to have been otherwise unnecessary.\n In these cases, however, the ratification act was not otherwise meaningless. Duties were collected under the order of July 12, 1898, as a military contribution while the war with Spain was in progress. The treaty was signed December 10, 1898, and the President, on December 21, issued an order proclaiming the sovereignty of the United States in the islands, and directing duties and taxes to be collected in future as public revenues for the support of the government. When the treaty was ratified the applicable laws of the United States became operative; but the President, nevertheless, continued in force the tariff created by the order of July 12, 1898, and, by an order of April 21, 1899, established a collection district with Manila as the chief port of entry, and under these orders collections of duties were made. This involves the question whether, after April 11, 1899, the President could have enforced any tariff other than such as existed under acts of Congress or might be sanctioned by Congress. And that question was put at rest by this ratification. \n\n[202 U.S. 484, 500]\n\u00a0\n Much more might be said, but we think it would needlessly prolong this opinion.\n Notwithstanding the able argument of the Attorney General, we adhere to the conclusion previously announced.\n Judgments reversed.\n\n Mr. Justice White, with whom concurs Mr. Justice McKenna, dissenting:\n Although I dissented in De Lima v. Bidwell, \n182 U.S. 1\n, 45 L. ed. 1041, 21 Sup.Ct.Rep. 743; Dooley v. United States, \n182 U.S. 220\n, 45 L. ed. 1065, 21 Sup.Ct.Rep. 762; and Fourteen Diamond Rings v. United States, \n183 U.S. 176\n, 46 L. ed. 138, 22 Sup.Ct.Rep. 59,-nevertheless I agreed to the judgment of reversal as previously rendered in this case. \n197 U.S. 429\n, 49 L. ed. 819, 25 Sup.Ct.Rep. 455. I was constrained so to do because to me it seemed that the determination of the substantial issues in the case were foreclosed by the prior cases above mentioned, which were binding on me under the rule of stare decisis. It is true that in this case, as previously argued and decided, there was present the question of an alleged ratification by Congress of the imposition and collection of the taxes in controversy; but, on the former argument, my attention was not directed to public reports and documents throwing light upon the scope of the ratifying act, as was done on the present argument. Construing the act of Congress which is relied upon to establish the ratification, by the light of the public documents referred to, my mind sees no possible escape from the conclusion that that act was intended to, and did, ratify the collection of the charges complained of. Having no doubt of the power of Congress to ratify, to my mind it clearly results that I erred in giving my assent to the previous judgment of reversal, and I therefore dissent from the opinion and conclusion of the court now announced.\n I am authorized to say that Mr. Justice McKenna concurs in this dissent. \n\n\n\n","91":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLOONEY v. METROPOLITAN R CO(1906)\nNo. 173\nArgued: Decided: February 19, 1906\n\n\n\n Messrs. Maurice D. Rosenberg, Alexander Wolf, and Simon Lyon, for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. J. J. Darlington for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n Action brought by plaintiff as administratrix of the estate of James F. Looney, deceased against the defendants, for damages for the death of her intestate, alleged to have been caused by defendants. Judgment went against plaintiff in the supreme court of the District of Columbia, which was affirmed by the court of appeals.\n After the plaintiff had rested her case the court directed the jury to return a verdict for the defendants. The correctness of this ruling is the question in the case.\n The declaration consists of four counts. The first three allege the employment of the deceased by each of defendant \n\n[200 U.S. 480, 481]\n\u00a0\n companies respectively. In the fourth the allegation is that he was rightfully and lawfully in the discharge of his duties.\n Looney was employed as a 'pitman' by the Washington & Great Falls Railroad Company (now the Washington Railway & Electric Company), and was, on the day of his death-July 28, 1901-in one of the 'plow pits' located on the lines of the company, near its terminus at Thirty-sixth street and Prospect avenue northwest.\n The Metropolitan Company's line connects at this point with that of the Great Falls line. The latter company uses the overhead system. By this system the power is conveyed to the car by means of a 'trolley pole' attached to the top of the car and made to touch the trolley wire when used to propel the car. The Metropolitan Company uses the underground system by means of a 'plow,' so called, projecting through a slot in the tracks to an underground current. The two companies have a trackage arrangement, whereby the cars of the Metropolitan Company run over the line of the other company. The cars of the Metropolitan Company, therefore, are equipped not only with a 'plow' and mechanism for the underground system, but with a trolley pole and mechanism for an overhead system. To attach these mechanisms to their respective systems it is necessary to run a car over an excavation on the line of the Great Falls Company known as the 'pit.' The 'pitman' is thus emabled to remove the 'plow' from a car to be transferred from the Metropolitan line to the Great Falls line, and adjust or attach the wires or 'leads' necessary for the operation of the car over the Great Falls line. While doing this Looney was killed, the plaintiff contends, through the negligence of the conductor of the car in permitting the trolley pole to come in contact with the trolley wire, whereby a current of electricity was transmitted to the motive machinery. And this is the ground of negligence charged in the declaration. In every count it is alleged 'before said intestate entered said plow pit it became the duty of the defendants, and each of them, to keep, or cause to be kept, the electric current so cut \n\n[200 U.S. 480, 482]\n\u00a0\n off from said pit as not to injure the said intestate; and the plaintiff says that said intestate, having entered said pit in obedience to said direction to him as aforesaid, said defendants negligently failed to keep, or cause to be kept, cut off, as aforesaid, said electric current from said pit while said intestate was therein for the purpose aforesaid, whereby and by reason of said negligence the said intestate was so severely shocked and injured by said electric current that he almost immediately died.'\n At the trial there was evidence given by the plaintiff of the arrangement between the defendant companies as to the exchange of cars, and to the relation of their respective employees. On this evidence the parties base opposing contentions, the defendants contending that the conductor and Looney were fellow servants, the plaintiff contending that they were not. Both of the lower courts sustained the contention of the defendants. The court of appeals beside intimated a belief that the testimony on behalf of plaintiff rather tended to show accident than negligence. If this be so, or if the evidence fails to establish whether the death was caused by accident or negligence, the judgment should be affirmed, and it will be unnecessary to decide whether Looney and the conductor were fellow servants. We will assume, for the purposes of the case, that they were not fellow servants.\n The accident was seen by two persons, Margaret Mawson and Helen Gertrude Coon. The former testified that she was sitting in her room on the second floor of her house, which is on Prospect avenue, 75 feet or more from the 'pit.' She saw the car turn the curve from Thirty-sixth street into Prospect avenue, and 'that the trolley pole was up and the trolley wheel against the overhead wire, all the time after the car got into Prospect avenue until it stopped over the pit; that while the car was coming from Thirty-sixth street down to the pit she saw Looney, the deceased, enter the pit through the south trapdoor. That after the car stopped over the pit she saw him go up under the car and take the plow off. That \n\n[200 U.S. 480, 483]\n\u00a0\n after he took the plow off she saw him go up under the car again and put the wires up in the car to connect with the overhead trolley, and that while he was in that position she heard him holler and drop down, and the motorman turned and said 'For God's sake, fix that trolley!' and the conductor then pulled the trolley down, but did not before that time. . . . That the accident did not happen until after the car stopped and the deceased had removed the plow and had gone up under the car again and was putting up the wires. That she saw the movements of the deceased under the car through the trapdoor. That she could see his hands taking off the plow; could see nothing but his hands then; that after he took off the plow and went up under the car, she could see a part of his body above the surface of the street. That the pit was deep enough for a man to stand up in; that she heard no bell ring, nor signal of any sort; her hearing was good enough to hear a bell if one had been rung. That he had to use his hands to remove the plow and also put the overhead current on, and she saw him twist his hands when he got the shock.'\n Helen Gertrude Coon testified that she was a daughter of the preceding witness and lived with her; that she saw the accident from the front porch of the house, which was about on the level with the sidewalk of Prospect avenue. She saw the car run around the curve from Thirty-sixth street, come down the avenue, and stop over the pit. She was not certain whether the pole was touching the wire before the car stopped over the pit, but the pole was touching the wire or came in contact with it while deceased was taking off the plow. 'That her attention was directed to the fact of the trolley being in contact with the wire from the fact that the deceased gave a groan, and the motorman said 'For God sake, pull that trolley down!' That some one said 'Pull the car off the pit!' That she saw deceased take the plow off and then go up under the car to throw the overhead current on. That after he took the plow off and was putting the overhead current on, she heard him groan. That she heard no bells or signals given. \n\n[200 U.S. 480, 484]\n\u00a0\n That he had to use his hands to remove the plow and also to put the overhead current on, and she saw him twist his hands when he got the shock. That she saw all this while looking under the car from where she was sitting on the porch. That they took the body up out of the pit over which the car had been standing.'\n A passenger on the car testified that he heard one bell ring, and immediately the conductor took the rope that holds the trolley rod in his hands, but he did not notice him do anything else. In about a minute and a half there 'was a groan down in the hole and he jumped down and saw the man lying on his face. He heard some one say 'For God's sake, hold the rod down; pull the pole down!'\n Another witness testified that he lived on Prospect avenue, and was in front of his house, lighting the fire in his automobile. He did not notice the car before it stopped. While it was standing over the pit he heard an exclamation and a groan, and some one said 'Pull that trolley down!' After the exclamation he looked up and saw the trolley against the wire. He was about 75 feet from the car.\n Another witness testified as to the manner of adjusting the plow and 'leads,' and the way a shock could be received by the pitman. It was to the effect that the wires used to connect the motive power with the overhead trolley are called 'leads.' Where the pitman takes hold of them to adjust them they are insulated by a covering of india rubber; but at the ends where they connect with other wires they are uninsulated, and have to be so in order to take the current. If the pitman takes hold of them at the right place and there is no leak, he would not be shocked, even though they were connected with the trolley. 'Wear and tear,' a witness said who was experienced in removing and adjusting plows and wires, 'will cause a leak in the insulation. A leak is when the electricity comes through a hole in the insulation, caused by the wear and tear or from the insulation being old or imperfect.'\n The same witness also testified 'that the company furnishes \n\n[200 U.S. 480, 485]\n\u00a0\n gloves in the pit with which to handle live plows and wires. But it is not customary or required to use the gloves except upon rainy days. On bright days, the car, when over the pit, is supposed to be 'dead,' and you don't take off the plows with gloves; you can't half do your work with them. That danger from electricity is increased from perspiration, rain, or other moisture. That the day of the accident was a bright, sunshiny day. The accident occurred between two and four o'clock P. M.'\n If the trolley was on before the plow was disconnected and removed, the plow would be charged with the full voltage on the line.\n A witness who had experience with the construction of electric railway systems, and was familiar with the action of electricity generally, and had experience in superintending the work of disconnecting a plow from an electric car and adjusting the wires to move an overhead system, testified that, in his opinion as an expert, it would be the duty of a conductor to keep the trolley off the wire until he received some signal from the man beneath the car.\n\n\n (1)\n It will be observed that the deceased did not meet his death while removing the plow. Of this the testimony leaves no doubt. (2) He received the electric shock while adjusting the leads. It follows from the first proposition that the trolley pole was not in contact with the trolley wire when the plow was removed. The argument of plaintiff assumes the contrary, and, indeed, is based entirely on the assumption that the deceased received his death stroke when removing the plow.\n Two questions arise on the second proposition. The leads are insulated except at the ends that go into the connection; they are necessarily uninsulated there in order to take the current. But it was not necessary for the deceased to touch the uninsulated parts in making the connection, and, unless touched, no shock would have been received, even though they had been connected with the current by reason of the trolley being in contact with the wire, unless there was a leak in the \n\n[200 U.S. 480, 486]\n\u00a0\n insulation arising from defective construction or wear and tear in use. Granting, therefore, that the conductor was negligent, one of two things was necessary to cause the accident,-a leak in the insulation, or the act of the deceased in touching the uninsulated ends of the leads. Either one or the other was a necessary condition. If the first existed, the defendants may be charged with liability. If the second, they are exonerated. The burden of proof becomes a factor. The plaintiff in the first instance is not required to prove that the deceased was free from contributory negligence; in other words, the burden of proof of contributory negligence is on the defendant. But, on the other hand, plaintiff must establish grounds of liability against the defendant. To hold a master responsible, a servant must show that the appliances and instrumentalities furnished were defective. A defect cannot be inferred from the mere fact of an injury. There must be some substantive proof of the negligence. Knowledge of the defect or some omission of duty in regard to it must be shown.\n In Texas P. R. Co. v. Barrett, \n166 U.S. 617\n, 41 L. ed. 1136, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 707, the plaintiff (defendant in error in this court) was a foreman in charge of a switch engine, and was injured by the explosion of a boiler of another engine. There was evidence tending to prove that the boiler was and had been in a weak and unsafe state by reason of the condition of the stay bolts, and that if a well-known test had been applied the condition of the bolts would have been discovered. The circuit court instructed the jury that the mere fact of the injury received from the explosion would not entitle plaintiff to recover: that, besides the fact of explosion, he must show that the explosion resulted from the failures of the railroad company to exercise ordinary care either in selecting the engine or in keeping it in reasonably safe repair. The court also instructed the jury that the burden of proof was on the plaintiff throughout the case to show that the boilers and engines that exploded were improper appliances to be used on its railroad by the defendant; that by reason of the particular defects pointed out and in- \n\n[200 U.S. 480, 487]\n\u00a0\n sisted on by the plaintiff the boiler exploded and injured him, and the plaintiff was ignorant of the defects, and did not, by his negligence, contribute to his injury. Passing on these instructions, this court said that they laid down the applicable rule with sufficient accuracy, and in substantial conformity with the views of this court expressed in prior cases which were cited.\n Plaintiff in the case at bar introduced no evidence whatever of a defect in the leads or that leaks were likely to occur, or the amount or degree of inspection necessary to discover them, or that there was an omission of inspection. The case was probably brought and tried on a different theory. It was argued in this court on a different theory. It was argued on the assumption that the deceased was killed when removing the plow. The assumption is directly in the teeth of the testimony. 'The accident did not happen until after the car stopped and the deceased had removed the plow and had gone up under the car again and was putting up the wires.' (Testimony of Margaret Mawson.) And to like effect is the testimony of Miss Coon. 'She saw deceased take the plow off and then go up under the car to throw the overhead current on. That after he took the plow off and was putting the overhead current on, she heard him groan.' And she saw him 'twist his hands when he got the shock.'\n The declaration does not charge a defect in the leads. It charges the negligence to have been in the failure 'to keep, or cause to be kept, cut off' the electric current while the deceased was in the pit, 'whereby and by reason of said negligence the said intestate was so severely shocked and injured by said electric current that he almost immediately died.' In other words, the cause of death was the negligent act of permitting the trolley pole to come in contact with the trolley wire.\n But granting plaintiff is not limited by her declaration, nevertheless she has not satisfied the requirements oflaw in her proof. A plaintiff in the first instance must show negli- \n\n[200 U.S. 480, 488]\n\u00a0\n gence on the part of the defendant. Having done this, he need not go farther in those jurisdictions where the burden of proof is on the defendant to show contributory negligence. In other words, if there is no evidence which speaks one way or the other with reference to contributory negligence of the person killed, then it is presumed that there was no such negligence. Thomp. Neg.  401; Baltimore & P. R. Co. v. Landrigan, \n191 U.S. 461\n, 48 L. ed. 262, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 137; Texas & P. R. Co. v. Gentry, \n163 U.S. 353\n, 41 L. ed. 186, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1104. But the negligence of a defendant cannot be inferred from a presumption of care on the part of the person killed. A presumption in the performance of duty attends the defendant as well as the person killed. It must be overcome by direct evidence. One presumption cannot be built upon another. Douglass v.

The proceedings in Florida were strictly in accordance with the laws of that state. The railroad company did business there, and was permanently liable to service and suit, and the defendant, the present defendant in error, was notified by such publication as the statutes of Florida prescribed. He was not, however, a resident of the state, but lived in Alabama, and the supreme court of the latter state affirmed a judgment in his favor on the ground that the Florida court had no jurisdiction to render the judgment relied on as a defense. 142 Ala. --, 40 South. 1037\n\n\n Whatever doubts may have been felt when this case was decided below are disposed of by the recent decision in Harris v.

CO.(1906)\nNo. 66\nArgued: Decided: December 3, 1906\n\n\n\n Reuben L. Martin brought this action to recover compensation for personal injuries. At the time Martin was injured he was on a train of the railroad company, in the employ of the United States as a railway postal clerk on a route extending from Cleveland, Ohio, to Pittsburg, Pennsylvania. The \n\n[203 U.S. 284, 285]\n\u00a0\n injuries arose from the derailing in Pennsylvania of the train, by the negligence of the crew of a work train, in permitting a switch leading to a side track to be open. Among other defenses the company pleaded a law of Pennsylvania passed April 4, 1868 (P. L. 58), which, it alleged, was applicable, and relieved from responsibility. In reply the plaintiff denied the existence and applicability of the statute, moreover, and defended on the ground that the statute, if existing and applicable, was void, first, because contrary to the power delegated to Congress to establish postoffices and post roads; second, because repugnant to the commerce clause of the Constitution; and, third, because in conflict with the equal protection and due process clauses of the 14th Amendment, and also the clause prohibiting a state from making or enforcing any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.\n On trial before a jury the court held the statute in question to be applicable and valid, and hence operative to defeat a recovery.

Pennsylvania R. Co. \n113 U.S. 221\n, 28 L. ed. 981, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 427, this question was in effect foreclosed against the plaintiff in error. That case was brought to this court from a judgment of the supreme court of Pennsylvania (96 Pa. 258), holding that a railway postal clerk was not a passenger within the meaning of the Pennsylvania act, and hence had no right to recover for injuries suffered by him in consequence of the negligence of an employee of the company. The Federal ground there relied upon was substantially the one here asserted; that is, the power of the government of the United States to establish postoffices and post roads, and the effect of the legislation of Congress and the act of the Postmaster General in appointing mail clerks thereunder. After fully considering the subject the case \n\n[203 U.S. 284, 293]\n\u00a0\n was dismissed because no substantial Federal ground was involved, the court saying (\n113 U.S. 221\n, 28 L. ed. 981, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 428):\n'The person thus to be carried with the mail matter, without extra charge, is no more a passenger because he is in charge of the mail, nor because no other compensation is made for his transportation, than if he had no such charge; nor does the fact that he is in the employment of the United States, and that defendant is bound, by contract with the government, to carry him, affect the question. It would be just the same if the company had contracted with any other person who had charge of freight on the train to carry him without additional compensation. The statutes of the United States which authorize this employment and direct this service do not, therefore, make the person so engaged a passenger, or deprive him of that character, in construing the Pennsylvania statute. Nor does it give to persons so employed and right, as against the railroad company, which would not belong to any other person in a similar employment, by others than the United States.'\n\n This brings us to the second contention,-the the repugnancy of the Pennsylvania statute to the commerce clause of the Constitution. It is apparent from the decision in the Price Case, just previously referred to, that in deciding that question we must determine the application of the statute to the plaintiff in error, wholly irrespective of the fact that at the time he was injured he was a railway postal clerk. In other words, the validity or invalidity of the statute is to be adjudged precisely as if the plaintiff was, at the time of the injury, serving for hire in the employment of a private individual or corporation.\n Under the circumstances we have stated, the case of Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Hughes, \n191 U.S. 477\n, 48 L. ed. 268, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 132, clearly establishes the unsoundness of the contention that the Pennsylvania statute in question was void because in conflict with the commerce clause. In that case a horse was shipped from a point in the state of New York to a point in the state of Pennsylvania under a bill of lading which limited the right of \n\n[203 U.S. 284, 294]\n\u00a0\n recovery to not exceeding $100 for any injury which might be occasioned to the animal during the transit. The horse was hurt within the state of Pennsylvania through the negligence of a connecting carrier. In the courts of Pennsylvania, applying the Pennsylvania doctrine which denies the right of a common carrier to limit its liability for injuries resulting from negligence, a recovery was had in the sum of $10,000, the value of the animal. On writ of error from this court the judgment of the supreme court of Pennsylvania was affirmed, it being held that, at least, in the absence of legislation by Congress on the subject, the effect of the commerce clause of the Constitution was not to deprive the state of Pennsylvania of authority to legislate as to those within its jurisdiction concerning the liability of common carriers, although such legislation might, to some extent, indirectly affect interstate commerce. The ruling in the Hughes Case in effect but reiterated the principle adopted and applied in Chicago, M. & St. P. R. Co. v. Solan, \n169 U.S. 133\n, 42 L. ed. 688, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 289, where an Iowa statute forbidding a common carrier from contracting to exempt itself from liability was sustained as to a person who was injured during an interstate transportation.\n The contention that because, in the cases referred to, the operation of the state laws which were sustained was to augment the liability of a carrier, therefore the rulings are inapposite here, where the consequence of the application of the state statute may be to lessen the carrier's liability, rests upon a distinction without a difference. The result of the previous rulings was to recognize, in the absence of action by Congress, the power of the states to legislate, and of course this power involved the authority to regulate as the state might deem best for the public good, without reference to whether the effect of the legislation might be to limit or broaden the responsibility of the carrier. In other words, the assertion of Federal right is disposed of when we determine the question of power, and doing so does not involve considering the wisdom \n\n[203 U.S. 284, 295]\n\u00a0\n with which the lawful power may have been, under stated conditions, exerted.\n And the views previously stated are adequate to dispose of the assertion that the Pennsylvania statute is void for repugnancy to the 14th Amendment. If it be conceded, as contended, that the plaintiff in error could have recovered but for the statute, it does not follow that the legislature of Pennsylvania, in preventing a recovery, took away a vested right or a right of property. As the accident from which the cause of action is asserted to have arisen occurred long after the passage of the statute, it is difficult to grasp the contention that the statute deprived the plaintiff in error of the rights just stated. Such a contention, in reason, must rest upon the proposition that the state of Pennsylvania was without power to legislate on the subject,-a proposition which we have adversely disposed of. This must be, since it would clearly follow, if the argument relied upon were maintained, that the state would be without power on the subject. For it cannot be said that the state had authority in the premises if that authority did not even extend to prescribing a rule which would be applicable to conditions wholly arising in the future.\n The contention that because plaintiff in error, as a citizen of the United States, had a constitutional right to travel from one state to another, he was entitled, as the result of an accident happening in Pennsylvania, to a cause of action not allowed by the laws of that state, is in a different form to reiterate that the Pennsylvania statute was repugnant to the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States. Conceding, if the accident had happened in Ohio, there would have been a right to recover, that fact did not deprive the state Pennsylvania of its authority to legislate so as to affect persons and things within its borders. The commerce clause not being controlling in the absence of legislation by Congress, it follows, of necessity, that the plaintiff in error, as an incident of his right to travel from state to state, did not possess the privilege, as to an accident happening in Pennsylvania, to exert a cause \n\n[203 U.S. 284, 296]\n\u00a0\n of action not given by the laws of that state, and had no immunity exempting him from the control of the state legislation.\n The proposition that the statute denied to the plaintiff in error the equal protection of the laws because it 'capriciously, arbitrarily, and unnaturally,' by the classification made, deprived railway mail clerks of the rights of passengers, which they might have enjoyed if the statute had not been enacted, is without merit. The classification made by the statute does not alone embrace railway mail clerks, but places in a class by themselves such clerks and others whose employment in and about a railroad subjects them to greater peril than passengers in the strictest sense. This general difference renders it imposible in reason to say, within the meaning of the 14th Amendment, that the legislature of Pennsylvania, in classifying passengers in the strict sense in one class and those who are subject to greater risks, including railway mail clerks, in another, acted so arbitrarily as to violate the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","94":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMARTIN v. STATE OF TEXAS(1906)\nNo. 170\nArgued: Decided: February 19, 1906\n\n\n\n\n[200 U.S. 316, 317]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Watson E. Coleman, O. P. Easterwood, and O. E. Smith for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. C. K. Bell, Robert Vance Davidson, and Claude Pollard for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n\n[200 U.S. 316, 318]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan delivered the opinion of the court:\n By an indictment returned in the district court of Tarrant county, Texas, the plaintiff in error was charged with the crime of murder. Having been duly arraigned and pleaded not guilty, the accused (who is a negro) moved to quash the indictment, on the ground, stated in writing under oath, that all persons of the African race had been excluded from the grand jury, because of their race, although about one fourth of the inhabitants of the county, competent under the law to act as grand jurors, were of that race. The facts upon which the motion was based were set out, and the accused, in the written motion, prayed that testimony be heard in support of its grounds. The state's attorney, in writing, denied such discrimination, and offered to prove that only about one hundred and fifty persons of the African race in the county, as compared with twelve thousand whites, were competent under the law to act as grand jurors.\n The accused then moved in writing, verified by his oath, to quash the panel of petit jurors, upon the ground that from the panel had been excluded all persons of the African race, because of their race, although about one fourth of the persons in the county competent under the law to serve as jurors were of that race. The facts set out in that motion were also denied in writing by the state's attorney.\n Both motions were overruled by the court, the accused excepting. There was a verdict of guilty of murder in the first degree, and the accused was sentenced to suffer death. The judgment of conviction was affirmed in the court of criminal appeals, the highest court of the state in which a decision of the case could be had. One of the assignments of error in that court was the overruling of the motion to quash the indictment; but no error was there assigned in respect of the overruling of the motion to quash the panel of petit jurors.\n It is not contended that the Constitution or laws of Texas authorized any discrimination, on account of race merely, in the selection of grand or petit jurors. Nor is it contended that \n\n[200 U.S. 316, 319]\n\u00a0\n the prescribed qualifications for jurors were not appropriate in order to secure an impartial jury for the trial of an accused. Nevertheless, if, upon the hearing of the written motion to quash the indictment, the facts stated in the motion had been established by affirmative proof, or if the trial court had refused to admit evidence to prove them, we should not hesitate to reverse the judgment. For it is the settled doctrine of this court that 'whenever, by any action of a state, whether through its legislature, through its courts, or through its executive or administrative officers, all persons of the African race are excluded solely because of their race or color, from serving as grand jurors in the criminal prosecution of a person of the African race, the equal protection of the laws is denied to him, contrary to the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.' Carter v. Texas, \n177 \nU.S. 442, 447\n, 44 S. L. ed. 839, 841, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 687; Strauder v. West Virginia, \n100 U.S. 303\n, 25 L. ed. 664; Neal v. Delaware, \n103 \nU.S. 370, 397\n, 26 S. L. ed. 567, 574; Gibson v. Mississippi, \n162 U.S. 565\n, 40 L. ed. 1075, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 904; Rogers v. Alabama, \n192 \nU.S. 226, 231\n, 48 S. L. ed. 417, 419, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 257. So if, upon the hearing of the written motion to quash the panel of petit jurors, the facts stated in that motion had been proved, or if the opportunity to establish them by evidence had been denied to the accused, the judgment would be reversed.\n But the record before us makes no such case. Although the accused in each of his written motions prayed the court to hear evidence thereon, it does not appear that he introduced any evidence whatever to prove discrimination against his race bacause of their color, or made any actual offer of evidence in support of either motion. The reasonable inference from the record is that he did not offer any evidence on the charge of discrimination, but was content to rely simply on his verified written motions, although the facts stated in them were controverted by the state. The trial court, it must be assumed from the record, had nothing before it, when deciding the motions to quash, except the written motions and the written answers thereto. In Smith v. Mississippi, \n162 \nU.S. 592, 600\n, 601 S., 40 L. ed. 1082, 1085, 1086, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 900,-which was a prosecution of a negro for the crime \n\n[200 U.S. 316, 320]\n\u00a0\n of murder,-it appeared that the accused, upon grounds stated in writing, and similar to those assigned in this case, moved to quash the indictment. He moved, also, upon similar grounds, in writing, to quash the panel of petit jurors. Each motion was overruled. This court said: 'No evidence was offered in support of the motion by the accused to quash the indictment, unless the facts set out in the written motion to quash, verified 'to the best of his knowledge and belief,' can be regarded as evidence in support of the motion. We are of opinion that it could not properly be so regarded . . . . The facts stated in the written motion to quash, although that motion was verified by the affidavit of the accused, could not be used as evidence to establish those facts, except with the consent of the state prosecutor or by order of the trial court. No such consent was given. No such order was made. The grounds assigned for quashing the indictment should have been sustained by distinct evidence introduced, or offered to be introduced, by the accused. He could not, of right, insist that the facts stated in the motion to quash should be taken as true simply because his motion was verified by his affidavit. The motion to quash was, therefore, unsupported by any competent evidence; consequently, it cannot be held to have been erroneously denied.' To the same effect were Tarrance v. Florida, \n188 \nU.S. 519, 521\n, 47 S. L. ed. 572, 573, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 402, and Brownfield v. South Carolina, \n189 \nU.S. 426, 428\n, 47 S. L. ed. 882, 883, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 513. The present case cannot be distinguished from the Smith Case; and we are unable to hold, upon this record, that it was error to overrule the motions to quash; for, as already stated, it does not appear that the facts stated in those motions were established by evidence, or that the accused, after filing his motions, made any separate offer to prove them by witnesses, or was denied the opportunity to make such proof.\n A different conclusion in this case would mean that, in a criminal prosecution of a negro for crime, an allegation of discrimination against the African race because of their race could be established by simply proving that no one of that race was on the grand jury that returned the indictment, or on the \n\n[200 U.S. 316, 321]\n\u00a0\n petit jury that tried the accused; whereas, a mixed jury, some of which shall be of the same race with the accused, cannot be demanded, as of right, in any case; nor is a jury of that character guaranteed by the 14th Amendment. What an accused is entitled to demand, under the Constitution of the United States, is that, in organizing the grand jury as well as in the impaneling of the petit jury, there shall be no exclusion of his race, and no discrimination against them, because of their race or color. Virginia v. Rives (Ex parte Virginia) \n100 \nU.S. 313, 323\n, 25 S. L. ed. 667, 671; Re Wood (Wood v. Brush) \n140 \nU.S. 278, 285\n, 35 S. L. ed. 505, 508, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 738. Whether such discrimination was practised in this case could have been manifested only by proof overcoming the denial on the part of the state of the facts set out in the written motions to quash. The absence of any such proof from the record in this case is fatal to the charge of the accused that his rights under the 14th Amendment were violated.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","95":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMAYOR AND ALDERMEN OF THE CITY OF VICKSBURG v. VICKSBURG(1906)\nNo. 133\nArgued: Decided: May 21, 1906\n\n\n\n\n[202 U.S. 453, 454]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. J. C. Bryson, M. Dabney, H. C. McCabe, and L. W. Magruder for appellant.\n\n\n\n[202 U.S. 453, 456]\n\u00a0\n Mr. S.S. Hudson, Mr. Murray F. Smith and Mr. J. Hirsh for appellee:\n\n\n[202 U.S. 453, 458]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case was before this court at the October term, 1901, and is reported in \n185 U.S. 65\n, 46 L. ed. 808, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 585. It was then here upon the question of jurisdiction, and it was held that it presented a controversy arising under the Constitution of the United States, such as gave the circuit court jurisdiction. There was no diversity of citizenship, and the bill was filed by the Vicksburg Waterworks Company, a corporation of the state of Mississippi, against the mayor and aldermen of the city of Vicksburg, a municipal corporation of the same state. In view of the full statement of the contents of the bill and the amended bill in the case, as reported in 185 U. S., it is unnecessary to repeat it. On the present appeal a motion to dismiss or affirm was made, which was passed, to be heard with the merits. We regard the decision of this court, when the case was here at the former term, as settling the question of jurisdiction, and affirmatively determining that, upon the bill and amended bill, the complainant alleged a case which involved the application of the Constitution of the United States, and appealable to this court, within  5 of the act of March 3, 1891, as amended. 26 Stat. at L. 827, chap. 517, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 549.\n The suit was brought by the waterworks company, claiming an exclusive right, as against the city, under a contract with it for the construction and maintenance for a period of thirty years of a system of waterworks, which exclusive contract, it was alleged, would be practically destroyed if subjected to the competition of a system of waterworks to be erected by the city itself, which was in contemplation under authority of an act of the legislature of Mississippi, authorizing the mayor and aldermen of the city of Vicksburg to issue bonds to the amount \n\n[202 U.S. 453, 459]\n\u00a0\n of $375,000 to purchase or construct a waterworks system and a sewer system, and for certain other purposes. That act, among other things, required the vote of the electors of the city upon the question of issuing bonds and constructing or buying waterworks; an election was held, and it was voted by a majority of the votes cast that the city should issue bonds to the sum of $150,000 to purchase or construct waterworks for the city. A resolution was passed by the municipal authorities, instructing the mayor and aldermen to notify the waterworks company that liability was denied upon the contract for the use of the waterworks hydrants, and that from and after August, 1900, the city would pay a reason-able compensation for the use of said hydrants. A bill was filed in the equity court in Warren county, Mississippi, averring that the original contract to which the waterworks company claimed to have succeeded was null and void; that the mayor and aldermen had exceeded their powers in making the contract for thirty years; that rates charged to consumers were exorbitant and illegal; that the mayor and aldermen, at a meeting held on November 5, 1900, had resolved that they no longer recognized any liability under said contract; that the Vicksburg Water Supply Company (a former holder of said contract) and the complainant had no rights in said contract, and the city was entitled to have the same canceled and snnulled. And it was held in 185 U. S. that the facts, taken together, presented something more than a case of mere breach of private contract and disclosed an intention and attempt, by subsequent legislation of the city, to deprive the company of its rights under the existing contract, and it was said: 'Unless the city can point to some inherent want of legal validity in the contract, or to some disregard by the waterworks company of its obligations under the contract as to warrant the city in declaring itself absolved from the contract, the case presented by the bill is within the meaning of the Constitution of the United States and within the jurisdiction of the circuit court, as presenting a Federal question.' And it was further \n\n[202 U.S. 453, 460]\n\u00a0\n held that it was a valuable feature of equity jurisdiction to anticipate and prevent threatened injury, and the conclusion was reached that the allegations of the bill made a case for an injunction. The case was thus brought within  5 of the act of March, 1891, as one in which the appeal is directly to this court. See also upon this point Penn Mut. L. Ins. Co. v. Austin, \n168 U.S. 685\n, 42 L. ed. 626, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 223. The motion to dismiss will be overruled.\n Upon the case going back to the circuit court an answer was filed raising issues as to whether the complainant had accepted and performed the agreement in their contract to supply water to the city, and denying the right of the complainant to have and to own the contract and the authority of the city to make an exclusive contract, and detailing other matters not necessary to further set forth.\n Certain questions of fact as to the character of the water wupplied by the complainant, the pressure maintained, and similar questions were decided by the circuit court in favor of the appellees. An examination of the record makes it sufficient for us to say that we find no reason for disturbing the conclusions of the circuit court upon these questions.\n The decree in the case below was in favor of the waterworks company, maintaining its right to the contract for hydrant rentals, and enjoining the city, during the period of the contract, from constructing a waterworks system of its own, and requiring the city to construct a sewer for the disposal of house sewage from the city.\n The assignments of error necessary to be considered are:\n\n 1. \nAs to the alleged error of the court below in permitting a corporation known as the City Waterworks & Light Company, which had intervened in the case, to withdraw from the files its original bill in the nature of a supplemental bill, and striking out certain testimony which had been taken concerning the same.\n\n 2. \nIn enforcing the contract with the city in favor of the complainant, and restraining the city from erecting waterworks of \n\n[202 U.S. 453, 461]\n\u00a0\n its own during the term covered by the contract with the complainant.\n\n 3. \nIn requiring the construction of the sewer by the city.\n We shall proceed to notice these in the order named.\n The City Waterworks & Light Company, on December 2, 1903, filed its petition praying to be admitted as a party complainant in the cause, and set up that it was the owner of the contract sued upon. To this petition the city answered, denying that the City Waterworks & Light Company had purchased, by deed or otherwise, or owned the property, real and personal, of the complainant, the Vicksburg Waterworks Company, and denying that the City Waterworks & Light Company had any interest in the subject-matter of the suit or should be admitted as a party complainant therein. The City Waterworks & Light Company then filed its original bill in the nature of a supplemental bill, on May 5, 1904, after the city had denied that it had any interest in the suit. On May 13, 1904, it filed a motion asking leave to withdraw its petition and bill from the files, which motion was granted by the court, and the motion of the Vicksburg Waterworks Company to withdraw from the files its written consent to the filing of the bill was also sustained, and the court granted the withdrawal of the petition, bill, exhibits, and written consent. Thereupon the city offered a supplemental answer, and asked the court for leave to file the same. This answer made allegations setting forth the transfer of the contract to the City Waterworks & Light Company, and asked for a continuance of the cause, with leave to take testimony to support the averments of this supplemental answer. The court, on the same day, May 13, 1904, overruled the city's motion for leave to file the supplemental answer and for continuance, with leave to take testimony in support thereof, and proceeded to hear the case upon the original pleadings and proofs. It also permitted the withdrawal of certain testimony referring to the City Waterworks & Light Company and the transfer of the contract to it. In view of \n\n[202 U.S. 453, 462]\n\u00a0\n the action of the court upon the pleadings as to the City Waterworks & Light Company, this testimony had become immaterial.\n In the action of the court just recited we can find no ground for a reversal. The City Waterworks & Light Company had come into the case claiming an ownership of the contract which was denied by the city; certain testimony was filed concerning this claim of the company. We think it was discretionary with the court to permit the withdrawal of these pleadings and the suppression of this testimony, and it was likewise within its discretion to permit or deny a further answer by the city setting up the alleged transfer of ownership. These matters, except in cases of gross abuse of discretion, are within the control of the trial court. Chapman v. Barney, \n129 \nU.S. 677, 681\n, 32 S. L. ed. 800, 801, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 426; Dean v. Mason, 20 How. 198, 204, 15 L. ed. 876, 878.\n The principal controversy in the case is as to the correctness of the decree of the court below restraining the city from erecting waterworks of its own within the period named in the contract, which decree proceeded upon the theory that the city had excluded itself from erecting or maintaining a system of waterworks of its own during that period. The contract for the construction of the waterworks was originally made on November 18, 1886, by an ordinance of that date, granting to Samuel R. Bullock & Company, their associates, successors, and assigns, the right and privilege to construct a waterworks system in the city of Vicksburg, for the period of thirty years from the date of the ordinance. Section 1 of the ordinance provided that, in consideration of the public benefit to be derived therefrom, the exclusive right and privilege was granted for the period of thirty years from the time the ordinance took effect, to Samuel R. Bullock & Company, their associates, successors, and assigns, to erect, maintain, and operate a system of waterworks in accordance with the terms of the ordinance, and of using the streets, alleys, etc., within the corporate limits of the city, as they then existed or might thereafter be extended for the purpose of laying pipes and mains and other conduits, \n\n[202 U.S. 453, 463]\n\u00a0\n and erecting hydrants and other apparatus for the obtaining of a good water supply for the city of Vicksburg and for its inhabitants, for public and private use. There was a stipulation for certain hydrants for the term of thirty years at an annual rental of $65.00 each, and it was provided that Bullock & Company, their associates, successors, and assigns, might procure the organization of a waterworks company, and assign their rights and privileges under the ordinance to such corporation. It is disclosed in the record that Bullock & Company procured the organization of a waterworks company, the Vicksburg Water Supply Company, which company executed a mortgage to the Farmers' Loan & Trust Company of New York, which included 'All of its real and personal property, goods, chattels, owned now or which may hereafter be acquired by it, including its land, rents, waterworks, buildings, pump houses, standpipes, reservoirs, machinery, pipes, mains, hydrants, apparatus, and equipments, situated in the city of Vicksburg, county of Warren, state of Mississippi, together with all and singular the tenements, hereditaments, and appurtenances thereunto belonging or in any wise appertaining, and the reversion and reversions, remainder and remainders, tolls, rents, issues, income, profits accruing therefrom; also all and singular the corporate franchises, privileges, rights, liabilites which the water company now has and can exercise, or shall hereafter acquire and possess, and also all the estate, right, title, interest, property, possessions, claim, and demand whatsoever, as well in law as in equity, of the water company, of and to the property above described or hereafter to be acquired, and each and every part and parcel thereof, with the appurtenances, to have and to hold all and singular the above granted and described premises with the appurtenances unto the trustee and its successors forever.' Upon the foreclosure of this mortgage the property was bid off by M. O. Crumpler on the 8th day of August, 1900. He assigned his bid to the Vicksburg Waterworks Company, complainant in this case, and the Vicksburg Water Supply Company on October 18, 1900, by a quitclaim \n\n[202 U.S. 453, 464]\n\u00a0\n deed, conveyed all the property described in the deed of trust to the Farmers' Loan & Trust Company, to the Vicksburg Waterworks Company.\n A preliminary question is made that the Vicksburg Waterworks Company did not acquire title to the contract rights by virtue of these proceedings. But we are cited to an act of the legislature of Mississippi, approved March 7, 1882 (Laws of 1882, p. 50), which, upon its face, is broad enough to authorize such corporations to borrow money and secure the payment of the same by mortgage or deed of trust upon their property and franchises, and we think the mortgage in question would include the contract rights of the Vicksburg Water Supply Company, and that they would pass by the sale and subsequent quitclaim deed to the Vicksburg Waterworks Company. Where a company is authorized to mortgage its franchises and rights, these may be sold and the purchaser acquire title thereto at the foreclosure sale, although the corporate right to exist may not be sold. Memphis & L. R. R. Co. v. Railroad Comrs. (Memphis & L. R. R. Co. v. Berry) \n112 U.S. 609\n, 28 L. ed. 837, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 299. The power to mortgage the privileges and rights of the corporation must necessarily include the power to bring them to sale to make the mortgage effectual. New Orleans, S. F. & L. R. Co. v. Delamore, \n114 U.S. 501\n, 29 L. ed. 244, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1009, cited and followed in Julian v. Central Trust co. \n193 \nU.S. 93, 106\n, 48 S. L. ed. 629, 636, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 399. We think the mortgage in this case covered and the decree passed the contract rights given originally to the Vicksburg Water Supply company by the ordinance of November 18, 1886\n\n\n It is further urged that the Vicksburg Waterworks Company was organized after the taking effect of the Constitution of Mississippi of 1890, which provided: 'Sec. 178. Corporations shall be formed under general laws only. The legislature shall have power to alter, amend, or repeal any charter of incorporation now existing and revocable, and any that may hereafter be created, whenever, in its opinion, it may be for the public interests to do so; provided, however, that no injustice shall be done to the stockholders.' And it is insisted that the subsequent legislative authority given to the city to issue bonds and \n\n[202 U.S. 453, 465]\n\u00a0\n build its own waterworks amounted to a repeal of the exclusive feature of the grant in the ordinance of 1886, if any it contained. We are cited in support of that proposition to the case of Hamilton Gaslight & Coke Co. v. Hamilton, \n146 U.S. 258\n, 36 L. ed. 963, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 90, considering the provisions of the Constitution of Ohio as to altering or revoking corporate privileges. But we think the right of the Vicksburg Waterworks Company was acquired under the foreclosure and sale of the contract rights conferred in the ordinance of 1886 and covered in the mortgage, as we have stated. Furthermore, the Mississippi Constitution contains this provision, which is not in the Ohio Constitution, considered in the Hamilton Case, namely: 'Provided [in exercising the right of amendment or repeal of a charter] no injustice shall be done to the stockholders.' If it be true that the complainant below had a binding contract excluding competition by the city in furnishing a water supply for a period of thirty years, we think it would be a palpable injustice to the stockholders to permit the competition of the city by new works of its own; which, whether operated profitably for the municipality or not, might be destructive of all successful operation in furnishing water to consumers by the private company.\n Coming directly, then, to the question whether this is an exclusive contract, the question resolves itself into two branches. Had the city the right to make a contract excluding itself? And, if so, has the contract now under consideration that effect. The legislature of the state of Mississippi on March 8, 1886, in the charter of the city of Vicksburg, among others, gave to the city the following powers: 'To provide for the erection and maintenance of a system of waterworks to supply said city with water, and to that end to contract with a party or parties who shall build and operate waterworks.' The question is now, not whether the city might make a contract giving the exclusive right as against all third persons to erect a system of waterworks, but waether it can, in exercising this legislative power, exclude itself from constructing and operating waterworks for the period of years covered by the contract. It is \n\n[202 U.S. 453, 466]\n\u00a0\n said the supreme court of Mississippi has denied this power, and we are referred to Collins v. Sherman, 31 Miss. 679, Gains v. Coates, 51 Miss. 335, and Greenville Waterworks Co. v. Greenville (Miss.) 7 So. 409.\n We do not think any of these cases decisive of the point. In Collins v. Sherman, it was held that the charter granting the right to a turnpike and ferry company to maintain a ferry upon a particular river, which contained no grant of an exclusive right, did not prevent the legislature from afterwards incorporating another company, authorized to establish a turnpike and ferry upon the same river and upon the same line of travel, although the establishment of the latter company might materially impair the value of the franchise granted to the first company. The cases were cited and the general principles stated that exclusive privileges could not be granted by implication; there was no attempt to make the first franchise exclusive in that case. In Gaines v. Coates it was held that the act in question did not confer upon a certain corporation the exclusive privilege of weighing cotton; that there was nothing in the charter indicating any intention to confer an exclusive right, and many cases were cited, including a number from this court, to the effect that exclusive privileges are not to be granted by implication. In Greenville Waterworks Co. v. Greenville the city of Greenville had made a contract with the Greenville Waterworks Company to build a system of waterworks by a certain time, but the company had failed to comply with the contract, the time was extended, and the company again defaulted. The city thereupon canceled the contract and made a new contract with the Delta Waterworks Company. Then the Greenville Waterworks Company filed a bill to enjoin the city and the other company from carrying out the contract, and prayed for a specific performance of its contract with the city. The court held that there was no power given by the charter of the city of Greenville to grant a monopoly for a long series of years for supplying the city and its inhabitants with water. The question whether the city could \n\n[202 U.S. 453, 467]\n\u00a0\n exclude itself in such a contract as we have now before us was not met or passed upon. But if the doctrine of Mississippi were otherwise, and with due respect to which the decisions of its highest court are justly entitled, it has been frequently held, in passing upon a question of contract, in circumstances such as exist in this case involving the constitutional protection afforded by the Constitution of the United States, this court determines the nature and character thereof for itself. Douglas v. Kentucky, \n168 U.S. 488\n, 42 L. ed. 553, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 199. And we think the question of the power of the city to exclude itself from competition is controlled in this court by the case of Walla Walla v. Walla Walla Water Co. \n172 U.S. 1\n, 43 L. ed. 341, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 77. In that case the city charter of Walla Walla provided,  10, that no exclusive grant should be made, nor should prevent the council from granting the right to others; and  11 provided: 'The city of Walla Walla shall have power to erect and maintain waterworks within or without the city limits, or to authorize the erection of the same for the purpose of furnishing the city, or the inhabitants thereof, with a sufficient supply of water.' The contract was made for twenty-five years. The grant was not made exclusive to the waterworks company, but the city agreed not to erect waterworks of its own, and reserved the right to take, condemn, and pay for the works of the company at any time after the expiration of the contract. It was held by this court that the city might thus exclude itself from competition during the period of the contract, and of this feature of the contract the following pertinent language was used by Mr. Justice Brown, who delivered the opinion of the court:\n'An agreement of this kind was a natural incident to the main purpose of the contract, to the power given to the city by its charter to provide a sufficient supply of water, and to grant the right to use the streets of the city for the purpose of laying water pipes to any persons or association of persons for a term not exceeding twenty-five years. In establishing a system of waterworks the company would necessarily incur a large expense in the construction of the power house and the \n\n[202 U.S. 453, 468]\n\u00a0\n laying of its pipes through the streets, and, as the life of the contract was limited to twenty-five years, it would naturally desire to protect itself from competition as far as possible, and would have a right to expect that at least the city would not itself enter into such competition.'\n\n'Cases are not infrequent where, under a general power to cause the streets of a city to be lighted or to furnish its inhabitants with a supply of water, without limitation as to time, it has been held that the city has no right to grant an exclusive franchise for a period of years; but these cases do not touch upon the question how far the city, in the exercise of an undoubted power to make a particular contract, can hedge it about with limitations designed to do little more than bind the city to carry out the contract in good faith and with decent regard for the rights of the other party.'\n\n In the Walla Walla Case the same general power to make the contract existed. There was an express provision against making an exclusive contract, and this court held that for the period mentioned in the contract, and as incident to the protection of the rights of the contractor, the city might exclude itself from competition. We think that case is decisive of the present one on this proposition.\n We shall proceed to consider whether the language of the contract is such as to prevent the city, during the period named therein, from erecting a waterworks of its own.\n The case of Lehigh Water Co.'s Appeal, 102 Pa. 515, cited by counsel for appellants, is not in point. The act provided 'the right to have and enjoy the franchises and privileges of such incorporation within the district or locality covered by its charter shall be an exclusive one; and no other company shall be incorporated for that purpose until the said corporation shall have, from its earnings, realized and divided among its stockholders, during five years, a dividend equal to 8 per centum per annum upon its capital stock.' Of this grant Mr. Justice Paxon, who delivered the opinion of the court, observed: \n\n[202 U.S. 453, 469]\n\u00a0\n 'While the language from the act of 1874, above quoted, would seem to favor the exclusive right claimed by the water company, a careful examination of clause 3 of  34 shows that the legislature intended that the right should be exclusive only as against other water companies; for, immediately in this connection, occur the words 'and no other ocmpany shall be incorporated for that purpose until the said corporation shall have, from its earnings, realized and divided among its stockholders, during five years, a dividend equal to 8 per centum per annum upon its capital stock.' The provision that another company shall not be incorporated was not intended to prohibit a city or borough from providing its citizens with pure water by means of works constructed by itself from money in its own treasury.'\n In considering this contract we are to remember the well-established rule in this court which requires grants of franchises and special privileges to be most strongly construed in favor of the public, and that, where the privilege claimed is doubtful, nothing is to be taken by mere implication as against public rights. This rule has been applied to a series of contracts in waterworks and lighting cases, and we have no disposition to detract from its force and effect. And unless the city has excluded itself in plain and explicit terms from competition with the waterworks company during the period of this contract, it cannot be held to have done so by mere implication. The rule, as applied to waterworks contracts, tracts, was last announced in this court in Knoxville Water Co. v. Knoxville, \n200 U.S. 22\n, 50 L. ed. --, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 224, decided at this term, citing previous cases.\n The contract in the respect under consideration is found in  1 of the ordinance, and undertakes to give to Bullock & Company, their associates, successors, and assigns, the exclusive right and privilege, for the period of thirty years from the time the ordinance takes effect, of erecting, maintaining, and operating a system of waterworks, with certain privileges named, for the furnishing of a supply of good water to the city of Vicksburg and its inhabitants, for public and private use. \n\n[202 U.S. 453, 470]\n\u00a0\n Without resorting to implication or inserting anything by way of intendment into this contract, it undertakes to give by its terms to Bullock & Company, their associates, successors, and assigns, the exclusive right to erect, maintain, and operate waterworks, for a definite term, to supply water for public and private use. These are the words of the contract and the question upon this branch of the case is, conceding the power of the city to exclude itself from competition with the grantee of these privileges during the period named, has it done so by the express terms used? It has contracted with the company in language which is unmistakable, that the rights and privileges named and granted shall be exclusive. Consistently with this grant, can the city submit the grantee to what may be the ruinous competition of a system of waterworks to be owned and managed by the city, to supply the needs, public and private, covered in the grant of privileges to the grantee? It needs no argument to demonstrate, as was pointed out in the Walla Walla Case, that the competition of the city may be far more destructive than that of a private company. The city may conduct the business without regard to the profit to be gained, as it may resort to public taxation to make up for losses. A private company would be compelled to meet the grantee upon different terms, and would not likely conduct the business unless it could be made profitable. We cannot conceive how the right can be exclusive, and the city have the right, at the same time, to erect and maintain a system of waterworks which may, and probably would, practically destroy the value of rights and privileges conferred in its grant. If the right is to be exclusive, as the city has contracted that it shall be, it cannot, at the same time, be shared with another; particularly so when such division of occupation is against the will of the one entitled to exercise the rights alone. It is difficult to conceive of words more apt to express the purpose that the company shall have the undivided occupancy of the field so far as the other contracting party is concerned.\n The term 'exclusive' is so plain that little additional light \n\n[202 U.S. 453, 471]\n\u00a0\n can be gained by resort to the lexicons. If we turn to the Century dictionary we find it defined to mean 'Appertaining to the subject alone; not including, admitting, or pertaining to any other or others; undivided; sole: as, an exclusive right or privilege; exclusive jurisdiction.' We think, therefore, it requires no resort to implication or intendment in order to give a construction to this phase of the contract; but, on the other hand, the city has provided and the company has accepted a grant which says in plain and apt words that it shall have an exclusive right,-a sole and undivided privilege. To hold otherwise, in our view, would do violence to the plain words of the contract, and permit one of the contracting parties to destroy and defeat the enjoyment of a right which has been granted in plain and unmistakable terms. On the authority of the Walla Walla Case, the city had the power to exclude itself for the term of this contract, giving the words used only the weight to which they are entitled, without strained or unusual construction, and we think it was distinctly agreed that, for the term named, the right of furnishing water to the inhabitants of Vicksburg under the terms of the ordinance was vested solely in the grantee, so far, at least, as the city's right to compete is concerned. Any other construction seems to us to ignore the language employed, and to permit one of the parties to the contract to destroy its benefit to the other. We think the court below did not err in reaching this conclusion.\n The court decreed as to a sewer, which the record discloses was originally a surface-water sewer, that the city should refrain from permitting future connections therewith for the conveyance of house sewage. The company complaining that this sewer entered into the source of supply above the intake of the waterworks, the court, by a mandatory injunction, required the city of Vicksburg to extend the sewer and construct an outlet therefor, so as to discharge sewage into the Yazoo or Mississippi river, below the intake of the complainant, provided, if the city was unable to construct such sewer within \n\n[202 U.S. 453, 472]\n\u00a0\n twelve months from date, application might be made to the court for an extension of time. The error assigned in this behalf is as to the award of the mandatory injunction. We think the court erred in this respect, and that it had no authority to issue a mandatory injunction requiring the city to construct a sewer, irrespective of the exercise of discretion vested by law in the municipal authorities to determine the practicability of the sewer ordered, the availability of taxation for the purpose, and the like matters; and we think that the exercise of this authority is primarily vested in the municipality, and not in the courts.\n We find no error in the decree of the Circuit Court enforcing the contract rights of the complainant and enjoining the city from erecting its own works during the term of the contract, but error in granting a mandatory injunction as to the sewer, and in that respect the decree will be modified, and, as so modified, affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan, dissenting:\n I cannot agree to the opinion and judgment in this case.\n In my opinion, the city of Vicksburg had no authority, under the Constitution and laws of Mississippi, to give an exclusive right to any person or corporation to maintain a system of waterworks for the benefit of that city and its people.\n But if I am wrong in this view, it ought not, in my judgment, to be held upon the present record that the city has, by ordinance or otherwise, precluded itself from establishing and maintaining, at its own expense, a system of waterworks for the benefit of its people. The contrary cannot be maintained, unless we hold that a municipal corporation may, by mere implication, bargain away its duty to protect the public health and the public safety as they are involved in supplying the people with sufficient water. Nothing can be more important or vital to any people than that they should be supplied with \n\n[202 U.S. 453, 473]\n\u00a0\n pure, wholesome water. And yet it is now held that it was competent for the city of Vicksburg, by mere implication, to so tie its hands that it cannot perform the duty which it owes in that regard to its people. \n\n\n\n","96":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMCALISTER v. HENKEL(1906)\nNo. 341\nArgued: Decided: March 12, 1906\n\n\n\n Messrs. De Lancey Nicoll, Junius Parker, and John D. Lindsay for appellant.\n Messrs. Henry W. Taft, Felix H. Levy, and Attorney General Moody for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice Brown, delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case involves many of the questions already passed upon in the opinion in Hale v. Henkel, \n201 U.S. 43\n, 50 L. ed. --, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 370, differing from that case, however, in two important particulars: First, in the fact that there was a complaint and charge made on behalf of the United States against the American Tobacco Company and the Imperial Tobacco Company under the so-called Sherman act, and second, that the subpoena pointed out the particular writings sought for (three agreements), giving in each case the date, the names of \n\n[201 U.S. 90, 91]\n\u00a0\n the parties, and, in one instance, a suggestion of the contents.\n The witness McAlister, who was secretary and a director of the American Tobacco Company, refused to answer or produce the documents for practically the same reasons assigned by the appellant Hale; demanding to be advised what the suit or proceeding was and to be furnished with a copy of the proposed indictment. A copy of one of the agreements with three English companies and certified by the Consul General of the United States is contained in the record.\n For reasons already partly set forth, we think that the immunity provided by the 5th Amendment against self-incrimination is personal to the witness himself, and that he cannot set up the privilege of another person or of a corporation as an excuse for a refusal to answer; in other words, the privilege is that of the witness himself, and not that of the party on trial. The authorities are practically uniform on point. Com. v. Shaw, 4 Cush. 549, 50 Am. Dec. 813; State v. Wentworth, 65 Me. 234, 241, 20 Am. Rep. 688; Ex parte Reynolds, 15 Cox, C. C. 108, 115. In New York L. Ins. Co. v. People, 195 Ill. 430, 63 N. E. 264, the privilege was claimed by a corporation, but the agent of an insurance company was permitted to testify in a suit for the recovery of a statutory penalty to facts showing the performance by the corporation of the act prohibited. Indeed, the authorities are numerous to the effect that an officer of a corporation cannot set up the privilege of a corporation as against his testimony or the production of their books.\n The questions are the same as those involved in the Hale Case, without the objectionable feature of the subpoena, and the order of the Circuit Court is, therefore, affirmed. \n\n\n\n","97":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMCDERMOTT v. SEVERE(1906)\nNo. 244\nArgued: Decided: May 28, 1906\n\n\n\n\n\n[202 U.S. 600, 601]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George P. Hoover and Charles A. Douglas, for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. A. S. Worthington, William Meyer Lewin, and Charles L. Frailey for defendant in error. \n\n[202 U.S. 600, 602]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is an action to recover damages because of an injury received by Charles E. Severe, an infant, who was run over at a plank crossing of the railway company, the railroad then being in charge of the defendant, operating the same as receiver.\n The plaintiff below recovered judgment in the supreme court of the District, which was affirmed in the court of appeals.\n At the place of the accident there was a plank crossing, the planks laid between and on either side of the rails, at a point where a street was opened to the westward, and, on the other side of the track, a footpath, but no thoroughfare for vehicles. The crossing was one of the regular stopping places of the cars of the street railway near Riverdale, Maryland. The words 'Cars stop here' were on both sides of the telegraph pole at the crossing. At the time of the injury plaintiff was six years and ten months old. His youngest brother, Raymond, was a little over five years of age, and with them another brother, Edward, about nine years old. The injured boy, at the time he was hurt, had his foot caught in a space between the rail and the edge of the plank on the inside. There was testimony tending to show that this opening was 2 to 2 11-16 inches wide. The accident happened between 2 and 3 o'clock in the afternoon of August 31, 1902. The testimony discloses that the boys had expected to meet their parents, returning from a visit, about 2 o'clock that afternoon, and went to the crossing for that purpose. Edward, the oldest boy, went to his father's house nearby to get a drink of water; while he was gone the youngest boy, Raymond, got his foot caught in the space between the west rail and the plank next the inside of the rail. Plaintiff came to the assistance of his little brother, whose foot he helped to extricate, and was himself caught in the space between the plank and the rail. Raymond ran to the house to notify Edward that \n\n[202 U.S. 600, 603]\n\u00a0\n the plaintiff's foot was caught. Together the two boys ran back towards the crossing and shortly thereafter the plaintiff was struck and so severely injured that it became necessary to amputate his leg below the knee.\n In the view we take of this case we do not consider it necessary to state in detail the testimony as to the construction of the crossing and the alleged negligence in leaving the space in which the boy's foot was caught. Under the pleadings and the testimony the jury was directed to return a special verdict upon three propositions: 1. Was the defendant guilty of negligence in the improper construction or maintenance of the crossing? 2. Was the defendant guilty of negligence in the improper management of the car? 3. Did the motorman do all in his power to stop the car as soon as he saw the plaintiff's foot was caught in the space between the rail and plank? The jury answered the first and second questions in the affirmative; being unable to agree on the third, the plaintiff consented that it might also be answered in the affirmative.\n In view of these special findings, if the issue concerning either of the first two of them was properly submitted to the jury upon sufficient evidence and found against the company, the judgment of the court of appeals must be affirmed.\n In delivering the opinion of the court of appeals, Mr. Chief Justice Shepard says:\n'It is conceded, by reason of the special findings of the jury, that the defendant was guilty of negligence, not only in the construction and maintenance of the crossing, but also in the management and control of the car; that error in the instructions upon both points must be shown in order to obtain a reversal of the judgment, because either finding alone is sufficient support therefore.' [25 App. D. C. 282.]\n\n It is insisted in argument here that the court ought to have taken the case from the jury because of the insufficiency of the evidence to sustain a verdict. In the view we take of the case as made and submitted concerning the conduct of the motorman at the time of the accident and the instructions given to \n\n[202 U.S. 600, 604]\n\u00a0\n the jury in that connection, we do not deem it necessary to consider the correctness of the charge submitting the question as to the negligent construction of this crossing. We think the testimony was ample to carry the case to the jury upon the question of the negligent conduct of the motorman at the time of the injury, and that this issue was properly left to the jury under instructions which afford no ground for reversal.\n Negligence only becomes a question of law to be taken from the jury when the facts are such that fair-minded men can only draw from them the inference that there was no negligence. If fair-minded men, from the facts admitted, or conflicting testimony, may honestly draw different conclusions as to the negligence charged, the question is not one of law, but of fact, and to be settled by the jury under proper instructions. Richmond & D. R. Co. v. Powers, \n149 U.S. 43\n, 37 L. ed. 642, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 748; Northern P. R. Co. v. Everett, \n152 U.S. 107\n, 38 L. ed. 373, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 474.\n In addition to the facts to which we have adverted upon the branch of the case which we deem it necessary to consider, the testimony tended to show that there was nothing to prevent the motorman from seeing the crossing for a distance more than sufficient to have avoided the injury by controlling or stopping his car; that the boy Edward waved his hat and 'hollered' for the motorman 'to stop,' when the car was 50 or 60 feet away. A passenger who was on the car testified that, his attention being called by the motorman ringing his bell, he saw a larger boy than the one on the track, waving his hand. Another passenger testified that, when from 60 to 100 yards from the place, he saw three boys, apparently standing on the platform or crossing. Plaintiff says that just before he was hurt he saw his brother waving his hat and 'hollering' to the motorman, and that he too waved his hand at the motorman. Witnesses testified that the car, when stopped, came up with a sudden jolt. There was also testimony tending to show that boys were in the habit of playing at this crossing and running back and forth over it.\n The motorman testified that he was in charge of the car and \n\n[202 U.S. 600, 605]\n\u00a0\n was on the Washington-bound track at the time; that he saw the boys when he was about 3 or 400 feet away; when he first saw them there were three boys on the track, running and jumping backwards and forwards on the crossing. He sounded his gong when he approached, about 150 feet away, and repeatedly thereafter until he reached the boy; when he first saw that the boy was not going to get off the track he was about 30 or 35 feet away from him; that he then put on the brakes, reversed the power, and did everything possible to stop the car. He had often seen the plaintiff on the track at that place and on the crossing at Riverdale, Maryland; that he had seen him remaining on the track until the car got close to him, when he would jump off the track, clap his hands, and laugh; had seen the plaintiff and other boys do the same thing; the first thing that indicated to him that the boy would not get off the track was when he saw that his foot was caught; that at that time he was from 30 to 35 feet from him; that he did not see the boys wave their hands or hats or making any motions to him or did not hear them calling to him. There was testimony tending to show, on the part of the plaintiff below, that he was not in the habit of playing at this crossing, and that he and his brothers had not been there before in the manner stated by the motorman. The motorman testified further that he saw the boy on the track when he was about 3 or 400 feet away.\n We are of opinion that, in the attitude of the case on this subject, it was not error to leave to the jury, under proper instructions, to find whether or not there was negligence in managing the car just before the accident occurred. Upon this part of the case the instructions requested were as follows:\n'If the jury shall find from the evidence that the motorman sounded his gong when he was far enough away from the plaintiff and his associates so that they had sufficient time to leave the track before the car reached them, he had the right to assume that they would do so, and he was not required to \n\n[202 U.S. 600, 606]\n\u00a0\n commence to stop the car until such time as he discovered that the plaintiff had his foot caught between the rail and the plank; and if they shall further find that, as soon as the motorman made such discovery, he did all in his power to stop the car before it struck the plaintiff, then they should find for the defendant.\n\n'If the jury find from the evidence that the motorman sounded the gong when he was far enough away from the plaintiff and his associates so that they had sufficient time to leave the track before the car reached them; and if they shall further find that, as soon as the motorman saw that the plaintiff would not or could not leave the track before the car reached him, he did all in his power to stop the car before it struck the plaintiff, and shall further find that the construction was not negligent, then they should find for the defendant; and, in determining whether the motorman should have commenced to stop the car before he did, they may consider the fact, if they find it to be a fact from the evidence, that plaintiff and others were in the habit of standing on the track and leaving it as the car approached near them, and whether he saw any waving from anyone before he commenced to stop the car.'\n\n Upon this subject the court said to the jury:\n'On the other question, as to whether the motorman did all that he could possibly do under the circumstances to avert this danger, you will have to consider all the testimony; not only that of the plaintiff, but of the defendant; and try to reconcile it so far as you can in order to ascertain where the fact lies. Was it prudent in that motorman, under all the circumstances of the case, to calculate that these children would be off from the track, and out of danger when he got there? Or was it requisite for him, as a prudent and reasonable man to have his car under control, so that he could stop very suddenly in case they were not out of danger when he got there? Of course, in determining that question, you are to consider what had been the habit of children about playing \n\n[202 U.S. 600, 607]\n\u00a0\n at that place. You are not to attribute any contributory negligence to the plaintiff, because this plaintiff is less than seven years of age, and the law does not give him discretion. Adults have to look out for children of that kind. But, at the same time, he may have been in the habit of jumping off and on that track in such a way that the motorman might have been justified in concluding there would be no danger. You are to look at all the surrounding facts and see whether that is true, whether he was justified in that calculation. There was one boy still smaller than the boy who was injured, and, according to the motorman's own statement, the three boys were running back and forth across the track. It is for you to determine whether or not he should have gotten into close proximity to them without getting his car under such control that he could have stopped very suddenly if necessary to prevent an accident. Of course, after he saw that the boy's foot was caught, he must do everything to stop the car. But I call your attention to the time before he could see that the boy's foot was caught, and ask you to consider what it would have been prudent for him to do before that time, considering all the surrounding circumstances,- considering the formation of this plank crossing, of this track, and of this platform, and considering the fact, as the motorman says it was a fact, that children were frequently there, running back and forth. Should he have anticipated that there might have been some kind of danger there, and should be have stopped his car or gotten it under control before he even saw any signal or waving, or before he saw that the boy's foot was caught? Of course, after he saw that the boy's foot was caught, it must be his duty to stop just as soon as he can, in order to prevent the accident. I have no doubt he did that. But, whether he discharged his whole duty towards these children, whom he admits having seen there before that time, is a question for the jury.\n\n'In considering the question of the liability of the defendant on either of the two foregoing grounds, the jury are instructed that they have a right to take into consideration the \n\n[202 U.S. 600, 608]\n\u00a0\n evidence tending to show that the place where the accident occurred was a public crossing, and that it was frequented, and that it was known to the motorman in charge of the car to be frequented, by young children, as well as by older persons.\n\n'It is a question for the jury whether the motorman should have commenced to stop the car sooner than he did, and, in determining that question, they should take into consideration the fact, if they find it to be a fact, that the plaintiff and other boys were in the habit, at the point in question, of standing on the track until the car was very near them and then jumping off.\n\n'In determining the question of how far the car was from the platform when the boys waved their hands, they must be governed by the evidence, and not by speculation.'\n\n The substance of the requests of the defendant on this part of the case was that the motorman, having sounded his gong far enough away to give warning to the boys in time to get off the track before the car reached them, did all his duty required, provided that, as soon as he saw that the boy could not or would not leave the track, he did all in his power to stop the car before the injury. On the other hand, the court left it to the jury to say whether, under the circumstances shown, the motorman was or was not guilty of negligence in failing to get his car under control, so that, in the event of probable injury, he could quickly and promptly stop it.\n We think the court did not err in its charge in this respect, and that the motorman had no right to assume that boys of tender age, such as the plaintiff, might not be caught upon the crossing, notwithstanding his signals, which would have been adequate to warn one of mature years of approaching danger. Plaintiff was not a wrongdoer. He had gone upon the track with a view of rescuing his brother, and was himself caught and was unable to extricate his foot from the space between the rail and the plank. It is not contended that he was guilty of any contributory negligence. He was a child of tender years; \n\n[202 U.S. 600, 609]\n\u00a0\n the testimony is undisputed that children were in the habit of playing at and near this crossing; that they were, at the time of the injury, in full view of the motorman at least 400 feet away, at which distance he admits he saw the boys. It was apparent that one of the boys was right upon the track. The jury may have found from the testimony, and the court could not have disturbed that conclusion, that the motorman acted upon the assumption that the boys would get off the track, and, though running at a speed of 8 to 10 miles per hour, made no effort to get his car under control or to stop it, until he saw the boy's foot was caught, when it was too late to do otherwise than run over him. The car, running with electric power, could have been controlled and taken well in hand so as to be readily stopped at the crossing.\n This court in Union P. R. Co. v. McDonald, \n152 \nU.S. 262, 277\n, 38 S. L. ed. 434, 441, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 619, 625, quoted approvingly from Judge Cooley in a Michigan case: 'Children, wherever they go, must be expected to act upon childish instincts and impulses; and others, who are chargeable with a duty of care and caution towards them, must calculate upon this and take precautions accordingly.' This view is supported by other well-considered cases. Powers v. Harlow, 53 Mich. 507, 514, 51 Am. Rep. 154, 19 N. W. 257; Camden Interstate R. Co. v. Broom, 139 Fed. 595; Forrestal v. Milwaukee Electric R. & Light Co. 119 Wis. 495, 97 N. W. 182; Strutzel v. St. Paul City R. Co. 47 Minn. 543, 50 N. W. 690; Gray v. St. Paul City R. Co. 87 Minn. 280, 91 N. W. 1106\n\n\n This is not a case of a sudden and unexpected coming of children upon a track. The jury may have found that, if the motorman had acted prudently in view of the signals and warnings to stop, which the testimony tends to show were given, and the full view he had of the boys at the time of the accident, checked the car and kept it under control, the injury might have been avoided.\n We think, upon principle and authority, the court properly left to the jury to find whether the motorman exercised that reasonable care to avoid injury to the boy which the circum- \n\n[202 U.S. 600, 610]\n\u00a0\n stances of the occasion required. And to have given an instruction as requested by the plaintiff in error, which limited the duty of the motorman to sounding an alarm in time for the boy to get off the track, and to act upon the presumption that he would do so until he found it was impossible for the plaintiff to remove his foot, would have been an unwarranted charge.\n It is further urged that the court erred in instructing the jury upon the question of damages. Upon this point the court said:\n'The jury are instructed that, if they find a verdict for the plaintiff, they should render a verdict in his favor for such a sum (not exceeding the amount claimed in the declaration) as, in their judgment, will reasonably compensate him for the pain resulting from the injury and from the loss of his leg; for the inconvenience to which he has been put, and which he will be likely to be put, during the remainder of his life, in consequence of the loss of his leg; for the mental suffering, past and future, which the jury may find to be the natural and necessary consequence of the loss of his leg, and for such pecuniary loss, as the direct result of the injury, which the jury may find from the evidence that he is reasonably likely to sustain hereinafter in consequence of his being deprived of one of his legs.'\n\n The court's attention was not called to any particular in which this charge, which covers a number of elements of damages, was alleged to be wrong; only a general exception was taken to the charge as given in this respect. It has been too frequently held to require the extended citation of cases, that an exception of this general character will not cover specific objections which, in fairness to the court, ought to have been called to its attention, in order that, if necessary, it could correct or modify them. A number of the rules of damages laid down in this charge were unquestionably correct; to which no objection has been or could be successfully made. In such cases it is the duty of the objecting party to point out specifically the part of the instructions regarded as erroneous. \n\n[202 U.S. 600, 611]\n\u00a0\n Baltimore & P. R. Co. v. Mackey, \n157 \nU.S. 72, 86\n, 39 S. L. ed. 624, 629, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 491.\n It is now objected that to permit a recovery for a pecuniary loss, as covered in the instructions, would allow the infant plaintiff to recover compensation for his time before as well as after he has reached his majority; and that, during infancy, his father is entitled to recover any wages he might earn. If the defendant wished the charge modified in this respect, he should have called the attention of the court directly to this feature. The charge in this respect was general, permitting a recovery for a pecuniary loss directly resulting from the injury. It would be very unfair to the trial court to keep such an objection in abeyance, and urge it for the first time in an appellate tribunal.\n Furthermore, an objection is taken to the charge as to mental suffering, past and future. It is objected that this instruction permits a recovery for future humiliation and embarrassment of mind and feelings because of the loss of the leg. But we find no objection to the charge as given in this respect. The court said: 'The jury are to consider mental suffering, past and future, found to be the necessary consequence of the loss of his leg.' Where such mental suffering is a direct and necessary consequence of the physical injury, we think the jury may consider it. It is not unlikely that the court might have given more ample instruction in this respect, had it been requested so to do. But what was said limited the compensation to the direct consequences of the physical injury.\n An instruction of this character was sustained in Washington & G. R. Co. v. Harmon, \n147 U.S. 584\n, 37 L. ed. 289, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 557. That there might be more or less continuous mental suffering directly resulting from a maiming of the plaintiff's person in an injury of this character was probable, and, where the jury was limited to that which necessarily resulted from the injury, we think there can be no valid objection or just ground of complaint. Of a charge of this character, in Kennon v. Gilmer, \n131 \nU.S. 22, 26\n, 33 S. L. ed. 110, 112, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 696, Mr. Justice Gray, speaking for this court, said: \n\n[202 U.S. 600, 612]\n\u00a0\n 'But the instruction given only authorized them, in assessing damages for the injury caused by the defendants to the plaintiff, to take into consideration 'his bodily and mental pain and suffering, both taken together' ('but not his mental pain alone'), and such as 'inevitably and necessarily resulted from the original injury.' The action is for an injury to the person of an intelligent being, and when the injury, whether caused by wilfulness or by negligence, produces mental as well as bodily anguish and suffering, independently of any extraneous consideration or cause, it is impossible to exclude the mental suffering in estimating the extent of the personal injury for which compensation is to be awarded. The instruction was in accord with the opinions of this court in similar cases.' We find no error in the charge in this respect.\n As to the alleged error in charging the jury that damages could not be recovered in excess of the sum claimed in the declaration, the court was careful to say to the jury that the sum claimed should not be taken as a criterion to act upon, but that it was only a limit, beyond which they could not go. We cannot see how the plaintiff in error was prejudiced by this instruction.\n The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","98":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMCDONALD v. DEWEY(1906)\nNo. 220\nArgued: Decided: May 28, 1906\n\n\n\n\n[202 U.S. 510, 511]\n\u00a0\n The first of these cases was an appeal from a decree of the circuit court of appeals, rendered in a case wherein John W. McDonald, receiver of the First National Bank of Orleans, Nebraska, was complainant, and Charles P. Dewey and others were defendants, reversing a decree of the circuit court for the northern district of Illinois, and remanding the case to that court with directions to enter a decree against Dewey for his full assessment on twenty-five shares of stock of the First National Bank, and for interest thereon.\n The second case is a cross appeal by Chauncey Dewey and his co- executor from the same decree.\n Charles P. Dewey having died pending the litigation, the suits were revived in the name of Chauncey Dewey and Charles T. Killen, executors of his will.\n The original was a bill in equity to enforce an assessment of $86 a share on 105 shares of stock of the First National Bank of Orleans, Nebraska, which failed on May 20, 1897. These shares, having been originally owned by Charles P. Dewey, were sold by him in December, 1894, and in January, 1895. Eighty shares were duly transferred on the books of the bank within a few weeks after the sale. The remaining twenty-five shares had been previously transferred by Dewey to his agent, Frederick L. Jewett, who was admitted to be irresponsible, and stood on the books of the bank in the name of Jewett when the bank went into the hands of a receiver, on May 20, 1897, although they had been sold by Dewey. The bill alleged that Hedlund, the original receiver (since superseded by McDonald, \n\n[202 U.S. 510, 512]\n\u00a0\n the present receiver), was appointed and took possession on June 5, 1897, a fortnight after the failure of the bank; that on September 14, 1897, the Comptroller levied an assessment of $86 a share upon the capital stock; that on May 8, 1894, Charles P. Dewey was the owner of 105 shares of stock, and was registered as such; that the bank was then, and continuously remained, insolvent; that this insolvency was known to Dewey, who, on that day, May 8, assigned ninety-five of these shares to the defendant Jewett, who was wholly irresponsible; that the transfer was colorable only, and made for the sole purpose of evading Dewey's liability as a stockholder; that Jewett thereafter, at various times, transferred eighty of the ninety- five shares to the several other defendants, and that on January 3, 1895, Dewey transferred his remaining ten shares to Jewett, so that at the time the bank failed said 105 shares were registered on the books of the bank in the names of the several transferees; that the several transfers were made at a time when the bank was insolvent, and known by Dewey to be so, for the purpose of evading his liability for assessments, and to irresponsible persons.\n The answer of Dewey contained a general denial of all material allegations, and set up that the transfers were outright and for the par value of the stock; that he had sold all his stock, and, with the exception of the twenty-five shares, all transfers had been made on the books of the bank prior to its suspension.\n The circuit court found that the sales of stock were all made through Jewett, who acted merely as the agent of Dewey and had no interest in the stock, but held it for Dewey in his name; that the bank failed about two years and five months after the sale by Dewey; that the bank was insolvent in December, 1894, and January, 1895, at the time Dewey sold the 105 shares, and that Dewey, who was vice president of the bank from 1892 to 1895, knew, or ought to have known, that fact; that three certificates, aggregating twenty-five shares, were not transferred on the books of the bank, and still stood in the name of Jewett when the bank suspended; that the claims of the creditors of the bank, who were such when Dewey sold his \n\n[202 U.S. 510, 513]\n\u00a0\n stock and remained such at the time of the failure, aggregated $11,839.15, of which, however, only $2,787.97 remained unsatisfied, and that of this the ratable share of Dewey was $585.48, for which sum a decree was rendered.\n On appeal by the receiver to the circuit court of appeals the decree of the circuit court was reversed and a new decree directed to be entered for the full amount of the assessment on the twenty-five shares standing in the name of Jewett at the time of the failure; that as to the eighty shares there could be no recovery, although the bank was insolvent at the time of the sale of the stock, and was known to be insolvent, and the transfer was made for the purpose of evading liability; but that there could be no recovery without proof of the additional fact that the several transferees were likewise insolvent; that, as to the twenty-five shares, Dewey remained liable, as he had not surrendered the certificate to the bank or given the officers such data as to enable them to make such transfer on its books. The case was remanded to the circuit court, with directions to render a decree against Dewey for his full assessment on twenty-five shares. From this decree both parties appealed to this court.\n Messrs. Frank M. Hall, Roscoe Pound, and E. E. Prussing for the receiver.\n\n\n[202 U.S. 510, 516]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. William B. McIlvaine, Nathan G. Moore, and John P. Wilson, for Dewey et al.\n\n\n\n[202 U.S. 510, 519]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Brown delivered the opinion of the court:\n Three sections of the national bank act, which are printed in the margin, are pertinent in connection with the leading questions involved in this case.\n Sec. 5139 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3461). The capital stock of each association shall be divided into shares of one hundred dollars each, and be deemed personal property, and transferable on the books of the association in such manner as may be prescribed in the by-laws or articles of association. Every person becoming a shareholder by such transfer shall, in proportion to his shares, succeed to all the rights and liabilities of the prior holder of such shares; and no change shall be made in the articles of association by which the rights, remedies, or security of the existing creditors of the association shall be impaired.\n (The shares of this Nebraska bank were transferable only on the books of the bank, in person or by attorney, on surrender of the certificate that represented the shares proposed to be transferred.)\n Sec. 5210 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3498).\n The president and cashier of every national banking association shall cause to be kept at all times a full and correct list of the names and residences of all the shareholders in the association, and the number of shares held by each, in the office where its business is transacted. Such list shall be subject to the inspection of all the shareholders and creditors of the association, and the officers authorized to assess taxes under state authority, during business hours of each day in which business may be legally transacted. A copy of such list, on the first Monday of July of each year, verified by the oath of such president or cashier, shall be transmitted to the Comptroller of the Currency.\n Sec. 5151 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3465). The shareholders of every national banking association shall be held individually responsible, equally and ratably, and not one for another, for all contracts, debts, and engagements of such association, to the extent of the amount of their stock therein, at the par value thereof, in addition to the amount invested in such shares; . . . \n\n[202 U.S. 510, 520]\n\u00a0\n That the transfer of stock in corporations, oven when in failing circumstances, should not be unduly impeded, is essential not only to the prosperity of such corporations and the value of their stock, but to the interest of stockholders who may desire, for legitimate reasons, to change their investments or to raise money for debts incurred outside the business of such corporation. First Nat. Bank v. Lanier, 11 Wall. 369, 377, 20 L. ed. 172, 174. At the same time, the frequency with which such transfers are made for the purpose of evading the double liability imposed by the national banking act has given rise to a large amount of litigation turning upon their legality. In this connection certain propositions have been laid down by so many courts and in so many cases that they may be regarded as fundamental principles of law, applicable to all cases of this character.\n\n\n (1)\n That a party who, by way of pledge or collateral security for a loan of money, accepts stock of a national bank and puts his name on the registry as owner, incurs an immediate liability as a stockholder, and cannot relieve himself therefrom by making a colorable transfer of his stock to another person for his own benefit, as was done by the sale to Jewett in this case. Germania Nat. Bank v. Case, \n99 U.S. 628\n, 25 L. ed. 448; Marcy v. Clark, 17 Mass. 330; Nathan v. Whitlock, 9 Paige, 152; Cook, Stock & Stockholders,  263.\n\n\n (2)\n The same result follows if the stockholder, knowing, or having good reason to know, the insolvency of the bank, colludes with an irresponsible person with design to substitute the latter in his place, and thus escape individual liability, and transfers his stock to such person. It is immaterial in such case that he may be able to show a full or partial consideration for the transfer as between himself and the transferee. Bowden v. Johnson (Adams v. Johnson) \n107 U.S. 251\n, 27 L. ed. 386, 2 Sup.Ct.Rep. 246.\n Upon the other hand, in Whitney v. Butler, \n118 U.S. 655\n, 30 L. ed. 266, 7 Sup.Ct.Rep. 61, certain stockholders employed an auctioneer to sell their shares \n\n[202 U.S. 510, 521]\n\u00a0\n at public auction. They were bidden in by a purchaser who paid the auctioneer for them and received from him the certificate of stock with a power of attorney to transfer the same in blank. The auctioneer paid the money to the original owner of stock, but no formal transfer was made on the books of the bank. Shortly afterwards the bank became insolvent and went into the hands of a receiver, who made an assessment upon the original stockholders. We held that the responsibility of the stockholders ceased upon the surrender of the certificate to the bank, and the delivery to its president of a power of attorney to transfer the stock on the books of the bank. The controlling considerations were the good faith of the stockholders in making the sale, believing the bank to be solvent, and the fact that they had done all that they could reasonably be expected to do to make a valid sale of the stock and a transfer of the certificate on the stock register.\n Under the English law a shareholder may transfer his shares to an irresponsible party for a nominal consideration, though the sole purpose of the transfer be to escape liability, provided the transfer be out and out, and not merely colorable or collusive, with a secret trust attached. Under such circumstances the person making the transfer is released from liability, both as to corporate creditors and the other shareholders. Cook, Stock & Stockholders,  266; 2 Morawetz, Priv. Corp.  859.\n The law is quite different in this country. At the same time the original stockholder cannot be held liable, unless the bank were practically insolvent at the time the transfer was made, and its condition was known or ought to have been known to the stockholder making the transfer. If the bank were in fact solvent and able to pay its debts as they matured when the transfer was made, the creditors, having ample security in the solvency of the bank, have no special interest in knowing who the stockholders are, since their only recourse to them would be in the remote contingency of the insolvency of the bank. The transferrer can only be held liable if the bank be insolvent, and such insolvency be known, or ought to have been known, \n\n[202 U.S. 510, 522]\n\u00a0\n to him from his relations to the bank, since the transfer is prima facie valid, and shifts to the transferee the burden of the responsibility, which can be laid upon the original stockholder only in case of bad faith, or evidence of a purpose to evade liability.\n This bad faith may be shown by the fact that the bank was known to him to be insolvent; but, notwithstanding this, the transfer would be valid if made to a person of known financial responsibility, since the creditors could not suffer by the substitution of one solvent stockholder in place of another. The court of appeals, however, went further, and held that the transfer would be valid unless made to an irresponsible person unable to respond to an assessment, whose financial condition was known, or ought to have been known, to him.\n There is no such limitation intimated in the case of Pauly v. State Loan & T. Co. \n165 U.S. 606\n, 41 L. ed. 844, 17 Sup.Ct.Rep. 465, which involved a question as to the liability of a pledgee, but in which certain rules were stated (p. 619, L. ed. p. 849, Sup.Ct.Rep. p. 470) as to the liability of shareholders, one of which was 'that if the real owner of the shares transfers them to another person, or causes them to be placed on the books of the association in the name of another person, with the intent simply to evade the responsibility imposed by  5151 on shareholders of national banking associations, such owner may be treated, for the purposes of that section, as a shareholder, and liable as therein prescribed.' The case, however, is not directly in point.\n The most pertinent in this connection is that of Stuart v. Hayden, \n169 U.S. 1\n, 42 L. ed. 639, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 274. In that case, Stuart, being an owner of one hundred shares of stock in a national bank, a director of the bank, and a member of its finance committee, purchased certain real property of Gruetter and Joers, and, as a consideration, assumed a mortgage debt, turned over his stock in the bank as of the value of $18,000, delivered to them the certificate of the shares, and paid the balance of the agreed price in cash.\n These certificates of stock were returned to the bank and new certificates issued to Gruetter and Joers, to whom Stuart rep- \n\n[202 U.S. 510, 523]\n\u00a0\n resented that the bank was in a solvent and prosperous condition. The circuit court found that such representation was false to the knowledge of Stuart, and made for the purpose of inducing them to purchase the stock, and of evading and escaping his liability as a shareholder for his assessment thereon. Upon this state of facts Stuart was held liable to the receiver as the holder and owner of these shares.\n The principal inquiry was whether Stuart transferred his stock to escape the liability imposed by the statute, his contention being that, if the transfer were absolute and to persons who were at the time solvent and able to respond to an assessment upon the shares, the motive with which the transfer was made was of no consequence.\n In answer to this it was said by Mr. Justice Harlan:\n'There is no case in which this court has held that the intent with which the shareholder got rid of his stock was of no consequence; certainly, no case in which the intent was held to be immaterial, when coupled with knowledge or reasonable belief upon the part of the transferrer that the bank was insolvent or in a failing condition.\n\n ... * *\n'One who holds such shares-the bank being at the time insolvent- cannot escape the individual liability imposed by the statute by transferring his stock with intent simply to avoid that liability, knowing or having reason to believe, at the time of the transfer on the books of the bank, . . . that it is insolvent or about to fail. A transfer with such intent and under such circumstances is a fraud upon the creditors of the bank, and may be treated by the receiver as inoperative between the transferrer and himself, and the former held liable as a shareholder without reference to the financial condition of the transferee.'\n\n The court found upon the facts 'that Stuart, with knowledge of the insolvency of the bank, or, at all events, with such knowledge of facts as reasonably justified the delief that insolvency existed or was impending, sold and transferred his stock with the intent to escape individual liability. . . . \n\n[202 U.S. 510, 524]\n\u00a0\n And the bank having been in fact insolvent at the time of the transfer of his stock,-which fact is not disputed,-he remained, notwithstanding such transfer, and as between the receiver and himself, a shareholder, subject to the individual liability imposed by  5151.' Although it was alleged in the bill by the receiver that Gruetter and Joers were, at the time of the transfer, pecuniarily irresponsible, there was no finding to that effect, and, in treating of the liability of Stuart, no stress was laid upon their financial condition, but the case was disposed of as one of bad faith on Stuart's part in transferring the shares at a time when he knew the bank to be insolvent. There is certainly nothing in this case to justify the inference that the receiver was bound, in making out his case, to establish the fact that the transferee was insolvent, and was known to the stockholder to be so when he transferred his stock.\n In Matteson v. Dent, \n176 U.S. 521\n, 44 L. ed. 571, 20 Sup.Ct.Rep. 419, the stockholder, while the stock was yet owned by him and stood registered in his name, died intestate, and the stock was distributed to the widow and heirs by decree of the probate court. Shortly thereafter the bank became insolvent and the receiver brought suit against the widow and children for an assessment. The defendants were held to be liable upon the ground that the obligation of a subscriber of stock is contractual in its nature, and is not extinguished by death, but, like any other contract obligation, survives and is enforceable against the estate of the stockholder, notwithstanding that the estate of the decedent had been settled and fully administered according to law, and that the insolvency of the bank occurred after the death of the intestate, citing Richmond v. Irons, \n121 U.S. 27\n, 30 L. ed. 864, 7 Sup.Ct.Rep. 788. It is true that the case did not involve the question here presented, but, in delivering the opinion, the prior cases of Germania Nat. Bank v. Case, \n99 U.S. 628\n, 25 L. ed. 448, and Bowden v. Johnson (Adams v. Johnson) \n107 U.S. 251\n, 27 L. ed. 386, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 246, were cited in support of the proposition, treated as elementary, that, 'where a transfer has been fraudulently or collusively made to avoid an obligation to pay assessments, such transfer will be disregarded, and the real owner be held liable.' P. 531, L. ed. p. 576, Sup.Ct.Rep. p. 423. \n\n[202 U.S. 510, 525]\n\u00a0\n Much stress is laid, in the opinion of the court of appeals, upon the case of Earle v. Carson, \n188 U.S. 42\n, 47 L. ed. 373, 23 Sup.Ct.Rep. 254, supposed to lend countenance to the doctrine that the receiver is bound, as part of his case, to establish the fact that the transferee was insolvent and known to the transferrer to be so at the time of the transfer. The defense was that, prior to the suspension of the bank, the defendant had, in good faith, sold the stock standing in her name for the full market price, which had been paid her that she had delivered up to the bank her stock certificate, with a power of attorney to make the transfer, and requested that the stock be transferred; that the officer of the bank said the transfer would be made, but it seems that the officer had failed to discharge that duty; that, as the defendant had done everything which the law required her to do to secure the transfer, she had ceased to be a stockholder, and was not responsible. It was alleged as error that the trial court refused to instruct the jury that the sale of the stock, though lawful in every other respect, could not be so treated if it were found that, at the time of the sale, the reserve of the bank was, to the knowledge of the defendant, below the limit fixed by law. P. 44, L. ed. p. 374, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 254. This refusal was held not to be error. 'Certainly,' said Mr. Justice White in the opinion (p. 46, L. ed. p. 376, Sup.Ct.Rep. p. 256), 'it cannot in reason be said that the power would exist to sell stock like any other personal property, if, before the power could be exercised, the seller must examine the affairs of the bank, marshal its assets and liabilities, in order to form an accurate judgment as to the precise condition of the bank.'\n In discussing the question in regard to the validity of the transfer, it was said (p. 49, L. ed. p. 377, Sup.Ct.Rep. p. 257) that 'the exercise of the power to transfer stock in a national bank is controlled by the rules of good faith applicable to other contracts. The qualification just stated gives no support to the proposition that, where a sale of stock in a national bank is made in good faith, nevertheless the consequences of the sale are avoided if subsequently it developed that the bank was insolvent at the time of the transfer, in the sense that its assets were then unequal to the \n\n[202 U.S. 510, 526]\n\u00a0\n discharge of its liabilities, when such fact was unknown to the seller of the stock at the time of the sale.'\n The argument was made (p. 54, L. ed. p. 379, Sup.Ct.Rep. p. 259) that, as the 'person to whom the stock was sold . . . was . . . insolvent, and hence unable to respond to the double liability, the sale was void, although the fact of such insolvency of the buyer was unknown to the seller.' This was held to be unsound, 'since it but insists that the validity of the sale of the stock is to be tested, not by the bad faith of the seller, but upon the unknown financial condition of the buyer.' We find nothing in this case which impugns in any degree the authority of the prior cases, or holds that the validity of the sale is to be gauged by the financial condition of the transferee, or the knowledge of that condition of the transferrer.\n\n 1. \nWe think it a proper deduction from the prior cases, and such we hold to be the law, that the gist of the liability is the fraud implied in selling with notice of the insolvency of the bank, and with intent to evade the double liability imposed upon the stockholder by the national banking act. In short, the question of liability is largely determinable by the presence or absence of an intent to evade liability. The fact that the sale was made to an insolvent buyer is doubtless additional evidence of the original fraudulent intent, but would not be in itself sufficient to constitute fraud without notice of the insolvency of the bank. The stockholder is not deprived of his right to sell his stock by the fact that the sale is made to an insolvent person, unless it be made with knowledge of the insolvency of the bank. This was practically the ruling in Earle v. Carson, in which we held that a bona fide sale would not be void, though the vendee were insolvent, if the fact of such insolvency were at the time unknown to the seller. The case of Earle v. Carson, so far from lending countenance to the argument of the appellees, bears strongly in the opposite direction.\n The solvency of the vendee, however, is pertinent in showing that no damage could have resulted to the creditors of the bank by the transfer. Though not a necessary part of the plaintiff's \n\n[202 U.S. 510, 527]\n\u00a0\n case, it may be a complete defense, if it be shown that the sale, however fraudulent, was made to a vendee who was as able to respond to the double liability as was the vendor. The proposition that the executors are not responsible because the sales were made to solvent vendees, being defensive in its character, the burden of proof was upon them. In this particular the case is not unlike that of an ordinary action upon a contract, where the plaintiff relies upon the contract and the breach, and sues for such damages as may be reasonably supposed to follow therefrom. But it may be shown in defense that no damages really resulted; as, for instance, in an action for services, that plaintiff might have obtained other employment at the same wages; or, in an action for a failure to deliver goods, that plaintiff might have gone into the market and purchased other goods at the same price at which the defendant had agreed to sell them. In such case defendant assumes the burden of proving that no damage in fact resulted. The argument in this case really is that the receiver was bound to show, not only that Dewey was guilty of fraud, but that damages necessarily resulted and that he knew that fact. The reply is that the fraud was consummated by the sale of the stock of a bank known to be insolvent, with intent to evade liability, and that the fraud is not less though the transferees happened to be solvent, but that their solvency may be proved to rebut the presumption that injury resulted to the creditors from the transfers.\n While there is no express finding of the court of appeals (though there was in the circuit court) that Dewey knew, or should have known, of the insolvency of the bank at the time of the transfer, and that the transfer was made with the intent to evade his double liability as stockholder, the decree of both courts is based upon this assumption; and, as stated in the dissenting opinion, 'that the final suspension of the bank, though it occurred two years and five months after Dewey's transfer of stock, is traceable, in the line of cause and effect, to the insolvency of the bank at the time of the trans- \n\n[202 U.S. 510, 528]\n\u00a0\n fer.' [67 C. C. A. 414, 134 Fed. 534.] We do not understand these facts to be seriously disputed.\n In this connection it only remains to consider whether the transferees were financially responsible to the amount of the assessment. It is not necessary to show that they were persons of a responsibility equal to that of the original stockholder. It is sufficient that they were responsible to the amount called for by the necessities of the case,-in other words, in an amount sufficient to indicate that the creditors of the bank were not damnified by the change of ownership.\n Although the evidence does not show affirmatively the insolvency of the ultimate transferees, it falls far short of showing that a decree against them for their assessment could be collected. Without going into details of the property of each one of the seven transferees, it is sufficient to say that they were either working on salaries, with no evidence of available property, outside of such salaries, or that their property consisted of encumbered real estate in Chicago of a largely speculative value; and that, in some cases, at least, the shares were paid for in real estate conveyed for the purpose of getting rid of the property and avoiding the payment of interest on the encumbrances. There is no satisfactory evidence that a decree against any one of these parties for the amount of his assessment could have been collected by ordinary process of law.\n\n 2. \nBut, except so far as the twenty-five shares held by Jewett as the agent of Dewey at the time of the failure, we think the executors should not be held liable to the creditors who became such after the transfer. The national banking act requires (Rev. Stat.  5210, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901. p. 3498) a list of the names and residences of all the shareholders, and the number of shares held by each to be kept in the banking house, subject to the inspection of all the shareholders and creditors of the associtation; and ( 5139, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3461) that every person becoming a shareholder by transfer of shares to himself shall succeed to all the rights and liabilities of the prior holder of such shares, and no change shall be made in the ar- \n\n[202 U.S. 510, 529]\n\u00a0\n ticles of association by which the rights, remedies, or securities of the existing creditors of the association shall be impaired.\n The object of this legislation is evidently to apprise persons dealing with the bank of the names of the shareholders, upon whom the double liability shall be imposed in case of the insolvency of the bank. In the event of such insolvency it is only existing creditors who can claim to have been damnified by a fraudulent transfer of shares. As to them such transfer is voidable. Subsequent creditors are apprised by the published list of the names of the shareholders, to whom transfers have been made, and of the persons to whom they may have recourse for the double liability. The injustice of holding a stockholder liable for an indefinite time in the future to creditors who may have become such years after he had parted with his stock, and who were apprised of the names of the stockholders by the published list, is too manifest to require an extended comment. We are only applying to this case by analogy the ordinary rule of the common law, that a voluntary deed by a person heavily indebted is fraudulent and void as to prior creditors merely upon the ground that he was so indebted; but, as to subsequent creditors, is only void upon evidence that the deed was made in contemplation of future indebtedness. Sexton v. Wheaton, 8 Wheat. 229, 5 L. ed. 603; Schreyer v. Scott, \n134 U.S. 405\n, 33 L. ed. 955, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 579; Ridgeway v. Underwood, 4 Wash. C. C. 129-137, Fed. Cas. No. 11,815; Bennett v. Bedford Bank, 11 Mass. 421.\n This was the interpretation given to a similar statute by the supreme court of Ohio in Peter v. Union Mfg. Co. 56 Ohio St. 181-204, 46 N. E. 894. It is true that in Ohio a stockholder cannot escape liability to existing creditors by a transfer of his stock, however bona fide such transfer may be. But we do not see how that affects the ruling in the Peter Case, that he does not continue liable as to future creditors.\n The case of Bowden v. Johnson (Adams v. Johnson) \n107 U.S. 251\n, 27 L. ed. 386, 2 Sup.Ct.Rep. 246, turned upon the question of the fraud in a certain transfer of stock, the conclusion being that such transfer was fraudulent, and that the original owner continued liable to the creditors of the bank. \n\n[202 U.S. 510, 530]\n\u00a0\n The question as to whether such liability was limited to existing creditors on extended to future creditors was not touched upon in the opinion of the court, but, as the insolvency of the bank seems to have occurred soon after the fraudulent transfer was made, it is improbable that any future creditors existed.\n There are undoubtedly cases in which we have used the general expression that, in the event of a fraudulent transfer of stock, the stockholder remains liable to the creditors of the bank, but in none of them were we called upon to discriminate between existing and subsequent creditors, since, as a rule, the insolvency of the bank followed soon after the transfer, and the distinction was not called to our attention by counsel.\n It results that there must be a decree affirming the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals so far as it holds Dewey liable for his full assessment on the twenty-five shares standing in Jewett's name, and reversing it so far as it exonerated his estate from assessment upon the remaining shares, to such amount as is necessary to satisfy the creditors existing at the time the transfer of the stock was made, and that the cause be remanded to the Circuit Court for the Northern District of Illinois for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n Mr. Justice White, with whom concur Mr. Justice McKenna and Mr. Justice Day, dissenting:\n To make clear the reasons for my dissent, I briefly recapitulate the facts, the issues, and the matters decided.\n As a result of the failure in May, 1897, of the First National Bank of Orleans, Nebraska, the Comptroller appointed a receiver and subsequently levied an assessment of $86 a share to make good a deficiency of assets required to enable the payment of the creditors of the bank existing at the date of the failure.\n In May, 1894, Dewey was the registered owner of 105 shares of the stock of the bank. In that month and year he assigned ninety-five of these shares to Jewett and they were transferred on the \n\n[202 U.S. 510, 531]\n\u00a0\n stock register in the name of Jewett. Jewett then transferred on the stock register eighty of these shares to six other persons, Jewett thus remaining the registered holder of but fifteen out of the ninety-five shares transferred to him by Dewey. Subsequently Dewey transferred on the stock register the remaining ten of the original 105 shares to Jewett. At the time, therefore, of the failure of the bank, the 105 shares originally owned by Dewey had been put out of his name, and stood on the stock register of the bank as follows: twenty-five shares in the name of Jewett and eighty shares in various proportions in the names of the six persons to whom Jewett had transferred them.\n The object of the bill is to hold Dewey liable on the 105 shares for the assessment levied by the Comptroller. Questions of fact and of law are involved. The first are: At the time of the failure of the bank did the 105 shares of stock stand in the name of the agent of Dewey, or if not, did they stand in the name of irresponsible persons to whom Dewey, with the knowledge of the insolvency of the bank, and to escape liability, transferred the stock? And the question of law is, If the stock was still Dewey's, or if it was transferred by him, as stated, is he liable for the assessment or for any part thereof?\n The court now determines both questions of fact against Dewey. In other words, the court holds that Dewey was the owner of the twenty-five shares standing in the name of Jewett, because Jewett received the transfer merely as the agent of Dewey, and never became the owner of the stock. As to the eighty shares standing in the names of the six persons to whom Jewett transferred them, the court holds that they were transferred by Dewey to his agent, Jewett, with knowledge of the insolvency, and to avoid the statutory liability, and, to carry out this purpose, were transferred by Jewett as his (Dewey's) agent, into the names of six irresponsible persons. The questions of fact being thus decided against Dewey, the proposition of law is, in substance, decided in his favor. I say this because it is now held that Dewey is not liable, except as to the twenty-five shares, for the assessment of $86 a share to pay the debts of the bank \n\n[202 U.S. 510, 532]\n\u00a0\n existing at the time of the failure, but only for such proportion of such assessment as may be required to pay such unsatisfied debts of the bank, if any there be, which were in existence at the several dates when the transfers of the eighty shares were made by Jewett as the agent of Dewey.\n My dissent is constrained by a deep conviction of the unsoundness of the proposition now upheld exempting Dewey from liability, in respect to the eighty shares, for the call made by the Comptroller to pay the debts of the bank existing at the time of the failure, and the decision that he is only liable for such sum as may be necessary to pay the unsatisfied debts, if any, which existed when the fraudulent transfer of the stock was made.\n As it is given to me to see it, this ruling is both novel and dangerous, and without the support of any administrative or judicial construction applied to the statute since it was originally enacted, more than forty years ago. To me it, moreover, seems that the ruling is repugnant both to the text and spirit of the statute, considered as an original question, and is, besides, contrary to a line of adjudications of this and other Federal courts. My endeavor shall be briefly to state the reasons by which I am led to this conclusion.\n It cannot be denied that, from the date of the original enactment of the national banking act, in 1863 [12 Stat. at L. 665, chap. 58], to the present time, the Comptroller of the Currency, in making an assessment under the law to pay the debts of a failed national bank, has always made such call upon the assumption that the stockholders who were liable for assessment were so liable ratably for the amount required to pay the debts of the bank existing at the time of the failure. Such also is the case viewed from the standpoint of judicial decisions, for, although in numerous cases in this court and many cases in the lower Federal courts for years and years, questions in every aspect have been considered concerning the liability of a stockholder in a national bank who, it was alleged, had transferred his stock in fraud of the statute, no case can be found where even a suggestion was \n\n[202 U.S. 510, 533]\n\u00a0\n made by counsel or by the courts of the existence of the rule of limited liability which the court now upholds. In saying this I do not overlook the fact that the court in its opinion refers to an Ohio case (Peter v. Union Mfg. Co. 56 Ohio St. 181, 46 N. E. 894) as sustaining the doctrine which is now announced. That case, however, did not concern a national bank, but related to an Ohio corporation; and, as I shall hereafter endeavor to demonstrate, rested solely upon the provisions of the Constitution and laws of the state of Ohio, which were not only peculiar to that state, but were directly in conflict with the principle of liability expressed in the acts of Congress concerning the responsibility of stockholders in national banks.\n Whilst, of course, the absence, during such a long period of time, in administrative execution and judicial exposition, of even a suggestion that the limitation of liability now sustained was warranted by the statute, is not conclusive, it certainly is persuasive that, if such a limitation can be evolved from the law, it must be occult and strained, since it has been latent and undiscovered for forty years. But a consideration of the statute, it seems to me, will at once make clear the fact that the limitation now sanctioned has never before been intimated, because that limitation must have been considered to be repugnant to the text of the statute.\n Both by the national banking act as originally adopted in 1863 and as re-enacted in 1864 [13 Stat. at L. 99, chap. 106], and as now embodied in  5139 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3461), owners of stock in national banks were empowered to transfer that stock as personal property. The purpose of Congress to render this transfer effectual is evidenced by the omission in the re-enactment in 1864 of a provision found in the act of 1863, which might have had the effect of limiting transfers. Earle v. Carson, \n188 \nU.S. 42, 46\n, 47 S. L. ed. 373, 376, 23 Sup.Ct.Rep. 254. And, following the plain text of the act, it has not been questioned that creditors existing at the time a stockholder made and completed lawful transfer of his stock had no right to complain or hold the outgoing stockholder for existing debts of the bank, since, by the statute, the result of such a transfer \n\n[202 U.S. 510, 534]\n\u00a0\n was to sever all connection between such stockholder and the bank, wholly without reference to the consent of the then-existing creditors, and to substitute the person to whom the valid and completed transfer had been made. Now, whilst it is true that the statute requires a registry of stockholders to be kept and transfers to be noted thereon, in view of the unlimited right of a stockholder to make a lawful transfer without the consent of the creditors existing at the time of the transfer, it cannot be said that the statute gave to the creditors a right to prevent transfers or presupposed that they would contract with the bank upon the faith of a particular state of the registry, when, by the statute, that registry could be changed by lawful transfers without the power of the creditor to complain. It is true also that the statute declares (Rev. Stat .  5139) that when a lawful transfer is made the shareholder 'shall succeed to all the rights and liabilities of the prior holder of such shares.' But this does not imply that existing creditors have a contract right against the transferring stockholder, since the right of such stockholder to make a lawful transfer and substitute another for himself without the consent of the creditors is an affirmance instead of a negation of the absence of the contract relation between the transferring stockholder and then-existing creditors. And this is emphasized, since the new stockholder becomes ratably liable not only for debts contracted after the transfer made to him, but for all the prior unsatisfied debts. Of course, by the statute as originally enacted and as now existing (Rev. Stat.  5151, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3465) those who were stockholders in a national bank at the time of its failure are made equally and ratably liable to the amount of their stock for the debts of the bank then existing. But this provision does not destroy or impair the right to make a lawful transfer before the failure of a bank, since it only attaches the double liability to those who have not made a lawful transfer, and who are, in contemplation of law, stockholders at the time of the failure. Harmonizing these two sections of the statute, they import the purpose to secure the great advantage result- \n\n[202 U.S. 510, 535]\n\u00a0\n ing from the untrammeled power to make a lawful transfer of stock, as pointed out by this court in Earle v. Carson, supra, and First Nat. Bank v. Lanier, 11 Wall. 377, 20 L. ed. 174, and yet, at the same time, when failure ensues, to give the then-existing creditors the benefit of the double liability of the then-existing stockholders.\n And when the repeated adjudications of this court are considered, to me it seems that they expound the text and spirit of the statute as above pointed out; and, therefore, the rule now announced cannot be consistently upheld without overthrowing those decisions and substituting a new statute. In Germania Nat. Bank v. Case (1878) \n99 U.S. 628\n, 25 L. ed. 448, the principle controlling the question of the liability of a stockholder in a national bank who had made a fraudulent disposition of his stock was considered. On the one hand it was insisted that, as the stockholder had a right to transfer his stock without the consent of then-existing creditors of the bank, every 'out-and-out' transfer, as it was termed, should be held to be efficacious to relieve from liability at the date of the failure. On the other hand, it was contended that if a transfer was made with a knowledge of the insolvency of the bank, and to escape the statutory liability, the stockholder remained a stockholder, and was, therefore, subject to the double liability. The latter contention was sustained. The court recognized the fact that in England, when a stockholder had a right to dispose of his stock at pleasure, the rule was that every out-and-out transfer which was not a mere sham severed the connection of the stockholder with the corporation, thus causing him to be no longer a stockholder, and leaving him entirely free from liability. But the American rule was held to be different. Expounding that rule, it was declared that, both in the case where a stockholder made a sham sale or transferred his stock to an irresponsible person, with knowledge of the insolvency of the bank, and for the purpose of escaping the statutory liability, the transferrer remained a stockholder for the purpose of the statutory double liability. In other words, \n\n[202 U.S. 510, 536]\n\u00a0\n the court declared that, in both such cases, the transfer, in legal intendment, at the election of creditors, would be held to be a mere simulation, leaving the stockholder, despite such transfer, continuously subject to his statutory liability.\n Without attempting to review all of the many other cases decided by this court involving controversies on this subject, it may not be doubted that the substantial doctrine of the case just reviewed has been reiterated time and time again and is the settled law of this court. Thus in Bowden v. Johnson, (Adams v. Johnson) \n107 U.S. 251\n, 27 L. ed. 386, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 246, Johnson was the holder of stock in a national bank. On February 14, 1874, his stock was transferred on the books of the bank in the name of a Mrs. Valentine. On May 26, 1874, more than three months after such transfer, the bank failed and the Comptroller made an assessment to pay the debts existing at the time of the failure, and the suit had for its object the enforcement of this assessment against Johnson. It was found that the transfer to Mrs. Valentine was not a sham, but that, at the time it was made, the bank was insolvent, that Johnson knew of the insolvency, and transferred his stock to avoid liability, and with the knowledge that Mrs. Valentine was irresponsible. Coming to consider the contention, under these facts, that Johnson could not be held for the debts existing at the time of the failure, the court expressly reiterated the ruling in the Case Case, held that a shareholder who made a fraudulent transfer of the kind under consideration continued liable as a stockholder, and the assessment which had been made by the Comptroller for the debts existing at the time of the failure was adjudged to be valid, although such failure happened months after the fraudulent transfer. In the course of the opinion the court said (p. 261, L. ed. p. 389, Sup.Ct.Rep. p. 254):\n'But where the transferrer, possessed of information showing that there is good ground to apprehend the failure of the bank, colludes and combines, as in this case, with an irresponsible transferee, with the design of substituting the latter in his place, and of thus leaving no one with any ability to respond for the individual liability imposed by the statute, in respect \n\n[202 U.S. 510, 537]\n\u00a0\n of the shares of stock transferred, the transaction will be decreed to be a fraud on the creditors, and he will be held to the same liability to the creditors as before the transfer. He will be still regarded as a shareholder quoad the creditors, although he may be able to show that there was a full or a partial consideration for the transfer, as between him and the transferee.\n\n'The appellees contend that the statute does not admit of such a rule, because it declares that every person becoming a shareholder by transfer succeeds to all the liabilities of the prior holder, and that, therefore, the liabilities of the prior holder, as a stockholder, are extinguished by the transfer. But it was held by this court in Germania Nat. Bank v. Case, supra, that a transfer on the books of the bank is not, in all cases, enough to extinguish liability. The court, in that case, defined as one limit of the right to transfer, that the transfer must be out-and-out, or one really transferring the ownership as between the parties to it. But there is nothing in the statute excluding, as another limit, that the transfer must not be to a person known to be irresponsible, and collusively made with the intent of escaping liability, and defeating the rights given by statute to creditors. Mrs. Valentine might be liable as a shareholder succeeding to the liabilities of Johnson, because she has voluntarily assumed that position; but that is no reason why Johnson should not, at the election of creditors, still be treated as a shareholder, he having, to escape liability, perpetrated a fraud on the statute. This is the veiw enforced by the decision of the Chief Justice in Davis v. Stevens, 17 Blatchf. 259, Fed. Cas. No. 3,653.'\n\n Again, in Stuart v. Hayden, \n169 U.S. 1\n, 42 L. ed. 639, 18 Sup.Ct.Rep. 274, where it was found that a transfer of stock in a national bank had been made with knowledge on the part of the transferrer of the insolvency of the bank, and to escape the double liability, the court, after approvingly citing the previous cases, said (p. 14, L. ed. p. 643, Sup.Ct. Rep. p. 278):\n'And the bank having been, in fact, insolvent at the time of the transfer of his stock-which fact is not disputed-he \n\n[202 U.S. 510, 538]\n\u00a0\n [the transferrer] remained, notwithstanding such transfer, as between the receiver and himself, a shareholder, subject to the individual liability imposed by  5151.'\n\n I need not stop to refer to the subsequent adjudications of this court which expressly reiterate the rulings just reviewed, since they are approvingly cited in the opinion of the court, and, indeed, are made the basis of the ruling. But to my mind it seems clear that the limited liability of Dewey which the court now applies to the eighty shares is repugnant to the previous decisions, and therefore the effect of citing approvingly the cases in question and yet deciding, as the court now does, is but, at one and the same time, to approve and disapprove the previous decisions. Let me briefly state why I think this conclusion inevitable. Certain it is that the previous cases expressly and unequivocally decided that a stockholder who, in fraud of the liability as stated, makes a transfer of his stock, remains, at the election of the creditors, a stockholder to the same extent as if the transfer had not been made, or as if it had been a mere sham. Can there be doubt of this in view of the language of the Case Case, announcing the American rule, of the express statement to that effect in the Bowden Case, and the fact that, in that case, the liability, under the call of the Comptroller, was enforced for the debts existing months after the completed transfer, and not merely for the unsatisfied debts existing at the time of the transfer? Is this not certain also, in view of the declaration in Stuart v. Hayden, that, because of the fraudulent transfer, the stockholder continued to be liable under the statute? And mark, in the Hayden Case, as if ex industria to exclude the conception that the fraud was only relative as to creditors existing at the time of the fraudulent transfer, the court expressly declared that the liability of the transferring stockholder was to the receiver and according to the terms of the statute. And this, but in different form, reiterated the declaration made in the Bowden Case, that the fraud was a fraud on the statute, and not, therefore, \n\n[202 U.S. 510, 539]\n\u00a0\n simply relative as to particular creditors existing at the time.\n Besides, to me it seems that the rule of limited liability now announced is self-destructive. What is the liability which the statute imposes? Is it a responsibility only to pay debts of the bank as they existed at the time a fraudulent transfer was made? Not so; for the only liability imposed by the statute on the stockholders is an obligation to respond to an equal and ratable assessment made by the Comptroller to pay the debts existing at the time of the failure, Rev. Stat.  5151, 5234, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 3465, 3507. From this it results that, if a person is not a stockholder at the time of the failure, he is liable for nothing; and if he is such stockholder, he is liable for the statutory sum, and no other. This plain result of the statute to my mind demonstrates the error of the conclusion as to limited liability now announced. For, if Dewey was not a stockholder at the time of the failure, there is an entire absence of statutory authority to make any assessment whatever upon him; and, if he was such stockholder, then the statute fixed the measure of liability, and there is no power to substitute, by judicial discretion, a liability which the statute does not impose, and which, on the contrary, is excluded by its express terms. In other words, the statute imposes a uniform and ratable liability upon all stockholders who are liable at all, and affords no justification for assessing one stockholder at one amount and another stockholder in another sum, upon the theory that the date of the contracting of debts, and not the date of the failure, is the test of liability.\n And that this departure from the longreceived and judicially- sanctioned construction of the statute will tend to destroy the security of the national banking system by rendering the double liability impossible of enforcement results from a few obvious considerations. Thus, under the rule now announced, one who owns or controls a majority of the stock of a national bank, knowing it to be insolvent, can transfer his stock to wholly irresponsible persons in order to avoid the statutory liability, \n\n[202 U.S. 510, 540]\n\u00a0\n and, by postponing the date of open failure until the existing debts of the bank have been extinguished by novation, leave the creditors existing at the time of the failure with substantially no stockholder to respond to the double liability. Indeed, this condition of things cannot be more cogently made manifest than by considering the facts in this case, as found by the court. What are they? They are that Dewey was an officer of the bank and knew its hopelessly insolvent condition, and that he transferred his stock to avoid the liability, leaving the share in the name of his agent, or causing that agent to put the same in the names of irresponsible people. In effect controlling the affairs of the bank, Dewey delays the open failure until, by a change of the situation, although the indebtedness of the bank may not have diminished, yet, by a mere substitution of creditors, the particular debts due at the time of his fraudulent transfers have largely been extinguished. And thus, when the open failure comes, it is now decided that, as to the shares fraudulently transferred by his agent, Dewey owes nothing towards payment of the debts of the bank, except as to debts still existing, which were contracted prior to the fraudulent transfers. In other words, it is held that, although the bank was insolvent prior to and at the time of the commission of the fraudulent acts, and continued so to the time of the failure, the fraudulent transferrer has accomplished the wrong which the statute was intended to prevent by holding back and preventing the open failure until he had discharged, at the expense of the subsequent creditors of the bank, the indebtedness existing at the time of the fraudulent transfers. Under the rule hitherto prevailing the duty of the administrative officer was plainly marked out in the statute,-to realize the assets, and, if necessary to meet a deficiency of assets, to assess ratably the legal stockholders,-a simple and effective rule. Now the duty of the administrative officer is wholly changed. He must analyze the situation at the bank, he must determine who were creditors at this time and that, in order to fix the liability of stockholders, and, when this process is gone through \n\n[202 U.S. 510, 541]\n\u00a0\n with, instead of levying the equal and ratable statutory liability, he must call upon the shareholders for unequal and unratable contributions.\n I can see no reason for now changing the construction of the national banking act as applied in forty years of administration, as embodied in the text and spirit of the statute, and as sanctioned by a long line of decisions of this court, especially when the inevitable consequence of such change will, in my judgment, operate to the detriment of the public interest and the security and stability of national banks which it was the purpose of Congress by the statute to secure.\n It remains only to briefly notice the case of Peter v. Union Mfg. Co. 56 Ohio St. 181. 46 N. E. 894, heretofore referred to and cited by the court in its opinion. To understand that case a prior decision of the supreme court of Ohio (Brown v. Hitchcock, 36 Ohio St. 667), of which the opinion in the Peter Case was but an evolution, must be taken into view. In Brown v. Hitchcock, interpreting the Ohio law, the supreme court of Ohio held that, by the effect of the Constitution and laws of that state, a stockholder in an Ohio corporation who was subjected to a double liability was impotent to dispose of his stock, however bona fide might be the sale or disposition thereof, so as to escape liability to creditors who were such at the time of the transfer. In other words, the court held that the effect of that double liability imposed by the Ohio statutes was to prevent an efficacious transfer of the stock without the consent of the creditors, since such creditors, despite a bona fide sale, as long as debts contracted previously remained unsatisfied, had the power, if circumstances required, to proceed against the stockholders who were such at the time the debt was contracted, and this irrespective of whether the corporation was, at the time of the transfer, solvent or insolvent. Subsequently, in the Peter Case, the Ohio court was called upon to determine how far a transfer of stock by a stockholder in an Ohio corporation operated to relieve him from future debts of the corporation. As to this question the court, in effect, \n\n[202 U.S. 510, 542]\n\u00a0\n applied to the Ohio statutes the English 'out-and-out' rule; in other words, that court, whilst reiterating its ruling as to existing creditors, decided that a stockholder who made an out-and-out sale, although the corporation was insolvent and the purpose was to escape the double liability, was discharged from any responsibility to future creditors, although remaining liable to existing creditors. The difference between the Ohio statutes, as thus expounded, and the national banking act, as expounded by this court, is at once demonstrated by the statement that, under the national banking act, the stockholder, as repeatedly decided by this court, has a right, when acting in good faith, to dispose of his stock and escape liability both as to existing and future creditors, and that the theory of out-and-out transfers as to future debts, applied by the Ohio court to the statute of that state, was expressly repudiated by this court as to the national banking act in the Case and subsequent decisions. To treat, then, the Ohio case as authoritative here, is, in effect, but to expunge the national banking act from the statutes of the United States, and to substitute in its stead the statutes of Ohio, when such statutes have a wholly different significance as interpreted by the highest court of that state.\n I therefore dissent.\n I am authorized to say that Mr. Justice McKenna and Mr. Justice Day concur in this dissent. \n\n\n\n","99":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMCNEILL v. SOUTHERN R. CO.(1906)\nNo. 370\nArgued: Decided: May 28, 1906\n\n\n\n\n[202 U.S. 543, 544]\n\u00a0\n The Southern Railway Company, a corporation organized under the laws of the state of Virginia, operates, among others, a line of railway passing through Greensboro, North Carolina. At that place the Greensboro Ice & Coal Company, during the times hereafter mentioned, had a coal and wood yard, located some distance from the main track and right of way of the railroad. From this main track, however, there was a private siding or spur track extending across the land of private persons to the establishment of the ice and coal company. In consequence of the views expressed in the opinion it is unnecessary to review the facts as to the construction of this spur track, or to detail the course of dealing between the parties concerning it prior to the origin of this controversy. Certain it is that at one time the railroad delivered cars consigned to the ice and coal company from its main track onto the spur track in question. A dispute arose between the railway company and the ice and coal company concerning demurrage on thirteen cars containing coal and wood consigned to the latter company. In consequence of the refusal of the ice and coal company to pay these charges, the railway, on October 12, 1903, notified the ice and coal company that after October 17, 1903, it would only deliver cars, consigned to the ice and coal company on the public tracks of the railway company at a place known as the team track, set aside for the delivery to the public generally of merchandise of that character. After receiving this notice the ice and coal company ordered four cars of coal from points in the states of Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Tennessee. These cars reached Greensboro between October 18, 1903, and October 22, 1903, were placed upon the team track, and delivery was tendered to the ice and coal company. That company, however, declined to receive or unload the cars elsewhere than on the siding above referred to. An informal complaint on the subject was made by letter on October 20, 1903, to the North Carolina corporation commission, composed of the appellants Franklin McNeill, Samuel L. Rogers, and Eugene C. Beddingfield. After conversations had with \n\n[202 U.S. 543, 545]\n\u00a0\n officers of the railway company, the commission, on October 31, 1903, made an order requiring the railway company, upon payment of freight charges, to make delivery of the cars beyond its right of way and on the siding referred to. Hearing was had on exceptions filed on behalf of the railway company, and on December 10, 1903, the commission made an order overruling the exceptions. The railway company appealed to the circuit court of Guilford county.\n In the meantime, on November 2, 1903, after demurrage or car service charges had attached in respect to the four cars of coal, and to prevent unnecessary interference with its other business, the railway company removed the cars in question from the team track and placed them on a distant siding.\n By chapter 164 of the Public Laws of North Carolina for 1899, creating the corporation commission, and by the acts amendatory thereof, as contained in chapter 20, revisal of 1905, as amended in 1905, it was provided as follows:\n'1086. For Violating Rules.-If any railroad company doing business in this state, by its agents or employees, shall be guilty of a violation of the rules and regulations provided and prescribed by the commission, and if, after due notice of such violation, given to the principal officers thereof, if residing in the state, or, if not, to the manager or superintendent or secretary or treasurer, if residing in the state, or, if not, then to any local agent thereof, ample and full recompense for the wrong or injury done thereby to any person or corporation, as may be directed by the commission, shall not be made within thirty days from the time of such notice, such company shall incur a penalty for each offense of $500. 1899, chap. 164,  15.\n\n'1087. Refusing to Obey Orders of Commission.-Any railroad or other corporation which violates any of the provisions of this chapter, or refuses to conform to or obey any rule, order, or regulation of the corporation commission, shall, in addition to the other penalties prescribed in this chapter, forfeit and \n\n[202 U.S. 543, 546]\n\u00a0\n pay the sum of $500 for each offense, to be recovered in an action to be instituted in the superior court of Wake county, in the name of the state of North Carolina on the relation of the corporation commission; and each day such company continues to violate any provision of this chapter, or continues to refuse to obey or perform any rule, order, or regulation prescribed by the corporation commission, shall be a separate offense. 1899, chap. 164,  23.\n\n ... * *\n'1091. Violation of Rules, Causing Injury; Damages; Limitation.-If any railroad company doing business in this state shall, in violation of any rule or regulation provided by the commission, inflict any wrong or injury on any person, such person shall have the right of action and recovery for such wrong or injury in any court having jurisdiction thereof, and the damages to be recovered shall be the same as in an action between individuals, except that, in case of wilful violation of law, such railroad company shall be liable to exemplary damages; Provided, that all suits under this chapter shall be brought within one year after the commission of the alleged wrong or injury. 1899, chap. 164,  16.'\n\n On January 5, 1904, the bill in this case was filed in the circuit court of the United States for the eastern district of North Carolina to perpetually enjoin the bringing of actions by the ice and coal company and by the commission to recover penalties or damages under the authority of the aforesaid statutory provisions, because of the noncompliance of the railway company with the order of the commission. As grounds for the relief prayed it was averred that the railway company had a common defense based upon the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States, the provisions of the act of Congress to regulate commerce, and the due process clause of the Constitution, and also because the corporation commission was an illegal body, as it was empowered to exercise judicial, executive, and legislative functions, contrary to the Constitutions of the state and of the United States. After the filing \n\n[202 U.S. 543, 547]\n\u00a0\n of answers the cause was referred to a master to report the testimony and findings of fact to the court. The court, concluding that the order of the corporation commission was repugnant to the commerce clause of the Constitution, entered a decree in favor of the railway company, and perpetually enjoined the enforcement of the order of the corporation commission and the bringing of actions to recover penalties or damages for a violation of that order. 134 Fed. 82. The corporation commission and the ice and coal company appealed and the railway company prosecuted a cross appeal upon the ground that the court below erred in not deciding that the corporation commission was an unconstitutional body because of the alleged mixed and peculiar character of the functions conferred upon it by the state statutes.\n Messrs. R. H. Battle, E. J. Justice, and Robert D. Gilmer for McNeill et al.\n\n\n[202 U.S. 543, 549]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Claudian B. Northrop and Fabius H. Busbee for the Southern Railway Company.\n\n\n\n[202 U.S. 543, 558]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice White, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The legal principle which controls the determination of this cause renders it unnecessary to state many of the facts contained in this voluminous record, or to consider and pass upon a number of the legal propositions urged in the cause. But three questions are essential to be passed upon. They are: First. Whether the record discloses that the matter in dispute exceeds, exclusive of interest and costs, the sum or value of $ 2,000. Second. Whether, as to the individual defendants below, this cause in fact was a suit against the state of North Carolina. Third. Whether the order and decision of the corporation commission of North Carolina, and the statutes of that state upon which the same was based, were void because in conflict with the commerce clause of the Constitution and the act of Congress to regulate commerce.\n\n 1. \nIt was urged in argument on behalf of the commission and the ice and coal company that the extra cost or expense, if any, of placing the four cars of coal on the siding, was the matter in controversy. In the court below it would seem to have been claimed that the $146 demurrage was the question at issue. However this may be, as said by the trial court, although the demurrage dispute may have been the origin of the litigation, there is involved in the controversy presented by the bill not only the right to enforce against the railway company the payment of statutory penalties much in excess of $2,000, but also the right of that company to carry on interstate commerce in North Carolina without becoming subject to such orders and directions of the corporation commission which so directly burdened such commerce as to amount to a regulation thereof. This latter right is alleged in the bill to be of the necessary jurisdictional value, the averment was supported by testimony, and the master and the court below have found such to be the \n\n[202 U.S. 543, 559]\n\u00a0\n fact. There is no merit in the contention that there is a want of jurisdiction to entertain the writ of error.\n\n 2. \nWe think the real object of the bill may properly be said to have been the restraining of illegal interferences with the property and interstate business of the railway company, the asserted right to interfere, which it was the object of the bill to enjoin, being based upon the assumed authority of a state statute, which the bill alleged to be in violation of rights of the railway company protected by the Constitution of the United States. In this aspect the suit was not, in any proper sense, one against the state. Scott v. Donald, \n165 \nU.S. 107, 112\n, 41 S. L. ed. 648, 653, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 262; Fitts v. McGhee, \n172 \nU.S. 529, 530\n, 43 S. L. ed. 541, 19 Sup.Ct.Rep. 269.\n\n 3. \nThe cars of coal not having been delivered to the consignee, but remaining on the tracks of the railway company in the condition in which they had been originally brought into North Carolina from points outside of that state, it follows that the interstate transportation of the property had not been completed when the corporation commission made the order complained of. Rhodes v. Iowa, \n170 U.S. 412\n, 42 L. ed. 1088, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 664.\n By  1066 of the revisal of 1905, the general powers of the North Carolina corporation commission were thus defined:\n'1066. General Powers.-The corporation commission shall have such general control and supervision of all railroad, street railway, steamboat, canal, express and sleeping car companies or corporations, and of all other companies or corporations engaged in the carrying of freight or passengers, of all telegraph and telephone companies, of all public and private banks, and all loan and trust companies or corporations, and of all building and loan associations or companies, necessary to carry into effect the provisions of this chapter and the laws regulating such companies. 1899, chap. 164; 1901, chap. 679.'\n\n By  1100 it was provided as follows:\n'1100. Demurrage; Storage; Placing and Loading of Cars.-The commission shall make rules, regulations, and rates governing demurrage and storage charges by railroad companies and other transportation companies; and shall make rules gov- \n\n[202 U.S. 543, 560]\n\u00a0\n erning railroad companies in the placing of cars for loading and unloading and in fixing time limit for delivery of freights after the same have been received by the transportation companies for shipment. 1903, chap. 342.'\n\n Under these circumstances it is undoubted that, by a circular, numbered 36, and dated July 9, 1903, the corporation commission promulgated rules fully regulating the right of railway companies to exact and the amount of charges which might be made for storage, demurrage, etc. And the pleadings make it clear that the order of the corporation commission complained of was not made upon the assumption of any supposed contract right which the corporation commission, as a judicial tribunal, was enforcing as between the ice and coal company and the railway company, but was exclusively rested upon the general administrative authority which the corporation commission deemed it had power to exercise in virtue of the rights delegated to it by the statutes of North Carolina, as above stated. Thus, in paragraph 12 of the answer, the corporation commission averred as follows:\n'These defendants are advised that the orders made by them, hereinbefore referred to, do not constitute an interference with interstate commerce, as alleged in said paragraph 12 (referring to bill of complaint); nor with the right of the complainant to conduct its business according to its reasonable rules and regulations, except so far as the corporation commission has the right and power to control its rules and regulations by virtue of said act creating the corporation commission, and the amendment thereto, contained in chapter 342, Public Laws 1903, whereby the power is expressly conferred upon the North Carolina corporation commission, by subsection 26, 'to make rules governing railroad companies in the placing of cars for loading and unloading, and in fixing time limit for the delivery of freights after the same have been received by the transportation companies for shipment.' And these defendants further say that, having full power to provide for placing cars for unloading, and in conformity with the rules of the said North \n\n[202 U.S. 543, 561]\n\u00a0\n Carolina corporation commission, the orders complained of in the bill were in strict conformity to the law, and finally adjudged and made after the complainant company had full opportunity to make defense as to its alleged rights in the premises.'\n\n Without at all questioning the right of the state of North Carolina, in the exercise of its police authority, to confer upon an administrative agency the power to make many reasonable regulations concerning the place, manner, and time of delivery of merchandise moving in the channels of interstate commerce, it is certain that any regulation of such subject made by the state, or under its authority, which directly burdens interstate commerce, is a regulation of such commerce, and repugnant to the Constitution of the United States. Houston & T. C. R. Co. v. Mayes, \n201 U.S. 321\n, 50 L. ed. --, 26 Sup.Ct.Rep. 491; American Steel & Wire Co. v. Speed, \n192 U.S. 500\n, 48 L. ed. 538, 24 Sup.Ct.Rep. 365.\n Not being called upon to do so, we do not pass upon all the general regulations formulated by the commission on the subject stated, but are clearly of opinion that the court below rightly held that the particular application of those regulations with which we are here concerned was a direct burden upon interstate commerce and void. Viewing the order which is under consideration in this case as an assertion by the corporation commission of its general power to direct carriers engaged in interstate commerce to deliver all cars containing such commerce beyond their right of way and to a private siding, the order manifestly imposed a burden so direct and so onerous as to leave no room for question that it was a regulation of interstate commerce. On the other hand, treating the order as but the assertion of the power of the corporation commission to so direct in a particular case, in favor of a given person or corporation, the order not only was, in its very nature, a direct burden and regulation of interstate commerce, but also asserted a power concerning a subject directly covered by the act of Congress to regulate commerce and the amendments to that act, which forbid and provide remedies to prevent unjust dis- \n\n[202 U.S. 543, 562]\n\u00a0\n criminations and the subjecting to undue disadvantages by carriers engaged in interstate commerce.\n The direct burden and resulting regulation of interstate commerce operated by an alleged assertion of state authority similar in character to the one here involved was passed upon by the circuit court of appeals for the sixth circuit in Central Stock Yards Co. v. Louisville & N. R. Co. 63 L. R. A. 213, 55 C. C. A. 63, 118 Fed. 113. The court in that case was called upon to determine whether certain laws of Kentucky imposed a direct burden upon interstate commerce and were a regulation of such commerce, upon the assumption that those laws compelled a common carrier engaged in interstate commerce transportation to deliver cars of live stock, moving in the channels of interstate commerce, at a particular place beyond its own line, different from the general place of delivery established by the railway company. In pointing out that, if the legislation in question was entitled to the construction claimed for it, it would amount to a state regulation of interstate commerce, it was aptly and tersely said (p. 219, 63 L. R. A., p. 70, 55 C. C. A. and p. 120, 118 Fed):\n'It is thoroughly well settled that a state may not regulate interstate commerce, using the terms in the sense of intercourse and the interchange of traffic between the states. In the case at bar we think the relief sought pertains to the transportation and delivery of interstate freight. It is not the means of making a physical connection with other railroads that is aimed at, but it is sought to compel the cars and freight received from one state to be delivered to another at a particular place and in a particular way. If the Kentucky Constitution could be given any such construction, it would follow it could regulate interstate commerce. This it cannot do.'\n\n As we conclude that the court below rightly decreed that the order complained of was invalid because amounting to an unlawful interference with interstate commerce, we deem it unnecessary to consider the contentions made on the cross appeal of the railway company. And because we confine our decision to the issue which necessarily arises, we do not intimate any \n\n[202 U.S. 543, 563]\n\u00a0\n opinion upon the question pressed at bar as to whether an order which was solely applicable to purely state business, directing a carrier to deliver property upon a private track beyond the line of the railway company, would be repugnant to the due process clause of the Constitution.\n The final decree which the circuit court entered, and the writ of perpetual injunction issued thereon, were, however, much broader than the necessities of the case required, and should be limited so as to adjudge the invalidity of the order complained of, restrain the institution by the defendant of suits or actions for the recovery of penalties or damages founded upon the disobedience of such order, and forbid future interferences, under like circumstances and conditions, with the interstate commerce business of the railway company. As so modified, the decree below is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","100":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMEAD v. CITY OF PORTLAND(1906)\nNo. 56\nArgued: November 27, 1905Decided: January 2, 1906\n\n\n\nStatement by Mr. Justice McKenna:\n Bill in equity to enjoin defendants from closing a certain passageway in the approach of a bridge called the Morrison street bridge, in the city of Portland, Oregon. The approach leads to plaintiffs' wharves. The bill was demurred to and the demurrer sustained by the trial court, plaintiffs declining to plead further, and a decree was entered dismissing the bill. The decree was affirmed by the supreme court of the state. 45 Or. 1, 76 Pac. 347.\n The bill alleges that some of the plaintiffs have been for many years owners of block 76 in the city of Portland, and other plaintiffs have been the owners of block 77. These blocks are bounded on the east by the Willamette river and on the west \n\n[200 U.S. 148, 149]\n\u00a0\n by Front street. Morrison street is the north boundary of block 76 and the south boundary of block 77. Attached to the properties are valuable riparian rights and wharf rights and privileges, which entitled the owners to build, maintain, and use the same to the established wharf line of the river, and on them are warehouses, docks, and wharves of great value, which are occupied by tenants. The properties are located within the donation land claimed by one Daniel H. Lownsdale, under whom plaintiffs claim as owners. In the dedication by Lownsdale of the plat of the town of Portland it is, among other things, provided as follows:\n'The wharves and wharfing privileges are specially reserved to the owners of the claim, and never (except by deed) subject to any but the laws of the territory of Oregon or ordinances of the town or city corporation, as other town (private) property. . . . '\n\n That the common council of said city of Portland adopted an ordinance, No. 2273, entitled 'An Ordinance Authorizing the Construction of a Wharf on the Willamette River in Front and Opposite Lots Numbers 3 and 4, in Block No. 77,' approved September 26, 1878.1 \n\n[200 U.S. 148, 150]\n\u00a0\n Also an ordinance, No. 2387, entitled 'An Ordinance Authorizing the Construction of a Wharf on the Willamette River in Front of and Opposite Lots Nos. 3 and 4, in Block No. 76,' approved February 21, 1879.2\n\n\n[200 U.S. 148, 151]\n\u00a0\n The predecessors in interest of plaintiffs constructed wharves in conformity with the provisions of the ordinances and the grades established therein, the wharf constructed pursuant to ordinance No. 2387 covering the south half of the street, and that constructed pursuant to ordinance No. 2273 covering the north half of the street. The wharves consisted of two floors or stories, with a large warehouse over the second floor. The second floors were built slightly above the level of Front street, with approaches as provided in the ordinances. The lower stories or floors of the wharves were considerable below the level of Front street, and were connected with that street by a roadway running on an incline along Morrison street from Front street down to the portion of the wharves built on Morrison street, which roadway was constructed by the respective owners of the properties. The wharves, docks, and warehouses, and the approach thereto, have been used by plaintiffs and their predecessors for more than twenty years, and have been used as landing places for boats and vessels navigating the river, and by people and teams having business at the docks and wharves, and the docks and wharves and the approach thereto have been used as a street or highway by the public. The grade of Morrison street occupied by the roadway leading from Front street and over that portion of the street upon which the wharves and docks were built has never been established except by said ordinances, and said portions of Morrison street and the roadway have been and are now improved and used, and the same are a public street and highway, and were built and have been maintained 'in reliance of the rights and privileges therein [the ordinance] maintained.'\n In 1878 the legislature of the state of Oregon passed an act authorizing the Portland Bridge Company, or its assigns, to \n\n[200 U.S. 148, 152]\n\u00a0\n construct and maintain a bridge crossing the Willamette river between Portland and East Portland for all purposes of travel and commerce, 'at such point or location on the banks of said river, on and along any of the streets of either of said cities of Portland and East Portland, as may be selected or determined on by said corporation or its assigns, on or above Morrison street of the said city of Portland, and in streets of said city of East Portland; . . . and provided, that the approaches on the Portland side to said bridge shall conform to the present grade of Front street in said city of Portland.'\n The bridge was constructed in 1886, the west end of which was located at the east end of Morrison street. Between the west end of the bridge and Front street a plank road or approach was constructed over Morrison street, but the approach did not conform to the grade of Front street, but was constructed at an elevation of more than 2 feet above such grade at the west end of the bridge, and thence inclined to Front street, and has always been maintained at such elevation. The bridge did not cover the whole of Morrison street from Front street to the west end of bridge, but was so constructed that a portion of Morrison street, in the center thereof and leading from Front street on an incline to the lower docks and wharves of plaintiffs, was left uncovered and unchanged, the same being about 18 feet wide and extending easterly from Front street about 95 feet. The approaches constructed by the bridge company have been and are sufficient for the passage to and from the bridge for foot passengers, cars, and vehicles using the bridge. The opening was left in the decking of Morrison street to provide access to the lower floors of the wharves, and as a means of ingress and egress from them, and did not materially interfere with or obstruct the use of city roadways and the wharves and docks as they had been theretofore used.\n In 1895 the city of Portland purchased, under legislative authority, the Morrison street bridge from the Willamette Iron Bridge Company, the successor in interest to the Portland Bridge Company, and subsequently, under the provision of an \n\n[200 U.S. 148, 153]\n\u00a0\n act of the legislature, approved February 21, 1895, the county court of Multnomah county assumed and has since had the care and operation of the bridge and its approaches.\n In 1886 the Willamette Iron Bridge Company began the construction of the bridge and built two piers in the river to support the western end of the bridge in front of the outer line of plaintiffs' wharves, in such position as to obstruct navigation and to greatly interfere with the access to the wharves, and at the same time began to construct the approach to the bridge over Morrison street in such manner as to interfere with access to the wharves. The owners of the wharves in April, 1887, protested, and a compromise and settlement was effected between the parties, whereby the bridge company agreed to forever leave an opening in the bridge approach substantially as it now is, and in consideration thereof the wharf owners agreed to permit the piers to remain as constructed, and as they have ever since remained, and to waive all objection to the construction of the approach in the manner in which it was constructed, leaving the opening forever open and unobstructed for free ingress and egress to the wharves. The parties acted upon the agreement, and the wharf owners did not begin or prosecute legal proceedings. In 1890, however, the company, notwithstanding the agreement, threatened to close up the opening, whereupon the wharf owners commenced a suit in equity to enjoin the threatened injury, and thereupon, in consideration of the dismissel of the suit, the bridge company entered into another agreement to refrain from the threatened acts, and leave the opening and approach in the condition as the same now is.\n It is alleged that the city of Portland acquired the bridge and the approach thereof subject to the said agreement, and the rights vested in the plaintiffs thereby, and that the defendants are proceeding, without tendering or offering compensation therefor, to close said opening, and thereby deprive plaintiffs of their property without due process of law, contrary to the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. \n\n[200 U.S. 148, 154]\n\u00a0\n And it is alleged that the ordinances of the city of Portland, hereinbefore set out, constitue a contract between the city and plaintiffs' predecessors, and the acts of the legislature of the state of Oregon which have been mentioned, so far as they undertake to confer upon defendants the power to close the opening of such bridge without payment of compensation, impair the obligation of such contract, and violate  10, article 1, of the Constitution of the United States. An injunction was prayed.\n Messrs. Charles H. Carey, C. E. S. Wood, S. B. Linthicum, J. C. Flanders, and Carey & Mays for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n[200 U.S. 148, 158]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. L. A. McNary, and J. P. Kavanaugh for defendants in error.\n\n\n\n[200 U.S. 148, 159]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n If we determine what rights plaintiffs had in Morrison street and the river, we shall be able to determine their contentions. Plaintiffs claim a contract with the city based on the ordinances which authorize plaintiffs to construct their wharves, but they also claim rights which they say were attached to the property and reserved to it by Daniel H. Lownsdale, 'of the wharves and wharfing privileges.' The rights so reserved are made especially dominant. Indeed, the rights obtained from the city are somewhat minimized and depreciated. All the city \n\n[200 U.S. 148, 160]\n\u00a0\n could do, it is said, and all the city attempted to do by its ordinances, was to authorize the riparian owners to build their wharves. Why authority from the city was necessary in view of the reservation in the Lownsdale dedication, if it was as extensive as contended, seems to call for explanation, and explanation is given by saying that the ordinance was but the exercise of the authority to regulate the manner in which the wharves were to be built by the riparian proprietors. And plaintiffs, to point their reliance on the reservation in the Lownsdale dedication, say: 'Whether the ordinances do or do not purport to grant a privilege or right to use or appropriate the street or an extension thereof for wharfing purposes, the right exists, and it existed because of the reservation in the plat, long before the ordinances; and it exists independent of any action of the city. This right is different in kind from the right of the public to use the street. And it is a valuable right, which cannot be taken away or destroyed without compensation.' Plaintiffs, however, in other parts of their argument, claim, by reason of the ordinances, an irrevocable license, and in the pleadings give prominence to nothing else but the rights conferred by the ordinances. On account of this probably neither the trial court nor the supreme court commented on the Lownsdale dedication. But we will not consider plaintiffs precluded by that omission. It is very clear to us that their contention under the Lownsdale dedication is not sound. The purpose of the dedication was an addition to the city. Streets were contemplated and power of the city over them, and this purpose and power is as clear and definite in the dedication as the reservation of rights to lot owners. This was the view of plaintiffs' predecessors when they applied for the ordinances. Therefore the fundamental proposition in the case is the power of the city over its streets, and how far that power was limited or could be limited by the ordinance upon which plaintiffs rely.\n It will be observed that the wharves were constructed on Morrison street and 'used as, and the same are, a public street and highway.' In other words, the bill alleges that the wharves \n\n[200 U.S. 148, 161]\n\u00a0\n on Morrison street formed a part of the street, and were open to general and public use.\n What power the city of Portland had to grant rights in its streets depends upon its charter; and interpreting the ordinance upon which plaintiffs rely, the supreme court of Oregon decided that neither the plaintiffs nor their predecessors in interest were granted rights or privileges in the street different in kind from that enjoyed by the public.\n'The clear purpose of the ordinances,' the court said, 'was to authorize and regulate the construction of wharves in front of private property. It is so expressly stated in the title, and the granting part of the ordinances provides that the owner or owners of certain described property are authorized and permitted to construct a wharf in the river, 'on and in front of' such property. There is nowhere, in either of the ordinances, a grant of any right or privilege to build a wharf at the terminus of Morrison street. In the ordinance adopted in 1878 there is scarcely an inference that the lower floor of the wharf was to extend into Morrison street, and, as regards the upper floor, the provision is that it should not extend beyond the line of the block, except for passageway of a certain described width and over the north side of the street. The grantee was required to construct and maintain pontoons in the river at the foot of the street for the landing of small boats, with steps leading therefrom to the lower floor of the wharf. It was expressly provided that the whole of the passageways along the street and those portions of the wharf extending over and into the street 'shall be subject to regulation by the common council as a part of said street and sidewalks;' thus manifesting an intention to preserve the public character of the street, and not to vest in the grantee any rights or privileges therein not enjoyed by the general public. The ordinance of 1879, in describing the dimensions of the wharf authorized to be erected, says that it shall extend a certain distance south from 'the center line of Morrison street,' and indicates that the wharf constructed by the property owners on the opposite side of the street extended \n\n[200 U.S. 148, 162]\n\u00a0\n to that point. The grant, however, is confined to the construction of a wharf 'on and in front of' private property, there being a provision like the one in the former ordinance requiring the grantees to construct pontoons in the river for the landing of small boats, while the right is reserved to the council to regulate the passageways along the street and any part of the wharves extending therein 'as a part of the street and sidewalk.' The reasonable interpretation of these ordinances is that they were intended to regulate the construction of wharves by the property owners on either side of the street in front of their property, with permission, perhaps, to extend the lower floors of such wharves over and across the foot of Morrison street, for the purpose of affording access from the street to the wharves. There is, however, no grant of any privilege or right to use or appropriate the street or an extension thereof for wharfage purposes. On the centrary, the street and any improvements which may be put there by the abutting property owners were reserved to the use of the entire public, and the grantees had no greater rights under the ordinances than those enjoyed by the general public.' And this construction, the court observed, was supported by the averments of the complaint. It was, therefore, decided that plaintiffs acquired no greater rights in the street than the general public, nor a right to compensation for loss or injury caused by a change in the grade any more than a change in the grade would entitle an abutting owner to compensation because he had improved the street in front of his property. And decided also that the ordinances 'did not give to the plaintiffs or to their predecessors in interest authority to build a wharf at the foot of the street for commercial purposes, but rather conferred the right to improve the street by extending it into the river, so that they could the more readily reach their own property therefrom, and the fact that their improvements have been rendered valueless on account of the subsequent change in the grade of the street does not entitle them to compensation. Neither are they entitled to any rights under the rule applicable \n\n[200 U.S. 148, 163]\n\u00a0\n to an executed parol license. Their occupation of the street and construction of the wharf and landing at the foot thereof were permissive, under ordinances of the city, defining their rights. They could not acquire any interest or easement in the street not conferred by the ordinances, because their use could not, in law, be adverse. Thayer v. New Bedford R. Co. 125 Mass. 253; Washb. Easements,  152, 197.'\n\n Against these conclusions plaintiffs cite other Oregon cases. We are, however, not called upon to reconcile the cases. Plaintiffs point to no case decided prior to the construction of the wharves which interprets the ordinance as they now contend for, which might bring the case within the ruling of Muhlker v. New York & H. R. Co. \n197 U.S. 544\n, 49 L. ed. 872, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 522, and Lewis v. Portland, 25 Or. 159, 22 L. R. A. 736, 42 Am. St. Rep. 772, 35 Pac. 256. And if we could say that the construction of the ordinances by the supreme court is not indisputable, yet we are required by the rule expressed in Burgess v. Seligman, \n107 U.S. 20\n, 27 L. ed. 359, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 10, and the many cases which have followed it, to incline to an agreement with the state court.\n In accordance with the doctrine announced in Brand v. Multnomah County, 38 Or. 79, 50 L. R. A. 389, 84 Am. St. Rep. 772, 60 Pac. 390, 62 Pac. 209, the supreme court decided that a change or alteration of the grade of a street may be made by lawful authority, without liability to abutting property owners for consequential damages, and that the act of October 18, 1878, was a legislative change of the grade of Morrison street for its full width. Plaintiffs do not deny that the legislature has such power. They make, hawever, two contentions: (a) That the act of 1878 was not intended to change the grade of the street, and did not do so. (b) If it did change the grade at all, it changed it as to those portions of the street only which were actually made use of on the new grade as an approach to the bridge, the remainder not being affected by the act.' As to the latter point, it is contended that the power given to the bridge company to build an approach to the bridge on Morrison street to confrom to the grade on Front street was exhausted with the exercise of the right, and that the defendants have no power under the act, after a lapse of twenty years, to extend the \n\n[200 U.S. 148, 164]\n\u00a0\n approach of the bridge to cover the opening in Morrison street, and change the grade where it was not changed when the approach was built.\n The act of 1878 is a local statute, and in its interpretation involves no Federal question, nor does it become such by the circumstances of this case. It expresses the legislative authority, and its interpretation by the supreme court of the state we must accept. And the power to grade was not exhausted by one exercise. Goszler v. Georgetown, 6 Wheat. 593, 597, 5 L. ed. 339, 340; Wabash R. Co. v. Defiance, \n167 U.S. 88\n, 42 L. ed. 87, 17 Sup.Ct.Rep. 748. It is a phase of the same contention that the bridge company was given the right of election of the manner of constructing the approaches, and, being bound by that election, the city, its successor, is also bound.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Ordinance No. 2273.\n'Sec. 1.

CITY OF COLUMBUS(1906)\nNo. 50\nArgued: Decided: December 3, 1906\n\n\n\n Messrs.\n The appellant filed its bill in this case in the United States circuit court for the northern district of Georgia to obtain an injunction restraining the city of Columbus, in the state of Georgia (one of above defendants) from the construction of waterworks for the supplying of water to the defendant city and its inhabitants. Judgment was entered by the circuit court dismissing the bill for the want of jurisdiction, and the question of jurisdiction alone was certified to this court under  5, chapter 517, of the Acts of Congress of 1891. [26 Stat. at L. 827, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 549.]\n The complainant based the jurisdiction of the circuit court on the ground of diverse citizenship, and also upon the existence of a Federal question. An amended bill was filed and a motion made for an injunction pendente lite, enjoining the city from issuing bonds or doing any work towards the construction of the waterworks. The motion was granted, and a demurrer to the amended bill having been overruled, and issue having been joined by the service of an answer and replication, the \n\n[203 U.S. 311, 312]\n\u00a0\n case was referred to a master. Evidence was taken before him, and a report thereafter filed, to which exceptions were duly taken by both parties and an argument had thereon before the court. The judge certifies that, before a decision had been made by the court on the questions of law raised by the exceptions, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the bill, on the ground that, if the parties to the suit were properly placed, there was no such diversity of citizenship as was required to sustain the jurisdiction of the court, and also on the ground that there was no Federal question involved. The court granted the motion on those grounds and made its certificate, as stated.\n The suit was brought by the appellant, a citizen of Maryland, against the city of Columbus, a municipal corporation created by the state of Georgia, and its mayor and aldermen, all of them citizens of the state of Georgia, and against the Columbus Waterworks Company, a corporation also created by the state of Georgia.\n It appears from the averments contained in the bill that the complainant is trustee for the bondholders in a certain mortgage executed by the waterworks company, in January, 1891, to complainant, as trustee, to secure the payment of certain bonds, and to raise money for the purpose of making improvements and additions to the waterworks which were to supply the city of Columbus with water, and for providing for future extensions and improvements thereof. The mortgage is upon all of the company's property, and also upon all contracts made, or thereafter to be made, between the waterworks company and the city of Columbus for the supplying of water by the company to the city, or any public institution of public office. The mortgage also included all the water rents, etc., and all the income whatsoever of the mortgagor, due or to grow due, arising from its business of supplying water within the city, or within its vicinity or elsewhere, during the continuance of the lien under the mortgage.\n It also included therein a contract, which had been entered \n\n[203 U.S. 311, 313]\n\u00a0\n into in October, 1881, between one Thomas R. White, of the city of Philadelphia, and the mayor and council of the city of Columbus (defendant herein) for the construction and operation of an effective system of waterworks for the supplying of the city with water for the various uses required. This is the contract in question in this suit. Provision for a corporation was made in the contract, to which it was to be assigned; the corporation was subsequently created, and such contract was assigned by White to the water company, and the assignment was assented to by the city. The contract provided in great detail for the erection of a water system for the city and for private consumers, and it contained all the usual provisions for that kind of a contract.\n It was, among other things, provided in the contract that the city should grant a franchise to the other party named therein, for the exclusive privilege of maintaining and operating the waterworks for a period of thirty years, or until they might be purchased by the city, as provided in the contract.\n The work under the contract was completed and accepted by the city November 6, 1882, and the company then commenced to, and did, for some years, furnish water, under its provisions, to the city and its inhabitants.\n Thereafter disputes and differences arose between the parties, regarding the sufficient supply of water for the city and its inhabitants, the city contending that the water company had entirely failed to satisfactorily fulfil the contract in that respect. The company contended, on the other hand, that it had done all that possibly could be done, under the circumstances of an extraordinary and unprecedented drought, and was willing to spend more money for the purpose of enlarging its field of supply, if the city would not, by its proposed action, defeat such purpose. The differences continued until finally, on the 14th day of September, 1902, the city passed an ordinance for submitting to the voters of the city the question of issuing $250,000 of bonds of the city, to be used for the purpose of building and operating and owning a system of \n\n[203 U.S. 311, 314]\n\u00a0\n waterworks by the city. A special election was called for the 4th day of December, 1902. The ordinance opened with the statement that the water company had totally failed to supply the city of Columbus and its inhabitants with a sufficient quantity of pure and wholesome water, and that the public health of the city was of paramount importance to every other consideration, and the city, therefore, proposed an ordinance (which it set forth for the approval of the electors) for the issuing of bonds for the building of a separate system of works to be owned and operated by the city. It was provided in the proposed ordinance that if the electors assented to the issue and sale of the bonds to be used for the purpose of building and operating the waterworks, that thereafter bonds of the city should be issued upon certain conditions, and an annual tax should be levied for the payment of the interest on the bonds and a certain proportion of the principal every year. The proposed ordinance also provided that in the event of the assent of the voters at the election, and the issuing of the bonds when the same should have been validated, as by law required, thereafter the waterworks were to be considered a separate and distinct department of the city government, and a water commission was to be created for the government and control and operation of the waterworks. Other provisions were contained in the proposed ordinance, regulating the doing of the work and the operation of the constructed work.\n On the 3d day of December, 1902 (the day before the election under the city ordinance), the legislature, at the request, as it may be presumed, of the city, passed an act to amend its charter, so as to confer power and authority upon the city to construct, maintain, and operate a system of waterworks of its own. The act gave power to the city to appropriate private property, and to lay its pipes through its streets, either within or without the corporate limits of the city, and the city was given power and authority generally to do and perform all things necessary to carry the object and purposes of the act into effect. Section 7 of the act expressly conferred \n\n[203 U.S. 311, 315]\n\u00a0\n upon the city the right to issue and sell its bonds, for the purposes of building and operating the waterworks. Provision was also made in the act for the appointment of a board of water commissioners, who should have the supervision and control of the construction, operation, and management of the waterworks. This board was to regulate the distribution and use of water in all places, it was to fix the price for the use thereof, and terms of payment therefor. The moneys coming into the hands of the board for water rents and the sale of any apparatus or other property, or from any other source connected with the waterworks, were to be paid to the treasurer of the city, and were to be used by him only for the purpose of paying any principal and interest becoming due on the bonds issued by the city. The board was to be regarded as a subordinate branch of the city government.\n The ordinance above mentioned and this act of the legislature of Georgia having been passed subsequently to the execution of the contract, are asserted by the complainant to be acts which impair the obligation of such contract.\n Proceedings were taken under the ordinance, and the election was held pursuant to its provisions on the 4th of December, 1902, and resulted in the assent of the requisite number of electors to the issuing of the bonds and the use of the proceeds in the erection of a water system, to be owned and controlled by the city.\n A board of water commissioners was thereupon appointed, under the provisions of the ordinance and the act of the legislature, and on the 6th of May, 1903, the common council received a communication from the board, through its secretary, wherein the board requested the common council to invite bids for the bonds of the city for the purpose of constructing the system of waterworks, which bids were to be opened on the 1st of August, 1903. Thereupon the common council, on the same day, complied with the request, and directed the publication of a notice for receiving bids for the bonds up to August 1, 1903. \n\n[203 U.S. 311, 316]\n\u00a0\n On the 30th of July, 1903, the complainant filed this bill against the parties named. It is contended in the bill that, as trustee for the bondholders, the complainant can maintain this action, on the ground of an impairment of the obligation of the contract already mentioned, and that, as the water company has mortgaged to the complainant the benefits of its contract with the city, together with the other property of the water company, as security for the payment of its bonds, any such action as proposed by the city will destroy the value of the bonds of the water company, and will amount to the taking of complainant trustee's property without due process of law, and will deprive it of the equal protection of the laws. The water company is made a defendant for the purpose of binding it, as averred in the bill, by the judgment and decree that may be rendered in this cause, so that the right and equity of subrogation, or other rights and equities set up, may be enforced and decreed against the water company, and that the water company may be held and decreed, on its part, to specifically perform all the obligations of such contract. An injunction was asked for and granted, as stated, pendente lite. It was also asked that the defendant city might be enjoined from refusing to carry out the contract with the waterworks company, and from placing any obstacle in the way of the due performance thereof, according to its terms.\n Joseph Packard, Olin J. Wimberly, Louis F. Garrard, and John I. Hall for appellant.\n Messrs. W. A. Wimbish, J. H. Martin, T. T. Miller, and Ellis, Wimbish , & Ellis for appellees.\n\n\n\n[203 U.S. 311, 319]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Peckham, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The sole question arising herein is whether the Federal circuit court had the jurisdiction to determine the issue involved. That question alone has been certified to this court by the circuit court, under the provisions of the 5th section of the act of Congress of 1891. [26 Stat. at L. 827, chap. 517, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 549.] The grounds of the dismissal of the bill are set forth in the foregoing statement of facts.\n Whether this case comes within the principle laid down by this court in Dawson v. Columbia Ave. Sav. Fund, S. D. Title & T. Co. \n197 U.S. 178\n, 49 L. ed. 713, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 420, upon the question of diversity of citizenship, it is unnecessary to determine, because there is, in our \n\n[203 U.S. 311, 320]\n\u00a0\n opinion, a Federal question involved, which gave the circuit court jurisdiction to determine the case without reference to citizenship. It is averred in the bill that by reason of the passage of the ordinance of the common council of the city and the act of the legislature of Georgia, passed December 3, 1902, the obligation of the contract set forth in the bill was impaired. It is part of the duty of the Federal courts, under the impairment of the obligation of contract clause in the Constitution, to decide whether there be a valid contract and what its construction is, and whether, as construed, there is any subsequent legislation, by municipality or by the state legislature, which impairs its obligation. That the ordinance of the common council of a municipal corporation may constitute a law within the meaning of this constitutional clause is too well settled to admit of doubt. St. Paul Gaslight Co. v. St. Paul, \n181 \nU.S. 142, 148\n, 45 S. L. ed. 788, 791, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 575; Davis & F. Mfg. Co. v. Los Angeles, \n189 U.S. 207\n-216, 47 L. ed. 778-780, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 498. The contract in this case provided in terms for the exclusive privilege of supplying water to the city and its inhabitants for thirty years from the date of its completion. By the ordinance of the city of 1902 the city insisted that the water company had totally failed to fulfil its contract to supply water to the city and its inhabitants. Such ordinance then went on and proposed to the electors an ordinance, the material portions of which have been set forth in the foregoing statement.\n The act of the legislature, passed the day before the day of the election, is also referred to in the statement and some of its material provisions are mentioned.\n The ordinance and the act should properly be considered together, and they evidently contemplate an immediate execution of the work in case the electors assented to the issuing of the bonds. If the provisions of the ordinance and act were carried out, the effect, of course, could be none other than disastrous to the water company, as the obligations of the contract (if any) would thereby be so far impaired as to render the contract of no value. The source of the ability of \n\n[203 U.S. 311, 321]\n\u00a0\n the water company to pay the interest on its bonds, and the principal thereof, as they became due, was, by this ordinance and act, entirely cut off.\n Was not this legislation, and legislation of a kind materially to impair the obligation of the contract then existing, and not only to impair, but to wholly destroy its value? We are not called upon now to say whether the exclusive right for thirty years, granted to the water company by the contract to supply the city with water, was legal and valid, because that is a part of the question whether the obligation of the contract has been impaired by the subsequent ordinances of the city and the laws of the state. It cannot be determined that there is an impairment of the obligation of a contract until it is determined what the contract is, and whether it is a valid contract. If it be valid, it still remains to be determined whether the subsequent proceedings of the city council and legislature impaired its obligation. The ordinance and act were not mere statements of an intention on the part of one of the parties to a contract not to be bound by its obligations. Such a denial on the part, even of a municipal corporation, contained in an ordinance to that effect, is not legislation impairing the obligation of a contract. St. Paul Gaslight Co. v. St. Paul, \n181 U.S. 142\n, 45 L. ed. 788, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 575. It was stated in that case that the ordinance in question 'created no new right or imposed no new duty substantially antagonistic to the obligations of the contract, but simply expressed the purpose of the city not in the future to pay the interest on the cost of construction of the lamp posts which were ordered to be removed. . . . When the substantial scope of this provision of the ordinance is thus clearly understood, it is seen that the contention here advanced of impairment of the obligations of the contract arising from this provision of the ordinance reduces itself at once to the proposition that wherever it is asserted, on the one hand, that a municipality is bound by a contract to perform a particular act, and the municipality denies that it is liable under the contract to do so, thereby an impairment of the obligations of the con- \n\n[203 U.S. 311, 322]\n\u00a0\n tract arises, in violation of the Constitution of the United States. But this amounts only to the contention that every case involving a controversy concerning a municipal contract is one of Federal cognizance, determinable ultimately in this court. Thus, to reduce the proposition to its ultimate conception is to demonstrate its error.'\n In the case at bar the conditions are entirely different. There was not merely a denial by the city of its obligation under the contract, but the question is whether there were not new and substantial duties in positive opposition to those contained in the contract created and their performance provided for by the ordinances and act. The act of the legislature aided the city by granting it power to itself erect waterworks and to issue bonds in payment of the cost thereof, and the city was proceeding to avail itself of the power thus granted, when its progress was arrested by the filing of the bill in this case and the issuing of a temporary injunction. It would seem as if the case were really within the principle decided in Walla Walla v. Walla Walla Water Co. \n172 U.S. 1\n, 43 L. ed. 341, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 77; Vicksburg Waterworks Co. v. Vicksburg, \n185 U.S. 65\n, 46 L. ed. 808, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 585, \n202 U.S. 453\n, 50 L. ed. 1102, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 660; Davis & F. Mfg. Co. v. Los Angeles, \n189 U.S. 207\n, 47 L. ed. 778, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 498; Knoxville Water Co. v. Knoxville, \n200 U.S. 22\n, 50 L. ed. 353, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 224. In the last-cited case the water company contended that the agreement mentioned in that case constituted a contract, for which it acquired for a given period the exclusive right to supply water to the city and its inhabitants, and it insisted that the obligation of this contract would be impaired if the city, acting under the acts of the legislature and under the ordinance mentioned, established and maintained an independent and separate system of waterworks in competition with those of the water company. It was held that such a question was one arising under the Constitution of the United States, and that the Federal circuit court had jurisdiction thereof without regard to the citizenship of the parties. It must be remembered that in the case before us the sole question is whether the Federal circuit court had jurisdiction to determine the \n\n[203 U.S. 311, 323]\n\u00a0\n case, and we are not now concerned with the question as to how the matter should be determined, but only whether the circuit court had jurisdiction to determine it. As stated in Vicksburg Waterworks Co. v. Vicksburg, \n185 U.S. 65\n, at page 82, 46 L. ed. 808, at page 815, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 585, at page 592, in speaking of the question of jurisdiction: 'We do not wish to be understood as now determining such questions in the present case, for we are only considering whether or not the circuit court had jurisdiction to consider them.'\n Concluding that the court below had such jurisdiction, because it presents a controversy arising under the Constitution of the United States, the judgment of the Circuit Court is reversed, and the case remanded to that court to take proceedings therein according to law.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","102":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMERCHANTS' NAT BANK OF CINCINNATI v. WEHRMANN(1906)\nNo. 256\nArgued: April 26, 1906Decided: May 14, 1906\n\n\n\n\n[202 U.S. 295, 296]\n\u00a0\n Mr. W. C. Herron for plaintiff in error.\n\n Messrs. C. Bentley Matthews, William J. Shroder, J. H. Ralston, and Joseph B. Kelley for defendants in error.\n\n\n\n[202 U.S. 295, 298]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a bill for the dissolution of a partnership, a receiver and an account. The partnership was formed to purchase, improve, divide into lots, and sell a leasehold. There were forty shares in the firm, represented by transferable certificates. The plaintiff in error took nine of these shares as security for a debt, and afterwards became the owner of them in satisfaction of the debt, subject to the question whether the transaction was within the powers of a national bank. It was found at the trial that the partners must contribute to pay the debts of the firm, and, some of them being insolvent, the bank was charged with the full share of a solvent partner. The supreme court of the state held this to be wrong, but decided that the bank became a part owner of the property, and that, \n\n[202 U.S. 295, 299]\n\u00a0\n as it joined in the management of the same, it was liable for nine fortieths of the expenses, which constituted the debts of the firm. 69 Ohio St. 160, 68 N. E. 1004. A decree was entered to that effect, and the bank brought the case here.\n It is objected at the outset that this court has no jurisdiction because the specific question was not raised sufficiently upon the record. But at the trial the bank objected that under the statutes of the United States it could not be held liable as a partner, following the frame of the bill and meeting the ruling of the court. Then, when the supreme court, after discussion of the statutes, imposed the modified liability and sent the case back, it objected that under the same statutes it could not be held liable for any proportion of the debts of the firm, and took this question on exceptions again to the supreme court. It showed at every stage its intention to rely upon the United States banking laws for immunity, and it would be an excessive requirement to hold the bank bound in the first instance to anticipate the specific and qualified form in which the immunity finally was denied. In addition to the foregoing facts, all of which appear on the record, the supreme court made a certificate part of its record and judgment, to the effect that it became and was material to consider whether the bank had power under Rev. Stat.  5136, 5137, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 3455-3460, to become liable for the nine fortieths, as above stated, and that the decision was against the claim of the plaintiff in error. Marvin v. Trout, \n199 \nU.S. 212, 223\n, 50 S. L. ed.--, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 31; Cincinnati, P. B. S. & P. Packet Co. v. Bay, \n200 U.S. 179\n, 50 L. ed.--, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 208. Of course such a claim of immunity under the laws of the United States, if sufficiently set up, can be brought to this court. California Nat. Bank v. Kennedy, \n167 U.S. 362\n, 42 L. ed. 198, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 831. See Meyer v. Richmond, \n172 U.S. 82\n, 43 L. ed. 374, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 106.\n The question of substantive law presented is not without difficulty. It is not disposed of by the general proposition that a national bank may take, by way of security, property in which it is not authorized to invest, and may become owner of it by foreclosure or in satisfaction of a debt. It is not disposed of even by the decisions that it may acquire stock in a corporation \n\n[202 U.S. 295, 300]\n\u00a0\n in this way (First Nat. Bank v. National Exch. Bank, \n92 U.S. 122\n, 23 L. ed. 679), and so subject itself to the liability of a stockholder for the corporate debts (Germania Nat. Bank v. Case, \n99 U.S. 628\n, 25 L. ed. 448; California Nat. Bank v. Kennedy, \n167 \nU.S. 362, 366\n, 367 S., 42 L. ed. 198, 200, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 831; First Nat. Bank v. Converse, \n200 \nU.S. 425, 438\n, 50 S. L. ed. --, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 306),-a proposition not shaken by Scott v. Deweese, \n181 \nU.S. 202, 218\n, 45 S. L. ed. 822, 830, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 585. For it does not follow that because the interest in a partnership is represented by a paper certificate in form more or less resembling a certificate of stock in a corporation and transferable like it, a national bank can take the partnership certificate to the same extent that it could take the stock.\n As the supreme court of Ohio assumes such partnerships and certificates to be valid, we assume them to be. Wells v. Wilson, 3 Ohio, 425; Walburn v. Ingilby, 1 Myl. & K. 61, 76; Re Mexican & South American Co. 27 Beav. 474, 481, 4 De G. & J. 320; Phillips v. Blatchford, 137 Mass. 510. We may assume further, in accordance with a favorite speculation of these days, that philosophically a partnership and a corporation illustrate a single principle, and even that the certificate of a share in one represents property in very nearly the same sense as does a share in the other. In either case the members could divide the assets after paying the debts. But, from the point of view of the law, there is a very important difference. The corporation is legally distinct from its members, and its debts are not their debts. Therefore, when a paid-up share in a corporation is taken, no liability is assumed, apart from statute, but simply a right equal in value to a corresponding share in the assets and good will of the concern after its debts are paid. If the right is worth something, it is a proper security; and if it is worth nothing, no harm is done. It is true that a statute may add a liability, but when, as usual, this is limited to the par value of the stock, it has not been considered to affect the nature of the share so fundamentally as to prevent a national bank from taking it in pledge, with qualifications, as it might take land or bonds.\n But to take a share by transfer on the books means to be- \n\n[202 U.S. 295, 301]\n\u00a0\n come a member of the concern. The person who appears on the books of the corporation as the stockholder is the stockholder as between him and the corporation, and his rights with regard to the corporate property are incident to his position as such. Germania Nat Bank v. Case, \n99 \nU.S. 628, 631\n, 25 S. L. ed. 448, 449; Pullman v. Upton, \n96 U.S. 328\n, 24 L. ed. 818. This does not matter, or matters less, in the case of a corporation, for the reasons which we have stated. But when a similar transfer is made of a share in a partnership, it means that the transferee at once becomes a member of the firm and goes into its business with an unlimited personal liability,-in short, does precisely what a national bank has no authority to do. This the supreme court of Ohio rightly held beyond the powers of the bank. U. S. Rev. Stat.  5136, 5137.1 It is true that it has been held that a pledgee may escape liability if it appears on the certificate and books that he is only a pledgee. Pauly v. State Loan & Trust Co. \n165 U.S. 606\n, 41 L. ed. 844, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 465; Robinson v. Southern Nat Bank, \n180 U.S. 295\n, 45 L. ed. 536, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 383; Rankin v. Fidelity Ins. Trust & S. D. Co. \n189 \nU.S. 242, 249\n, 47 S. L. ed. 792, 795, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 553. No doubt the security might be realized without the pledgee ever becoming a member of the firm. It is not necessary in this case to say that shares like the present could not be accepted as security in any form by a national bank. But such a bank cannot accept an absolute transfer of them to itself. It recently has been decided that a national bank cannot take stock in a new speculative corporation, with the common double liability, in satisfaction of a debt. First Nat. Bank v. Converse, \n200 U.S. 425\n, 50 L. ed. --, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 306. A fortiori, it cannot take shares in a partnership to the same end.\n We are of opinion that with the liability as partner all liability falls. The transfer of the shares to the bank was not a direct transfer of a legal interest in the leasehold, which was in the hands of trustees. It was simply a transfer of a right to have the property accounted for and to receive a share of any balance left after paying debts, and the acquisition of this right was incident solely to membership in the firm. If the membership failed the incidental rights failed with it, and with the \n\n[202 U.S. 295, 302]\n\u00a0\n rights the liabilities also disappeared. Becoming a member of the firm was the condition of both consequences. As the bank was not estopped by its dealings to deny that it was a partner, it was not estopped to deny all liability for partnership debts. See California Nat. Bank v. Kennedy, \n167 \nU.S. 362, 367\n, 42 S. L. ed. 198, 200, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 831. It seems to us unnecessary to add more in order to show that the claim against the plaintiff in error must be dismissed.\n Judgment reversed.\n Mr. Justice Harlan, Mr. Justice Brewer, and Mr. Justice McKenna dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] U.

POWERS(1906)\nNo. 397\nArgued: Decided: April 2, 1906\n\n\n\n\n\n[201 U.S. 245, 247]\n\u00a0\n This suit was brought in the circuit court of the United States for the western district of Michigan to restrain the respondent, the auditor general of the state, from enforcing against the appellant the provisions of act No. 173 of the Michigan Laws of 1901, an act to provide for the assessment of the property of railroad and certain other companies, for the levying of taxes thereon by a state board of assessors, and for the collection of such taxes. The taxes involved in the suit are those for 1902, resulting from the first assessment under the statute. Prior to the year 1900 the Constitution of Michigan contained, in art. 14, the following sections applicable to taxation:\n'Sec. 10. The state may continue to collect all specific taxes accruing to the treasury under existing laws. The legislature may provide for the collection of specific taxes from banking, railroad, plank road, and other corporations hereafter created.\n\n'Sec. 11. The legislature shall provide a uniform rule of taxation, except on property paying specific taxes, and taxes shall be levied on such property as shall be prescribed by law.\n\n'Sec. 12. All assessments hereafter authorized shall be on property at its cash value.\n\n'Sec. 13. The legislature shall provide for an equalization by a state board in the year one thousand eight hundred and fifty-one, and every fifth year thereafter, of assessments on all taxable property except that paying specific taxes.\n\n'Section 14. Every law which imposes, continues, or revives a tax shall distinctly state the tax, and the object to which it is to be applied; and it shall not be sufficient to refer to any other law to fix such tax or object.' \n\n[201 U.S. 245, 248]\n\u00a0\n In that year  10, 11, and 13 were amended so as to read as follows:\n\n'Sec. 10. The state may continue to collect all specific taxes accruing to the treasury under existing laws. The legislature may provide for the collection of specific taxes from corporations. The legislature may provide for the assessment of the property of corporations, at its true cash value, by a state board of assessors, and for the levying and collection of taxes thereon. All taxes hereafter levied on the property of such classes of corporations as are paying specific taxes under laws in force on November sixth, A. D. nineteen hundred, shall be applied as provided for specific state taxes in  1 of this article.\n\n'Sec. 11. The legislature shall provide an uniform rule of taxation, except on property paying specific taxes, and taxes shall be levied on such property as shall be prescribed by law: Provided, That the legislature shall provide an uniform rule of taxation for such property as shall be assessed by a state board of assessors, and the rate of taxation on such property shall be the rate which the state board of assessors shall ascertain and determine is the average rate levied upon other property upon which ad valorem taxes are assessed for state, county, township, school, and municipal purposes.\n\n'Sec. 13. In the year one thousand nine hundred and one, and every fifth year thereafter, and at such other times as the legislature may direct, the legislature shall provide for an equalization of assessments by a state board, on all taxable property, except that taxed under laws passed pursuant to  10 of this article.'\n\n This change in the Constitution was doubtless owing to a decision of the supreme court of the state (Pingree v. Auditor General [Pingree v. Dix] 120 Mich. 95, 44 L. R. A. 679, 78 N. W. 1025), of date of April 26, 1899, holding unconstitutional an act passed in 1881 in respect to the assessment and taxation of telegraph and telephone lines. An act 19 of 1899, passed March 15, 1899, and commonly called the 'Atkinson bill,' was subject to the same objections as the \n\n[201 U.S. 245, 249]\n\u00a0\n act of 1881, and was evidently regarded as equally unconstitutional. Indeed, though not directly involved in that suit, it was referred to in the opinion of Mr. Justice Montgomery.\n The act in controversy (Pub. Acts 1901, act No. 173) provides that the board of state tax commissioners shall constitute a state board of assessors, who are to assess the railroad and certain other corporate property in the state. Section 5 contains the following:\n'Sec. 5. The term 'property' as used in this act shall be deemed to include all property, real or personal, belonging to the corporation subject to taxation under this act, including the right of way, roadbed, stations, cars, rolling stock, tracks, wagons, horses, office furniture, telegraph or telephone poles, wires, conduits, switchboards and all other property used in carrying on the business of said corporations or owned by them respectively, and all other real and personal property and all franchises, said franchises not to be directly assessed, but to be taken into consideration in determining the value of the other property: Provided, however, That this definition shall not include, apply to, or subject to taxation, such real estate as is owned and can be conveyed by such corporations under the laws of this state which is not actually occupied in the exercise of their franchises or in use in the proper operation of their roads or their corporate business; but such real estate so excepted shall be liable to taxation in the same manner and for the same purposes and to the same extent and subject to the same conditions and limitations as to the collection and return of taxes thereon, as is other real estate in the several townships or municipalities in which the same may be situate. The term 'company,' 'corporations,' or 'associations,' wherever used in this act, shall apply to and be construed as referring respectively to any railroad company, union station and depot company, express company, car-loaning company, or refrigerator or fast freight line company, and any and all other corporations subject to taxation under this act. The term 'property having a situs in this state' shall include all the property, real and per- \n\n[201 U.S. 245, 250]\n\u00a0\n sonal, of the corporations enumerated in this act, owned, used, and occupied by them within the limits of this state, and also such proportion of the rolling stock, cars, and other property of such corporations as is used partly within and partly without this state, as herein provided to be determined.'\n\n By  6 and 7 the several corporations are required to furnish information as to various matters of fact bearing on the matter of assessment. By  8 property is to be assessed at its 'true cash value' on the second Monday of April of each year, and, for the purposes of the assessment, the board of assessors is authorized to make personal inspection of the property, to take into consideration the reports filed under the act, and such other evidence as may be obtainable bearing thereon. In respect to the property of railroads running partly within and partly without the state, the board is directed to be guided in respect to the matter of taxation of property within the state by the relation which the number of miles of main tract within the state bears to the entire mileage of the main track, both within and without the state. By  10 the board is required to meet at the capitol at Lansing on the third Monday of December, and continue in session so long as may be necessary, not later than January 15 next thereafter, for the purpose of reviewing the assessment roll, and any person or company interested has the right to appear during said period and be heard by the assessors, and they are authorized on such application, or on their own motion, to correct the assessment or valuation. Sections 11 and 12 prescribe the method for fixing the rate of tax, the purpose being to impose upon the railroad property the average rate of taxation levied upon other property upon which ad valorem taxes are assessed. This method is accurately described by counsel for the railroad company in these words:\n'The new and peculiar feature of the statute lies in the application to corporate property of a special rate of tax, known as the 'average rate,' which is derived by the following process: The total ad valorem taxes for all purposes,-state, county, city, \n\n[201 U.S. 245, 251]\n\u00a0\n township, village, and school district,-paid by property in Michigan which is taxed otherwise than under act 173, are divided by the total assessments of such property, whether made by one or another assessor, and the quotient resulting from this process of division is the rate of tax applied to corporate property under act 173.'\n\n By  16 the taxes collected from corporations under this act are to 'be applied in paying the interest upon the primary school, university, and other educational funds, and the interest and principal of the state debt, in the order herein recited, until the extinguishment of the state debt other than the amounts due to educational funds, when such taxes shall be added to and constitute a part of the primary-school interest fund.'\n After a full hearing upon pleadings and proofs the circuit court entered a decree dismissing the bill (138 Fed. 223), whereupon the plaintiff appealed directly to this court, under  5 of the circuit court of appeals act.\n Messrs. Lloyd W. Bowers, O. E. Butterfield, Benton Hanchett, A. C. Angell, Henry Russell, and Ashley Pond for appellant.\n\n\n[201 U.S. 245, 266]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles A. Blair, Roger Irving Wykes, Loyal E. Knappen, John E. Bird, and Charles E. Townsend for appellee.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Brewer:\n\n\n[201 U.S. 245, 290]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n The unconstitutionality of a statute may depend upon its conflict with the Constitution of the state or with that of the \n\n[201 U.S. 245, 291]\n\u00a0\n United States. If conflict with the state Constitution is the sole gound of attack, the supreme court of the state is the final authority ( Merchants' & M. Nat. Bank v. Pennsylvania, \n167 U.S. 461\n, 42 L. ed. 236, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 829, and cases cited in the opinion); while, in the other case, the ultimate decision rests with this court. The validity of this act has not been directly presented to or determined by the state court, but the first attack by the parties interested is made in the Federal court and by this suit, and conflict with both Constitutions is alleged. Undoubtedly a Federal court has the jurisdiction, and, when the question is properly presented, it may often become its duty, to pass upon an alleged conflict between a statute and the state Constitution, even before the question has been considered by the state, and therefore of general public interest. of the act, whether springing out of the state or of the Federal Constitution, may be presented in a single suit, and call for consideration and determination. At the same time the Federal courts will be reluctant to adjudge a state statute to be in conflict with the state Constitution before that question has been considered by the state tribunals. Especially is this true when the statute is one affecting the revenues of the suate, and therefore of general public interest. Coulter v. Louisville & N. R. Co. \n196 U.S. 599\n-609, 49 L. ed. 615-618, 25 Sup.Ct.Rep. 342. And this reluctance becomes more imperative when the statute has been before the highest court of the state, and a decision rendered upon the assumption that it is valid, and this, although the direct question of validity was not presented nor determined.\n In the case at bar the rate of taxation imposed upon the railroad and other corporate property is the average rate of taxation upon other property subject to ad valorem taxes, and that average rate is ascertained by dividing the total tax levy on all such property by the value of the property. In Board of Education v. State Assessors, 133 Mich. 116, 94 N. W. 668, the following case arising under the statute was presented (p. 117, N. W. p. 668):\n'This is an application for a mandamus. It sets out, in substance, that the state board of assessors, in levying the tax upon the railroad property of this state, has assumed to fix the rate \n\n[201 U.S. 245, 292]\n\u00a0\n of taxation by dividing the total tax levy on all property other than railroad property by the value of such other property, as determined by the defendant board, by adding to the actual assessed value of such property as fixed by the local assessors and by the board of state tax commissioners, acting under the authority of the law relating to the assessment of taxes, the sum of $296,748,142, thus making the aggregate divisor in determining the rate of taxation that much in excess of the assessed valuation, thereby reducing the rate to be levied upon the railroad property of the state, and thus reducing the amount which the relator would receive as its portion of the tax assessed against railroad property by a very substantial sum.'\n\n This application was sustained, the court holding that the state board of assessors had no power to increase the value as returned to them by the local assessors and board of state tax commissioners, and saying (p. 119, N. W. p. 669):\n'A fair reading of this language of the statute, we think, leads to the conclusion that the board of assessors has imposed upon it the duty, ministerial in character, of determining by a computation from data, which the law provides for placing in its hands, the rate of taxation which other property in the state is subjected to, as it appears by assessment rolls which are supposed to contain an accurate and true assessment of all property at its full cash value.'\n\n While this case did not directly determine the constitutionality of the statute, a fair implication is that it was not regarded as obviously in conflict with the state Constitution, for in that event the court would scarcely have taken time to consider the validity of proceedings under its authority.\n We, therefore, proceed to inquire whether the provisions of this act and the method of taxation therein prescribed are open to any constitutional objection. We have had frequent occasion to consider questions of state taxation in the light of the Federal Constitution, and the scope and limits of national interference are well settled. There is no general supervision \n\n[201 U.S. 245, 293]\n\u00a0\n on the part of the nation over state taxation, and, in respect to the latter, the state has, speaking generally, the freedom of a sovereign, both as to objects and methods. It was well said by Judge Wanty, delivering the opinion of the circuit court in this case (p. 232):\n'There can at this time be no question, after the frequent and uniform expressions of the Federal Supreme Court, that it was not designed by the 14th Amendment to the Constitution to prevent a state from changing its system of taxation in all proper and reasonable ways, nor to compel the states to adopt an iron rule of equality, to prevent the classification of property for purposes of taxation, or the imposition of different rates upon different classes. It is enough that there is no discrimination in favor of one as against another of the same class, and the method for the assessment and collection of the tax is not inconsistent with natural justice.

Reynolds, \n183 U.S. 471\n, 46 L. ed. 283, 22 Sup.Ct.Rep. 176.'\n\n The first and principal matter of attack is the 'average rate.' It is contended that the fixing of the rate of taxation is a legislative function; that in ascertaining the average rate by the method described there is no exercise of the legislative judgment, but that it is determined by the action of the various local assessing and taxing boards, who, though charged with no \n\n[201 U.S. 245, 294]\n\u00a0\n duty of inquiry as to the necessities of the state or the proper rate of taxation of railroad property, are in fact the only officials exercising any discretion and judgment.\n There might be a question whether, even if there were a clear delegation of legislative functions to other departments of the state government, it would be void under the Federal Constitution. Whatever, in view of the distinct grant in the Federal Constitution to the President, Congress, and the Judiciary of separately the executive, legislative, and judicial powers of the nation, may be the power of Congress in the delegation of legislative functions, a very different question is presented when the restrictions of the Federal Constitution are invoked to restrain like action in a state. Crimes against the nation must be prosecuted by indictment, yet a state may proceed by information. Suppose a state, by its Constitution, grants legislative functions to the executive, or to the judiciary, what provision of the Federal Constitution will nullify the action? Will the grant work an abandonment of a republican form of government, or be a denial of due process, or equal protection?\n But it is unnecessary to enter into a discussion of this question, for in the case at bar there is no abandonment by the legislature of its functions in respect to taxation. The statute prescribes, as the rate of taxation upon railroad property, the average rate of taxation on all other property subject to ad valorem taxes. It provides the most direct way for ascertaining such average rate,-deducing it from a consideration of all the other rates. No authority is given to the local assessors to apply their judgment to the question of the railroad rate. Their authority in respect to the matter of taxation is precisely the same as it was before and independently of this statute. Their duty is to act according to their judgments in respect to local taxes committed to their charge. When they have finished their action, taken, as it must be assumed to have been, in conscientious discharge of the duties assigned, from it, by a simple mathematical calculation, the average rate of taxation is determined. If the legislature should be convened after they \n\n[201 U.S. 245, 295]\n\u00a0\n have finished their action and then prescribe the average rate thus mathematically deduced as the rate of railroad taxation, no question could be made of its validity. It would be obviously a legislative determination of the rate of taxation. Is it any the less a legislative determination that it assumes that the various local officials will discharge their duties honestly and fairly, with reference to local necessities, and independently of the effect upon the railroad rate, and directs that the mathematical computation be made by a board of ministerial officers, and, thus made, shall become the railroad rate of taxation? Why is it necessary that the legislature be convened to add its formal approval of the integrity of the action of the local officers? May it not intrust the mathematical computation to the state board of assessors, and if so, may it not likewise act upon the assumption that the local assessors will discharge their duties with an eye single to those duties, and irrespective of the effect upon the railroad rate? It is true there is a possibility that some local board may be actuated by other than a sense of duty to the community for which it is acting, and have a thought of the ultimate effect upon the railroad rate. There is always a possibility of misconduct on the part of officials, but legislation would be seriously hindered if it may not proceed upon the assumption of a proper discharge of their duties by the various officials. And it must be remembered that, in view of the vast multitude of local taxing boards (as stated in one of the briefs of counsel for appellant, there are about 1,300 local assessment districts), the action of any single board could have but little influence upon the railroad rate. Beyond the assumption that these local officers will act from a sense of duty is the further fact that their action affects directly and principally the special communities for which they act, and that, generally speaking, is a sufficient guaranty. As said by Mr. Chief Justice Marshall, in M'Culloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 428, 4 L. ed. 579, 606:\n'The only security against the abuse of this power is found in the structure of the government itself. In imposing a tax, \n\n[201 U.S. 245, 296]\n\u00a0\n the legislature acts upon its constituents. This is, in general, a sufficient security against erroneous and oppressive taxation.'\n\n And again, in Providence Bank v. Billings, 4 Pet. 514, 563, 7 L. ed. 939, 956:\n'This vital power may be abused; but the Constitution of the United States was not intended to furnish the corrective for every abuse of power which may be committed by the state governments. The interest, wisdom, and justice of the representative body, and its relations with its constituents, furnish the only security, where there is no express contract, against unjust and excessive taxation, as well as against unwise legislation generally.'\n\n Maine v. Grand Trunk R. Co. \n142 U.S. 217\n, 35 L. ed. 994, 3 Inters. Com. Rep. 807, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 121, 163, is worthy of consideration on this question of legislative determination. The legislature of Maine graded the rate of an excise tax imposed upon railroads by the amount of their gross transportation receipts, and provided that, when a railroad was partly within and partly without the state, the gross receipts chargeable to the road within the state should be ascertained on the mileage basis. The court below held that as the Grand Trunk Railroad was partly within and partly without the state of Maine, the imposition of the tax was a regulation of commerce, and therefore in conflict with the exclusive power of Congress over interstate and foreign commerce; and rendered judgment for the company.\n But this court, reversing that judgment, held that the reference to the receipts was simply to ascertain the value of the business done by the corporation, and thus obtain a reasonable conclusion as to the amount of tax which should be levied, saying (p. 229, L. ed. p. 996, Inters. Com. Rep. p. 809, Sup.Ct.Rep. p. 122):\n'If the amount ascertained were specifically imposed as the tax, no objection to its validity would be pretended. And if the inquiry of the state as to the value of the privilege were limited to receipts of certain past years instead of the year in which the tax is collected, it is conceded that the validity of the tax would not be affected; and if not, we do not see how \n\n[201 U.S. 245, 297]\n\u00a0\n a reference to the results of any other year could affect its character.'\n\n See also Home Ins. Co. v. New York, supra, and cases cited in the opinion. Of course, a passenger on the Grand Trunk Railroad knew that the fare he was paying was increasing the gross receipts, and therefore indirectly affecting the amount of the tax collectible under the statute. But it was not to be assumed that he would travel and pay fare with that object in view. No more can it be assumed in the present case that the local taxing officers, although knowing that an increase in their local tax levy will increase the tax rate upon railroads, will be led by that knowledge to forget their single duty to the community for which they are acting. No one pays money for the mere sake of compelling others to pay. Some personal advantage must be intended. No more will local tax officers levy a tax upon their neighbors, those who have placed them in position, for the mere sake of increasing the tax burden upon railroads, especially when the local levy is not followed by an equal increase in the amount of the burden cast upon railroads, and but a trifling fraction of that increase inures, either directly or indirectly, to the benefit of the taxpayers of the locality. The total value of other property in Michigan subject to ad valorem taxes was, according to the record, in the neighborhood of $1,500,000,000. A tax levy in the city of Detroit for local purposes of $1,500,000 would, therefore, increase the rate of taxation on railroad property only one mill, and that increase would profit Detroit but little, as the railroad tax is appropriated for state purposes only.\n It may be laid down as a general proposition that where a legislature enacts a specific rule for fixing a rate of taxation, by which rule the rate is mathematically deduced from facts and events occurring within the year and created without reference to the matter of that rate, there is no abdication of the legislative function, but, on the contrary, a direct legislative determination of the rate.\n Again, it seems more reasonable that the average rate should \n\n[201 U.S. 245, 298]\n\u00a0\n be fixed by this mathematical computation from the other rates already established than for the legislature to prescribe in advance that which it may hope will be such rate. In the one case the exact average is determined; in the other an estimate is made, which may turn out to be more or less than the average.\n While the peculiar method of ascertaining the average rate prescribed by this statute may be new, yet the application of an average rate to the taxation of railroads in not new, nor confined to Michigan. See  1, chap. 64, Public Statutes and Session Laws of New Hampshire of January 1, 1901, section first enacted in 1878; 1 Mass. Rev. Laws (1902) chap. 12,  93, p. 227; chap. 14,  37, 40, pp. 266, 268, incl., taken from laws of 1864, 1865, and 1880; 2 Mo. Rev. Stat. (1899)  9363, 9364, pp. 2175, 2176; Wis. Laws (1903) chap. 315,  7-14, incl. pp. 496-499; Boston, c. & M. R. Co. v. State, 60 N. H. 87; State ex rel. Brown v. Missouri P. R. Co. 92 Mo. 137, 6 S. W. 862; Chicago & A. R. Co. v. Lamkin, 97 Mo. 496, 10 S. W. 200; State ex rel. Gottlieb v. Metropolitan Street R. Co. 161 Mo. 189, 199, 61 S. W. 603.\n We have thus far assumed that there was equity and justice in applying to railroad property the average rate of taxation imposed upon other property. But this assumption is challenged. For instance, the Chicago & Northwestern Railroad Company's property is situate in the upper peninsula of the state of Michigan-- 'and yet the average rate of tax applied to its property depends upon, and increases with, the taxes raised on all the counties of the 'Lower Peninsula' of Michigan, and in all the cities, towns, villages, and school districts of those counties, for purely local purposes. If Detroit spends $10,000,000 for local government, the Northwestern Railway Company has to pay proportionately more tax on its property in northern Michigan than if Detroit's tax for local government were $5,000,000; and, beyond that, if Detroit spends $1,000,000 or $5,000,000 for purely domestic or private enterprises, such as \n\n[201 U.S. 245, 299]\n\u00a0\n gas works, waterworks, street railways, parks, baths, libraries, etc., the Northwestern Railway's tax on its property (though wholly outside of Detroit-in the 'Upper Peninsula') is proportionately larger on that account.\n ... * *\n'It may well be that (as respects the immediate point) the unity of railroad property would justify a statute requiring a railroad to pay taxes to the state at a rate derived by averaging the taxes, state and local, paid by others in the same taxing jurisdiction; but the question before the court is whether it can be made to pay a tax directly dependent upon, and measured by, the local taxes of counties, cities, towns, villages, and school districts where it has no part of its property and no office. Such a plan operates to tax the railroad because of the expenses ( public and private) of local communities whose benefits it does not enjoy.'\n\n But these considerations appeal mainly to the discretion of the legislature, and do not make against its power. Unless there be some specific provisions in the state Constitution compelling other action, the state may treat its entire territory as composing but a single taxing district, and deal with all property as within the district and subject to taxation accordingly. There is no magic in county organization, no inherent necessity of dividing the state into small taxing districts. Frequently railroads are separated from other property, assessed by a state board, and the taxes collected therefrom applied to the general purposes of the state. Sometimes, it is true, a portion of the taxes thus collected is distributed pro rata to the counties along the lines of the roads, but the power of the state to apply the taxes from railroad property to only state purposes cannot be doubted, and is often exercised. If it may take all the taxes received from railroad property and apply it to general state purposes, and, to that extent, relieve counties in which there is no railroad property from their contribution to the support of the state, it has equal power to say that the average rate of taxation shall be determined, not by the rates upon other \n\n[201 U.S. 245, 300]\n\u00a0\n property in the immediate localities in which the railroads are located, but by those upon all property wherever situated in the state. We do not mean to hold that cases may not arise in which enforcing this method of taxation works such injustice to a railroad as to call for judicial interference. But we do hold that the mere fact that all the property in the state is taken into account in determining the average rate does not carry with it such proof of injustice and inequality as to compel the courts in all cases to strike the latter down. From the cases that are before us involving this statute it appears that there are many railroad companies in the state, and we may fairly take judicial notice of the fact that the state is traversed in almost every direction by railroads. And while it is possible that there may be a county or two without one, yet it is an exception, and to hold that for each railroad the average rate must be determined from the property in the localities immediately contiguous or through which its road passes might well introduce into the matter of taxation a confusion and inequality resulting in far greater injustice than the uniformity established by the present system.\n Further, it must be borne in mind that the taxes collected from railroads in Michigan are, by  16 of the act, applicable to state purposes, and while it is doubtless true that the appropriation of these taxes to state purposes diminishes the tax burden which will fall upon other property, yet the case presented is one in which the legislature, taking a class of property, imposes upon it through state authorities a state tax for strictly state purposes. That, so far as the restraints of the Federal Constitution are concerned, it is within the power of a state to separate a particular class of property, subject it to assessment and taxation in a mode and at a rate different from that imposed upon other property, and apply the proceeds to state rather than to local purposes, is not open to question. Kentucky Railroad Tax Cases, \n115 U.S. 321\n, 29 L. ed. 414, 6 Sup.Ct.Rep. 57, is directly in point. By the legislation of Kentucky railroad companies and their property were separated from other \n\n[201 U.S. 245, 301]\n\u00a0\n property, subjected to different means and methods for purposes of taxation, and upon this the court said (p. 337, L. ed. p. 419, Sup.Ct.Rep. p. 63):\n'But there is nothing in the Constitution of Kentucky that requires taxes to be levied by a uniform method upon all descriptions of property. The whole matter is left to the discretion of the legislative power, and there is nothing to forbid the classification of property for purposes of taxation and the valuation of different classes by different methods. The rule of equality, in respect to the subject, only requires the same means and methods to be applied impartially to all the constituents of each class, so that the law shall operate equally and uniformly upon all persons in similar circumstances.'\n\n See also Pittsburgh, C. C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Backus, \n154 U.S. 421\n, 38 L. ed. 1031, 14 Sup.Ct.Rep. 1114; Florida C. & P. R. Co. v. Reynolds, \n183 U.S. 471\n, 46 L. ed. 283, 22 Sup.Ct.Rep. 176; Coulter v. Louisville & N. R. Co. \n196 U.S. 599\n, 49 L. ed. 615, 25 Sup.Ct.Rep. 342.\n That no provision is made for a general equalization of railroad with other property in the state does not vitiate the assessment. See Cummings v. Merchants' Nat. Bank, \n101 U.S. 153\n, 25 L. ed. 903, in which the question was distinctly presented and determined, the court saying (p. 161, L. ed. p. 906):\n'While it may be true that this system of submitting the different kinds of property subject to taxation to different boards of assessors and equalizers, with no common superior to secure uniformity of the whole, may give opportunity for maladministration of the law and violation of the principle of uniformity of taxation and equality of burden, that is not the necessary result of these laws, or of any one of them; and a law cannot be held unconstitutional because, while its just interpretation is consistent with the Constitution, it is unfaithfully administered by those who are charged with its execution. Their doings may be unlawful while the statute is valid.'\n\n While there may be no provision for an equalization of railroad with other property. it will be perceived that the statute names the time and place for the sessions of the assessing board, gives to any person or company interested the right \n\n[201 U.S. 245, 302]\n\u00a0\n to be heard, and also authorizes the board to correct the valuation. So that it cannot be objected that the railroad companies are precluded from a full hearing on the matter of valuation; and, as has heretofore been said by this court, one hearing is sufficient to constitute due process.\n Other questions are discussed by counsel in their briefs, but in view of the exhaustive and well-considered opinion of the trial judge, with the general trend of which we concur, it is unnecessary to further extend this discussion. It is sufficient to refer to that opinion for a consideration of those questions. We have noticed those which seem to us paramount and controlling.\n It is charged in the bill that there was a systematic undervaluation of other property in the state, which resulted in denying to this plaintiff the equal protection of the law. The trial court found against this charge. It is enough to say that generally we accept the finding of a trial court upon a question of fact when the testimony respecting it is conflicting. It may also be said that a legislature is not bound to impose the same rate of tax upon one class of property that it does upon another. As it may exempt all of one class, so it may impose a different rate of taxation. It is sufficient if all of the same class are subjected to the same rate and the tax is administrated impartially upon them.\nAFFIRMED.\n Cases on the docket, numbered from 462 to 487, inclusive, are suits brought by different railroad companies against this appellee, and are submitted on the same record.

Hamilton, and Michael J. Colbert for appellees.\n\n\n\n[202 U.S. 429, 434]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a bill in equity to enjoin Ellis H. Roberts, as Treasurer of the United States, from paying to any person any moneys of the District of Columbia, under certain acts of Congress \n An act entitled 'An Act to Provide for Eliminating Certain Grade Crossings of Railroads in the District of Columbia, to Require and Authorize the Construction of New Terminals and Tracks for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company in the City of Washington, and for Other Purposes,' approved February 12, 1901; an act entitled 'An Act to Provide for Eliminating Certain Grade Crossings on the Line of the Baltimore & Potomac Railroad Company in the City of Washington, District of Columbia, and Requiring Said Company to Depress and Elevate its Tracks, and to Enable it to Relocate Parts of Its Railroad Therein, and for Other Purposes,' approved February 12, 1901; an act entitled 'An Act to Provide for a Union Railroad Station in the District of Columbia and for Other Purposes,' approved Rebruary 28, 1903. \n\n[202 U.S. 429, 435]\n\u00a0\n (31 Stat. at L. 767, 774, chaps. 353, 354; 32 Stat. at L. 909, chap. 856), and to enjoin the other defendants from carrying into effect said acts of Congress, and that said acts 'be declared null and void for want of constitutional authority.' Defendants interposed demurrers to the bill, which were sustained by the supreme court, and a decree entered dismissing the bill. The court of appeals affirmed the decree.\n The principal allegations of the bill are that the railroad defendants are private corporations and all interested in the railway and terminal facilities of the District of Columbia; that the District of Columbia owns no stock in any of the companies nor is otherwise interested in any of them save as useful private enterprises, and yet it is required by said acts, 'without any lawful consideration therefor,' to pay the Baltimore & Potomac Railroad Company the sum of $750,000, and a like sum to the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, 'to be levied and assessed upon the taxable property and privileges in the said District other than the property of the United States and the District of Columbia,' and for the exclusive use of said corporations respectively, 'which is a private use, and not a governmental use;' that the public moneys of the District of Columbia are raised chiefly by taxation on the lands therein, and that the complainant is obliged to pay and does pay direct taxes on land owned by him therein. And the bill also alleges that the acts of Congress are 'acts which provide for raising revenue, and are repugnant to article 1,  7, clause 1, of the Constitution of the United States, and are, therefore, null and void ab initio, and to their entire extent, because they, and each and every one of them, originated in the Senate, and not in the House of Representatives.' Certain volumes of the Congressional Record are referred to and made part of the bill. \n\n[202 U.S. 429, 436]\n\u00a0\n In other allegations of the bill are expressed the limitations upon the power of the United States and the District of Columbia as to taxation; that the acts of Congress complained of are repugnant to the Constitution of the United States; that public funds are appropriated for private use, and that exorbitant taxes will be required to meet the legitimate expenses of the District of Columbia, and appellant will thereby be oppressed and deprived of his property without due process of law.\n The first contention of appellant is that the acts of Congress are revenue measures, and therefore should have originated in the House of Representatives, and not in the Senate, and, to sustain the contention, appellant submits an elaborate argument. In answer to the contention the case of Twin City Nat. Bank v. Nebeker, \n167 U.S. 196\n, 42 L. ed. 134, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 766, need only be cited. It was observed there that it was a part of wisdom not to attempt to cover by a general statement what bills shall be said to be 'bills for raising revenue' within the meaning of those words in the Constitution, but it was said, quoting Mr. Justice Story, 'that the practical construction of the Constitution, and the history of the origin of the constitutional provision in question, proves that revenue bills are those that levy taxes in the strict sense of the word, and are not bills for other purposes, which may incidentally create revenue.' 1 Story, Const.  880. And the act of Congress which was there passed on illustrates the meaning of the language used. The act involved was one providing a national currency, and imposed a tax upon the average amount of the notes of a national banking association in circulation. The provision was assailed for unconstitutionality because it originated in the Senate. The provision was sustained, this court saying:\n'The tax was a means for effectually accomplishing the great object of giving to the people a currency that would rest, primarily, upon the honor of the United States, and be available in every part of the country. There was no purpose, by the act or by any of its provisions, to raise revenue to be applied \n\n[202 U.S. 429, 437]\n\u00a0\n in meeting the expenses or obligations of the government.'\n\n This language is applicable to the acts of Congress in the case at bar. Whatever taxes are imposed are but means to the purposes provided by the act.\n The legality of those purposes is attacked in the other contentions of appellant. All of the contentions rest upon the correctness of the allegation that the moneys provided to be paid to the railroad companies are for the exclusive use of the companies, 'which is a private use, and not a governmental use.'\n The titles of the acts are the best brief summary of their purposes, and those purposes are obviously of public benefit. We do not think that it is necessary to enter into a discussion of the cases which establish this. The scheme of improvement provided by the acts required a removal of the railroads from their situations, large expenditures of money by the companies, and the surrender of substantial rights. These rights are recognized, and their surrender expressed to be part of the consideration of the sums of money paid to the companies. Indeed, there is an element of contract, not only in the changes made, but in the manner and upon the scale which they are required to be made. As remarked by Mr. Justice Morris, speaking for the court of appeals:\n'The case is practically that of a contract between the United States and the District of Columbia on the one side and the railroad companies on the other, whereby the railroad companies agree to surrender certain rights, rights of property as well as other rights, and to construct a work of great magnitude, greater, perhaps, than their own needs require, but which Congress deems to be demanded for the best interest of the national capital and by the public at large; and for this surrender of right and this work of magnitude commensurate with the public demand, Congress agrees to pay a certain sum, partly out of the funds of the United States and partly out of the funds of the District of Columbia. It is a simple case of bargain and sale, like any other purchase.' [25 App. D. C. 221.] \n\n[202 U.S. 429, 438]\n\u00a0\n We have assumed that appellant, as a taxpayer of the District of Columbia, can raise the questions we have considered, but we do not wish to be understood as so deciding.\n\n Decree affirmed.\n Mr. Justice Harlan concurs in the result only. \n\n\n\n","105":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMISSISSIPPI RAILROAD COMMISSION v. ILLINOIS CENTRAL R. R.(1906)\nNo. 64\nArgued: October 26, 1906Decided: December 3, 1906\n\n\n\n\n[203 U.S. 335, 336]\n\u00a0\n The railroad commission of the state of Mississippi, and its members and clerk, as appellants, bring to this court by appeal the judgment of the circuit court of appeals for the fifth circuit, which court reversed the judgment of the United States circuit court for the southern district of Mississippi, in favor of the appellants, and remanded the case, with directions to enter a decree for the complainant, the railroad company.\n The case, as it appears in the record, shows the following facts:\n The citizens of the town of Magnolia, which has about 1,200 inhabitants, and is situated in the state of Mississippi, on the line of the railroad of the appellee, and about 98 miles north of New Orleans, in April, 1903, presented a petition to the Mississippi railroad commission, asking that commission to order the railroad company to stop its passenger trains numbers 1, 3, and 4 at the Magnolia station, the ground of the request being, as stated in the petition, that Magnolia was one of the most progressive towns in the state and the county site of the county, and the petitioners believed \n\n[203 U.S. 335, 337]\n\u00a0\n that they were entitled to have these trains make regular stops at that point, and they stated their belief that it was for the best interest of the public, as well as the town, to have the passenger trains named make regular stops at the town.\n Trains numbers 1 and 3 were south-bound trains from Chicago, passing Magnolia on their way to New Orleans, while train number 4 was a train on its way north to Chicago from New Orleans.\n After a hearing before the railroad commission, on notice to the railroad company, the commission made an order granting the application as to trains 1 and 3, and denying it as to number 4.\n Before obeying the order the company brought this suit to enjoin its enforcement. Upon the filing of the bill a temporary injunction was issued and a subsequent motion to dissolve it was denied. The defendant in the suit, the railroad commission, answered the bill, and denied that the railroad company furnished the town of Magnolia with adequate accommodations for the south, and put in issue the allegations of the bill that the order made by the commission was unreasonable or an illegal interference with the interstate commerce of the railroad company. The case came on for hearing before the circuit court, at the end of which a decree was made denying the relief asked for by the complainant, the court holding that the order of the commission was not unreasonable, and that therefore the temporary injunction should be, and it was, dissolved. An appeal to the circuit court of appeals was prayed for by the railroad company and granted.\n The bill stated, amongst other things, that the corporation was created under the laws of the state of Illinois, and that the complainant was a resident of that state, and domiciled in the city of Chicago; and that the railroad commission was created by the state of Mississippi, and its individual members were citizens and residents of that state. The complainant further showed that it was operating an interstate line of railroad, extending from the city of New Orleans, in Louisiana \n\n[203 U.S. 335, 338]\n\u00a0\n north through that state and the states of Mississippi, Kentucky, Indiana, and Illinois to the Great Lakes of the Northwest, connecting at various points with other lines of interstate railroads. It is also averred that the Congress of the United States had established the line of railroad operated by the complainant as a national highway, for the accommodation of interstate commerce and the carriage of the mails of the United States, and had been so recognized and promoted as such by various acts of Congress; that owing to the exigencies of its interstate business and the requirements of modern commerce and passenger transportation, as well as the transportation of freight and the United States mails, the complainant had been, from time to time, required to shorten its schedule, and to maintain and operate certain fast through trains, intended primarily and chiefly for interstate transportation and interstate commerce; that the two trains numbered 1 and 3-one being known as the fast mail and the other as the New Orleans & Chicago Limited-were run expressly for the purpose of carrying the interstate business and for the transportation of the United States mail, and that they were run on special schedules for that purpose, and of necessity had to make close connections with other through trunk lines of railroad doing an interstate business, and, in order to maintain the necessary schedule of time for the operation of these interstate trains, it was impossible and wholly impracticable to stop at all stations; and, further, that these trains, being south-bound trains, only stop regularly at junction points and all such points of importance in the state of Mississippi which are necessary and which justify such stops. The bill showed the accommodations which were afforded the town of Magnolia by the other trains provided by the company, and which it alleged sufficiently accommodated the traveling public at that point; that a compliance with the order of the commission, by stopping the trains named, would imperil the ability of the complainant to comply with its contract with the United States for the carriage of the mails, and \n\n[203 U.S. 335, 339]\n\u00a0\n would embarrass its interstate traffic, and that it would be impossible, under the present condition of the roadbed and equipment of the complainant, to increase the speed of the trains so as to allow for the stoppage of the trains as directed by the commission; that the complainant protested before the commission against the issuing of the order, and it alleged that it showed that it was then furnishing the town of Magnolia all reasonable and necessary railroad facilities, and that the effect of the order would be to give that town greater railroad facilities than were afforded by complainant to any other town in the state of Mississippi, including the city of Jackson, the capital of the state, excepting only the town of McComb City, which, being a relay station on complainant's road, it is necessary for all trains to stop there to change the engine, and for fuel, water, etc.; that the effect of the order also would be to give to the town five daily trains to the city of New Orleans, running within short intervals of each other. It was further alleged that by the statutory law of the state of Mississippi the complainant was subject to a penalty of $50 for each time it failed to stop its trains on the order of the commission, and that the complainant would therefore be compelled to comply with the order or be subject to a multiplicity of suits for penalties arising from each and every violation of the order, and that defendants threaten by suit to enforce the order. It was then averred that the order of the commission was a direct burden upon interstate commerce, and also a direct and unnecessary interference with the speedy carriage of the mails of the United States.\n An amendment to the bill was subsequently filed, showing that Congress had granted a right of way and sections of land in the state of Illinois to aid in the construction of a railroad from the southern termination of the Illinois & Michigan Canal to a point at or near the junction of the Mississippi and Ohio rivers, with branches, etc., which should remain a public highway for the use of the government of the United States, free from toll or other charges upon the transportation of any \n\n[203 U.S. 335, 340]\n\u00a0\n property or troops of the United States, and on which mails of the United States should at all times be transported, and the Congress had made like grants to the states of Alabama and Mississippi, respectively, for the purpose of aiding in the construction of a railroad from the city of Mobile to a point near the mouth of the Ohio river; and it was also averred that the state of Illinois had chartered the complainant in 1850, and ceded to it rights and lands granted to that state by the act of Congress.\n The defendant commission answered and denied the averments in the bill, as already stated.\n Messrs. Marcellus Green, Garner Wynn Green, William Williams, and J. N. Flowers for appellants.\n Messrs. Edward Mayes and J. M. Dickinson for appellee.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Peckham:\n\n Mr. Justice Peckham, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The decision in this case by the circuit court of appeals is reported in 70 C. C. A. 617, 138 Fed. 327, in which will be found a statement of the material portions of the evidence taken at the hearing before the trial court. It is unnecessary to repeat it.\n The first objection raised by the appellant is, that this suit is, in substance, one against a state. The commission was created by the state of Mississippi, under the authority of its Constitution and laws, for the purpose of supervising, and, to some extent, controlling, the acts of the railroads operating within the state. Such a commission is subject to a suit by a citizen. Reagan v. Farmers' Loan & T. Co. \n154 U.S. 362\n, 38 L. ed. 1014, 4 Inters. Com. Rep. 560, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1047; Smyth v. Ames, \n169 U.S. 466\n, 42 L. ed. 819, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 418; Prout v. Starr, \n188 U.S. 537\n, 47 L. ed 584, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 398. We do not see that Arbuckle v. Blackburn, \n191 U.S. 405\n, 48 L. ed. 239, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 148, is at all in point. \n\n[203 U.S. 335, 341]\n\u00a0\n It is also objected that an injunction will not lie from a United States court to stay proceedings in a state court, because of the provisions of  720, United States Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 581). The commission is, however, not a court, and is a mere administrative agency of the state, as held by the Mississippi court. Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Mississippi Railroad Commission, 74 Miss. 80, 21 So. 15.\n It is urged, however, that proceedings in a state court were commenced by the presentation of the petition of the citizens of Magnolia to the railroad commission, and because the commission, having made an order to stop the trains, would have to resort to the proper state court to aid it in the enforcement of its order, therefore the whole proceeding must be regarded as in a state court from the commencement. Whatever may be the provision in the state statute in regard to the enforcement solely by the state court of the order of the railroad commission, the proceeding while before the commission never thereby became a proceeding in a state court, and the jurisdiction of the Federal court to enjoin the commission from the enforcement of its order, because such order was a violation of the Federal Constitution, was not in the least affected.\n The appellants also object that the circuit court of appeals had no jurisdiction to review the judgment of the circuit court in this case, because, as is stated, the jurisdiction was predicated upon diversity of citizenship, and also upon the claim that the state statutes requiring the stoppage of trains, when applied to the trains under discussion, violated the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution, and, therefore, the ease should have come directly here from the circuit court, and Field v. Barber Asphalt Paving Co. \n194 U.S. 618\n, 48 L. ed. 1142, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 784, is cited as authority. The complainant in this case, by a proper pleading, set up not only the diversity of citizenship, but also a constitutional question, and the complainant had the right to appeal from the judgment of the circuit court to the circuit court of appeals, and from its decision in such a case an appeal or writ of error may be taken to this court. American Sugar \n\n[203 U.S. 335, 342]\n\u00a0\n Ref. Co. v. New Orleans, \n181 \nU.S. 277, 281\n, 45 S. L. ed. 859, 861, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 646; Huguley Mfg. Co. v. Galeton Cotton Mills, \n184 \nU.S. 290, 295\n, 46 S. L. ed. 546, 548, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 452. The case of Field v. Barber Asphalt Paving Co. supra, does not hold otherwise. It simply holds that where the jurisdiction of the circuit court attaches on the ground of diverse citizenship, and also upon a separate and independent constitutional ground, the party may take a direct appeal to this court; but it does not hold that the defeated party must do so, and that he cannot go to the circuit court of appeals.\n The main question is, as stated in the court below, whether the order of the commission is valid with reference to the Federal Constitution. That depends upon the question whether it is only an incidental interference with interstate commerce, based upon a legal exercise of the police powers of the state for the purpose of securing proper and sufficient accommodation from the railroad company for railroad facilities for the residents of the state. The authority of the commission to interfere with a railroad is based on the statutes of Mississippi. Section 3550 (chapter 112, Code of Mississippi, 1892, relating to railroads) reads as follows:\n'3550. To stop all passenger trains, if, etc., at county seats.-Every railroad shall cause each and all of its passenger trains to stop for passengers at all county seats at which it has a depot, at the discretion of the railroad commission.'\n\n Chapter 134 of the same Code relates to the supervision of common carriers. Section 4302 thereof reads as follows:\n'Necessary depots to be maintained.-Every railroad shall establish and maintain such depots as shall be reasonably necessary for the public convenience, and shall stop such of the passenger and freight trains at any depot as the business and public convenience shall require; and the commission may cause all passenger trains to permit passengers to get on and off in a city at any place other than at the depot, where it is for the convenience of the traveling public. And it shall be unlawful for any railroad to abolish or disuse any depot when once established, or to fail to keep up the same and to regularly \n\n[203 U.S. 335, 343]\n\u00a0\n stop the trains thereat, without the consent of the commission.'\n\n Under these statutes the commission has power (a) to stop, in its discretion, all passenger trains at all county seats at which the company has a depot; (b) to stop such of the passenger and freight trains at any depot as the business and public convenience may require. The order in question was made with regard to a place which is both a county seat and also one where the railroad has a depot. It is not plain under which section the commission acted. Its order simply states that the petition of the citizens of Magnolia is granted as to trains 1 and 3, and denied as to train 4. The petition throws no light upon the subject. We may assume, however, that the commission acted under all the authority it had from the above quoted sections of the statute. It is fair to assume that it had exercised its discretion in causing the trains to stop at a county seat, and that it did so because, in its judgment, it was reasonable and necessary for the public convenience. The question is whether, having regard to the facts, the order is valid.\n The matter of the validity of statutes directing railroad companies to stop certain of their trains at stations named has been before this court several times, and the result of its holdings is: That a statute of Illinois, which required the Illinois Central Railroad to stop its fast mail train from Chicago to New Orleans at Cairo, in the state of Illinois, which was a county seat, was unconstitutional if the company had made adequate accommodation by other trains for interstate passengers to and from Cairo. That a statute which required every railroad corporation to stop all regular passenger trains running wholly within the state at its stations at all county seats was a reasonable exercise of the police power of the state, where the statute did not apply to railroad trains entering the state from any other state, or transcontinental trains of any railroad. A statute relating to railroad companies which provided that a company should cause three of its trains each \n\n[203 U.S. 335, 344]\n\u00a0\n way, if so many were run daily, Sundays excepted, to stop at a station containing over 3,000 inhabitants, was valid in the absence of legislation by Congress on the subject; and also a state statute which required all regular passenger trains to stop at county seats was invalid when applied to an interstate train, intended only for through passengers from St. Louis to New York, when it appeared that the railroad company furnished sufficient trains to accommodate all the local through business in the state, and where such trains stopped at county seats. These principles have been decided in Illinois C. R. Co. v. Illinois, \n163 U.S. 142\n, 41 L. ed. 107, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1096; Gladson v. Minnesota, \n166 U.S. 427\n, 41 L. ed. 1064, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 627; Lake Shore & M. S. R. Co. v. Ohio, \n173 U.S. 285\n, 43 L. ed. 702, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 465; Cleveland C. C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Illinois, \n177 U.S. 514\n, 44 L. ed. 868, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 722. Upon the principles decided in these cases, a state railroad commission has the right, under a state statute, so far as railroads are concerned, to compel a company to stop its trains under the circumstances already referred to, and it may order the stoppage of such trains if the company does not otherwise furnish proper and adequate accommodation to a particular locality, and in such cases the order may embrace a through interstate train actually running, and compel it to stop at a locality named. In such case, in the absence of congressional legislation covering the subject, there is no illegal or improper interference with the interstate commerce right; but if the company has furnished all such proper and reasonable accommodation to the locality as fairly may be demanded, taking into consideration the fact, if it be one, that the locality is a county seat, and the amount and character of the business done, then any interference with the company (either directly, by statute, or by a railroad commission acting under authority of a statute) by causing its interstate trains to stop at a particular locality in the state is an improper and illegal interference with the rights of the railroad company, and a violation of the commerce clause of the Constitution.\n In reviewing statutes of this nature, and also orders made by a state railroad commission, it frequently becomes necessary \n\n[203 U.S. 335, 345]\n\u00a0\n to examine the facts upon which they rest, and to determine from such examination whether there has been an unconstitutional exercise of power and an illegal interference by the state or its commission with the interstate commerce of the railroad. Whether there has or has not been such an interference is a question of law arising from the facts. In this case there was no important conflict of evidence on the material points, and so the circuit court of appeals has stated and these facts are clearly and sufficiently set forth in 138 Fed. supra. The fact that the company has contracts to transport the mails of the United States within a time which requires great speed for the trains carrying them, while not conclusive, may still be considered upon the general question of the propriety of stopping such trains at certain stations within the boundaries of a state. The railroad has been recognized by Congress, and is the recipient of large land grants, and the carrying of the mails is a most important function of such a road. We think that the railroad company has fully performed its duty towards the town in the way of furnishing it proper and adequate and reasonable accommodation, without stopping these interstate trains as ordered, and, therefore, the order of the commission was improper and illegal, and not merely an incidental interference with the interstate commerce of the company. The circuit court of appeals has, in effect, so held, although it did say that the commission and the circuit court had made an order that indicated that the trains which already stopped at Magnolia were not sufficient, and that the town should have five daily trains going south, and therefore the court said it thought it well to examine other questions, which it did. A reading of the whole opinion of the circuit court of appeals shows that the court did not concede, in any degree, that the passenger facilities afforded were inadequate, but that the remedy was to compel the company to run more trains, and not stop the ones in question. The opinion simply suggests that even if the facilities were inadequate, the appropriate course was to order more trains \n\n[203 U.S. 335, 346]\n\u00a0\n INSTEAD OF STOPPING THOSE MENTIONED. IN any event, the question is before us upon uncontradicted evidence as to whether there were or were not proper facilities, and we hold there were.\n The order cannot be viewed alone in the light of ordering a stop at one place only, which might require not more than three minutes, as asserted. It is the question whether these trains can be stopped at all at any particular station when proper and adequate facilities are otherwise afforded such station. If the commission can order such a train to be stopped at a particular locality under such circumstances, then it could do so as to other localities, and in that way the usefulness of a through train would be ruined and the train turned from a through to a local one in Mississippi. The legislature of a state could not itself make such an order, and it cannot delegate the power to a commission to do so, in its discretion, when adequate facilities are otherwise furnished.\n The transportation of passengers on interstate state trains as rapidly as can with safety be done is the inexorable demand of the public who use such trains. Competition between great trunk lines is fierce and at times bitter. Each line must do its best enen to obtain its fair share of the transportation between states, both of passengers and freight. A wholly unnecessary, even though a small, obstacle, ought not, in fairness, to be placed in the way of an interstate road, which may thus be unable to meet the competition of its rivals. We by no means intend to impair the strength of the previous decisions of this court on the subject, nor to assume that the interstate transportation, either of passengers or freight, is to be regarded as overshadowing the rights of the residents of the state through which the railroad passes to adequate railroad facilities. Both claims are to be considered, and after the wants of the residents within a state or locality through which the road passes have been adequately supplied, regard being had to all the facts bearing upon the subject, they ought not to be permitted to demand more, at the cost of the ability of \n\n[203 U.S. 335, 347]\n\u00a0\n the road to successfully compete with its rivals in the transportation of interstate passengers and freight.\n We are of opinion that the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals was right, and it is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","106":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMONTANA CATHOLIC MISSIONS v. MISSOULA COUNTY(1906)\nNo. 151\nArgued: Decided: January 2, 1906\n\n\n\n\n[200 U.S. 118, 119]\n\u00a0\n Statement by Mr. Justice Peckham:\n The plaintiff in error commenced this action in the circuit court of the United States for the district of Montana, to recover from the defendant the amount of certain back taxes, which it alleged had been illegally assessed, and which it had been compelled to pay in order to prevent the seizure and sale of the property owned by it, and upon which the taxes were levied. Both parties to the action were residents of the state of Montana at the time it was commenced. The defendant demurred to the complaint upon the ground, among others, that the court had no jurisdiction of the person of the defendant or of the subjectmatter of the action. The demurrer was sustained by the court, and the complaint dismissed on the sole ground that it had no jurisdiction, and the court has certified the question of jurisdiction directly to this court, as provided for in the 5th section of the act of 1891. 26 Stat. at L. 827, chap. 517, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 549.\n The following is the complaint:\n The plaintiff above-named complains to the court, and alleges:\n I. That it is, and since prior to the year 1890 has been, a corporation organized and existing under the provisions of chapter 34, fifth division of the Compiled Statutes of the state of Montana, relating to the incorporation of religious, benevolent, and other like societies, and that its purposes are set forth in its articles of incorporation as follows:\n The particular business or object of said corporation shall be to hold the legal title to real estate in the territory of Montana, \n\n[200 U.S. 118, 120]\n\u00a0\n for the use and in trust for the Society of Jesus, also to hold and in trust for said society all funds, property, and effects of said society, or any members thereof, or any person or persons, corporation or corporations, conveyed, transferred, delivered, or assigned to the said corporation, for the use and benefit of said society; to conduct, erect, govern, and maintain churches, colleges, schools, and libraries, and all other such necessary and useful enterprises as may be properly connected with the society and corporation. The general business and object of said corporation shall be to inculcate and further the interests of Christian education among the inhabitants of the territory of Montana, including the Indians and other residents on reservations within the said territory, and also to advance the interests of the Christian religion through the erection and maintenance of churches, colleges, and schools, and the preaching of the Gospel.\n II. The Society of Jesus referred to in the said articles of incorporation is an association or order of ministers of the Gospel, none of the members of which can, under the rules of the said order, hold, or does hold, any property in his own right.\n III. Plaintiff further avers that about the year 1854 the said Society of Jesus established a mission among the Flathead Indians, then residing in the western portion of what is now the state of Montana, and stationed among them members of the said order, with directions to teach, educate, enlighten, and care for the said Indians. That the said mission being so established, members of the said order so deputed went among the said Indians, and from about the year 1854 to the present time have continued in the work of teaching, educating, and enlightening the said Flathead Indians.\n IV. The plaintiff further avers that since the creation of the Flathead Indian reservation in the state of Montana, members of the said order, commonly known as Jesuit Fathers, have, by the direction of said order and by permission of the Indians living and entitled to live within the same, and the government of the United States, been permitted to reside within the said \n\n[200 U.S. 118, 121]\n\u00a0\n reservation for the purpose of teaching and educating the Indians residing thereon, and that they have been, during all of said period, continuously engaged in the work of teaching and educating the said Indians.\n V. That with the permission of the Indians inhabiting and entitled to inhabit the said reservation and the government of the United States, the said Jesuit Fathers have constructed on the said reservation, at great expense, extensive school buildings, with dormitories, and in connection therewith, for the purpose of teaching the said Indians the manual arts, a blacksmith shop, wagon shop, printing office, saddlery shop, shoe shops, bakeries, and other shops of like character, and, with the same purpose, cultivate fields and gardens.\n VI. That for the more successful conduct of the training and education of the Indians, the said Jesuit Fathers take into their care and custody at tender ages the children of the said Indians, and keep them at the said schools, and clothe, feed, and house them until they arrive at mature years, and that they now have, and for more than ten years last past have had, in their charge and care, upwards of two hundred and fifty of the children of the Indians residing on, and entitled to reside on, the said reservation.\n VII. That for many years the government of the United States, in recognition of the value of the work of the said Jesuit Fathers in the training and education of the said Indians, appropriated and paid to them large sums of money for the purpose of carrying on the said work of educating the said Indians and caring for their children, but that such contributions are no longer made by the government.\n VIII. That with a view to provide means for the carrying on of the said work of educating the said Indians the said Jesuit Fathers have acquired a large band of neat cattle, which roam over and feed upon the said reservation. That the right to keep and graze the said cattle upon the lands included within the said reservation was, long prior to the year 1895, granted to the Jesuit Fathers by the Indians residing upon the said reservation \n\n[200 U.S. 118, 122]\n\u00a0\n and entitled to reside thereon, which right was confirmed by the acquiescence and permission of the government of the United States, and that the cattle now owned by them or by the plaintiff herein, as hereinafter set out, now graze upon the lands included within the said reservation by the express permission of the Indians residing and entitled to reside thereon, and of the government of the United States.\n IX. That a large number of the said cattle are annually killed and consumed as food by the children of the Indians so residing on and entitled to reside on the said reservation, and who are under the care of the said Jesuit Fathers, as aforesaid, and by the fathers in charge of the said children, and assistants employed by them in the work of educating the said Indians, and that others of said cattle are annually shipped to Eastern markets, and the income derived from the sale of the same is devoted to, and used exclusively for, the work carried on by the said fathers on the said reservation, of educating the said Indians, as hereinbefore set out, and that all the said income is consumed in the said work.\n X. That a large portion of the work of rounding up the said cattle, branding, and otherwise caring for them, slaughtering and shipping the same, is done by the Indians residing on the said reservation, under the direction of the said fathers, and that the said Indians are enabled by this employment to earn in part a livelihood, and are instructed and gain experience in the business and occupation of cattle raising, and are encouraged themselves to engage in it,-a business for the conduct of which the said reservation is particularly adapted.\n XI. That prior to the year 1895 all property so as aforesaid acquired by the said Jesuit Fathers was conveyeed to the plaintiff herein, to hold the same in trust for the said Jesuit Fathers, and that by such conveyance it now has the legal title to all of the cattle acquired by the said Jesuit Fathers on the said reservation, and the increases thereof. And plaintiff avers that it is, and at all times since its organization has been, an institution of purely public charity, and that all of the cattle now \n\n[200 U.S. 118, 123]\n\u00a0\n owned by it, or which have been owned by it since the year 1895, or at any time, have been and are used exclusively for educational purposes, as hereinbefore set forth.\n XII. And plaintiff further avers that it is its purpose in the further to devote all cattle now on the said reservation, or which it may acquire thereon, and any income derived from the sale of the same, to the same purposes to which they have heretofore been devoted, as hereinbefore set out, and that it has no purpose now, nor has it had at any time any purpose, to devote any portion of said cattle or any income derived from the sale of the same to any purpose other than the education and training of the Indians residing or entitled to reside on the said reservation, and that it never has made, and does not contemplate making, any profit out of the raising of the said cattle, with the intent to devote the same to any other purpose.\n XIII. And plaintiff avers that, notwithstanding the facts aforesaid, the defendant, county of Missoula, which is one of the counties of the state of Montana, through its treasurer, annually, since the year 1897, has demanded of the plaintiff that it pay to the said county taxes upon all cattle owned by it and being upon the said reservation, and threatened to seize and sell the said cattle or so much thereof as might be necessary to satisfy the taxes demanded unless the same should be paid.\n XIV. That pursuant to such demand, and to prevent the seizure and sale of the said cattle, or so many thereof as might be necessary, the plaintiff, under protest, on or about November 23, 1898, paid to the said county and to its treasurer, who turned the same over to the said county as taxes claimed by it to be due on account of cattle owned by the said plaintiff on the said reservation for the years 1897 and 1898, the sum of $ 1,257.48; that the plaintiff, under protest, on or about November 22, 1899, paid \n\n[200 U.S. 118, 124]\n\u00a0\n to the said county and to its treasurer, who turned the same over to the said county, as taxes claimed by it to be due on account of cattle owned by the said plaintiff on said reservation for the year 1899, the sum of $ 867.82; that the plaintiff, under protest, on or about November 26, 1900, paid to the said county and its treasurer, who turned the same over to the said county, as taxes claimed by it to be due on account of cattle owned by the said plaintiff, on the said reservation for the year 1900, the sum of $661.20; and that plaintiff, under protest, on or about November 26, 1901, paid to the said county and to its treasurer, who turned the same over to said county, as taxes claimed by it to be due on account of cattle owned by the said plaintiff on the said reservation for the year 1901, the sum of $321.95; and plaintiff avers that it neither had nor owned any cattle 'at any time since 1895,' in the county of Missoula, state of Montana, except such cattle as it held on the said reservation as hereinbefore set out, and that the said taxes were exacted of it upon the said cattle. 'All of which were reared on the said reservation, and fed on grasses and herbage grown thereon.'\n XV. And now plaintiff avers that the defendant is indebted to it on account of said payments, by it made, as hereinbefore set out, in the sum of three thousand one hundred and eight and 45\/100 dollars ($3,108.45), with interest on the sum of $1,257.48 from the 23d day of November, 1898, amounting to $345.66; for interest on $867.82 from the 22d day of November, 1899, amounting to $169.35; for interest on the sum of $661.20 from the 26th day of November, 1900, amounting to $75.55; and for interest on the sum of $321.95 from the 26th day of November, 1901, amounting to the sum of $11.03.\n Wherefore plaintiff demands judgment for said amounts, together with interest as above set forth, and for its costs.\n Mr. Thomas J. Walsh for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[200 U.S. 118, 126]\n\u00a0\n No counsel for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n Mr. Justice Peckham, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n There is nothing on the face of the complaint above set forth to show either the existence of any question involving the construction or application of the Federal Constitution, or that the constitutionality of any law of the United States, or the validity or construction of any treaty made under its authority, was drawn in question. This must appear in the complaint by the statement in legal and logical form, such as good pleading requires. Arbuckle v. Blackburn, \n191 \nU.S. 405, 413\n, 48 S. L. ed. 239, 241, 24 Sup.Ct.Rep. 148; Spencer v. Duplan Silk Co. \n191 \nU.S. 526, 530\n, 48 S. L. ed. 287, 290, 24 Sup.Ct.Rep. 174. It must appear that the suit really and substantially involves a controversy of such a character. This pleading seems simply to be a claim that the plaintiff is exempt from taxation on the cattle which it owns, because it is an institution of purely public charity; and it would seem from that fact that it was claiming such exemption under some act of the state of Montana, and that its right to recover back these taxes depended upon a statute of that state. \n\n[200 U.S. 118, 127]\n\u00a0\n There is no provision in the Federal Constitution, neither is there any Federal law, nor any treaty between the United States and the Indians, that is referred to in the complaint, and it is not averred therein that the claim of the plaintiff to be exempt from taxation is founded upon any constitutional provision or law or treaty of the United States. It cannot be assumed, from any averment in the complaint, that the alleged right of a private owner of property to be exempt from taxation thereon, because it was devoted to purposes of charity among the Indians, was founded upon any Federal ground. On the contrary, it would seem to be plain that it was based upon some statute of the state wherein the tax was imposed and collected, which exempted from state taxation property wholly devoted to charity. The case is, therefore, not one which, from the subject-matter of the controversy, is apparently and in its essence of a Federal nature, or one that involved any of the foregoing questions of Federal right. Swafford v. Templeton, \n185 U.S. 487\n, 46 L. ed. 1005, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 783.\n But it is now urged that the entire beneficial use or ownership of the property taxed is in tribal Indians, and that it is, therefore, not subject to taxation by or under state authority; also that the property is made use of by the Federal government, and that it is one of the means and instrumentalities adopted by it through which it carries out its governmental purposes; and such property is, therefore, not subject to be taxed by the state.\n That the entire beneficial use or ownership of the property taxed is in tribal Indians, while the legal title only is in plaintiff, is not alleged in the complaint, and such a conclusion does not follow from the allegations to be found in that pleading. It is true that the property of Indians living in the tribal state, and so recognized by the government, is withdrawn from the operation of state laws, and is exempt from taxation thereunder. The Kansas Indians (Blue Jacket v. Johnson County) 5 Wall. 737, 757, 18 L. ed. 667, 673; United States v. Rickert, \n188 U.S. 432\n, 47 L. ed. 532, 23 Sup.Ct.Rep. 478. The expression 'beneficial use' or 'beneficial ownership or interest' in property is quite frequent in the \n\n[200 U.S. 118, 128]\n\u00a0\n law, and means, in this connection, such a right to its enjoyment as exists where the legal title is in one person and the right to such beneficial use or interest is in another, and where such right is recognized by law, and can be enforced by the courts, at the suit of such owner or of some one in his behalf. And one is also said to have the beneficial ownership of land who has done everything to entitle him to a patent from the government, and who, therefore, has the legal right to such patent, and all that remains to be done is for the proper officer to issue it. Wisconsin C. R. Co. v. Price County, \n133 U.S. 496\n, 33 L. ed. 687, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 341; Central P. R. Co. v. Nevada, \n162 U.S. 512\n, 40 L. ed. 1057, 16 Sup.Ct.Rep. 885. In such case the land is taxable to such owner, though he has not the legal title. He is the beneficial owner. If such were the case here, it might then be said that the Indians really owned such property, and that it was therefore exempt from taxation. But, as we have said, there is no such averment in the complaint, and no such inference can be drawn from the facts therein set forth. Taking the complaint as it is, it shows on its face that the Indians have neither any legal nor equitable title to the property, neither have they any legal or equitable right to its beneficial use; and it also appears from the complaint that the property is owned unconditionally and absolutely by the plaintiff. The plaintiff, as the owner of these cattle, may, at any time, abandon its present manner of using them, and may devote them, or any income arising from their ownership, to any other purpose it may choose, and the Indians would have no legal right of complaint. The plaintiff might refuse to spend another dollar upon the Indians upon these reservations, and refuse to further maintain or aid them in any way whatever, and no right of the Indians would be thereby violated, nor could they call upon the courts to enforce the application of the plaintiff's property, or the income thereof, to the same purposes the plaintiff had theretofore applied them. There is nothing in Church of Jesus Christ, L. D. S. v. United States, \n136 U.S. 7\n, 34 L. ed. 480, 10 Sup.Ct.Rep. 792, which, in the remotest degree, applies to this case. This court has heretofore determined that the Indians' interest in this kind of property, \n\n[200 U.S. 118, 129]\n\u00a0\n situated on their reservation, was not sufficient to exempt such property, when owned by private individuals, from taxation, Thomas v. Gay, \n169 U.S. 264\n, 42 L. ed. 740, 18 Sup.Ct.Rep. 340; Wagoner v. Evans, \n170 U.S. 588\n, 42 L. ed. 1154, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 730. In the first of above-cited cases the right to graze over the reservation was leased by the Indians to the owners of the cattle, and it was alleged that it the cattle were taxed the value of the lands would be reduced, because the owners of the cattle would not pay as much for the right to graze as they would if their cattle were not subjected to taxation, and that therefore the tax was, in effect and substance, upon the land. This court held that the tax put upon the cattle of the lessees was too remote and indirect to be deemed a tax upon the lands or privileges of the Indians, citing New York, L. E. & W. R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n158 U.S. 431\n, 39 L. ed. 1043, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 896, and other cases, as authority for the decision. This is reaffirmed in the second case above cited. In this case the Indians have not even given a lease, and the owners are not obliged to pay anything for the privilege of grazing, and may, as we have said, devote the property, or the income thereof, to purposes wholly foreign to the Indians themselves. However meritorious the conduct of the owners of the cattle may be, in devoting the income or any portion of the principal of their property to the charitable work of improving and educating the Indians (and we cordially admit the merit of such conduct), we cannot see that there is, on that account, the least claim for exemption from taxation because of any Federal provision, constitutional or otherwise.\n Nor is there any merit in the proposition that the plaintiff is made use of by the government of the United States, and is one of the means used by it to carry out its obligations to the Indians, under the Constitution or laws of the United States, and that therefore the property of the plaintiff which is thus used is not subject to state taxation. No such averment of fact is to be found in the pleading; nor does any such conclusion arise from the facts which appear therein. The government may lease a building from a private owner for the purpose of better carrying on its governmental duties, and yet the building is not \n\n[200 U.S. 118, 130]\n\u00a0\n such an instrumentality of government as prevents its taxation by or under state authority. Congress has not constituted this corporation an agency of its own for the purpose of discharging any duties which the government may owe to the Indians. It has, as the complaint avers, made in the past some appropriations from time to time to the corporation to aid it in its own work among the Indians, but that is far from constituting the corporation an agency of its own, to carry into effect its own governmental powers, granted by the Constitution or by law. And even such appropriations ceased years ago.\n The case, in short, is one of that class where we have frequently held that the claim of a Federal question must have some foundation of plausibility (St. Joseph & G. I. R. Co. v. Steele, \n167 U.S. 659\n, 42 L. ed. 315, 17 Sup.Ct.Rep. 925; McCain v. Des Moines, \n174 U.S. 168\n, 43 L. ed. 936, 19 Sup.Ct.Rep. 644) in order to give jurisdiction. This has none.\n The Circuit Court was right in refusing jurisdiction, and its judgment dismissing the complaint on account of the lack thereof is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","107":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMOYER v.

Campbell for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n In this suit a bill was filed in the supreme court of the District of Columbia by Joseph Naganab against Ethan Allen Hitchcock, Secretary of the Interior. Complainant brought the suit as a citizen of the United States and a member of the band and tribe of Chippewa Indians of the state of Minnesota, \n\n[202 U.S. 473, 474]\n\u00a0\n suing for himself and other members of the band and tribe. The bill is quite voluminous, but in substance sets out the alleged right and title of the Indians who had conveyed certain lands under the act of Congress of January 14, 1889 [25 Stat. at L. 642, chap. 24], to the United States, to be administered for their benefit. The bill averred that under the act of Congress the Indians of the state of Minnesota had conveyed to the United States upwards of 3,555,771 acres of land, constituting certain reservations named, all of which lands and reservations were held by the United States under conveyances in trust for the benefit of the Indians; that the Secretary of the Interior had caused the lands to be classified as required by the act, and that approximately 1,500,000 acres thereof were classified as pine lands, 1,855,000 acres as agricultural lands; 600, 000 acres of the lands, classified under the said act as pine lands, were situated in certain reservations, to wit, Chippewas of the Mississippi, Leech lake, Cass lake, and Lake Winnibigoshish; that upon said last- mentioned area, there was and is growing a large amount of merchantable pine timber, reasonably worth $10,000,000. The value of the lands classified as agricultural lands, to be sold under said act for $1.25 per acre, is $2,318,750. And it is averred that it is the right of the Chippewa Indians to have certain of the lands sold, the proceeds to draw 5 per cent interest for fifty years, and the interest money to be used for the benefit of the Indians, as provided in the act, and, at the expiration of the fifty years, the balance of the principal sum remaining to be paid to the Indians.\n The complaint is of the act of June 27, 1902 [32 Stat. at L. 400, chap. 1157] amendatory of the act of January 14, 1889. It is averred that at the time of the passage of the latter act there yet remained 600,000 acres of pine lands, and 200,000 acres of agricultural lands, which ought to be disposed of in pursuance of said trust in favor of the Indians; that the pine lands are worth upwards of $10,000,000, and the agricultural lands $1.25 per acre; that, without the consent of the Indians, a portion of the pine lands was set off as a forest reservation, the timber on this land being of the \n\n[202 U.S. 473, 475]\n\u00a0\n value of $3,000,000; that the rules and regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior for the selling and removal thereof would reduce the value of the pine timber to an amount exceeding $1,000,000; that the Secretary is about to sell and has advertised for sale the pine timber on 300,000 acres of said lands; that said act of June 27, 1902, if carried out, will deprive the complainant and other Chippewa Indians of the state of Minnesota of their property without compensation and without due process of law, in violation of the Constitution of the United States. The bill prays that the defendant, the Secretary of the Interior, may be temporarily enjoined from any further act or acts in execution of the act of Congress of June 27, 1902; that he be required to execute the trust in favor of the Indians, and account to the complainant, as required by the act of January 14, 1889, and for general relief.\n The defendant demurred on three grounds, viz.: 1. That there is a defect of parties complainant. 2. That the bill is bad in substance, in that it does not set out any facts sufficient to entitle the complainant or the real party in interest, the Chippewa Indians of Minnesota, to the relief prayed for, or to any relief. 3. That the court has no jurisdiction over the subject-matter of the suit. The supreme court of the District of Columbia sustained the demurrer and dismissed the bill. This judgment was affirmed in the court of appeals.\n It is apparent from the above statement of the allegations of the bill that the defendant, Hitchcock, Secretary of the Interior, has no interest in this controversy, and that it is in effect a suit against the United States to control the disposition of the lands, and for an account of the proceeds of the sales of certain lands conveyed by the Indians to the United States under the act of January 14, 1889. Without considering whether the courts would have power to control the action of the Secretary of the Interior in this matter, or whether the power and authority so to do is purely political, and subject to the control of Congress without judicial intervention, as was held in the court of appeals, we are of opinion that there is no jurisdiction to enter- \n\n[202 U.S. 473, 476]\n\u00a0\n tain this case. In respect to this question, it is no all fours with Oregon v. Hitchcock, Secretary of the Interior, and William A. Richards, Commissioner of the General Land Office, decided on April 23 of this term ( \n202 U.S. 60\n, 50 L. ed. --, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 568). That case was distinguished from Minnesota v. Hitchcock, \n185 U.S. 373\n, 46 L. ed. 954, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 650, relied on here by the appellant, in the fact that in the Minnesota Case the jurisdiction to sue the Secretary of the Interior was sustained because of the consent on the part of the United States to be sued in respect to school lands within an Indian reservation, and an acceptance by the government of full responsibility for the result of the decision, so far as the Indians were concerned. Act of March 2, 1901 (31 Stat. at L. 950, chap. 808, U. C. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1384). In this case as in the Oregon Case, the legal title to all the tracts of land in question is still in the government, and the United States, the real party in interest herein, has not waived in any manner its immunity, or consented to be sued concerning the lands in question, and there is no act of Congress in anywise authorizing this action. Upon the authority of the Oregon Case we hold that there is no jurisdiction to maintain the present suit, and the action of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, affirming the decree of the Supreme Court of the District, dismissing the complainant's bill, is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","109":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNAT'L COUNCIL U.

Bennett for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n[203 U.S. 151, 157]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Frank W. Christian and Samuel A. Anderson for defendant in error.\n\n\n[203 U.S. 151, 158]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a writ of error to reverse a decree in favor of the defendant in error, the original plaintiff, and hereinafter called the plaintiff. 104 Va. 197, 51 S. E. 166. The plaintiffs in error will be called the defendants. The plaintiff is a Virginia corporation. The principal defendant is a Pennsylvania corporation. The other defendants are alleged to be officers of a voluntary association, calling itself by the plaintiff's name, and are acting under a charter from the Pennsylvania corporation. The latter was incorporated in 1893, the articles of association reciting that the associates comprise the national council, the supreme head of the order in the United States (where it previously had existed as a voluntary association). Its objects were to promote the interests of Americans and shield them from foreign competition, to assist them in obtaining employment, to encourage them in business, to establish a sick and funeral fund, and to maintain the public school system, prevent sectarian interference with the same, and uphold the reading of the Holy Bible in the schools. As the result of internal dissensions the Virginia corporation was chartered in 1900, with closely similar objects, omitting those relating to the public schools. It seems to have consisted of the dominant portion of a former \n\n[203 U.S. 151, 159]\n\u00a0\n voluntary state council of the same name, from which a charter issued by the Pennsylvania corporation had been withdrawn. The act of incorporation declared that the new body 'shall be the supreme head of the Junior Order of the United American Mechanics in the state of Virginia,' and provides that it 'shall have full and exclusive authority to grant charters to subordinate councils, Junior Order United American Mechanics, in the state of Virginia, with power to revoke the same for cause.' The plaintiff and the voluntary organization of the defendants both have granted and intend to grant charters to subordinate councils in Virginia, and are obtaining members and fees which each would obtain but for the other, and are holding themselves out as the only true and lawful state council of the Virginia Junior Order of United American Mechanics.\n The plaintiff sued for an injunction, and the defendants, in their answer, asked cross relief. The plaintiff obtained a decree enjoining the defendant corporation and the other defendants (declared to be shown by their answers to be its agents and representatives) as officers of the Virginia voluntary association, from continuing within the state the use of the plaintiff's name or any other name likely to be taken for it; from using the plaintiff's seal; from carrying out under such name the objects for which the plaintiff and the Virginia voluntary association were organized; from granting charters to subordinate councils in the state as the head of the order in the state; from interfering in any way with the pursuit of its objects by the plaintiff within the state; and from designating their officers within the state by applications set forth as used by the plaintiff. On appeal the decree was affirmed, with a modification, merely by way of caution, providing that nothing therein contained should, in anywise, interfere with any personal or property rights that might have accrued before the date of the Virginia charter. The defendants had set up in their answer and insisted that the charter impaired the obligation of the contract existing between the plaintiff \n\n[203 U.S. 151, 160]\n\u00a0\n and the principal defendant, contrary to article 1,  10, of the Constitution, and also violated  1 of the 14th Amendment, and they took a writ of error from this court.\n The bill and answer state the two sides of the difference which led to the split, at length. But those details have no bearing that needs to be considered here. The only question before us is the constitutionality of the act of the Virginia legislature granting the charter. The elements of that question are the appropriation of the name of the previously existing voluntary society and the exclusive right of granting subcharters in Virginia conferred by the words that we have quoted. Whether the persons who were using that name when they got themselves incorporated were using it rightly or wrongly does not matter if the legislature had the right to grant the name to them in either case. On the other hand, we do not consider the question stated to be disposed of by the limitation put upon the decree by the supreme court of appeals. Unless the saving of personal and property rights existing at the date of the charter be read as a construction of the charter, it does not affect the scope or validity of the act. And if so read, still it cannot be taken to empty the specific prohibitions in the decree of all definite meaning and to leave only an indeterminate injunction to obey the law at the defendants' peril. That injunction remains and imports what the words of the charter import, that the plaintiff has been granted certain defined exclusive rights which the court will enforce.\n The decree, however, goes beyond the rights which we have mentioned as given by the charter. In that respect the discussion here must be limited again. Whether the plaintiff is using paraphernalia, or a ritual, or a seal, which it should not be allowed to use, is not before us here. The charter says nothing about them, and its validity is not affected by any abuse of rights of property or of confidence which the plaintiff or its members may have practised. This court, we re- \n\n[203 U.S. 151, 161]\n\u00a0\n peat, cannot go beyond a decision upon the constitutionality of the charter granted, and we address ourselves to that.\n The contract of which the obligation is alleged to have been violated is a contract between the plaintiff and the principal defendant. What that contract is supposed to have been is not stated, but manifestly there was none. It would have had to be a contract not to come into existence, at least with the plaintiff's present functions and name. There have been cases where administration was taken out on a prematurely born child and a suit brought for causing it to be born, per quod it died, but they have failed. Dietrich v. Northampton, 138 Mass. 14, 52 Am. Rep. 242. See Walker v. Great Northern R. Co. Ir. L. R. 28 Eq. 69. An antenatal contract presents greater difficulties still. Even if we should substitute an allegation of a contract with the members of the plaintiff, the contention would fail. The contract, if any there was, was not that they would not become incorporated, but must be supposed to be that they would retain their subordination to the national council, or something of that sort. It is going very far to say that they contracted not to secede, but whether they did so or not, it was a matter outside the purview of the charter. There was nothing in that to hinder their returning to their allegiance. Whether any, and if any, what, contract was made (National Council, J. O. of U. A. M. v. State Council J. O. of U. A. M. 64 N. J. Eq. 470, 473, 53 Atl. 1082, 66 N. J. Eq. 429, 57 Atl. 1132), and whether, if made, it must not be taken to have been made subject to the powers of the state, with which we are about to deal, are questions which we may pass. See Pennsylvania College Cases (Jefferson College v. Washington & J. College) 13 Wall. 190, 218, 20 L. ed. 550, 554; Bedford v. Eastern Bidg. & L. Asso. \n181 U.S. 227\n, 45 L. ed. 834, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 597.\n The most serious aspect of the defense is presented by the matter of the plaintiff's name. If the legislation of a state undertook to appropriate to the use of its own creature a trade name of known commercial value, of course the argument would be very strong that an act of incorporation could not interfere with existing property rights. And, no doubt, \n\n[203 U.S. 151, 162]\n\u00a0\n within proper limits, the argument would be as good for a foreign corporation as for a foreign person. But that is not what has been done in this case.\n The name in question is not the name of the principal defendant, but distinguished from that name as state and national councils no doubt generally are distinguished by members of similar institutions. It is the name of a voluntary association of which the officers are defendants. But it is not used even by that association in its own right, but only under a charter from, and in the right of, the Pennsylvania corporation. Furthermore, the name is not associated with a product of any kind. Its only value to the defendants, in a property sense, is as tending to invite membership in a club which professes to derive its existence and its powers from the Pennsylvania company. It does not seem likely that anyone would join the plaintiff, and certainly no member could be retained, in ignorance of its alienation from the national council. As the national council has its branches elsewhere, and as the plaintiff is, on its face, a state organization, competition outside the state appears improbable. So that the claim of the defendants comes down to a claim of right to compete within the state, and a right, as we have said, of or in behalf of the Pennsylvania corporation, which controls the existence of its subordinate Virginia councils. Thus the question as to the grant of the name passes over into the question as to the exclusive right of the plaintiff to issue charters, which was the other legislative grant.\n The supreme court of appeals was right, therefore, in treating the constitutional question as depending on the power of the state with regard to foreign corporations. That must decide the case. Now it is true, of course, that an unconstitutional law no more binds foreign corporations than it binds others. Carroll v. Greenwich Ins. Co. \n199 \nU.S. 401, 409\n, 50 S. L. ed. 246, 249, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 66. And no doubt a law specially directed against a foreign corporation might be unconstitutional, for instance, as depriving it of its property without due process of law. See Blake v. \n\n[203 U.S. 151, 163]\n\u00a0\n McClung, \n172 \nU.S. 239, 260\n, 43 S. L. ed. 432, 440, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 165. But when the so-called property consists merely in the value that there might be in extending its business or membership into a state, that property, it hardly needs to be said, depends upon the consent of the state to let the corporation come into the state. The state of Virginia had the undoubted right to exclude the Pennsylvania corporation and to forbid its constituting branches within the Virginia boundaries. As it had that right before the corporation got in, so it had the right to turn it out after it got in. Security Mut. L. Ins. Co. v. Prewitt, \n202 U.S. 246\n, 50 L. ed. 1013, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 619. It follows that the state could impose the more limited restriction that simply forbade the granting of charters to 'subordinate councils, Junior Order United American Mechanics, in the state of Virginia.'\n It is argued that the power of the state in this case was less than it otherwise might have been, because it did not turn the Pennsylvania corporation out. The supreme court of appeals says that the plaintiff's charter leaves the whole order of things as it existed unaffected except by the exclusive right of the plaintiff to issue subordinate charters. It is said that the general statutes recognized the defendant and authorized such associations to continue within the state. A subordinate council of the order had been granted a special charter, which is not revoked. The conclusion is drawn that the restrictions upon the defendant which flow from the charter to the plaintiff amount to a denial of the equal protection of the laws of Virginia to a person within its jurisdiction. But the power of the state as to foreign corporations does not depend upon their being outside of its jurisdiction. Those within the jurisdiction, in such sense as they ever can be said to be within it, do not acquire a right not to be turned out except by general laws. A single foreign corporation, especially one unique in character, like the national council, might be expelled by a special act. It equally could be restricted in the more limited way.\n There were many difficult questions presented to the state \n\n[203 U.S. 151, 164]\n\u00a0\n court which cannot be reviewed here. As to the constitutionality of the plaintiff's charter, we are of opinion that the court was right.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","110":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNATIONAL LIVE STOCK BANK v.

The court also stated in its opinion on the second appeal that it had been agreed upon between the parties in the trial court that a jury should be waived and the case submitted on the record as made \n\n[203 U.S. 296, 298]\n\u00a0\n on the first trial, and that 'no new question is raised on this appeal. The record is the same as stated in our former opinion, and we are fully satisfied with the law as therein declared. The judgment of the lower court is hereby affirmed at the cost of the appellant.' [(Okla.) 79 Pac. 1134.]\n The following facts were found by the supreme court on the first appeal, and were adopted by it as the facts for review on the second appeal:\n One W. B. Grimes, who at the time was a resident of Clark county, in Kansas, executed at that place, on the 27th day of June, 1900, and delivered to Siegel-Sanders Live Stock Commission Company, his negotiable promissory note for $11,111.23, due November 1, 1900, with interest from maturity at the rate of 8 per cent per annum. To secure the payment of this note he executed and delivered a chattel mortgage to the payee of the note on 526 cattle then in the county, and the mortgage was duly filed in the office of the register of deeds of Clark county on July 12, 1900. The note was then indorsed and delivered by the payee to the Geneseo Bank, the defendant in error. It does not appear that there was any separate assignment of the mortgage. No record of any assignment was ever made in the register's office of Clark county, Kansas. On the 24th day of November, 1900, although the Siegel-Sanders Company had already sold and delivered the note for $11,111.23 to the Geneseo Bank, the defendant in error, yet, notwithstanding such sale, the president of that company, Frank Siegel, without any authority, filed in the office of the register of deeds a pretended release of the mortgage, in which payment of the above debt was acknowledged.\n On the 25th day of February, 1901, the Chicago Cattle Loan Company caused its agent to examine the records of Clark county as to chattel mortgages against Grimes, and upon this examination he found the record clear, except as to a mortgage executed by Grimes to the Siegel-Sanders Live Stock Company, October 24, 1900, and by it assigned to the \n\n[203 U.S. 296, 299]\n\u00a0\n Chicago Cattle Loan Company, and True so reported to the lastnamed company.\n On April 17, 1901, Grimes executed two other notes to the Siegel- Sanders Company for $7,694.70 each, due October 27, 1901. These notes were probably renewals of notes previously given. To secure the payment of these two notes Grimes at the same time executed and delivered a chattel mortgage to the Siegel-Sanders Company on the cattle in question and other cattle. The two notes thus given were then sold by that company to the plaintiff in error for the amount named in the notes, and the plaintiff believed at the time it bought these notes that the mortgage securing them was the first lien on the cattle, and it secured this information through its agent, who personally examined the record.\n It is further stated in the finding that there was practteally no dispute as to the facts, and that the trial court expressly found that both parties to this action acted in good faith.\n The release of the first mortgage, signed by the president of the Live Stock Commission Company and filed in the office of the register of deeds, as above stated, on November 24, 1900, was not acknowledged.\n After the execution of these various instruments, and between the 25th of April and the 1st of May, 1901, without the knowledge or consent of either of the banks, parties to this suit, Grimes, the original owner of the battle, moved them from the state of Kansas to the county of Woodward, in the territory of Oklahoma, at which latter place, between the 19th and 20th of May, 1901, they were seized and taken possession of by the Geneseo Bank, the defendant. The plaintiff, within one year from the filing of the first mortgage, dated June, 27, 1900, in the office of the register of deeds of Clark county, Kansas, commenced this suit in replevin in the district court of Woodward county, Oklahoma, to recover possession of the cattle, claiming under the mortgage which was executed and delivered to the Siegel Sanders Company on April 17, 1901, and by it sold to plaintiff; while the \n\n[203 U.S. 296, 300]\n\u00a0\n defendant claimed under the mortgage dated June 27, 1900, a pretended release of which had been filed as already stated, but after the assignment to defendant.\n Upon these facts, as found by the supreme court of Oklahoma, judgment was rendered for the defendant in error.\n Silas H. Strawn, Frederick S. Winston, John Barton Payne, Ralph M. Shaw, Blackburn Esterline, and Earle W. Evans for plaintiff in error. \n\n\n[203 U.S. 296, 301]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. James S. Botsford, B. F. Deatherage, and O. G. Young for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[203 U.S. 296, 305]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Peckham, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The defendant in error, at the outset, objects to the jurisdiction of this court on the ground that the plaintiff should have brought the case here by appeal instead of by writ of error, because the case was tried without a jury, and therefore the writ of error was improper. There is nothing in this objection, as in actions at law coming from the territory of Oklahoma it has been held that the proper way to review the judgments of the supreme court of that territory was by writ of error. Comstock v. Eagleton, \n196 U.S. 99\n, 49 L. ed. 402, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 210; Oklahoma City v. McMaster, \n196 U.S. 529\n, 49 L. ed. 587, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 324; Guss v. Nelson, \n200 U.S. 298\n, 50 L. ed. 489, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 260.\n Further objection is made that the court below found no facts upon which a review can be had in this court. The foregoing statement disposes of this objection also, and shows it to be untenable.\n On the merits, the question arises which of these two parties shall sustain the loss occasioned by the improper act of the president of the Live Stock Commission Company in signing this pretended release, and acknowledging the payment of the $11,000 note, as above stated? The plaintiff in error contends that the defendant bank should bear the loss because of its failure to record or file the assignment to it of the first mortgage, securing the $11,000 mote. The defendant opposes this view and insists that, being the holder and the owner of the $11,000 note, secured by a first mortgage duly executed on the 27th of June, 1900, and duly filed in the register's office, it has the prior right to the cattle, and that the statutes of Kansas do not require that it should file or record the assignment to it of the note and mortgage, and its claim should not therefore be postponed. \n\n[203 U.S. 296, 306]\n\u00a0\n The note executed by Grimes for eleven thousand and some odd dollars was negotiable, and the chattel mortgage was given at that time to secure the payment of the note. The indorsement of the note and its delivery before maturity to the defendant by the payee of the note transferred its ownership to the defendant bank. This transfer also transferred, by operation of law, the ownership of the mortgage, which was collateral to the note. Such a mortgage has no separate existence, and when the note is paid the mortgage expires, as it cannot survive the debt which the note represents. Carpenter v. Longan, 16 Wall. 271, 21 L. ed. 313; Burhans v. Hutcheson, 25 Kan. 625, 37 Am. Rep. 274; Mutual Ben. L. Ins. Co. v. Huntington, 57 Kan. 744, 48 Pac. 19; Swift v. Bank of Washington, 52 C. C. A. 339, 114 Fed. 643.\n The mortgage, therefore, is a prior lien upon the cattle, as security for the payment of the note, unless defendant has lost it by its failure to record an assignment of the mortgage. Whether it has or not is to be determined by the law of Kansas.\n There is no express provision in the statutes of Kansas for the filing or recording of assignments of chattel mortgages. Paragraph 36,  4251, General Statutes of Kansas for 1901, by Dassler, may be found in the margin. \n1\n It is said this statute by implication provides for the recording of an assignment of a chattel mortgage.\n Assuming that the statute makes provision for such recording, it is then argued that it is the duty of the assignee to do\n___ 1 Paragraph 36,  4251, General Statutes of Kansas for 1901, by Dassler, provides as follows:\n'When any mortgage of personal property shall have been fully paid or satisfied, it shall be the duty of the mortgagee, his assignee or personal representative, to enter satisfaction or cause satisfaction thereof to be entered of record in the same manner as near as may be, and under the same penalty for a neglect or refusal, as provided in case of the satisfaction of mortgages of real estate. The entry of satisfaction shall be made in the book in which the mortgage is entered, as hereinbefore provided; and any instrument acknowledging satisfaction shall not be recorded at length, but shall be referred to under the head of 'Remarks' and filed with the mortgage or copy thereof, and preserved therewith in the office of the register.' \n\n[203 U.S. 296, 307]\n\u00a0\n so, and his failure takes away a right of priority of lien which he might otherwise have. This reasoning is not satisfactory. We cannot make the assumption that the statute cited does make provision for the recording of the assignment, and we fail, therefore, to find its necessity. That necessity depends upon statute, and without some statutory provision therefor the necessity does not exist. Uncertain and doubtful implications arising from portions of a statute not requiring the recording of an instrument are not to be regarded as furnishing a rule upon the subject. There are statutory provisions for recording assignments of real estate mortgages to be found in the Kansas statutes. See paragraph 19,  4234, and paragraph 26,  4241, General Statutes of Kansas for 1901, by Dassler. Paragraph 19, above, provides for the acknowledgment of assignments of real estate mortgages by the assignor, and paragraph 26 provides that, on presentation of such assignment for record, it shall be entered upon the margin of the record of the mortgage by the register of deeds, who is to attest the same, as therein provided. Now, in relation to chattel mortgages and the assignment thereof, there is no such provision or anything similar to it. Provision is made for the satisfaction of a chattel mortgage when paid by the mortgagee, assignee, etc., but that does not make it necessary to record or file the assignment of a chattel mortgage in order to protect the assignee.\n\n The supreme court of Kansas has held that there is no statute making it necessary to record an assignment of a chattel mortgage, in order to protect the rights of such assignee, and that it need not be recorded or filed. Burhans v. Hutcheson, supra; Wiscomb v. Cubberly, 51 Kan. 580, 33 Pac. 320; Mutual Ben. L. Ins. Co. v. Huntington, Supra. It is true that these cases refer to real estate mortgages, but the reasoning sustains the statement as to chattel mortgages.\n The first of the above cases (Burhans v. Hutcheson) holds that where a mortgage upon real estate is given to secure payment of a negotiable note, and before its maturity the note \n\n[203 U.S. 296, 308]\n\u00a0\n and mortgage are transferred by indorsement of the note to a bona fide holder, the assignment, if there be a written one, need not be recorded. This is held even where there was an express statute as to the record of such an assignment. The statute was held not to apply to the case of a mortgage given as collateral to a negotiable note.\n The second case (Wiscomb v. Cubberly) has reference also to a mortgage on real estate, and involves much the same principle.\n In the third case (Mutual Ben. L. Ins. Co. v. Huntington) it was again held that after the assignment and delivery by the payee of a negotiable promissory note, before maturity, together with the mortgage on real estate, given as collateral security for its payment, the original mortgagee had no power to release or discharge the lien of the mortgage, and a release made by him without authority, even though the assignment was not recorded, would not affect the rights of the assignee.\n These cases would seem to establish the rule in Kansas that it is not necessary to record the assignment of a mortgage even upon real estate, when given to secure payment of negotiable notes, although there is a statute which, in general terms, provides for the recording of assignments of real estate mortgages. Still stronger, if possible, is the case of a chattel mortgage given to secure the payment of negotiable notes, when there is no statutory provision for the recording of the assignment of such mortgage. It is probable that in the large majority of cases the only evidence of an assignment of a negotiable note and a chattel mortgage given to secure its payment is the indorsement of the note, and delivery thereof to the purchaser. In such a case there would be no assignment to record, and there is no provision in the statute for filing a copy of the note with its indorsement, together with a statement that it had been delivered to a third party, as the purchaser or assignee thereof.\n The policy of the state of Kansas seems to be not alone to \n\n[203 U.S. 296, 309]\n\u00a0\n give to a negotiable promissory note all the qualities that pertain to commercial paper, but also to clothe mortgages given as collateral security for the payment of such notes with the same facility of transfer as the note itself, to which it is only an incident.\n The plaintiff, however, contends for the opposite doctrine, and cites, among others, Lewis v. Kirk, 28 Kan. 497, 42 Am. Rep. 173, as its authority. In that case the question was which should suffer, a bona fide purchaser of the real estate which had been mortgaged, or the bona fide purchaser of the mortgage, who had failed to have his assignment recorded. The court held in favor of the purchaser of the real estate, and distinguished Burhans v. Hutcheson, supra, though not assuming to overrule it. The mortgage in the Lewis Case was upon real estate, and would not, therefore, necessarily affect the case of a chattel mortgage, where there is no statute for recording an assignment of the mortgage.\n But in Mutual Ben. L. Ins. Co. v. Huntington, supra, the case of Burhans v. Hutcheson, supra, was cited, and the doctrine that a bona fide holder of negotiable paper, transferred by him by indorsement thereon before maturity, and secured by a real estate mortgage, need not record the assignment of mortgage, was again approved.\n In Thomas v. Reynolds, 29 Kan. 304, cited by plaintiff, it was held that an action to recover the penalty provided for by the statute for refusal to enter satisfaction of a chattel mortgage when it had been paid could not be sustained against the assignee of the mortgage without proof of the assignment of record, as the purpose of the statute was to clear the record, and therefore the defaulting party must have record title or his satisfaction would apparently be an impertinent interference by a stranger. That action did not raise the question herein presented, and the court made no reference to the case of Burhans v. Hutcheson, supra. It is quite clear that it did not intend to overrule that case. In any event, as already mentioned, the Burhans Case has been approved in 57 Kan. 744, 48 Pac. 19, \n\n[203 U.S. 296, 310]\n\u00a0\n above cited. We cannot treat the rule which we have stated above as having been at all shaken by the two cases from 28 and 29 Kansas (supra.)\n The counsel for plaintiff contends that, assuming there was no statute providing for the recording of an assignment of a chattel mortgage in the state of Kansas, yet there was no law of that state which prohibited the Geneseo Bank from recording its assignment. It is not necessary that there should be a law to prohibit the recording of such assignments. There must be a law which provides for their record, either in express terms or by plain and necessary implication from the words stated. Where the statute does not so provide, it is not necessary nor is it the duty of the assignee to record or file his assignment. There must be some legal duty imposed upon the assignee before the necessity arises for the recording of the assignment.\n Counsel have cited many cases from states other than Kansas, in which the rights of assignees of mortgagees as against subsequent mortgages or conveyances have been discussed and decided. In many cases the question has arisen in regard to the recording of assignments of mortgages upon real estate, where the states had provided for the recording of such assignments, and where, in the absence of such recording, the assignee has failed in obtaining priority of rights under his mortgage, which he would have had if the assignment had been recorded. But, as the owner of the cattle mentioned herein resided in Kansas at the time the mortgages were given, and the cattle were then in that state, and the mortgages were filed there, the transactions are to be judged of with reference to the law of that state, and we decide this question with reference to such law. Under that law the assignee of the first mortgage of June, 1900, has a superior lien to the assignee of the second mortgage of April, 1901, although such assignee of the first mortgage did not have his assignment recorded.\n Judgment is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","111":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNELSON v. U.S.(1906)\nNo. 490\nArgued: Decided: March 12, 1906\n\n\n\n These writs of error submit for review a judgment in contempt entered in the case of the United States v. General Paper Co. described in No. 381 et seq. [See \n201 U.S. 117\n, 50 L. ed. --, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 356.] The judgment was based upon the disobedience by the plaintiffs in error to orders of the court requiring them to answer certain \n\n[201 U.S. 92, 93]\n\u00a0\n questions and to produce certain books, documents, and papers in their examination before the special examiner, in pursuance to a subpoena duces tecum duly issued and served. The orders requiring the plaintiffs in error to answer were made upon petition of the United States, which exhibited the issues in the suit of United States v. General Paper Co., stated the questions asked plaintiffs in error, and the books, documents, and papers required of them.\n Plaintiffs in error refused to obey the orders, and the examiner reported their disobedience to the court 'for such action as the court might take for the further enforcement of its orders.' In defense plaintiffs in error filed separate answers, which respectively alleged that Nelson was the president and manager of the Hennepin Paper Company; Bossard, manager and treasurer of the Itasca Company, and McNair, a director and general manager of the Northwest Paper Company. In other particulars the answers are identical except so far as the relations of plaintiffs in error to their respective corporations made a difference. Plaintiffs in error are also directors of the General Paper Company. We insert the answer of Nelson in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[201 U.S. 92, 94]\n\u00a0\n The court required the questions to be answered and the books and documents to be produced, and, being of opinion that the order did not constitute a final decision, refused to allow an appeal on the part of either of the plaintiffs in error or either of \n\n[201 U.S. 92, 95]\n\u00a0\n the defendants in the suit, or on the part of all of them jointly.\n Plaintiffs in error refused to obey the order of the court, and upon the report of the examiner the judgment under review was \n\n[201 U.S. 92, 96]\n\u00a0\n entered fining plaintiffs in error severally $100 'for their said disobedience of the said order, said fines to be paid to the clerk of this court for the use of the United States, as punishment for such contempt,' and sentencing them to be imprisoned until \n\n[201 U.S. 92, 97]\n\u00a0\n the order of the court requiring them to testify should be complied with.\n The questions on the merits in these cases are the same as those on the merits in 381 et seq., just \n\n[201 U.S. 92, 98]\n\u00a0\n decided. In those cases, however, this court had no jurisdiction and the appeals were dismissed. In the present cases we have jurisdiction ( Bessette v. W. B. Conkey Co. \n194 U.S. 324\n, 48 L. ed. 997, 24 Sup.Ct.Rep. 665), and directly from the circuit court, as questions under the Constitution of the United States are involved. \n\n[201 U.S. 92, 99]\n\u00a0\n In the pleadings in the original suit brought in the circuit court of the United States for the district of Minnesota it is respectively alleged and denied that the defendant corporations, of which plaintiffs in error are officers, had entered into an agreement, combination, and conspiracy to control, regulate, and monopolize not only the manufacture of news prints and other papers, but the distribution and shipment thereof through the middle, southern, and western states, in violation of the antitrust act of July 2, 1890. [26 Stat. at L. 209, chap. 647, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3200.] The United States sought to establish by plaintiffs in error the truth of the charge, and the subpoena served upon them was explicit as to what was required of them.\n The subpoenas required plaintiffs in error to produce the account books, including the journals, ledgers, and other books kept by or under the control of the companies respectively, of which plaintiffs in error were respectively officers, (a) showing the amounts, kinds, and grades of paper manufactured by the respective companies and sold by or through the General Paper Company, and which were shipped since the 5th of July, 1900; ( b) the prices, amounts, or credits received for such paper from the paper company between the 5th of July and the present time, including entries showing the manner in which the prices and amounts received by the respective companies for any and all \n\n[201 U.S. 92, 100]\n\u00a0\n of its products so sold have been equalized with the prices and amounts received or realized of any and all of the other defendant companies for which the paper company is or has been the exclusive agent; (c) the amounts and proportions of earnings or profits of the paper company, received by the respective companies from and through the paper company, either in the form of rebates, credits, or otherwise.\n Second. All contracts, agreements, writings, and account books, including journals, ledgers, and other books, kept by or under the control of the respective companies, showing the agreement, arrangement, or understanding under and pursuant to each, and the manner in which the prices and amounts realized by the respective companies upon the various kinds and grades of paper manufactured by it and sold by and through the paper company, are and have been, since July 5, 1900, equalized, or the profits arising from the sale of such paper distributed or apportioned, as between the respective companies and other defendants manufacturing and selling through the paper company similar kinds or grades of paper or among all of the defendants manufacturing similar kinds or grades of paper, and then and there to testify and the truth to say, in a certain matter in controversy in said court, between the United States as complainant against the General Paper Company, et al., defendants, on the part of the complainant.\n There is no uncertainty, therefore, either in the issue or the means of proof. In other words, the United States charges a conspiracy upon the part of the defendant corporations for the cessation of competition between the manufacturing defendants by creating a general selling and distributing agent, the General Paper Company, which restricts the output of the mills, fixes the prices of their products, determines to whom, and the terms and conditions upon which, such products shall be sold, into what states and places they shall be shipped, and what publishers and customers each mill shall supply. The means of proof of the charge are obviously the conditions of the companies before and after the formation of the paper company, \n\n[201 U.S. 92, 101]\n\u00a0\n its organization and the purpose of its organization, the means of its operation, how and by what means it equalizes the output and price of products, and the distribution of the proceeds of their sale, and the relations the accounts between it and the other defendant companies, and their books, accounts, and minutes of proceedings.\n The questions were directed to these ends. They were directed to ascertain whether the prices received for the various paper materials were equalized, and whether, during the time the General Paper Company was the selling agent of the materials, there was in existence an arrangement whereby the prices received through the paper company were equalized between the other defendant companies. The questions were put in various ways to show such equalization and the arrangements to equalize, and to show the allowances to each mill, the fixing of definite prices, and the distribution of the balances received among the companies on the basis of their average daily output of the grade of paper inquired about. And there were also questions asked as to whether the board of directors or the executive committee of the paper company fixed the prices of paper to be paid to each of the mills by or through the paper company, and the compensation to be paid to the mills making butchers' fibre paper, because it was less profitable, and other questions as to conversations between gentlemen representing the different mills in regard to the organization of a corporation to act as general selling agent in order to eliminate competition. There were also questions as to whether the books showed the things expressed in the other questions. The objection made to each of the questions before the examiner was that the testimony sought was irrelevant, incompetent, and immaterial, and counsel advised the witnesses not to answer. As to the books and papers, the following is a sample of the proceedings:\n Q. Do the books, journals, or ledgers of the Hennepin Paper Company show any agreement or arrangement or understanding under and pursuant to which and the manner in which the prices and amounts realized by the Hennepin Paper Company \n\n[201 U.S. 92, 102]\n\u00a0\n upon various grades of paper manufactured by it and sold by or through the defendant the General Paper Company are and have been, since the 5th day of July, 1900, equalized, or the profits arising from the sale of such paper distributed or apportioned, as between the defendants?\n Mr. Flanders: All objections renewed, and I give the witness the same advice.\n (No answer.)\n Q. Do you refuse, Mr. Nelson, to produce the books?\n Mr. Flanders: As I said before, you may assume for the purposes of these questions that the books and all the papers called for are present in court; but, on behalf of the Hennepin Paper Company and the witness and the General Paper Company, I decline to submit those to the inspection of the government counsel.\n Mr. Kellogg: Or to allow them or any part of them to be put in evidence, Mr. Flanders?\n Mr. Flanders: Yes.\n Other facts will appear in the opinion.\n Messrs. James G. Flanders, Charles F. Fawsett, and William Brace for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n[201 U.S. 92, 108]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Frank B. Kellogg, James M. Back, and Attorney General Moody for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[201 U.S. 92, 111]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna, after stating the case as above, delivered the opinion of the court:\n Plaintiffs in error urge three main contentions, which we will consider in their order.\n I. That the evidence, documentary and oral, which the witnesses were required to produce, was not shown to be material to plaintiff's case.\n\n 1. \nThere are three answers to this contention. (1) The evidence is clearly material. The charge of the bill is that the defendant manufacturing corporations entered into a conspiracy and combination in violation of the act of July 2, 1890, to suppress competition between themselves, and that they accomplished this purpose by organizing the General Paper Company, and gave it certain controlling powers over the output of the mills and the prices and distribution of their products.\n Before the application to the court for the orders under review there were certain facts established. It was established that in the fall of 1899 and the spring of 1900 there were preliminary meetings of the parties to ultimately form the paper company, and that it was subsequently formed by those representing the manufacturing companies, who subscribed for the stock. In July, 1900, the corporations, as represented in the paper company, fourteen in all, entered into contracts with it, making it their exclusive selling agent; that each constituent manufacturing company was represented by one of its principal officers upon the board of directors of the paper company, and the number of directors have been increased as other corporations have made the paper company their selling agent. A table of the constituent companies was given and the times the companies became members of the paper company. And it was established that there was an executive committee, comprised \n\n[201 U.S. 92, 112]\n\u00a0\n substantially of the same persons who constituted the board of directors, and that the paper company had books and records containing the minutes of the meetings of stockholders, directors, and the executive committee, and that the treasurers and sales agents had presented reports to the stockholders, directors, and executive committee. It was stipulated that all the subscriptions to stock of the paper company were for the benefit of some paper manufacturing company, and in its name, that it was the beneficial owner thereof, and that the dividends declared thereon were its property; that said stock was from time to time allotted to such corporations as made contracts with the paper company, making it their exclusive selling agent, upon the basis of estimated relative productions of paper. A list of the individuals to whom stock was issued, the names of the corporations represented by them, and the days of the issuances of the stock, were given.\n The questions were framed to prove the combination charged in the bill and the powers and operation of the General Paper Company and the relations of the other companies to it. What the answers will show we do not know, nor what the books and documents will disclose. The organization of the paper company had a purpose, and whether it was a legal or illegal instrument for competing companies to use we do not have now to determine. By the admissions of the answers the paper company entered into contracts with those companies, became their selling agent, and was entitled to a certain percentage of the sales. Presumably it exercised its powers, made sales and received profits. In all that it did, the manufacturing corporations were interested; they owned its stock, were entitled to its dividends. This we may admit, for argument sake, not prejudging in any way, may be consistent with continued competition between the companies, but it may be otherwise. At any rate, the manner in which the paper company executed its functions may be links in the evidence adduced by the United States, and this is enough to establish the materiality of the evidence.\n It must not be overlooked that not only an inspection of the \n\n[201 U.S. 92, 113]\n\u00a0\n books was refused, but questions directed to ascertain the contents of the books were objected to, not answered. We have given one illustration; we will give another. Counsel for defendant corporations stated at the examination: 'That for the purpose of any questions the government counsel see fit to ask, it may be assumed that all the books, papers, and documents' described in the subpoena 'are present here in court, and we decline to submit them to the inspection of the government counsel.' The following then took place:\n Q. State whether those books show the amounts, kinds, or grades of paper manufactured by the defendant Northwest Paper Company and sold by or through the defendant General Paper Company, as the exclusive sales agent of the defendant Northwest Paper Company since the 8th day of April, 1902, or since about the 1st of May, 1902 if that is the date the business commenced.\n Same objections by defendants, and the witness given the same advice.\n Q. You decline to answer?\n A. I decline on advice of attorney.\n Q. Do the books also show where the said paper so manufactured was sold and into what states and territories it was shipped since the 8th day of April, 1902, or the 1st day of May, 1902?\n Mr. Flanders: I wish to make the same objections, and I give the witness the same advice.\n A. Same answer.\n And counsel for the United States, not only as to the matters expressed in the foregoing questions, but as to other matters which the bill charged against the companies and which had been inquired about, said that he desired to use the books and offer them in evidence to show such matters. An inspection of the books was refused, and all evidence of their contents withheld.\n Necessarily the books contained the information. The paper company was the selling agent of the Northwest Paper Company \n\n[201 U.S. 92, 114]\n\u00a0\n and must have kept an account of its sales and into what states the paper of the company was shipped and sold. Such accounts are material and relevant to complainant's case. They may or may not, in connection with other evidence, sustain the charge of the United States, but they are elements in the proof, having tendency enough to sustain the charge to be considered material.\n\n 2. \nThe claim of immateriality of the testimony cannot avail plaintiffs against the orders of the circuit court. The procedure before an examiner and his power are explained in Blease v. Garlington, \n92 U.S. 1\n, 23 L. ed. 521. It is there said: 'The examiner, before whom the witnesses are orally examined, is required to note exceptions, but he cannot decide upon their validity. He must take down all the examination in writing, and send it to the court, with the objections noted. So, too, when depositions are taken according to the acts of Congress, or otherwise, under the rules; exceptions to the testimony may be noted by the officer taking the deposition, but he is not permitted to decide upon them; and when the testimony, as reduced to writing by the examiner, or the deposition, is filed in court, further exceptions may be there taken. Thus, both the exceptions and the testimony objected to are all before the court below, and come here upon the appeal as part of the record and proceedings there.'\n And an application to a court to compel the delivery of testimony in aid of the examination does not change the rule. The testimony is taken to be submitted to the court where the suit is pending, and all questions upon the evidence, its materiality and sufficiency, are to be determined by it, and after it by an appellate court. Even if the trial court permit the examination of witnesses orally in open court upon the hearing in cases in equity, as further said in Blease v. Garlington, the testimony must be taken 'down or its substance stated in writing and made part of the record, or it will be entirely disregarded here on an appeal. So, too, if testimony is objected to and ruled out, it must still be sent here with the record, subject to the objection, \n\n[201 U.S. 92, 115]\n\u00a0\n or the ruling will not be considered by us.' Blease v. Garlington has been applied at circuit in a number of cases. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n\n 3. \nThese writs of error are not prosecuted by the parties in the original suit, but by witnesses, to review a judgment of contempt against them for disobeying orders to testify. Being witnesses merely, it is not open to them to make objections to the testimony. The tendency or effect of the testimony on the issues between the parties is no concern of theirs. The basis of their privilege is different from that the entirely personal, as we shall presently see.\n II. That the documentary evidence called for was not shown to be in the possession or under the control of the witnesses. This contention is untenable. The ground of it is that the possession of the witnesses was not personal, but was that of the respective corporations of which they were officers. Granting this to be so, and that the witnesses could have set up whatever privileges the corporations had, nevertheless they had the custody (actual possession) of the books, and were summoned from necessity, as representing the corporations. It is hardly necessary to observe that the witnesses had all the possession human beings could have had or can have, and if the objection is to prevail, the books of a corporation can be withdrawn from the reach of compulsory process.\n It is as useless as attempting to demonstrate that twice two make four, to say that a corporation can have possession of nothing except by the human beings who are its officers, and it is to them-not the intangible being they represent and act for- \n\n[201 U.S. 92, 116]\n\u00a0\n that the law directs its process of subpoena and must procure its evidence.\n III. That the evidence, documentary and oral, required to be produced, was in the nature of incriminating evidence, which the witnesses and the defendants are privileged from furnishing to the plaintiff under the provisions of the Federal Constitution and the well-recognized principles of equity procedure.\n This contention asserts rights personal to the plaintiffs and rights of the corporation defendants in the suit. The basis of both rights is the protection of the 4th and 5th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States.\n The argument submitted is substantially the same as that made by appellants in Hale v. Henkel and McAlister v. Henkel [\n201 \nU.S. 43, 90\n, 50 S. L. ed. --, 26 Sup.Ct.Rep. 370, 385]. It is insisted that the immunity 3 given by the act of February 25, 1903, is not as broad as the penalties and forfeitures to which the plaintiffs in error or the corporations of which they are officers will be subjected. If the immunity, it is urged, protects from the penalties of the antitrust act of 1890, it does not protect, nor has Congress the power to protect, from the penalties of the Minnesota laws, which make criminal a combination and conspiracy in restraint of trade, and subject to forfeiture the charters of corporations who become parties to such combination and conspiracy. Minn. Stat. 1894,  6955, 6956, 6962\n\n\n The extent of the immunity and its application to corporations was considered in Hale v. Henkel and McAlister v. Henkel, and decided adversely to the contention of plaintiffs in error.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Now comes Benjamin F. Nelson and, answering the order to show cause made in the above-entitled matter on the 15th day of September, A. D. 1905, and the petition heretofore filed in said matter by said complainant, upon which said order to show cause was made, alleges and shows unto the court as follows: That this respondent is a director and the president of Hennepin Paper Company, one of the defendants in the above-entitled matter, and is also the owner and holder of stock in said company of the par value of forty-nine thousand ($49,000.00) dollars and that the books and papers referred to in said order to show cause and in the petition and schedules thereto attached, upon which said order to show cause was made, are the books and papers of said Hennipen Paper Company, and not of this respondent, and are subject to the control of said Hennepin Paper Company, and not of this respondent; that this respondent is also a director of General Paper Company, another of the defendants in the above-entitled matter, and the owner and holder of stock in said General Paper Company of the par value of $2,250; that said Hennepin Paper Company and said General Paper Company have objected and do object, and this respondent has objected and does object, to the production of said books and papers for inspection by counsel for said complainant for the purpose of being offered in evidence in said cause. Said objections are based upon the following reasons: \n[\nFootnote 1\n] That the materiality of said books and papers in the case mentioned in said order to show cause now pending in said court has not been established so as to authorize a court of equity of order their inspection, production, and introduction in evidence, and that the same are not material, relevant, or competent evidence in said cause; that said books and papers contain mattters of importance relating to the business of said Hennepin Paper Company and said General Paper Company in no way bearing upon or touching the issues in said cause, which it would be highly injurious to the business interests of both of said companies to make public, and this respondent submits that he ought not to be required to disclose any portions of said books or papers except on a proper showing that the same are material to said cause to establish some issue therein, and a showing that the same are not privileged for the protection of the defendants above named. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] That one of the purposes of said complainant in instituting said cause and in making the requests mentioned in said order to show cause for the inspection, production, and introduction as evidence of said books and papers, is to establish and to compel said Hennepin Paper Company and said General Paper Company, and this respondent as such director or officer of each of said defendants, to furnish to said complainant evidence tending to establish that said Hennepin Paper Company and said General Paper Company have been guilty of certain violations of the act of Congress entitled 'An Act to Protect Trade and Commerce against Unlawful Restraints and Monopolies,' approved July 2, 1890 [26 Stat. at L. 209, chap. 647, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3200], and the acts amendatory thereof or supplemental thereto, and to subject said Hennepin Paper Company and said General Paper Company to the penalties for such violations imposed by said act, and that to compel the production by said Hennepin Paper Company or said General Paper Company, through their officers or otherwise, of said books and papers for inspection and introduction as evidence in said cause, would be contrary to the provisions of the 5th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which provides that no person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, and also contrary to the provisions of the 4th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which provides that the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] That the alleged acts of said Hennepin Paper Company complained of by said complainant in its said original petition or bill of complaint in said cause, and which said complainant is endeavoring to establish in said cause, would, if committed by said Hennepin Paper Company, be violations of the laws of the state of Minnesota, and would subject said Hennepin Paper Company to forfeiture of its charter and other penalties under said laws; that to compel said Hennepin Paper Company, through this respondent as one of its officers or otherwise, to produce said books and papers for inspection and introduction as evidence in said cause would be to compel it to furnish evidence tending to establish that it has been guilty of such acts, and subject it to the forfeiture of its charter and other penalties aforesaid, contrary to the provisions hereinbefore mentioned of the 4th and 5th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] That in addition to the matters above set forth, the purpose of the complainant in instituting said cause and in making the requests mentioned in said order to show cause is to obtain from said court a decree enjoining said General Paper Company from carrying on the business for which it was incorporated, and to enjoin the carrying out of, and operation under, certain agency contracts and agreements existing between it and said Hennepin Paper Company, on the alleged ground that said contracts and agreements were made and are in violation of the provisions of said act of Congress; that said contracts and agreements are of great value, not only to said General Paper Company, whose entire business practically rests upon them, but are also of great value to, and constitute valuable property rights in, each of the defendants respectively parties thereto, including the said Hennepin Paper Company, and that such injunction from carrying out said contracts and agreements, and their virtual annulment thereby occasioned, would result in great injury, damage, or loss, not only to said General Paper Company, but also to said Hennepin Paper Company and to this respondent as a stockholder in each of said companies; and that to compel the production by said Hennepin Paper Company or said General Paper Company, or either of them, though this respondent as such director or officer or otherwise, of said books and papers for inspection and introduction as evidence in said cause for the purpose aforesaid, would be contrary not only to the provisions of said 4th and 5th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, but also contrary to the well-established rule of the common law, as well as of equity jurisprudence, that no person will be compelled to discover any fact, either by producing documents or answering questions, which may subject him, either directly or eventually, to prosecution for a crime, or to a forfeiture or penalty, or anything in the nature of a forfeiture or penalty.\n Further answering, this respondent alleges and shows unto this court that all the matters concerning which the questions referred to in said petition and schedules thereto annexed were asked, and which this respondent refused to answer, as stated in said petition, came to this respondent's knowledge exclusively as president and a director of said Hennepin Paper Company, or as a director of said General Paper Company, in the conduct of matters intrusted to him as such director or president, and which said companies, from the nature of the case, were compelled to intrust to this respondent as such director or officer, and that said Hennepin Paper Company and said General Paper Company have objected and do object, and this respondent has objected and does object, to said questions and to his being required to answer the same, for reasons similar to those already set forth in respect to the production inspection, and introduction in evidence of the books and papers above mentioned, that is to say: \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] That the materiality of said questions in the cause above mentioned has not been established so as to authorize a court of equity to order them to be answered, and that the same are not material, relevant, or competent evidence in said cause. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] That the purpose of said complainant in instituting said cause and in asking said questions is to establish and to compel said Hennepin Paper Company and said General Paper Company, through this respondent as such director or officer, to furnish to said complainant evidence tending to establish that said Hennepin Paper Company and said General Paper Company have been guilty of certain violations of the acts of Congress above referred to, and to subject them to the penalties for such violations imposed by said acts, and that to compel said defendants hereinbefore named, or either of them, through this respondent, to answer said questions, would be contrary to the provisions hereinbefore referred to of said 4th and 5th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] That the alleged acts of said Hennepin Paper Company complained of by said complainant in its original petition or bill or complaint in said cause, and which said complainant is endeavoring to establish in said cause, would, if committed by it, be violations of the laws of the state of Minnesota, and would subject it to forfeiture of its charter and other penalties under said laws; that to compel it through this respondent to answer the questions aforesaid would be to compel it to furnish evidence tending to establish that it has been guilty of such acts, and subject it to the forfeiture of its charter and other penalties aforesaid, contrary to the provisions hereinbefore refered to of said 4th and 5th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] That in addition to the matters above set forth, the purpose of the complainant in instituting said cause, and in asking the questions mentioned in said order to show cause, is to obtain a decree enjoining said General Paper Company from carrying on the business for which it was incorporated, and to enjoin the carrying out of and operation under certain agency contracts and agreements existing between it and said Hennepin Paper Company, on the alleged ground that said contracts and agreements were made and are in violation of the provisions of said acts of Congress: that said contracts and agreements are of great value, not only to said General Paper Company, whose entire business practically rests upon them, but are also of great value to, and constitute valuable property rights in, each of the defendants respectively parties thereto, including The Hennepin Paper Company, and that such injunction from carrying out said contracts and agreements, and their virtual annulment thereby occasioned, would result in great injury, damage, and loss, not only to said Hennepin Paper Company or said General Paper Company, and that to compel said Hennepin Paper Company or said General Paper Company, through this respondent, to answer the questions aforesaid in aid of the purposes aforesaid would be contrary, not only to the provisions hereinbefore referred to of said 4th and 5th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, but also contrary to the well- established rule of the common law as well as of equity jurisprudence, that no person will be compelled to discover any fact, either by producing documents or answering questions, which may subject him, either directly or indirectly, to prosecution for a crime or to a forfeiture or penalty, or anything in the nature of a forfeiture or penalty. \n Further answering, this respondent alleges that he ought not to be required to answer the questions or comply with the requests, or produce for inspection by counsel for the complainant, or for the purpose of being offered in evidence in the cause above referred to, the books and papers referred to in said order to show cause and in the petition and schedules thereto annexed, upon which said order to show cause was made, not only for the reasons hereinabove set forth, but also for the following reasons, that is to say: \n[\nFootnote 1\n] That one of the purpose of said complainant in instituting said cause and in seeking to require this respondent to answer the questions and comply with the requests and produce for inspection by counsel for the complainant, and for the purpose of being offered in evidence in said cause, the books and papers aforesaid, is to establish and to compel this respondent to furnish to said complainant evidence tending to establish that he has been guilty of certain violations of the acts of Congress hereinbefore mentioned and referred to, and to subject him to the penalties for such violations imposed by said acts, and that to compel him to answer said questions or comply with said requests, or to produce for inspection or for the purpose of being offered in evidence in said cause, the said books and papers, would be contrary to the provisions hereinbefore referred to of said 4th and 5th Amendments to the Constitution of the United states. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] That the alleged acts of said Hennepin Paper Company and of said General Paper Company complained of by the complainant in its said original petition or bill of complaint in said cause, and which said complainant is endeavoring to establish in said cause, would, if committed by said defendant companies, involve certain violations of the laws of the state of Minnesota by this respondent, and would subject him to penalties and forfeiture under said laws, and that to compel him to answer the questions or comply with the requirements aforesaid, or to produce for inspection, or for the purpose of being offered in evidence in said cause, the said books and papers, would be to compel him to furnish evidence tending to establish that he has been guilty of such violations of the laws of the state of Minnesota, and to subject him to the penalties and forfeitures aforesaid, contrary to the provisions hereinbefore referred to of said 4th and 5th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] That one of the purposes of said complainant in instituting said cause and in seeking to require this respondent to answer the questions and comply with the requests, and produce for inspection by counsel for the complainant and for the purpose of being offered in evidence in said cause, the books and papers above referred to, is to establish and compel this respondent to furnish to said complainant evidence tending to establish the allegations of the original petition or bill of complaint in said cause, which, if established, will result in subjecting this respondent to loss or detriment in the nature of a penalty or forfeiture, in that the said Hennepin Paper Company, of which this respondent is a stockholder as aforesaid, will be subjected, under the laws of the state of Minnesota, to the forfeiture of its charter, resulting in the virtual forfeiture of the stock of this respondent in said defendant company, and in the loss and forfeiture to a large extent of the value of the interest of this respondent in said corporation, and in that the contracts made through said General Paper Company as its sales agent by said Hennepin Paper Company under and pursuant to the agency contracts herein referred to between said Hennepin Paper Company and said General Paper Company will be virtually annulled and the property rights of said Hennepin Paper Company in said contracts destroyed; that there are a large number of such contracts outstanding under which large sums of money are due to said Hennepin Paper Company, all of which, as this respondent is advised and believes, will be or may be forfeited and lost to said defendant and to this respondent as a stockholder therein in case the illegal combination alleged in said original petition or bill of complaint is established by the decree or judgment in said cause; and this respondent alleges that to compel him to answer the questions and comply with the requests and product for inspection and for purpose of being offered in evidence the books and papers referred to in said order to show cause and the petition and schedules aforesaid, and which he has declined to answer and comply with or produce, if material to said cause, would be contrary to the provisions of said 4th and 5th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States. and also contrary to the well-established rule of the common law and of equity jurisprudence, that no person will be compelled to discover any fact or matter which may subject him to forfeiture or penalty or anything in the nature of a forfeiture or penalty. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Thomson-Houston Electric Co. v.

GATTI(1906)\nNo. 21\nArgued: April 26, 1906Decided: December 3, 1906\n\n\n\n Messrs. D. Cady Herrick, Charles E. Miller, and William C. Trull for appellant.\n\n\n[203 U.S. 429, 432]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Walter Bennett and A. A. Hoehling, Jr., for appellee. \n\n[203 U.S. 429, 433]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n The suit below was begun by a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, by the New York Foundling Hospital, a corporation of the state of New York, against John C. Gatti, to command \n\n[203 U.S. 429, 434]\n\u00a0\n said Gatti to produce the body of one William Norton, an infant, and to show by what right he held such infant under his custody and control.\n The petitioner set out in substance that, by its charter, granted by the legislature of New York, it was authorized to receive and keep under its charge, custody, and control children of the age of two years or under, found in the city of New York, abandoned or deserted, and left in the crib or other receptacle of petitioner for foundlings, and to keep such children during infancy; that the child William Norton had come to it as a foundling within the terms of its charter; that the petitioner, on the 4th of October, 1901, to Cotober 2, 1904, had the care, charge, custody, and management of said child; that on or about the 1st of October, 1904, petitioner placed the child in the home of a certain person in the town of Clifton, county of Graham, territory of Arizona, to be held and cared for by the said person in said home temporarily, and at all times subject to the supervision of the petitioner and its officers and agents; that at such time the petitioner had officers and agents of trained experience at the town of Clifton, with instructions to supervise said child and the care and management of it while temporarily in the charge and care of the said person as aforesaid; that at all times the petitioner had the right at will to withdraw the child from the care and charge of the said person, and retain the custody thereof, and continue to keep the said child in pursuance of law under its care, charge, custody, and management during the term of its infancy, as aforesaid.\n Upon information and belief it charges that thereafter, and on or about the 2d day of October, 1904, one John C. Gatti, residing at the said town of Clifton, his servants and employees, unlawfully and with force and violence entered into the house of the said person, where, at the time of said unlawful entrance, the said child, William Norton, was, having been placed there as aforesaid and forcibly, unlawfully and without right, took possession of said William Norton, and removed him hence to \n\n[203 U.S. 429, 435]\n\u00a0\n the custody of the said John Gatti. That the said child has ever since said day been in the custody and under the control of the said Gatti, and that the said child is now restrained of its liberty by the said Gatti, without the consent or license of the petitioner, and against its desire, intention, and protest, and in violation of its rights under the laws of the state of New York, of the United States, and of the territory.\n The respondent made return and claimed to be entitled to the custody of the child named in the petition as the legally appointed guardian, duly qualified as such under letters of guardianship issued by the probate court of Graham county, Arizona. And further set forth in the return that the child in question is a white, Caucasian child; that the petitioner, on or about the 1st day of October, 1904, brought the said child to the territory of Arizona, and abandoned him to the keeping of a Mexican Indian, whose name is unknown to the respondent, but one financially unable to properly clothe, shelter, maintain, and educate said child, and, by reason of his race, mode of living, habits, and education, unfit to have the custody, care, and education of the child; that said person, to whom petitioner is alleged to have abandoned said child, voluntarily surrendered it to certain persons, who thereupon placed it in the care, custody, and control of respondent, who is a fit person for that purpose, and it will be to the best interest of the child that he be permitted to remain with the respondent, whose purpose and intention it is to rear, maintain, educate, and provide for said child as though he were his own.\n The petitioner traversed the return, and denied that the said minor was in the care, custody, and control of the respondent by virtue of letters of guardianship, and alleged that the said minor has been in the care, custody, and control of respondent Gatti by force and violence, and without authority of law or of any person legally authorized to place the child in the custody of the respondent.\n The case came to trial on the issues of fact raised in the petition, return, and traverse thereof by the petitioner, and \n\n[203 U.S. 429, 436]\n\u00a0\n the testimony having been heard in open court, a final order was mede, adjudging the said William Norton to be a minor of the age of two and one- half years, and that his best interests required that the said John C. Gatti have the care, custody, and control of said infant, who was thereupon remanded to the care, custody, and control of said respondent.\n In the view which we take of the jurisdiction of this court to entertain the appeal in this case, it is unnecessary to consider the elaborate findings of fact made in the supreme court of Arizona as the basis of its order, further than they bear upon the question of jurisdiction to entertain this appeal.\n It was found that the children were taken into the territory by the representatives of the foundling hospital, to remain there and be placed in suitable homes in Arizona; but, by imposition practised upon the agents of the society, the children were distributed among persons wholly unfit to be intrusted with them, being, with one or two exceptions, half-breed Mexican Indians of bad character. That thereupon a committee was appointed from the citizens resident of the vicinity, who visited the homes of the persons having possession of the children, stating to them that they had been appointed by the American residents to take possession of the children, who were then voluntarily surrendered by such persons. The children were taken charge of by certain good women, and afterwards the child William Norton was given to the respondent, who has since had his care, custody, tody, and control. This was done without the consent of the society or its agents. Afterwards letters of guardianship were issued to the respondent by the probate court of Graham county, Arizona. The petitioner took an appeal from the order granting the letters of guardianship to the district court of the county. Pending this appeal the petition for the writ of habeas corpus was filed.\n The court, acting upon the principle that the best interests of the infant are controlling, awarded the care and custody thereof to the respondent (79 Pac. 231) and the petitioner took an appeal to this court. \n\n[203 U.S. 429, 437]\n\u00a0\n The jurisdiction of the supreme court of the territory to issue the writ of habeas corpus is not called in question in this case.\n We are met at the threshold with an objection to the appellate jurisdiction of this court. The appeal in such cases is allowed under cover of  1909, Rev. Stat. Gonzales v. Cunningham, \n164 U.S. 612\n, 41 L. ed. 572, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 182. That section provides:\n'Sec. 1909. Writs of error and appeals from the final decisions of the supreme court of either of the territories of New Mexico, Utah, Colorado, Dakota, Arizona, Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming shall be allowed to the Supreme Court of the United States, in the same manner and under the same regulations as from the circuit courts of the United States, where the value of the property or the amount in controversy, to be ascertained by the oath of either party, or of other competent witnesses, exceeds one thousand dollars, except that a writ of error or appeal shall be allowed to the Supreme Court of the United States from the decision of the supreme courts created by this title, or of any judge thereof, or of the district courts created by this title, or of any judge thereof, upon writs of habeas corpus involving the question of personal freedom.'\n\n The question is, therefore, is this a writ of habeas corpus 'involving the question of personal freedom?' That this section of the statute does not permit appeals from all cases in which the writ is issued is manifest in the use of language in the act specifically limiting the right of review in this court to cases of writs which involve the question of personal freedom.\n A brief consideration of the history and nature of the writ will, we think, make manifest the purpose of Congress in using this restrictive language giving the right of appeal. The writ is usually granted in order to institute an investigation into the illegal imprisonment or wrongful detention of one alleging himself to be unlawfully restrained of his liberty.\n The jurisdiction is conferred to enable the cause of restraint \n\n[203 U.S. 429, 438]\n\u00a0\n to be inquired into, and the person imprisoned or wrongfully deprived of freedom restored to liberty.\n The subject was discussed by Mr. Justice Miller in the case of Re Burrus, \n136 U.S. 586\n, 34 L. ed. 500, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 850, in which it was held that a district court of the United States has no authority to issue a writ of habeas corpus to restore an infant to the custody of its father when unlawfully detained by its grandparents.\n Appended to that case, and printed by request of the members of the court, is an instructive opinion by Judge Betts, delivered in the case of Re Barry, United States circuit court for the southern district of New York, in which he reached the conclusion that a circuit court of the United States had no jurisdiction in habeas corpus to entertain a controversy as to the custody of a child when the father sought to compel the mother to deliver it to him,-a question not decided in Re Burrus. In the course of the discussion the learned judge points out the origin of the writ as a means of relief from arrest or forcible imprisonment, and its growth in later use as a means of determining the custody of children:\n'There is no reason to doubt that originally the common-law writ was granted solely in cases of arrest and forcible imprisonment under color or claim of warrant of law.\n\n'As late as 2 James II. the court expressly denied its allowance in a case of detention or restraint by a private person (Rex v. Drake, Comb. 35; 16 Vin. Abr. 213), and the habeas corpus act of Charles II., which is claimed as the Magna Charta of British liberty, has relation only to imprisonment on criminal charges (3 Bacon, Abr. 438, note).\n\n'It is not important to inquire at what period the writ first was employed to place infant children under the disposal of courts of law and equity. This was clearly so in England, anterior to our Revolution (Rex v. Smith, 2 Strange, 982; Rex v. Delaval, 3 Burr. 1434; Blissets's Case, Lofft. 748), and the practice has been fully confirmed in the continued assertion of the authority by those courts unto the present day (King v. De Manneville, 5 East, 221; De Manneville v. \n\n[203 U.S. 429, 439]\n\u00a0\n De Manneville, 10 Ves. Jr. 52; Ball v. Ball, 2 Sim. 35; Ex parte Skinner, 9 J. B. Moore, 278; King v. Greenhill, 4 Ad. & El. 624); and this indifferently, whether the interposition of the court is demanded by the father or mother (4 Ad. & El. 624, ubi supra; 9 J. B. Moore, 278, ubi supra.\n\n ... * *\n'The authority to take cognizance of the detention of infants by private persons, not held under claim or color or warrant of law, rests solely in England on the common law. It is one of the eminent prerogatives of the Crown, which implies in the monarch the guardianship of infants paramount to that of their natural parents. The royal prerogative, at first exercised personally ad libitum by the King (Kendall v. United States, 12 Pet. 630, 9 L. ed. 1223), and afterwards, for his relief, by special officers, as the Lord High Constable, the Lord High Admiral, and the Lord Chancellor, in process of time devolved upon the high courts of equity and law, and in them this exalted one, of allowing and enforcing the writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum, became vested as an elementary branch of their jurisdiction. In the performance, however, of this high function in respect to the detention of infants by parents, etc., the court or judge still acts with submission to the original principle, out of which it sprang, that infants ought to be left where found, or be taken from that custody and transferred to some other, at the discretion of the prerogative guardian, and according to its opinion of their best interest and safety.'\n\n It was in the exercise of this jurisdiction as parens patrioe that the present case was heard and determined. It is the settled doctrine that in such cases the court exercises a discretion in the interest of the child to determine what care and custody are best for it in view of its age and requirements. Such cases are not decided no the legal right of the petitioner to be relieved from unlawful imprisonment or detention, as in the case of an adult, but upon the court's view of the best interests of those whose welfare requires that they be in custody of one person or another. In such cases the question \n\n[203 U.S. 429, 440]\n\u00a0\n of personal freedom is not involved except in the sense of a determination as to which custodian shall have charge of one not entitled to be freed from restraint. As was said by Sharkey, Ch. J., in [Foster v. Alston] 6 How. (Miss.) 472:\n'An infant is not entitled to his freedom; an adult is. When a habeas corpus is granted to an adult, the object is to inquire whether he is legally restrained of his liberty; because if he is not, he must be set free, for the plain reason that by law he is entitled to his freedom. But if the court is also to set the infant free, they give him a right to which he is not entitled, and deprive the parent or guardian of a right to which he is entitled; to wit, the custody of the infant.'\n\n We think that such considerations as these induced Congress to limit the right of appeal to this court in habeas corpus cases. The discretionary power exercised in rendering the judgment, the ability of local tribunals to see and hear the witnesses and the rival claimants for custody of children, induced, in our opinion, the denial of appeal in such cases as the one at bar, as distinguished from those of a different character, where personal liberty is really involved, and release from illegal restraint-a high constitutional and legal right, not resting in the exercise of discretion-is sought, in which an appeal is given to this court.\n In the present case there was no attempt to illegally wrest the custody of the child from its lawful guardian while temporarily in the territory of Arizona. The society voluntarily took the child there with the intention that it should remain. Through imposition the child was placed in custody of those unfit to receive or maintain control over it, and, as above stated, came into the custody and possession of the respondent.\n The child was within the jurisdiction of the court under such circumstances that rival claimants of the right of custody might invoke the jurisdiction of a competent court of the territory to determine, not the right of personal freedom, but to which custodian a child of tender years should be committed. Woodworth v. Spring, 4 Allen, 321. \n\n[203 U.S. 429, 441]\n\u00a0\n We do not think that the case comes within the provisions of  1909, permitting an appeal to this court only in cases involving the question of personal freedom.\n The appeal will be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.\n Mr. Justice Brewer took no part in the decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","113":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNEW YORK, NEW HAVEN, & HARTFORD RAILROAD CO. v. INTERSTATE(1906)\nNo. 24\nArgued: Decided: February 19, 1906\n\n\n\n\n[200 U.S. 361, 362]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John W.

Long for the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway Company.\n\n\n[200 U.S. 361, 378]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorney General McReynolds and Mr. W. A. Day for the Interstate Commerce Commission.\n Messrs.\n\n\n[200 U.S. 361, 381]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice White, delivered the opinion of the court:\n Following an inquiry, begun in consequence of a complaint to it made, the Interstate Commerce Commission, through the Attorney General of the United States, filed under the act to further regulate commerce (32 Stat. at L. 847, chap. 708, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1905, p. 599), in the circuit court of the United States for the western district of Virginia, this proceeding against the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway Company, \n\n[200 U.S. 361, 382]\n\u00a0\n a Virginia corporation, and the New York, New Haven, & Hartford Railroad Company, a corporation, of the state of Connecticut. In this opinion we shall hereafter respectively speak of the parties as the Commission, the Chesapeake & Ohio, and the New Haven. The petition averred that the Chesapeake & Ohio was engaged in the carriage of coal as interstate traffic between the Kanawha district of West Virginia and Newport News, Virginia, for delivery thence to the New Haven, in Connecticut, and charged that the traffic was being moved at less than the published rates, and in such a way as to produce a discrimination in favor of the New Haven road and against others, all in violation of the act to regulate commerce and the amendments thereto. Specifying the grounds of the complaint, it was alleged that in the spring of 1903 the Chesapeake & Ohio made a verbal agreement with the New Haven to sell to that road 60,000 tons of coal, to be carried from the Kanawha district to Newport News, and thence by water to Connecticut, for delivery to the buyer at $2.75 per ton, and that a considerable portion had already been delivered and the remainder was in process of delivery. It was averred that the price of the coal at the mines where the Chesapeake & Ohio bought it and the cost of transportation from Newport News to Connecticut, would aggregate $2.47 per ton, thus leaving to the Chesapeake & Ohio only about 28 cents a ton for carrying the coal from the Kanawha district to Newport News, whilst the published tariff for like carriage from the same district was $1.45 per ton.\n Referring to the developments before the Commission, and annexing as part thereof the testimony taken on such hearing and the documents connected therewith, the petition further alleged that the Chesapeake & Ohio asserted that, although the total price which it received for the coal covered by the verbal agreement was less than the total outlay in delivering the coal, including its published rates, such fact did not amount to a departure from the published rates, and was not a discrimination, for two reasons: First. Because if such difference existed, \n\n[200 U.S. 361, 383]\n\u00a0\n it was a loss suffered by the Chesapeake & Ohio, not from taking less than its published rates, but because it had received less as seller than the coal had cost. Second. That even if it had not the lawful right thus to impute the payment of the price of the coal, the Chesapeake & Ohio had, in fact, received much more for the coal than the price in money agreed on, because, at the time the verbal agreement to sell was made, the New Haven had a claim exceeding $100,000 against the Chesapeake & Ohio, arising from a previous written contract to deliver coal, which was to be extinguished by the completion of the delivery of the coal, and this caused that price largely to exceed the cost of the coal to the Chesapeake & Ohio, including its published rates. Averring that the prior contract was in itself void because it also embodied an agreement to take less than the published rates, and was discriminating, it was charged that the New Haven had entered into both agreements with the Chesapeake & Ohio, knowing that they were in violation of the interstate commerce law. The prayer was that the Chesapeake & Ohio and the New Haven be made parties; that both roads be enjoined, the one from further executing the verbal agreement to deliver coal, and the other from seeking to enforce it; that the Chesapeake & Ohio be enjoined from 'accepting or receiving any rebate, concession, or discrimination in respect of the transportation of any property in interstate or foreign commerce carried by it,' and be, moreover, enjoined from 'doing anything whatever, whereby coal or any other property shall, by any device whatever, be transported . . . at a less rate than named in the tariffs published and filed by such carrier, as is required by the act to regulate commerce and acts amendatory thereof or supplementary thereto, or whereby any other advantage may be given or discrimination practised.' And that the New Haven road 'be enjoined and restrained from accepting or receiving any rabate, concession, or discrimination in respect of the transportation of any property in interstate or foreign commerce carried by it.' \n\n[200 U.S. 361, 384]\n\u00a0\n A preliminary restraining order was issued, conforming to the prayer of the petition. The Chesapeake & Ohio by its answer admitted that it had made, in the spring of 1903, a verbal agreement with the New Haven road for about 60,000 tons of Kanawha coal for the price alleged in the petition, to be transported by it to Newport News, and thence delivered by ocean transportation to the New Haven in Connecticut. It was admitted that the purchase price agreed to be paid was less than the market price of the coal, plus the published rates and the cost of transportation and delivery from Newport News to Connecticut, but it was averred that this was only apparently the case, because the contract to sell included the discharge of a debt of about $100,000, arising from the previous written contract to which the petition referred. The validity of both the previous written contract and the later verbal agreement was averred. The right of the Chesapeake & Ohio to buy and sell coal, and to impute any loss on the sale of the coal to itself as dealer instead of to itself as a carrier, was averred. Both the original contract and the one of 1903 were averred to have been made in good faith, not with any intention to avoid the published rates, and it was charged that, at about the time the original contract was made, arrangements had been made by the railroad for a rate of transportation from Newport News to Connecticut which would have caused the contract price to be adequate to pay the market price of the coal and all other charges, including the published rates, but that, subsequently thereto, the persons with whom this contract for transportation was made had violated their agreement, and that by strikes the price of coal had advanced, and thereby the loss of $100,000 to the Chesapeake & Ohio was occasioned.\n The New Haven road, in its answer, asserted its good faith in making both the original contract and the verbal agreement. It alleged that by the original contract it was a mere purchaser of coal from the Chesapeake & Ohio, and not a shipper over that road; that the coal bought was intended for its own use \n\n[200 U.S. 361, 385]\n\u00a0\n in the operation of its railroad; that it had no knowledge of the price which the Chesapeake & Ohio would be obliged to pay for the coal, or the sum which it would cost that road to deliver it, and therefore had no knowledge that the total cost would not equal the market price of the coal, the cost of delivery, and the published rate of the Chesapeake & Ohio. It averred the validity of the agreement, the legality of the debt of $100, 000 which resulted from it, and charged that, taking that debt into consideration, the sum which it paid the Chesapeake & Ohio for the coal under the 1903 verbal agreement largely exceeded the market price and the cost of delivery, including the published rates of the Chesapeake & Ohio. It denied that there was any departure from the published rates or any discrimination, asserted that at the time the original contract was made the price was sufficient to have enabled the Chesapeake & Ohio to perform the contract without losing anything either as a seller or as a carrier, and that if, in execution of the contract, a condition arose where a loss was suffered by the Chesapeake & Ohio in either capacity, it was caused by subsequent events which could not affect the validity of the contract when made, and especially denied that in any way, directly or indirectly, had it knowingly lent itself to any discrimination, or any taking by the Chesapeake & Ohio of less than its published rates.\n The case was heard on the testimony taken in the proceeding before the Commission and the documents forming a part of the same, and upon further documents and testimony stipulated by counsel.\n For reasons to which we shall hereafter have occasion to advert, the court held that, considering both the original contract and the verbal agreement of 1903, there was no violation of the provisions of the 2d and 6th sections of the act to regulate commerce, forbidding the taking of less than the published rates. [24 Stat. at L. 379, chap. 104, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3154.] It, however, held that the contracts amounted to an undue discrimination and a violation of the 3d section of the act. The court, hence, permanently enjoined the Ches- \n\n[200 U.S. 361, 386]\n\u00a0\n apeake & Ohio from discharging any obligation arising from the original contract of 1896, and from further executing or attempting to execute, in any manner whatever, directly or indirectly, the verbal agreement of 1903, and it permanently enjoined the New Haven from asserting or attempting to enforce any claim arising from the contract of 1896, or in any manner, directly or indirectly, attempting to enforce the verbal agreement of 1903. Thereafter the court denied a request made by the Commission, that the injunction be expanded so as, in general terms, to command the Chesapeake & Ohio perpetually to observe in the future its published rates.\n The New Haven appealed. The Commission also prosecuted a cross appeal because of the refusal of the court to grant its prayer to make the injunction against the Chesapeake & Ohio general in its nature, and that company, in an elaborate and separate printed argument in its own behalf, assails the judgment below on the merits, and in effect asks its reversal on the merits.\n It is apparent from the case as thus stated that, in order to decide the issues which arise, we may not confine our attention to the verbal agreement of 1903, the execution of which it was the immediate object of the proceeding to enjoin, but must consider the prior contract of 1896, since primarily the rights, if any, which arose under the verbal agreement, are inextricably involved in and dependent upon the contract of 1896. In other words, the controversy, as considered by the Commission on the inquiry by it conducted, and as decided below, and as here presented, involves an analysis of all the dealings under both contracts, and the legal rights, if any, which arose from them. We must, therefore, consider the subject in this aspect, and to do so we state at once the facts which are admitted or which are undisputably established, reserving such questions of fact as are in dispute for separate consideration when we approach the legal propositions which arise from the undisputed facts.\n The Chesapeake & Ohio, chartered by the state of Virginia, \n\n[200 U.S. 361, 387]\n\u00a0\n operates a road which reaches both the New River and the Kanawha coal fields of West Virginia, and extends to Newport News. The New Haven, chartered by the state of Connecticut, operates a road principally situated in New England. On December 3, 1896, these two roads entered into a written contract, the one to sell and the other to buy, between July 1, 1897, and July 1, 1902, not to exceed 2,000,000 gross tons of bituminous coal, to be taken from the line of the Chesapeake & Ohio road; deliveries to be made not exceeding 400,000 tons per annum. The price agreed upon was $ 2.75 per gross ton, New Haven basis, settlement to be made monthly. The coal was to be delivered by the seller on the line of the New Haven. The contract is reproduced in the margin. \n The Chesapeake & Ohio, not in its own name, but through others who really, although not ostensibly, acted for it, made a contract with operators in the New River district of West Virginia, for the delivery to it of the coal to fulfil the contract which had been made with the New Haven. In consequence \n Contract Made between the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway Company and the New York, New Haven, & Hartford Railroad Company.\n Said Chesapeake & Ohio Railway Company, for the consideration hereinafter mentioned, hereby agrees to furnish to said railroad company not to exceed 2,000,000 gross tons of bituminous coal from its line in such quantities monthly as wanted from July 1, 1897, to July 1, 1902, without charge for demurrage. Deliveries to be made not exceeding 400,000 tons per annum.\n And said Chesapeake & Ohio Railway Company further agrees that all said bituminous coal shall be of the best quality, first-class in every respect, and satisfactory to said railroad company, and said railway company has the right to terminate this contract at any time if said bituminous coal be of poor quality, or if its delivery be unnecessarily delayed.\n And said Chesapeake & Ohio Railway Company further agrees to deliver all said bituminous coal to said railroad company in its bins at such ports upon its lines as required by the monthly requisitions of its purchasing agent.\n In consideration of the faithful performance by the said Chesapeake & Ohio Railway Company of all its agreements herein contained, said railroad company agrees to pay for said bituminous coal at the rate of two and seventy-five one-hundreths dollars per gross ton. New Haven basis, settlement to be made monthly.\n Said railway company has the right to cancel any and all portions of said quantity of bituminous coal remaining undelivered on July 1, 1902\n\n\n Witness the names of the parties hereto this, the 3d day of December, 1896.\n Chesapeake & Ohio Railway Company, By M. E. Ingalls, President. The New York, New Haven, & Hartford Railroad Company, By C. E. Mellen, Second Vice President. For value received, I hereby guarantee that the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway Company shall not fail to deliver coal on account of strikes. J. Pierpont Morgan. \n\n[200 U.S. 361, 388]\n\u00a0\n of failure of some of the operators to perform their part of the contract, changes were made at various times, which it is unnecessary to note. Deliveries of the coal were made to the New Haven as required up to the winter of 1900-1901, when, because of strikes and other difficulties, delivery ceased, and the New Haven bought coal in the open market and presented to the Chesapeake & Ohio a bill for the increased price which it had paid, and the Chesapeake & Ohio paid $160,000 to cover such loss. Subsequently, in 1902, further strikes supervened and deliveries again ceased, at a time when about 60,000 tons remained yet to be delivered. The New Haven again presented a bill for damages amounting to $103,000. Thereupon the verbal agreement of 1903 was made, by which it was provided that the shortage of 60,000 tons upon the original contract might be discharged by delivery on the part of the Chesapeake & Ohio of that amount of coal from the Kanawha district at the contract price of $2.75, and when this delivery was consummated it was agreed that the Chesapeake & Ohio would be absolutely relieved from the payment of the damage claim just referred to.\n At the time this verbal agreement was made the contract price was, leaving out of view the claim for damages, inadequate to pay the market price, as admitted by the pleadings, of the coal plus the published rates of the Chesapeake & Ohio to Newport News, and the charges thence to the point of delivery. To put itself in a position to carry out the agreement, \n\n[200 U.S. 361, 389]\n\u00a0\n an individual who represented the Chesapeake & Ohio made contracts in his own name with the operators in the Kanawha district to furnish the disired coal. Without stopping to state the particular methods of accounting by which the result was accomplished, it is indisputable that the Chesapeake & Ohio bore the loss arising from the difference between the contract price, the price of the coal at the mines, the published rate to Newport News, and the cost of transporting thence to the point of delivery.\n Undoubtedly long prior to the making of the first contract the Chesapeake & Ohio, besides its business as a carrier, bought and sold coal. This business was carried on by the company from about 1874 up to the time of the making of the contract of 1896, as testified by the president who made that contract, as follows:\n'The coal was handled by a separate and distinct department of the railway company, the mine operators delivering for an agreed price at the mines to the coal agent of the railway company all coal mined by them, the net result realized from the selling price of the coal representing the freight earned by the railway company.'\n\n And the same official testified that he made the contract of 1896 as a continuation of this system.\n In 1895, however, the state of West Virginia passed 'An Act to Prevent Railroad Companies from Buying or Selling Coal or Coke and to Prevent Discrimination.' The 1st section of this act made it unlawful for any railroad corporation to engage directly or indirectly in the business of buying and selling coal or coke. In consequence of this act, prior to the making of the contract of 1896, the coal department of the railroad was abolished. And it was the existence of the West Virginia statute which caused the Chesapeake & Ohio, when it contracted with operators in West Virginia to procure as to both contracts the coal for delivery to the New Haven, to do so not in its own name, but through another.\n Before applying to these undisputed facts the legal question \n\n[200 U.S. 361, 390]\n\u00a0\n arising for decision, we must determine a question of fact as to which there is some dispute; that is, was the price at which the Chesapeake & Ohio contracted in 1896 to sell the coal to the New Haven sufficient to pay the cost of the coal at the mines, as well as the expense of delivery, including the published freight rate? Without stopping to go into the evidence, we content ourselves with saying that we think the court below correctly held that the price was not adequate to accomplish these purposes, and that from the inception of delivery under the contract, and during the whole period thereof, except for a brief time, caused by a lowering of the freight rates, the contract price was inadequate to net the railroad its proper legal tariff.\n We are brought, then, to determine whether the contract made in 1896 for the 2,000,000 tons of coal was void because in conflict with the act to regulate commerce and its amendments. In approaching the consideration of the act to regulate commerce, we, for the moment, put out of view the provisions of the West Virginia statute, and its influence upon the validity of the contract made in West Virginia for the purpose of acquiring the coal which the Chesapeake & Ohio had obligated itself to deliver. We shall also assume, for the purpose of the inquiry, that the Chesapeake & Ohio, although not expressly authorized, was not prohibited by its Virginia charter from buying and selling and transporting the coal in which it dealt. The case, therefore, will be considered solely in the light of the operation and effect of the provisions of the act to regulate commerce, and we shall not direct our attention to expressly determining whether the assertion by a carrier of a right to deal in the products which it transports would not be so repugnant to the general duty resting on the carrier as to cause the exertion of the power to deal in the products which it transports to be unlawful, irrespective of statutory restrictions.\n The question, therefore, to be decided is this: Has a carrier engaged in interstate commerce the power to contract to sell and transport in completion of the contract the commodity \n\n[200 U.S. 361, 391]\n\u00a0\n sold, when the price stipulated in the contract does not pay the cost of purchase, the cost of delivery, and the published freight rates?\n The previous decisions of this court concerning the interstate commerce act do not afford much aid in determining this question. This is the case, because, although that act was adopted in 1887, and questions concerning the import of the act have been often here, such questions have not generally involved the operation and effect of the act concerning the command that published rates be adhered to, and the prohibitions, against discrimination, favoritism, or rebates, but have mainly concerned the meaning of the act in other respects; that is, involved deciding whether powers asserted as to other subjects were vested by the act in the Interstate Commerce Commission.\n There are several leading cases decided by the Commission, which are relied upon by the two railroads, directly relating to the question we have stated, but, as we shall have occasion hereafter to weigh their import, we shall not now pause to analyze and apply them.\n It cannot be challenged that the great purpose of the act to regulate commerce, whilst seeking to prevent unjust and unreasonable rates, was to secure equality of rates as to all, and to destroy favoritism, these last being accomplished by requiring the publication of tariffs, and by prohibiting secret departures from such tariffs, and forbidding rebates, preferences, and all other forms of undue discrimination. To this extent and for these purposes the statute was remedial and is, therefore, entitled to receive that interpretation which reasonably accomplishes the great public purpose which it was enacted to subserve. That a carrier engaged in interstate commerce becomes subject as to such commerce to the commands of the statute, and may not set its provisions at naught whatever otherwise may be its power when carrying on commerce not interstate in character, cannot in reason be denied. Now, in view of the positive command of the 2d section of the act, that no departure from the published rate shall be made, 'd- \n\n[200 U.S. 361, 392]\n\u00a0\n irectly or indirectly,' how can it in reason be held that a carrier may take itself from out the statute in every case by simply electing to be a dealer and transport a commodity in that character? For, of course, if a carrier has a right to disregard the published rates by resorting to a particular form of dealing, it must follow that there is no obligation on the part of a carrier to adhere to the rates, because doing so is merely voluntary. The all-embracing prohibition against either directly or indirectly charging less than the published rates shows that the purpose of the statute was to make the prohibition applicable to every method of dealing by a carrier by which the forbidden result could be brought about. If the public purpose which the statute was intended to accomplish he borne in mind, its meaning becomes, if possible, clearer. What was that purpose? It was to compel the carrier, as a public agent, to give equal treatment to all. Now if, by the mere fact of purchasing and selling merchandise to be transported, a carrier is endowed with the power of disregarding the published rate, it becomes apparent that the carrier possesses the right to treat the owners of like commodities by entirely different rules. That is to say, the existence of such a power in its essence would enable a carrier, if it chose to do so, to select the favored persons from whom he would buy, and the favored persons to whom he would sell, thus giving such persons an advantage over every other, and leading to a monopolization in the hands of such persons of all the products as to which the carrier chose to deal. Indeed, the inevitable result of the possession of such a right by a carrier would be to enable it, if it chose to exercise the power, to concentrate in its own hands the products which were held for shipment along its line, and to make it, therefore, the sole purchaser thereof and the sole seller at the place where the products were to be marketed; in other words, to create an absolute monopoly. To illustrate: If a carrier may, by becoming a dealer, buy property for transportation to a market and eliminate the cost of transportation to such market, a faculty possessed by no other owner of the commodity, it must \n\n[200 U.S. 361, 393]\n\u00a0\n result that the carrier would be in a position where no other person could ship the commodity on equal terms with the carrier in its capacity of dealer. No other person owning the commodity being thus able to ship on equal terms, it would result that the owners of such commodity would not be able to ship, but would be compelled to sell to the carrier. And as, by the departure from the tariff rates, the person to whom the carrier might elect to sell would be able to buy at a price less than any other person could sell for, it would follow that such person, so selected by the carrier, would have a monoply in the market to which the goods were transported. And that the result arising from an admission of the asserted power of the carrier as a dealer to disregard the published rates conduces immediately, and not merely remotely, to the production of the injurious results stated, is not only demonstrated by the very nature of things, but is established to be the case by the facts indisputably shown on this record. For here it is unquestioned that the Chesapeake & Ohio, as a result of its being a dealer, had become, long prior to the adoption of the interstate commerce law, and continued to be thereafter, up to the passage of the West Virginia statute prohibiting a carrier from dealing in coal, virtually the sole purchaser and seller of all the coal produced along the line of its road. That this result was not merely accidental, but was in effect engendered by the power of the carrier to deal and transport a commodity, is illustrated by the case of Atty. Gen. v. Great Northern R. Co. 29 L. J. Ch. N. S. 794. In that case Vice Chancellor Kindersley was called upon to determine whether dealing in coal by the railway company was illegal, because incompatible with its duties as a public carrier and calculated to inflict an injury upon the public. In deciding that the act of Parliament granting the charter to operate the railway implied a prohibition against the company's engaging in any other business, the reason for the rule was thus expressed (p. 798):\n'These large companies, joint-stock companies gen- \n\n[200 U.S. 361, 394]\n\u00a0\n erally, for whatever purpose established, and more particularly railway companies, are armed with powers of raising and possessing large sums of money,-large amounts of property,-and if they were to apply that money, or that property, to purposes other than those for which they were constituted, they might very much injure the interests of the public in various ways.'\n\n Illustrating the danger to the public, as established by the case before him, the Vice Chancellor said (p. 799):\n'Here we find this company, having the traffic from the north of England, where the great coal fields are (at least, some of the principal coal fields), supplying the country with coal, or capable of supplying it; this company buys the coal, which gives to the company an interest in checking, as much as possible, those who will not deal with them; and it is quite clear that it is possible, by the mode in which this company may ( I will not say has)-but by the mode in which this company may exercise such powers as either it has or assumes to have-this company may get into their hands the traffic; that is, the dealing in all the coal in the large districts supplying coal to the country. They have, to a considerable extent, done so, and there is no reason why it should not go on progressing. I observe that in the eight [?] years from 1852 to 1857, inclusive, the amount of their coal business has increased from 73,000 tons to 794,000 tons; and there is no reason, as the affidavits show, why they should not-there is great danger that they may-get into their hands the entire business in the coal of all that district of country. If they can do that with regard to coal, what is to prevent their doing it with regard to every species of agricultural produce all along the line? Why should they not become purchasers of corn, of all kinds of beasts, and of sheep, and every species of agricultural produce, and become great dealers in the supply of edibles to the markets of London and why not every other species of commodity that is produced in every part of the country from which or to which their railway runs? I do not know where it is to stop, if the argument on the part of the company is to prevail. There is, therefore, \n\n[200 U.S. 361, 395]\n\u00a0\n great detriment to the interests of the public, for this reason, taking merely the article of coal.'\n\n It is apparent that the construction of the statute which is now claimed by the carriers would, if adopted, not only destroy its entire remedial efficacy, but would cause the provisions of the statute to accentuate and multiply the very wrongs which it was enacted to prevent.\n Without a statutory requirement as to publication of rates and the imposition of a duty to adhere to the rates as published, individual action of the shippers, as between themselves and in their dealings with the carrier, would have full play, and thereby every shipper would have the opportunity to procure such concessions as might result from favoritism or other causes. Interpreting the prohibitions of the statute as it is contended they should be, it would follow that every individual would be bound by the published tariff, and the carrier along would be free to disregard it. Thus the statute, whilst subjecting the public to the prohibitions, would exempt the carrier, and would thereby enormously increase the opportunities of the latter to do the wrongs which the statute was enacted to prevent.\n And the considerations previously stated serve also to demonstrate that the prohibitions of the act to regulate commerce concerning 'undue or unreasonable preference or advantage,' 'undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage,' and unjust discrimination,' are in conflict with the asserted right of a carrier to become a dealer in commodities which it transports, and, as such dealer, to sell at a price less than the cost and the published rates. Certain also is it, when the reasons previously stated are applied to those prohibitions of the statute, the possession of the power by a carrier to deal in merchandise and to sell and transport at less than published rates would not only destroy the remedy intended to be afforded by the provisions in question, but would cause the statute to fructify the growth of the wrongs which it was intended to extirpate. In a general sense the considerations which we have previously stated, moreover, dispose of all the contentions \n\n[200 U.S. 361, 396]\n\u00a0\n urged at bar to establish the right of the carrier to become a dealer under the circumstances stated. Even although it may give rise to some repetition, we more particularly notice the various contentions.\n\n\n (a)\n It is said that when a carrier sells an article which it has purchased and transports that article for delivery, it is both a dealer and a carrier. When, therefore, the price received for the commodity is adequate to pay the published freight rate and something over, the command of the statute as to adherence to the published rates is complied with, because the price will be imputed to the freight rate, and the loss, if any, attributed to the company in its capacity as dealer, and not as a carrier. This simply asserts the proposition which we have disposed of, that a carrier possesses the power, by the form in which he deals, to render the prohibitions of the act ineffective, since it implies the right of a carrier to shut off inquiry as to the real result of a particular transaction on the published rates, and thereby to obtain the power of disregarding the prohibitions of the statute.\n\n\n (b)\n It is said that, as in the case in hand, it is shown that there was no intention on the part of the carrier in making the sale of the coal to violate the prohibitions of the statute, and, on the contrary, as the proofs shows an arrangement made by the carrier for transporting the coal from Newport News to Connecticut, which, if it had been carried out, would have provided for the full published rate, therefore an honest contract made by the carrier should not be stricken down because of things over which the carrier had no control. The proposition involves both an unfounded assumption of fact and an unwarranted implication of law. It is true the court below found that the proof did not justify the inference that the Chesapeake & Ohio had, in 1896, made the contract to sell the coal to the New Haven with the purpose of avoiding a compliance with the published rates. But in this conclusion of fact we cannot agree. Whilst it may be that the proof establishes that the contract for the sale of coal was not made as a mere device \n\n[200 U.S. 361, 397]\n\u00a0\n for avoiding the operation of the statute, we think the proof leaves no doubt that, in making the contract in question, the Chesapeake & Ohio was wholly indifferent to and did not concern itself with, the prohibitions of the statute, of which, of course, it must be assumed to have had full knowledge. As we have seen, the president of the Chesapeake & Ohio, by whom the corporation was represented in making the contract, expressly testified that from the beginning that corporation had pursued the policy of acquiring all the coal mined on its line, and sold it, relying upon the net result of such sales for its freight compensation, and that the particular contract was made in continuation of that policy. We find it impossible to conclude, from the proof, that the Chesapeake & Ohio could have made a contract for so large an amount of coal, to be delivered over so long a period, without taking into view the existing prices and the cost necessarily to be occasioned by the delivery of the coal, if the full published freight rates were to be realized. Indeed, the proof leaves no doubt upon our minds that, in making the contract, the Chesapeake & Ohio sought to accomplish results which it deemed beneficial by means which it considered effectual, even although resort to such means was prohibited by the interstate commerce act. In other words, we think it is established beyond doubt that, desiring to stimulate the production of coal along its line, and thereby, as it conceived, to increase the carriage of that commodity, and to benefit the railroad and those living along its line by the reflex prosperity which it was deemed would arise from giving a stimulus to an industry tributary to the railroad, the Chesapeake & Ohio bought and sold the coal without reference to whether the net result to it would realize its published rates. And it would seem that this means of stimulating the industry in question was resorted to instead of attempting to bring about the same result by a lowering of the published rates, because to have so done would have engendered disparity between coal rates and the tariff on all the other articles contained in the same classification, and would \n\n[200 U.S. 361, 398]\n\u00a0\n besides have caused other and competing roads to make a similar reduction on the published rates, and thereby would have frustrated the very advantage to itself and those along its lines which the Chesapeake & Ohio deemed it was bringing about by the method pursued. That is to say, we think it is shown that the mode of dealing adopted was simply the result of a disregard by the Chesapeake & Ohio of the economic conceptions upon which the interstate commerce law rests, and a substitution in their stead of the conceptions of the Chesapeake & Ohio as to what was best for itself and for the public. Further, as the prohibition of the interstate commerce act is ever operative, even if the facts established that at the particular time the contract was made, considering the then cost of coal and other proper items, the net published tariff of rates would have been realized by the Chesapeake & Ohio from the contract, which is not the case, it is apparent that the deliveries under the contract came under the prohibition of the statute whenever, for any cause, such as the enhanced cost of the coal at the mines, an increase in the cost of the ocean carriage, etc., the gross sum realized was not sufficient to net the Chesapeake & Ohio its published tariff of rates. This must be the case in order to give vitality to the prohibitions of the interstate commerce act against the acceptance at any time by a carrier of less than its published rates. We say this because we think it obvious that such prohibitions would be rendered wholly ineffective by deciding that a carrier may avoid those prohibitions by making a contract for the sale of a commodity stipulating, for the payment of a fixed price in the future, and thereby acquiring the power during the life of the contract to continue to execute it, although a violation of the act to regulate commerce might arise from doing so. Besides, all the contentions just noticed proceed upon the mistaken legal conception that the application of the statutory prohibitions depends not upon whether the effect of the acts done is to violate those prohibitions, but upon whether the carrier intended to violate the statute. \n\n[200 U.S. 361, 399]\n\u00a0\n (c) It is urged that if the requirement of the act to regulate commerce as to the maintenance of published rates and the prohibitions of that act against undue preferences and discriminations be applied to a carrier when engaged in buying the selling a commodity which it transports, the substantial effect will be to prohibit the carrier from becoming a dealer when no such prohibition is expressed in the act to regulate commerce, and hence a prohibition will be implied which should only result from express action by Congress. Granting the premise, the deduction is unfounded. Because no express prohibition against a carrier who engages in interstate commerce becoming a dealer in commodities moving in such commerce is found in the act, it does not follow that the provisions which are expressed in that act should not be applied and be given their lawful effect. Even, therefore, if the result of applying the prohibitions as we have interpreted them will be practically to render it difficult, if not impossible, for a carrier to deal in commodities, this affords no ground for relieving us of the plain duty of enforcing the provisions of the statute as they exist. This conclusion follows, since the power of Congress to subject every carrier engaging in interstate commerce to the regulations which it has adopted is undoubted.\n But it is in effect said, conceding this to be true as an original question, the prohibitions of the act ought not now to be interpreted as applying to a carrier who is a dealer in commodities, because of an administrative construction long since given to the act by the interstate commerce commission, the body primarily charged with its enforcement, and which has become a rule of property, affecting vast interests, which should not be judicially departed from, especially as such construction, it is asserted, has been impliedly sanctioned by Congress by frequently amending the act without changing it in this particular.\n Passing, for the present, the legal conclusion, let us first ascertain whether the premise itself is well founded. The two rulings of the Interstate Commerce Commission upon which \n\n[200 U.S. 361, 400]\n\u00a0\n the premise is based are Haddock v. Delaware, L. & W. R. Co. 4 I. C. C. Rep. 296, 3 Inters. Com. Rep. 302, and Coxe Bros. v. Lehigh Valley R. Co. 4 I. C. C. Rep. 535, 3 Inters. Com. Rep. 460, decided respectively in 1890 and 1891.\n Without going into detail, we content ourselves with saying that in both of the cases complaints were made to the Interstate Commerce Commission concerning the defendant railroads, and it was charged that whilst acting as common carriers they were dealing in coal, and as a result violating the prohibitions of the interstate commerce act as to rates and undue preferences and discriminations. It was shown in both cases that the carriers, prior to the adoption of the interstate commerce act, were authorized by their charters or legislative authority to carry on both the business of mining and selling the coal so mined, and transporting the same to market. Indeed, it was found in both cases that the functions of producing and transporting, as authorized, were so interblended that it was impossible to separate one from the other. Whilst it is true that in both of the cases it was also shown that the carriers bought, sold, and transported some coal which was not produced in the mines which they owned, this fact was evidently treated, in view of the other circumstances of the case, as of minor importance, since the commingled powers of producing, selling, and transporting were alone made the basis of the conclusion reached by the Commission as to the character of relief which could be afforded. Solely in view of the lawful power of the carriers to mine, sell, and transport, existing before the passage of the act to regulate commerce, the Commission decided that its authority, under that statute and under the circumstances of the case, was confined to compelling the exaction of rates which were just and reasonable. The fact that the rulings in the two cases just referred to were solely placed upon the peculiar powers of the defendant corporations possessed by them prior to the passage of the interstate commerce act was pointed out by the Commission in Re Alleged Unlawful Rates, 7 I. C. C. Rep. 33. In that case, in de- \n\n[200 U.S. 361, 401]\n\u00a0\n ciding that the defendant carrier was without power to purchase grain for the purpose of securing the right to transport it, and thus evade the law which would have applied to its transportation had it been owned by any other party, the Commission, in distinguishing the case before it from the Haddock and Coxe Bros. Cases, said (p. 38):\n'Those cases are in no respect similar to this. In both the common carrier was also the owner of extensive coal fields, and indeed it had become a common carrier largely for the purpose of transporting the product of those mines to market. This state of things existed before the passage of the act, and had no reference to the act. Unless the carrier was permitted to transport its coal, the result would be in effect the confiscation of its property; and to order it to charge itself with a particular rate would merely result in a matter of bookkeeping. Under these circumstances it was held that the only remedy was to inquire whether the rate charged the complainant was a reasonable one.'\n\n Now, without at all intimating that, as an original question, we would concur in the view expressed in the case last cited, that to have applied the act to regulate commerce, under proper rules and regulations for the segregation of the business of producing, selling, and transporting, as presented in the Haddock and Coxe Bros. Cases would have been confiscatory, and without reviewing the rulings made by the Interstate Commerce Cmmission in those cases, and adhered to by that body during the many years which have followed those decisions, we concede that the interpretation given by the Commission in those cases to the act to regulate commerce is now binding, and, as restricted to the precise conditions which were passed on in the cases referred to, must be applied to all strictly identical cases in the future; at least, until Congress has legislated on the subject. We make this concession because we think we are constrained to so do, in consequence of the familiar rule that a construction made by the body charged with the enforcement of a statute, which construction has long obtained in practical \n\n[200 U.S. 361, 402]\n\u00a0\n execution, and has been impliedly sanctioned by the reenactment of the statute without alteration in the particulars construed, when not plainly erroneous, must be treated as read into the statute. Especially do we think this rule applicable to the case in hand, because of the nature and extent of the authority conferred on the Commission from the beginning concerning the prohibitions of the act as to rebates, favoritism, and discrimination of all kinds, and particularly in view of the repeated declarations of the court that an exertion of power by the Commission concerning such matters was entitled to great weight, and was not lightly to be interfered with. The concessions thus made, however, are wholly irrelevant to the case before us. This follows since the Chesapeake & Ohio was, neither by its charter nor by legislative grant existing at the time of the adoption of the act to regulate commerce, possessed of the commingled attributes of carrier and producer, which was the controlling consideration in the decisions made in the Haddock and Coxe Bros. Cases.\n Concluding, therefore, that both the contracts made by the Chesapeake & Ohio with the New Haven were contrary to public policy, and void because in conflict with the prohibitions of the act to regulate commerce, it obviously follows that such contracts were not susceptible of being enforced by the New Haven, and afforded no legal basis for a claim of the New Haven against the Chesapeake & Ohio, and therefore the court below was correct in so deciding.\n This leaves only for consideration the question raised by the cross appeal of the Interstate Commerce Commission. That proposition is thus stated in the first of the assignments of error filed on behalf of the Commission:\n'That the circuit court of the United States for the western district of Virginia, after finding that the claim of the New York, New Haven, & Hartford Railroad Company against the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway Company for $103,910.69, asserted as damages arising from a partial nonperformance by said railway company of a contract of December 3, 1896, set \n\n[200 U.S. 361, 403]\n\u00a0\n out in the record, is, as to the whole of said claim and interest thereon, an illegal and unenforceable claim, and after finding that the verbal agreement between said companies, made in April, 1903, and set out in said record, whereby said railway company undertook to furnish to said railroad company 59,966 tons of coal, to be transported from West Virginia to Newport News, Virginia, over the lines of said railway company, and thence transported by vessels to certain New England ports, said coal to be delivered at said ports at the price of $2.75 per ton, New Haven basis, to be an invalid and illegal agreement; that said court merely enjoined and restrained the said Chesapeake & Ohio Railway Company, its officers, agents, and employees from, in any manner, direct or indirect, executing or performing, or attempting to execute or perform, either said contract of December 3, 1896, or said agreement of April, 1903, and from in any manner discharging or satisfying any obligation or seeming obligation arising from said agreements or either of them, or arising from any arrangement or agreement made in lieu of said agreements, or either of them; whereas said court should have further enjoined and restrained the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway Company from giving to said railroad company, or to any other person, firm, or company, any undue or unreasonable advantage or preference, and should further have restrained and enjoined the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway Company from transporting coal from one state to or through any other state for the New York, New Haven, & Hartford Railroad Company, or for any firm, person, or company, at a less rate than the duly established freight rate of the said railway company in force at the time, and from further failing to observe its published tariffs, or from giving to the said New York, New Haven, & Hartford Railroad Company, or to any person, firm, or company, in any manner whatsoever, any undue or unresonable preference or advantage; and said decree, entered by the court on the 19th day of February, 1904, in addition to the provisions thereof, should have enjoined and restrained the New York, New Haven, & Hart- \n\n[200 U.S. 361, 404]\n\u00a0\n ford Railroad Company and its officers and agents from seeking or accepting, in any manner, any direct or indirect rebate of the duly established freight rates of the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway Company on any interstate commerce, and from seeking or accepting in any manner from said railway company any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage.'\n\n The contention, therefore, is that, whenever a carrier has been adjudged to have violated the act to regulate commerce in any particular, it is the duty of the court, not only to enjoin the carrier from further like violations of the act, but to command it in general terms not to violate the act in the future in any particular. In other words, the proposition is that, by the effect of a judgment against a carrier concerning a specific violation of the act, the carrier ceases to be under the protection of the law of the land, and must thereafter conduct all its business under the jeopardy of punishment for contempt for violating a general injunction. To state the proposition is, we think, to answer it. Swift & Co. v. United States, \n196 U.S. 375\n, 49 L. ed. 518, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 276. The contention that the cited case is inapposite because it did not concern the act to regulate commerce, but involved a violation of the antitrust act, we think is also answered by the mere statement of the proposition. The requirement of the act to regulate commerce, that a court shall enforce an observance of the statute against a carrier who has been adjudged to have violated its provisions, in no way gives countenance to the assumption that Congress intended that a court should issue an injunction of such a general character as would be violative of the most elementary principles of justice. The injunction which was granted in the case of Re Debs, \n158 U.S. 564\n, 39 L. ed. 1092, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 900, was not open to such an objection, as its terms were no broader than the conspiracy which it was the purpose of the proceeding to restrain. To accede to the doctrine relied upon would compel us, under the guise of protecting freedom of commerce, to announce a rule which would be destructive of the fundamental liberties of the citizen.\n As the court below did not decide that the 2d and 6th \n\n[200 U.S. 361, 405]\n\u00a0\n sections of the act, relating to the maintenance of rates, had been violated, the injunction by it issued was not made as directly responsive to the commands of the statute on that subject as we think it should have been. We, therefore, conclude that the injunction below should be modified and enlarged by perpetually enjoining the Chesapeake & Ohio from taking less than the rates fixed in its published tariff of freight rates, by means of dealing in the purchase and sale of coal. And, as thus modified, the decree below is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","114":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNORTHERN ASSUR CO. v. GRAND VIEW BLDG ASS'N(1906)\nNo. 40\nArgued: Decided: November 5, 1906\n\n\n\n Messrs.\nCharles J. Greene and Ralph W. Breckenridge for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs.\n Joseph R. Webster, Halleck F. Rose, and Wilmer B. Comstock for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a bill to reform a policy and to recover upon it as reformed. An action at law upon the same instrument, between the same parties, has come before this court heretofore. \n183 U.S. 308\n, 46 L. ed. 213, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 133. In that case it was held that the plaintiff could not recover. The question before us at the present time is whether the supreme court of Nebraska failed to give full faith and credit to the judgment in the former case by holding that it was no bar to the relief now sought. ( Neb.) 102 N. W. 246.\n The policy was conditioned to be void in case of other \n\n[203 U.S. 106, 107]\n\u00a0\n insurance, unless otherwise provided by agreement indorsed or added; and it stated, in substance, that no officer or agent had power to waive the condition except by such indorsement or addition. There was other insurance and there was no indorsement. The plaintiff alleged a waiver and an estoppel. The jury found that the agent who issued the policy had been informed on behalf of the insured and knew of the outstanding insurance. But this court held that the attempt to establish a waiver was an attempt to contradict the very words of the written contract, which gave notice that the condition was insisted upon and could be got rid of in only one way, which no agent had power to change. The judgment based upon this decision is what is now relied upon as a bar. Metcalf v. Watertown, \n153 \nU.S. 671, 676\n, 38 S. L. ed. 861, 863, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 947; Hancock Nat. Bank v. Farnum, \n176 \nU.S. 640, 645\n, 44 S. L. ed. 619, 621, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 506.\n Whether sufficient grounds were shown for the relief which was granted is a matter with which we have nothing to do. But the state court was right in its answer to the question before us. The former decision, of course, is not an adjudication that the contract cannot be reformed. It was rendered in an action at law, and only decided that the contract could not be recovered upon as it stood, or be helped out by any doctrine of the common law. If it were to be a bar it would be so, not on the ground of the adjudication as such, but on the ground of election, expressed by the form in which the plaintiff saw fit to sue. As an adjudication it simply establishes one of the propositions on which the plaintiff relies,-that it cannot recover upon the contract as it stands. The supposed election is the source of the effect attributed to the judgment. If that depended on matter in pais it might be a question, at least, as was argued, whether such a case fell within either U. S. Const. art. 4,  1, or Rev. Stat.  905, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 677. It may be doubted whether the election must not at least necessarily appear on the face of the record as matter of law in order to give the judgment a standing under Rev. Stat.  905. \n\n[203 U.S. 106, 108]\n\u00a0\n We pass such doubts, because we are of opinion that, however the election be stated, it is not made out. The plaintiff in the former action expressed on the record its reliance upon the facts upon which it now relies. It did not demand a judgment without regard to them and put them on one side, as was done in Washburn v. Great Western Ins. Co. 114 Mass. 175, where this distinction was stated by Chief Justice Gray. Its choice of law was not an election, but an hypothesis. It expressed the supposition that law was competent to give a remedy, as had been laid down by the supreme court of Nebraska and the circuit court of appeals for the circuit. Home F. Ins. Co. v. Wood, 50 Neb. 381, 386, 69 N. W. 941; Fireman's Fund Ins Co. v. Norwood, 16C. C. A. 136, 32 U. S. App. 490, 69 Fed. 71. So long as those decisions stood the plaintiff had no choice. It could not, or at least did not need to, demand reformation, if a court of law could effect the same result. It did demand the result, and showed by its pleadings that the path which it did choose was chosen simply because it was supposed to be an open way. Snow v. Alley, 156 Mass. 193, 195, 30 N.

At any time when this policy has been two years continuously in force it will be incontestable, except for fraud and nonpayment of premiums as provided herein, if the age of the insured has been correctly stated in the application.'\n The application for insurance was made by reference a part of the policy, the latter providing that the statements and answers therein every person accepting or acquiring an interest in the policy 'adopts as his own, and warrants to be full, complete, and true, and agrees to be material.' The application provides: 'No obligation shall arise under this application until the usual policy of insurance shall be issued and delivered to me, I being at that time in good health, and the first premium paid by me,' also, 'I warrant the statements and answers as written or printed herein, or in part two of this application, to be full, complete, and true, whether written \n\n[203 U.S. 243, 248]\n\u00a0\n by my own hand or not, and agree that every such statement and answer is material to the risk;' also, 'That I am not afflicted with any disease or disorder; nor have I had any illness, local disease, or personal injury not herein set forth.'\n Among the questions propounded to the insured and his answers- embodied in the application-were the following: 'Q.

And at the trial it was offered to be proved (and the offer was rejected, the company duly excepting) that such answers were not true, and when made were known to be untrue.\n There was a verdict for the plaintiffs, the executors of the insured, for the amount due on the two policies, namely, \n\n[203 U.S. 243, 249]\n\u00a0\n $11,050, for which judgment was rendered against the company.\n The case was brought here under the act of March 3d, 1891, chap. 517, which authorizes an appeal or writ of error directly to this court from a circuit or district court of the United States, in any case in which the Constitution or law of a state is claimed to be in contravention of the Constitution of the United States. 26 Stat. at L. 826, 828, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 488, 549.\n When the policies in question were issued it was provided by the statutes of Missouri,  7890, that: 'No misrepresentation made in obtaining or securing a policy of insurance on the life or lives of any person or persons, citizens of this state, shall be deemed material, or render the policy void, unless the matter misrepresented shall have actually contribited to be contingency or event on which the policy is to become due and payable, and whether it so contributed in any case shall be a question for the jury;' and by  7891, that 'in suits brought upon life policies, heretofore or hereafter issued, no defense based upon misrepresentation in obtaining or securing the same shall be valid unless the defendant shall, at or before the trial, deposit in court for the benefit of the plaintiffs, the premiums received on such policies.'\n These provisions were first enacted in 1874, appearing in the Revision of 1879 as  5976 and 5977, in the Revision of 1889 as  5849 and 7891, and in the present revision as  7890 and 7891\n\n\n At the trial in the circuit court the insurance company made several requests for instructions. They embodied these propositions: That the statute of Missouri,  7890, was not applicable to this case, and could not be applied to it consistently with the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States; that the plaintiff could not recover on either policy if it appeared that it was not delivered to and accepted by him while he was in good health; that if the insured, at the time of making his application for a policy of insurance, knowingly, falsely, and fraudulently, with the pur- \n\n[203 U.S. 243, 250]\n\u00a0\n pose to mislead and deceive the company, misrepresented in the application any matter concerning his health, life, or physical condition, which would reasonably affect the action of the company, then the Missouri statute was not applicable to the case; that if, with the intention to deceive and mislead the company, the insured made in his application an untrue warranty or misrepresentation concerning anything material to the risk, or if, at the time of the application, he was in bad health, and knew such to be his condition, but fraudulently and falsely, with the intent to decive, stated that he was then, and had been for twelve months, in good health, free from all ailments, diseases, weaknesses and infirmities, whereby the company was deceived into issuing the policy, when it would not otherwise have done so, he could not recover in this action.\n The trial court refused each request of the company and an exception to its action was duly taken; and it charged the jury (the company excepting) that the Missouri statute was applicable to this case, and not unconstitutional, and that the defendant company could not avoid liability on its policy by reason of any representations by the insured in his application, unless the jury found that the matters to which such representations had reference actually contributed to the contingency or event on which the policy, by its terms, was to become due and payable.\n Although the assignments of error are numberous, we do not deem it necessary to notice any questions except those growing out of the application of the Missouri statute to this case.\n As to the purpose and scope of that statute, we need only refer to the decisions of the highest court of Missouri, whose province it is to declare its meaning and effect, while it is the province of this court to adjudge whether the statute, as interpreted, is in conflict with the Constitution of the United States. We do not stop to inquire whether, having due regard to its words, the statute might not have been differently construed by the state court, but accept its judgment as indicating what it is to be taken to mean. In Schuermann v. \n\n[203 U.S. 243, 251]\n\u00a0\n Union Cent. L. Ins. Co. 165 Mo. 641, 653, 65 S. W. 723, reference was made to the history of business of life insurance in Missouri, the court saying: 'While equality of rights and privileges should be the general aim of all laws, and special restrictions and burdens imposed its strict exception, yet laws have ever been enacted by the state, and sustained, since the adoption of our present Constitution, as before its adoption, which were made to operate against certain classes of the community only, when that class has occupied some peculiar position, or when it has been clothed with some peculiar opportunities not enjoyed by the remainder of the community. As said before, life insurance companies in this state, prior to the adoption of  7890, could, and by a practice, almost universal, did, insert in their policies a stipulation to the effect that any untrue statement or answer made by the applicant for insurance (regardless of its materiality or regardless of the intent of the applicant in making same) should avoid the policy, and too frequently when demands were made upon them for the obligations of the policies the companies availed themselves of these harsh provisions without a return by them of the money which they had obtained from the insured in his lifetime, and when the untrue statements made had little, if any, effect upon the risk undertaken by the insurer. This doctrine of warranties, in the extent to which it had grown and was applied, was something peculiar to insurance companies, and was therefore thought the subject of special legislation, in a law which properly undertook to affect insurance companies alone in that particular. By a long and hurtful practice of a given policy peculiarly their own, insurance companies had stamped themselves as a class, to which alone legislation might properly address itself, in that regard.'\n In the subsequent case of Kern v. Supreme Lodge, A. L. of H. 167 Mo. 471, 487, 67 S. W. 252, the court, referring to the statute, said that it 'was enacted to correct the evil that had grown up, of permitting insurance companies to make every statement or answer a warranty, and if any one, however trivial or however \n\n[203 U.S. 243, 252]\n\u00a0\n foreign to the risk or loss, turned out to be untrue, to avoid the policy without refunding the benefits the company had received. The statute draws no distinction between innocent and fraudulent misrepresentations, and the courts have no right to draw any such distinction. The test applied by the statute is whether 'the matter misrepresented shall have actually contributed to the contingency or event on which the policy is to become due and payable,' and the power to determine that question is vested by the statute in the jury, and not in the court.' The case of Christian v. Connecticut Mut. L. Ins. Co. 143 Mo. 460, 45 S. W. 268, being called to the attention of the state court, it further said: 'In that case no distinction was drawn, or intended to be permitted, between innocent and wilfully fraudulent misrepresentations. The purpose was to give full force and effect to the statute, and to hold that no misrepresentation, whether innocent or fraudulent, when based upon a warranty of truth by the terms of the policy or not, shall be a defense, 'unless the matter misrepresented shall have actually contributed to the contingency or event on which the policy is to become due and payable.\" See also Jenkins v. covenant Mut. L. Ins. Co. 171 Mo. 375, 383, 71 S. W. 688.\n We take it, then, that the statute, if enforced, cuts off any defense by a life insurance company, based upon false and fraudulent statements in the application, unless the matter misrepresented actually contributed to the death of the insured. Is the statute, therefore, to be held repugnant to the 14th Amendment? Does it, in such case, deprive the insurance company of its 'liberty' or property without due process of law, or deny to it the equal protection of the laws? Although the statute in some degree restricts the company's power of contracting, and is so worded that the beneficiaries of its policy may sometimes reap the fruits of fraud practised upon its by the insured, we cannot, for that reason, hold that the state may not, so far as the Constitution of the United States is concerned, regulate the business of life insurance to the extent indicated. It is true that this court has said that the liberty \n\n[203 U.S. 243, 253]\n\u00a0\n guaranteed by the 14th Amendment against deprivation otherwise than by due process of law embraces the right to pursue a lawful calling and enter into all contracts proper, necessary, and essential to the carrying out of the purposes of such calling. Allgeyer v. Louisiana, \n165 \nU.S. 578, 589\n, 41 S. L. ed. 832, 835, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 427. It is true, also, that a corporation of one state, doing business in another state, under such circumstances as to be directly subject to its process at the instance of suitors, may invoke the protection of that clause of the 14th Amendment which declares that no state shall 'deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.' Blake v. McClung, \n172 \nU.S. 239, 260\n, 261 S., 43 L. ed. 432, 440, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 165. But it is equally the doctrine of this court that the power, whether called police, governmental, or legislative, exists in each state, by appropriate legislation, not forbidden by its own Constitution or by the Constitution of the United States, to determine for its people all questions or matters relating to its purely domestic or internal affairs, and, 'to regulate the relative rights and duties of all persons and corporations within its jurisdiction, and, therefore, to provide for the public convenience and the public good.' Lake Shore & M. S. R. Co. v. Ohio, \n173 \nU.S. 285, 297\n, 43 S. L. ed. 702, 706, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 465, and authorities there cited.\n We are informed by the decisions of the supreme court of Missouri that life insurance companies doing business in that state often secured contracts under which they could defeat all recovery upon a policy, and retain all premiums paid by the insured, if it appeared in proof that the application for insurance contained an inaccurate or untrue statement, however innocently made, as to matters having no real or substantial connection whatever with the death of the insured, and which were in no sense material to the risk. This was deemed an evil practice, to be remedied by legislation. Of course, the state, if it had seen proper, might have excepted from the operation of the statute cases in which the insured, by his representations when obtaining a policy, perpetrated a fraud upon the company, or made untrue statements in his applica- \n\n[203 U.S. 243, 254]\n\u00a0\n tion as to matters material to the risk. But that remedy was deemed inadequate to prevent wrong and injustice. The state decided to go to the root of the evil, and therefore, in substance, it established, as a rule of conduct for all life insurance companies, domestic and foreign, doing business in the state, that representations, of whatever nature, made to the company by the insured, should not defeat recovery upon a policy unless such representations, in the judgment of a jury, actually contributed to the contingency or event on which it was to become due and payable. Surely the state could make such a regulation in relation to its own corporations; for a corporation cannot exert any power, nor make any contract, forbidden by the law of its being. Such a restriction as that founded in the Missouri statute, if embodied in the original charter of a life insurance corporation, would, of course, be binding upon it in the state granting such charter, and could not be disregarded. If, however, no such restriction was imposed by its charter, it could yet be imposed by subsequent legislation, unless the state had precluded itself from so doing by some contract (if a binding one could be made) which, as to its obligation, was protected by the Federal Constitution. The business of life insurance is of such a peculiar character, affects so many people, and is so intimately connected with the common good, that the state creating the insurance corporations and giving them authority to engage in that business may, without transcending the limits of legislative power, regulate their affairs, so far, at least, as to prevent them from committing wrong or injustice in the exercise of their corporate functions. The state may well say to its own corporate creatures engaged in the business of life insurance that they shall not refuse to pay what they agreed to pay simply because of some representation made by the insured which did not actually contribute to the contingency or event on which the agreement to pay depended. If a life insurance corporation does not approve such a restriction upon the conduct of its affairs it is its privilege to cease doing busi- \n\n[203 U.S. 243, 255]\n\u00a0\n ness. Now, if the statute in question is not invalid as to life insurance corporations of Missouri, it is not perceived that the state may not make its provisions applicable to corporations of other states doing business in its territory with its sanction or under its license. That Missouri could forbid life insurance companies of other states from doing any business whatever within its limits, except upon the terms prescribed by the statute in question, cannot be doubted, in view of the decisions of this court. If it could go that far, why may it not declare, as it has in effect done, by this statute, that its provisions shall apply to foreign life insurance companies doing business in Missouri under its license? It would, indeed, be extraordinary if the state could compel its own life insurance companies to respect this statute, but could not enforce its provisions against a foreign corporation doing business within its limits, with its consent, express or implied-especially against one which, as is the case here, came into the state for purposes of business after such statutory provisions were enacted. As the present statute is applicable alike to all life insurance companies doing business in Missouri, after its enactment, there is no reason for saying that it denies the equal protection of the laws. Equally without foundation is the contention that the statute, if enforced, will be inconsistent with the liberty guaranteed by the 14th Amendment. The liberty referred to in that Amendment is the liberty of natural, not artificial, persons. Nor, in any true, constitutional sense, does the Missouri statute deprive life insurance companies doing business in that state of a right of property. This is too plain for discussion.\n What has been said disposes of the only questions we need to determine, and the judgment is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","116":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNUTT v. KNUT(1906)\nNo. 78\nArgued: November 29, 1905Decided: January 2, 1906\n\n\n\n This suit was brought in the chancery court of Adams county, Mississippi, the plaintiff being S. Prentiss Knut, a defendant in error, and the defendants being the administrator, heirs, and devisees of Haller Nutt, deceased.\n It was based upon a written contract between the late James W. Denver and the (then) executrix of Haller Nutt, deceased, as follows: 'That the party of the first part (Denver) agrees to take exclusive charge and control of a certain claim which the party of the second part (executrix of Nutt's estate) holds against the government of the United States, for the use of property and for property of which the said Haller Nutt and his estate was deprived by the acts of officers, soldiers, and employees of the United States in Louisiana and Mississippi, in the years 1863, 1864, and 1865, amounting to one million of dollars, more or less, and to prosecute the same before any of the courts of the United States, and upon appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, or before any of the departments of government, or before the Congress of the United States, or before any officer or commission or convention specially authorized to take cognizance of said claim, or through any diplomatic negotiations as may be deemed by him for the best interests of the party of the second part. And in consideration therefor the party of the second part agrees to pay the party of the first part a sum equal to 33 1\/3 per cent of the amount which may be allowed on said claim, the payment of which is hereby made a lien upon said claim and upon any draft, money, or evidence of indebtedness which may be issued thereon. This agreement \n\n[200 U.S. 13, 14]\n\u00a0\n not to be affected by any services performed by the claimant, or by any other agents or attorneys employed by him. All expenses of printing, costs of court, and commission fees for taking testimony, are to be charged to the party of the second part, and the party of the second part agrees to execute from time to time such powers of attorney as may be convenient or necessary for the successful prosecution and collection of said claim. No revocation of any authority conferred on the party of the first part by this agreement, or any power of attorney relating to the business covered by the same, to be valid.'\n On the same day the executrix of Nutt executed to Denver a power of attorney, constituting the latter her attorney 'irrevocable,' for her and in her name and stead 'to prosecute a certain claim against the government of the United States, for property used and for property of which said Haller Nutt and his estate was deprived by United States officers, soldiers, and employees in Louisiana and Mississippi, amounting to $1,000, 000, more or less, before any court of the United States, or before any of the departments of the government, or before the Congress of the United States, or before any officer or commission or convention specially authorized to take cognizance of said claim, or through any diplomatic negotiations, to collect the same; and from time to time to furnish any further evidence necessary, or that may be demanded, giving and granting to my said attorney full power and authority to do and perform all and every act and thing whatsoever requisite and necessary to be done in and about the premises, as fully to all intents and purposes as I might or could do if personally present at the doing thereof, with full power of substitution and revocation, and to receipt and sign all vouchers and bonds of indemnity or appeal, and to indorse all drafts and vouchers in my name, either by or without indicating it is done by procuration, which may be requisite in the prosecution or collection of said claim, hereby ratifying and confirming all that my said attorney or his substitute may or shall lawfully do, or cause to be done by virtue hereof.' \n\n[200 U.S. 13, 15]\n\u00a0\n The petition shows, and it is not disputed, that the plaintiff succeeded to all the rights, whatever they were, of Denver under the above contract, and that, as the result of his labors, Congress at different times appropriated, on account of the Nutt claim, the sums of $35,556.17 and $89,999.88. 23 Stat. at L. 586, chap. 237, 32 Stat. at L. 212, chap. 887. Prior to the bringing of the present suit the plaintiff had received his 'due share' of the first appropriation, but has not received his full part of the last one. He therefore sought payment, in accordance with the contract, for the balance due him on account of the said sum of $89,999.88, appropriated to and received by the Nutt estate.\n The plaintiff subsequently amended his petition, and asked that, in the event of his not being entitled to compensation under the Denver contract, he have judgment for such sum as his services were reasonably worth, which he alleged to be $30,000.\n Some of the defendants by their answers put the plaintiff upon proof of his case, but submitted to the court the question of the reasonableness of his claim for fees.\n Three of the defendants, while not denying that plaintiff had been recognized by the executrix and subsequent administrators of Nutt's estate as the attorney of record against the United States government, yet denied any legal liability of the estate by reason of such recognition. They averred that 'the original contract and power of attorney, as assignee of which petitioner claims to recover from the present administrator 33 1\/3 per cent of said sum of $89,999.88, were contrary to good morals and public policy, were null and void, so far as they undertook to vest a right to a contingent fee in said Denver, and conferred upon said Denver no rights for the recovery of any fee against this estate which a court would recognize and enforce. And respondents further charge that said petitioner, as assignee of said Denver, occupies no better position than his assignor had, and that as such assignee he has no standing in this court for the enforcement of said void contract, or for the enforcement of any claim whatever for professional services rendered by him, or alleged to have been rendered by him, in behalf of said \n\n[200 U.S. 13, 16]\n\u00a0\n estate, in connection with said claim against the United States government.'\n Upon the final hearing of the case in the court of original jurisdiction the chancellor rendered a decree holding that the Denver contract was 'violative of the United States statute laws, and being further of the opinion that complainant, in the prosecution of said claim under said contract before the Congress of the United States, in procuring and attempting to procure appropriations for the payment thereof, did procure personal solicitations to be made of members of Congress of the United States in behalf of said claim, and, for the reasons stated, is not entitled to the relief prayed for in his petition, doth order, adjudge, and decree that complainant's petition be and the same is hereby dismissed at his cost, for which let execution issue.'\n Upon appeal to the supreme court of Mississippi the judgment was reversed, and that court, proceeding to render such decree as, in its opinion, should have been rendered, adjudged that the plaintiff was entitled 'to his prayer for 33 1\/3 per centum of the amount collected by the administrator ($89,993.83), in full for any advances made by him and all services,' less any payments made. 83 Miss. 365, 102 Am. St. Rep. 452, 35 So. 686. The cause was remanded for an account to be taken and for an order directing the administrator to pay to Knut any balance of that per cent unpaid. The accounting was had in the inferior state court, Knut being charged with $10,000 paid on June 10th, 1902, and allowed interest. The result was a decree that the plaintiff have and receive from the administrator of Haller Nutt's estate the sum of $22,143.30, with 6 per cent interest. That decree, upon appeal, was affirmed by the supreme court of Mississippi.\n Mr. A. S. Worthington for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n[200 U.S. 13, 17]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Frederic D. McKenney, John Spalding Flannery, T. C. Catchings, and O. W. Catchings for defendants in error.\n\n\n\n[200 U.S. 13, 18]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan delivered the opinion of the court:\n The first question is one of the jurisdiction of this court. The present plaintiffs in error based their defense in part upon  3477 of teh Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2320), which declares absolutely null and void certain transfers and assignments of claims against the United States. They insisted that the contract sued on was in violation of that statute; and that they and the estate of Nutt were protected by its provisions against any judgment whatever in favor of the plaintiff. In every substantial sense, therefore, they asserted a right and immunity under a statute of the United States, and such right and immunity was denied to them by the supreme court of Mississippi. That court\n' 3477. All transfers and assignments made of any claim upon the United States, or of any part or share thereof, or interest therein, whether absolute or conditional, and whatever may be the consideration therefor, and all powers of attorney, orders, or other authorities for receiving payment of any such claim, or of any part or share thereof, shall be absolutely null and void uniess they are freely made and executed in the presence of at least two attesting witnesses, after the allowance of such a claim, the ascertainment of the amount due, and the issuing of a warrant for the payment thereof. Such transfers, assignments, and powers of attorney must recite the warrant for payment, and must be acknowledged by the person making them before an officer having authority to take acknowledgments of deeds, and shall be certified by the officer; and it must appear by the certificate that the officer, at the time of the acknowledgment, read and fully explained the transfer, assignment, or warrant of attorney to the person acknowledging the same.' \n\n[200 U.S. 13, 19]\n\u00a0\n expressly adjudged that the contract was not, on its face, in violation of the statutes of the United States, and could legally be the basis of a valid claim against the Nutt estate. The case, so far as our jurisdiction is concerned, is therefore within  709 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 575), which authorizes this court to re-examine the final judgment of the highest court of a state, 'where any title, right, privilege, or immunity' is claimed under a statute of the United States, and the decision is against such title, right, privilege, or immunity specially set up or claimed. A party who insists that a judgment cannot be rendered against him consistently with the statutes of the United States may be fairly held, within the meaning of  709, to assert a right and immunity under such statutes, although the statutes may not give the party himself a personal or affirmative right that could be enforced by direct suit against his adversary. Such has been the view taken in many cases where the authority of this court to review the final judgment of the state courts was involved. Logan County Nat. Bank v.

Rep. 831.\n\n We perceive no sufficient reason to modify the views expressed in those cases as to our jurisdiction. It is true there are some cases which, it is contended, justify a contrary view. We will not now stop to examine those cases narrowly, and to declare wherein they may be in conflict with the cases above cited. Suffice it to say that, upon a careful reconsideration of the whole subject, and after reviewing all the cases bearing upon the precise question of jurisdiction now before us, we reaffirm the views expressed in the above-cited cases, as demanded by the statutes regulating the jurisdiction of this court.\n We now come to the merits of the case as affected by  3477 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2320). That section, as we have seen, declares null and void all transfers and assignments of a \n\n[200 U.S. 13, 20]\n\u00a0\n claim upon the United States, or of any part or share thereof, or any interest therein, whether absolute or conditional, and whatever may be the consideration thereof, and all powers of attorney, orders, or other authorities for receiving payment of any such claim, or of any part or share thereof, unless they are freely made and executed after the allowance of the claim, the ascertainment of the amount due, and the issuing of a warrant for the payment thereof. This statute has been the subject of examination in many cases. Spofford v. Kirk, \n97 U.S. 484\n, 24 L. ed. 1032; United States v. Gillis, \n95 U.S. 407\n, 24 L. ed. 503; Erwin v. United States, \n97 U.S. 392\n, 24 L. ed. 1065; Goodman v. Niblack, \n102 U.S. 556\n, 26 L. ed. 229; Ball v. Halsell, \n161 U.S. 72\n, 40 L. ed. 622, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 554; Freedman's Sav. & T. Co. v.

Forrest, \n173 U.S. 410\n, 43 L. ed. 749, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 434.\n If regard be had to the words as well as to the meaning of the statute, as declared in former cases, it would seem clear that the contract in question was, in some important particulars, null and void upon its face. We have in mind that clause making the payment of the attorney's compensation a lien upon the claim asserted against the government, and upon any draft, money, or evidence of indebtedness issued thereon. In giving that lien from the outset, before the allowance of the claim, and before any services had been rendered by the attorney, the contract, in effect, gave him an interest or share in the claim itself and in any evidence of indebtedness issued by the government on account of it. In effect or by its operation it transferred or assigned to the attorney, in advance of the allowance of the claim, such an interest as would secure the payment of the fee stipulated to be paid. All this was contrary to the statute; for its obvious purpose, in part, was to forbid anyone who was a stranger to the original transaction to come between the claimant and the government, prior to the allowance of a claim, and who, in asserting his own interest or share in the claim, pending its examination, might embarrass the conduct of the business on the part of the officers of the government. We are of opinion \n\n[200 U.S. 13, 21]\n\u00a0\n that the state court erred in holding the contract, on its face, to be consistent with the statute.\n It does not follow, however, that, for this error, the judgment must be reversed. There is a provision in the contract of 1882 which can stand alone, and which was not in violation of the statute; namely, the one evidencing an agreement on the part of Nutt's executrix to pay to the attorney for his services a sum equal to 33 1\/3 per cent of the amount allowed on the claim. Wylie v. Coxe, 15 How. 415, 14 L. ed. 753; Wright v. Tebbitts, \n91 U.S. 252\n, 23 L. ed. 320; Taylor v. Bemiss, \n110 U.S. 43\n, 28 L. ed. 64, 3 Sup.Ct.Rep. 441. Such an agreement did not give the attorney any interest or share in the claim itself, nor any interest in the particular money paid over to the claimant by the government. It only established an agreed basis for any settlement that might be made, after allowance and payment of the claim, as to the attorney's compensation. It simply created a legal obligation upon the part of the estate, which, if not recognized after the collection of the money, could have been enforced by suit for the benefit of the attorney, without doing violence to the statute or to the public policy established by its provisions. The decree below may then be regarded as only giving effect to the agreement as the basis upon which the attorney's compensation was to be calculated. It did not assume to give him any lien upon the claim, or any priority in the distribution of the money received by Nutt's personal representative from the United States, nor upon any other money in his hands. Indeed, no lien is asserted by the plaintiff in his pleadings. While the original petition asserted his right to be paid in accordance with the contract, the plaintiff claimed, if he could not be paid under the contract, that he be compensated according to the reasonable value of his services.\n Much was said in argument as to the nature of the services rendered by the plaintiff,-the charge being that his services were of the kind called lobby services, for which, consistently with public policy and public morals, no recovery could be had in any court.

Rep. 126.\n It is clear from these authorities that the petition for removal, which, as will appear, presented the only definite Federal question, was rightfully denied.\n Thereupon the defendant filed an answer containing several defenses; a claim of title under and by virtue of a grant made in the year 1767, by the government of Spain to Joaquin Galan; a decree of the district court of Webb county on March 13, 1872, in a suit for confirmation of title, wherein Daniel Ruggles, claiming to be the owner of the grant to \n\n[202 U.S. 501, 508]\n\u00a0\n Galan, was plaintiff and the state of Texas defendant, prosecuted under and by virtue of an act of the legislature of Texas approved February 11, 1860; a confirmation of this decree by an act of the legislature of Texas of April 4, 1881; title by adverse possession under claim of right and title for a period of more than ninety-six years; title by estoppel, in that the state of Texas was estopped by long acquiescence from questioning the decree of the district court of Webb county of March 13, 1872; title under and by virtue of a decree of the district court of Webb county, Texas, rendered on January 8, 1862; and a claim of outstanding title in the settlers of the town of Palafox, or their heirs or assigns, as shown by the recitals in the last-mentioned decree.\n The case was tried by the court without a jury, which rendered a judgment in favor of the state. From this judgment the defendant prosecuted an appeal to the state court of civil appeals, which reversed the judgment of the trial court and ordered a judgment for the defendant. This judgment was taken to the supreme court of the state, which reversed the judgment of the court of civil appeals, and, sustaining the decision of the trial court, entered a judgment in favor of the state.\n It is obvious that most of the questions raised by the defenses are of a purely local nature, involving no Federal right. Some explanation may, however, be proper in reference to the decrees of the Webb county district court. The record is somewhat obscure, but we take the facts to be as stated in the opinions of the court of civil appeals and the Supreme Court. Under the law of 1860 Daniel Ruggles instituted two suits in the district court of Webb county for confirmation of title to separate tracts of land, one designated as the Palafox and the other as the Balconcitas tract. One suit came to trial on January 8, 1862, and resulted in a decree in favor of Ruggles and a confirmation of his title to a large tract of land. In 1869 a motion was filed by him, seeking a construction and modification of this decree of January 8, 1862, but it was \n\n[202 U.S. 501, 509]\n\u00a0\n overruled. In 1871 the other suit was dismissed for want of jurisdiction. The same year he made a motion to redocket the two cases, which was granted, and at the same time he filed a petition in which he sought to have the decree of 1862 set aside and a confirmation of title of both the tracts, but, on March 9, 1872, these motions were refused. On March 12, 1872, he filed in the same court another petition seeking to set aside the decree of January 8, 1862. This motion was sustained. On March 13, 1872, Ruggles filed an amended petition, in which he sought confirmation of title to both tracts, and upon this a decree was the same day entered in favor of Ruggles. The land which was covered by the decree of 1862 was patented to Ruggles, and the state has not since questioned the validity of the decree or Ruggles's title. The land in controversy here is located entirely in that portion of the grant which the court, in its decree of 1862, declined to confirm in favor of Ruggles, but is included in that which purports to have been confirmed by the decree of March 13, 1872. The suits originally brought by Ruggles were authorized by special statute, to wit, the act of the legislature passed February 11, 1860. That act expired by its own limitations in 1865, and, as the supreme court of the state held, the district court had thereafter no power to set aside the decree of January 8, 1862, or to enter the decree of March 13, 1872. The construction of the state statute and the power which it gave to the district court of Webb county, and the length of time for the exercise of that power, are matters arising under state law, and the decision of the supreme court of the state is conclusive upon us and presents no question arising under the Federal Constitution. So the alleged confirmation of the decree of March 13, 1872, by an act of the legislature of 1881, is also a question arising in the construction of a state statute. The supreme court held that it applied only to those decrees which were rendered while the Webb county district court had authority under the special statute, and did not apply to those which that court assumed to render thereafter. \n\n[202 U.S. 501, 510]\n\u00a0\n So far as any defense is based upon the grant made by the government of Spain in the year 1767, it involves no question of a Federal nature. Neither the validity nor construction of any treaty of the United States, nor the validity of the grant, were challenged. Indeed, it may be observed that during the progress of the case in the several state courts no appeal was made to the Federal Constitution, or to any acts of Congress save the one providing for the removal of cases from state to Federal courts.\n It is apparent that the only Federal question which was presented, to wit, the right of removal, was correctly decided, and, therefore, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","118":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nOFFIELD v.

Buckland for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n This writ of error brings up for review a judgment of the supreme court of errors of the state of Connecticut, rendered in a proceeding under the statutes of that state for the condemnation of two shares of stock owned by plaintiff in error in the New Haven & Derby Railroad Company.\n There was a demurrer to the application, which was overruled by the advice of the supreme court of errors, the judgment on demurrer having been reserved, under the practice of the state, for the advice and consideration of that court. 77 Conn. 417, 59 Atl. 510. Upon the hearing judgment was rendered for defendant in error, which was affirmed by the supreme court of errors. 78 Conn. 1, 60 Atl. 740.\n Defendant in error is the lessee of the New Haven & Derby Railroad Company, and has acquired all of the shares of stock of the latter road except the two shares owned by plaintiff in error.\n That the lease and acquisition of stock are valid under the laws of the state is decided by the supreme court of errors, and it is sought by proceedings under review to obtain the two \n\n[203 U.S. 372, 376]\n\u00a0\n shares of stock owned by plaintiff in error, under  3694 and 3695 of the General Statutes of Connecticut, which are as follows:\n'Sec. 3694. In case any railroad company, acting under the authority of the laws of this state, shall have acquired more than three fourths of the capital stock of any steamboat, ferry, bridge, wharf, or railroad corporation, and cannot agree with the holders of outstanding stock for the purchase of the same, such railroad company may, upon a finding by a judge of the superior court that such purchase will be for the public interest, cause such outstanding stock to be appraised in accordance with the provisions of  3687. When the amount of such appraisal shall have been paid or deposited as provided in said section, the stockholder or stockholders whose stock shall have been so appraised shall cease to have any interest therein, and on demand shall surrender all certificates for such stock, with duly executed powers of attorney for transfer thereon, to the corporation applying for such appraisal.\n\n'Sec. 3695. If any person holding a minority of the shares of stock in any corporation referred to in  3694 cannot agree with the railroad company owning three fourths of such stock for the purchase of his shares, he may cause the same to be appraised in accordance with the provisions of  3687. When such appraisal has been made and recorded in the office of the clerk of the superior court of any county where such railroad company operates a railroad, and the certificates for such stock, with duly executed powers of attorney for transfer thereon, have been deposited with such clerk for such railroad company, such appraisal shall have the effect of a judgment against such company and in favor of the holder of such stock, and at the end of sixty days, unless such judgment is paid, execution may be issued.'\n\n The purpose of the acquisition of the stock is to enable defendant in error to improve the New Haven & Derby Railroad. \n\n[203 U.S. 372, 377]\n\u00a0\n It is contended by plaintiff in error (1) that the purpose for which the stock is sought to be obtained is not a public use. (2) That defendant in error has the power and authority to make the improvements mentioned in its application, which would be as advantageous as taking the stock. (3) The proceedings and statutes are in violation of the due process clause of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and impair the contract rights of plaintiff in error as stockholder of the New Haven & Derby Railroad Company, and his rights in, under, and by virtue of, the lease to defendant in error.\n These contentions raise a Federal question and we canot say that it is frivolous. The motion to dismiss is therefore denied.\n (1.) The power of the state to declare uses of property to be public has lately been decided in Clark v. Nash, \n198 U.S. 361\n, 49 L. ed. 1085, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 676, and in the case of Strickley v. Highland Boy Gold Min. Co. \n200 U.S. 527\n, 50 L. ed. 581, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 301. These cases exhibit more striking examples of the power of a state than the case at bar. In the first case the statute of the state permitted an individual to enlarge the ditch of another to obtain water for his own land; in the second case the statute authorized the condemnation of a right of way to transport ore from a mine to a railroad station. In the first case it was said that the public policy of the state, declaring the character of use of property, depends upon the facts surrounding the subject. In the second case it was said, commenting on the first, 'it proved that there might be exceptional times and places in which the very foundations of public welfare could not be laid without requiring concessions from individuals to each other upon due compensation, which, under other circumstances, would be left wholly to voluntary consent.' The case at bar does not need the support of such broad principles. The ultimate purpose of defendant in error in the case at bar is the improvement of the New Haven & Derby Railroad, which 'connects [we quote from the opinion of the supreme court of errors, 77 Conn. 419, 59 Atl. 511] at \n\n[203 U.S. 372, 378]\n\u00a0\n New Haven, on the east, with four, and at its western terminals with two, important railroad lines owned by the plaintiff [defendant in error] and forms a link in an all-rail route between Boston and the West, which is the only one controlled by the plaintiff, and the only one of any kind controlled by it over which goods can be transported with assured despatch in all weathers and at all seasons.' In this purpose the public has an interest, and to accomplish it the court applied the statute. The court observed: 'To develop this route so as best to serve the public interest requires the laying of additional tracks on the New Haven & Derby Railroad and other extensive and very costly improvements. The lessor company has neither means nor credit whereby this can be effected on advantageous terms. The plaintiff could and will effect it, and at much less cost, if it can acquire the two outstanding shares of the stock of the lessee. They are owned by the defendant, who refuses to agree on terms of purchase.'\n\n\n (2)\n The contract which it is contended was impaired is the lease of the New Haven & Derby Railroad by defendant in error. The lease is for a period of ninety-nine years from July 1, 1892, at a rental of 4 per cent per annum upon the capital stock, together with the payment of taxes, assessments, and interest upon the funded debt. Associated with this contention there is another, more general, to the effect that the statute impairs the contract rights of plaintiff in error as a stockholder of the New Haven & Derby Railroad Company. We do not find it necessary to give precise and separate discussion to these contentions. They seem to us to be but parts or incidents of the contention that the stock is sought for a private use. If they are not incidents of that, they are answered and opposed by the case of Long Island Water Supply Co. v. Brooklyn, \n166 U.S. 685\n, 41 L. ed. 1165, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 718. Whatever value the lease gives the shares of stock will be represented in their appraisement.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","119":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nORTEGA v.

The date of the promise was laid as June 1, 1900, and of the breach in 1904. Both parties were subjects of Spain and residents of Porto Rico.\n Defendant demurred to the complaint, and, the demurrer having been overruled, pleaded the general issue. The cause was tried by a jury and resulted in a verdict for plaintiff in the sum of $5,000, interest and costs, on which judgment was entered. Defendant moved in arrest and for judgment non obstante veredicto, which motions were overruled, and this writ of error was thereupon allowed.\n At the conclusion of the evidence, defendant requested the court to instruct the jury to find in his favor, on the grounds, among others, that the court had no jurisdiction of a suit where both plaintiff and defendant were subjects of the King of Spain, and because the cause of action arose in June, 1900, 'at which time there was no provision in the laws in force in Porto Rico for a suit of the character set out in plaintiff's declaration, the only basis for the said suit being the provisions of article 44 of the Civil Code then in force.' Similar reasons were assigned in support of the motions in arrest and non obstante. \n\n[202 U.S. 339, 342]\n\u00a0\n 1. The judgment was for $5,000 and costs. It carried interest, but it is the amount of the judgment that furnishes the test of our jurisdiction, and it is conceded that that is insufficient in this instance. But plaintiff in error contends that the refusal of the court below to limit the right of recovery by the terms of article 44 of the former Civil Code of Porto Rico amounted to the denial of a right claimed under a statute of the United States, and that jurisdiction may be maintained on that ground. Act March 3, 1885 (23 Stat. at L. 443, chap. 355,  1, 2, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 572); act April 12, 1900 (31 Stat. at L. 77, chap. 191,  35).\n The treaty ceding Porto Rico to the United States was ratified by the Senate, February 6, 1899; Congress passed an act to carry out its obligations March 2, 1899 [30 Stat. at L. 993, chap. 376], and the ratifications were exchanged and the treaty proclaimed April 11, 1899 [30 Stat. at L. 1754]. Then followed the act of April 12, 1900 (31 Stat. at L. 77, chap. 191). At that date, article 44 of the Civil Code of Porto Rico, relating to breaches of promise of marriage, was in force, and provided that, under certain conditions, 'the person who refuses to marry without just cause shall be obliged to indemnify the other party for the expenses which he or she may have incurred by reason of the promised marriage.'\n By the general rule of public law, recognized by the United States, whenever political jurisdiction and legislative power over territory are transferred from one nation to another, the laws of the country transferred, intended for the protection of private rights, continue in force until abrogated or changed by the new government. Of course, in case of cession to the United States, laws of the ceded country inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States so far as applicable would cease to be of obligatory force; but otherwise the municipal laws of the acquired country continue.\n Nevertheless, and apparently largely out of abundant caution, the 8th section of the act of April 12, 1900, provided: 'That the laws and ordinances of Porto Rico now in force shall continue in full force and effect, except as altered, amended, or modified hereinafter, or as altered or modified by military or- \n\n[202 U.S. 339, 343]\n\u00a0\n ders and decrees in force when this act shall take effect, and so far as the same are not inconsistent or in conflict with the statutory laws of the United States not locally inapplicable, or the provisions hereof, until altered, amended, or repealed by the legislative authority hereinafter provided for Porto Rico or by act of Congress of the United States; . . . '\n In 1902 the legislature of Porto Rico enacted a new Civil Code, which went into effect July 1 of that year, and this repealed article 44 of the prior Civil Code, and carried forward several articles bearing upon the same subject.\n It will be remembered that the alleged promise was in 1900 and the alleged breach in 1904. And now the argument is, that by reason of  8 of the act of April 12, 1900, commonly called the 'Foraker act,' article 44 became a law of the United States by adoption, and that, therefore, the ruling of the court below, that recovery was not limited to expenses, was equivalent to the denial of a right claimed under a law of the United States.\n We do not agree with this view. Article 44 was a law of Porto Rico on April 12, 1900, and the operation of the Foraker act was to define how it might be amended or repealed.\n It was repealed by the Porto Rican legislature before the alleged breach of promise. If the district court erred in declining on any ground to apply it as a limitation, the error cannot be corrected on this appeal, because the appeal does not lie.\n The alleged Federal question had no existence in substance. The laws of Porto Rico remained the laws of Porto Rico except as indicated in  8 of the Foraker act, which section did not make all the laws of Porto Rico acts of Congress.\n We cannot perceive that 'the Constitution of the United States, or a treaty thereof, or an act of Congress' was brought in question or a right claimed thereunder denied, within  35 of the Foraker act, or that 'the validity of a treaty or statute of, or an authority exercised under, the United States,' was drawn in question within  2 of the act of March 3, 1885\n\n\n 2. By  3 of the act of March 2, 1901 (31 Stat. at L. 953, chap. 812), it was provided 'that the jurisdiction of the district \n\n[202 U.S. 339, 344]\n\u00a0\n court of the United States for Porto Rico in civil cases shall, in addition to that conferred by the act of April twelfth, nineteen hundred, extend to and embrace controversies where the parties, or either of them, are citizens of the United States, or citizens or subjects of a foreign state or states.'\n The jurisdiction of the district court, when the parties on both sides were the subjects of the King of Spain, has several times been sustained by this court, and we do not feel required in this case to make any other ruling.\n Writ of error dismissed. \n\n\n\n","120":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nOTIS CO. v.

The injunction is asked on alternative grounds,- either that the mill act does not authorize the dam, or that, if it does, then it is contrary to the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. The case was tried in the superior court and reported to the supreme judicial court, which held that the statute authorized the dam and was valid, and ordered the bill be dismissed. 186 Mass. 89, 104 Am. St. Rep. 563, 70 N. E. 1009. A decree was entered in accordance with the rescript, and the case then was brought here. The claim under the Constitution was distinctly set up \n\n[201 U.S. 140, 151]\n\u00a0\n in the bill, and was insisted on at every stage. The court could not have decided as it did without overruling that claim, so that the jurisdiction of this court is clear, although it was denied.\n The dam in question is built across the Chicopee river, a non- navigable stream, at Red Bridge. It was begun, in pursuance of a long previous determination, an August 3, 1899, and was completed within a reasonable time. The plaintiff owned a mill and dam, more than two miles above, and land below its dam on the two sides of the water course, down to within about 2 miles from the principal defendant's dam. On April 4, 1900, the plaintiff determined to build a dam near its lower boundary, and began the work of construction on August 11 of the same year. This dam was completed before, although it was begun after, the defendants', and will be rendered nearly or wholly useless by the back flow from the defendants' structure. The plaintiff's original dam and mill will not be interfered with. The supreme judicial court decided that, under the statute then in force (Pub. Stat. chap. 190,  2), the principal defendant, herein called the defendant, acquired the prior right, and that the statute was constitutional. It postponed the consideration of the plaintiff's rights in reference to damages, but decided that the provision for compensation was adequate to satisfy whatever rights the plaintiff might have.\n The only question which it is necessary for us to consider is whether the act as construed violates the 14th Amendment. General objections to mill acts as taking property for private use or on other graunds have been disposed of by Head v. Amoskeag Mfg. Co. \n113 U.S. 9\n, 28 L. ed. 889, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 441.

It may have begun with grist mills and may have had its justification in the public needs which exempted from military watchings \n\n[201 U.S. 140, 152]\n\u00a0\n and wardings one miller to each grist mill (act of 1693, chap. 3,  13, 1 Prov. Laws, 130); and in the public duties which were expressed in the act of 1728, chap. 6,  3, 1 Prov. Laws, 497. But, at all events, the liability of streams to this kind of appropriation and use has become so familiar a conception in New England, where water power plays as large a part as mines in Utah, that it would not be very extravagant to say that it enters as an incident into the nature of property in streams, as there understood.\n However, the liability of upper land to be flowed is not a liability to be flowed without payment. The principal objection made to the law is that it makes no adequate provision for payment, if it is construed as it has been construed by the state court. There has been no substantial change in the form of this provision for the better part of a century. It reads: 'A person whose land is overflowed or otherwise injured by such dam, may obtain compensation therefor upon his complaint before the superior court for the county where the land or any part thereof lies; but no compensation shall be awarded for damage sustained more than three years before the institution of the complaint.' Pub. Stat. chap. 190,  4. The jury is to take into consideration damage to other land as well as the damage to the land overflowed ( 14). It is to assess the damages sustained within three years ( 16), and to determine what sum, to be paid annually, would be reasonable compensation for the damages that may be occasioned thereafter, and also a sum in gross for all damages from the use of the dam in the manner fixed by it ( 18), the jury having power to regulate the height of the dam ( 17). The complainant is given an election to take the gross sum, in which case the owner of the dam loses all benefit of the act after three months until he pays.  19, 20. Otherwise the complainant has an action for the annual compensation and a lien on the dam and lands used with it.  21 et seq. And, finally, if dissatisfied with the amount of the annual compensation, he may bring a new complaint.  30. \n\n[201 U.S. 140, 153]\n\u00a0\n In considering whether these provisions are sufficient, it is important to know exactly what the upper owner loses by the dam. The state court lays it down that there is no taking under the right of eminent domain. 186 Mass. 95, 104 Am. St. Rep. 563, 70 N. E. 1009. We assume this to mean what often has been said with regard to the mill acts, that under them no easement or title of any kind is gained in or over the upper land, and that the water could be diked out, Storm v. Manchaug Co. 13 Allen, 10, 13; Lowell v. Boston, 111 Mass. 454, 466, 15 Am. Rep. 39; although the language has not been uniform, and it seems to have been held otherwise when the damages are paid in gross. Isele v. Arlington Five Cents Sav. Bank, 135 Mass. 142. Taking the law to be as stated by the court, it would follow that only the damage physically suffered is to be paid for. When a title is taken, for instance, to the waters of a stream, it is held that the whole value of the title must be paid, although a considerable use may be left in fact to the party aggrieved. Howe v. Weymouth, 148 Mass. 605, 20 N. E. 316; Imbescheid v. Old Colony R. Co. 171 Mass. 209, 50 N. E. 609. Flowage under the mill acts seems to be regarded as presenting the converse case. As no title is gained to have the water on the upper land, the dam owner pays only for the harm actually done from time to time. If this is so, somewhat less elaborate provisions might be justified than could be sustained when the title is lost. So far as security goes, looking to the reasonable probabilities in such cases, it would seem to be sufficient. We must bear in mind, as we presume the state court meant to suggest by its citation of the case of Brickett v. Haverhill Aqueduct Co. 142 Mass. 394, 397, 8 N. E. 119, that,-as was said there in words that need but little change,-if other remedies proved ineffectual, the 'court would, by proceedings in equity, restrain the defendant from a further use of the water, and, if necessary, order the removal of the dam.' In other words, the right to an injunction, if necessary, is taken into account in Massachusetts, in deciding whether the security for payment is sufficient, even when there is a taking by eminent domain. See \n\n[201 U.S. 140, 154]\n\u00a0\n also Atty. Gen. v. Old Colony R. Co. 160 Mass. 62, 90, 22 L. R. A. 112, 35 N. E. 252; Manigault v. Springs, \n199 \nU.S. 473, 485\n, 486 S., 56 L. ed --, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 127. This seems an answer to the objection that, in the state of the business of the courts, a judgment for past damages may not be recorded for several years, that the defendant may be insolvent, the dam inadequate security, and valuable improvements destroyed. It is said that the lower owner might abandon his dam and thereby escape liability for gross damages after an election to take them. But we presume that in that case he would be held to pay the temporary damage caused, and the case would stand like one where the choice had been the other way. Hunt v. Whitney, 4 Met. 603, 608.\n Again, we cannot wholly neglect the long settled law and common understanding of a particular state in considering the plaintiff's rights. We are bound to be very cautious in coming to the conclusion that the 14th Amendment has upset what thus has been established and accepted for a long time. Even the incidents of ownership may be cut down by the peculiar laws and usages of a state. Eldridge v. Trezevant, \n160 \nU.S. 452, 466\n, 40 S. L. ed. 490, 498, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 345. For a century the remedy given by the statute has been supposed to be sufficient, and in 1832 it was decided to be so under a somewhat similar statute, which was held to create a servitude. Boston & R. Mill Corp. v. Newman, 12 Pick. 467, 23 Am. Dec. 622. We are not prepared to pronounce the statute void on the ground that the security for payment is not enough.\n But it is argued that not all the serious damage which is or may be suffered is compensated. It is said that only damages caused by flowing can be recovered. But the cases cited only show that damages regarded as too remote on general principles are disallowed (Fuller v. Chicopee Mfg. Co. 16 Gray, 46), or that, not being within the protection of the mill acts, they are to be recovered by an action at common law (Eames v. New England Worsted Co. 11 Met. 570). And the statute now expressly provides for a 'person whose land is overflowed or otherwise injured' ( 4), and that the jury \n\n[201 U.S. 140, 155]\n\u00a0\n shall take into consideration any damage occasioned to other land as well as that to the land overflowed ( 14). A graver doubt is raised by another argument. It is decided that the prior right is gained by the dam first begun, provided it is completed and put in operation within a reasonable time. If, as in the present case, the upper owner builds a dam in the meantime, it may be held that he is entitled to no compensation for its being rendered useless, even if he builds without notice of the earlier appropriation, as well might happen. On the other hand if he refrains from using his land as he desires, he may be denied compensation for being deprived of the use of his land. We do not perceive why the latter result should follow. As to the former, it may be held that, notwithstanding the priority of the lower owner, the upper owner has a right to improve his land until it actually is flowed. Otherwise the former might have it in his power to keep the latter in suspense for a year or two, and then abandon his dam. Because the plaintiff was too late to prohibit the defendant's dam, it does not follow that it may not be entitled to all the damages which it suffers when the flowing takes place. That it would be entitled to them perhaps may be inferred from Baird v. Wells, 22 Pick. 312, decided under a different statute, but still applicable so far as this principle is concerned. See further, Storm v. Manchaug Co. 13 Allen, 10, 15; Edwards v. Bruorton, 184 Mass. 529, 532, 69 N. E. 328.\n The state court has confined itself to a general declaration that the act is valid, and has not expressed itself definitely upon these points. Yet our opinion upon the constitutional question may depend upon its interpretation of the statute in a case which could not be brought here. Obviously, it would be unjust that the plaintiff should be concluded upon a doubtful construction assumed by us which the state court hereafter may not adopt. Therefore it seems to us proper that this bill should be dismissed without prejudice, or retained until the plaintiff's rights shall have been determined in the proceedings for damages under the statutes, which it is admitted have been \n\n[201 U.S. 140, 156]\n\u00a0\n brought. The objection to the act on the ground of want of notice does not impress us except in its bearing upon the point just mentioned. The right of the lower owner only becomes complete when the land is flowed, and as, even then, it is not a right to maintain the water upon the plaintiff's land, but merely a right to maintain the dam, subject to paying for the harm actually done, we see nothing to complain of in that regard.\n Decree modified and affirmed. \n\n\n\n","121":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nOWENSBORO WATER WORKS CO. v. CITY OF OWENSBORO(1906)\nNo. 145\nArgued: Decided: January 2, 1906\n\n\n\n\n[200 U.S. 38, 39]\n\u00a0\n The plaintiff in this suit, the Owensboro Waterworks Company, is a private corporation of Kentucky, while the defendant, the city of Owensboro, is a municipal corporation of the same commonwealth.\n The bill was dismissed for want of jurisdiction in the court below to hear and determine the cause, the circuit court being of opinion that the suit was not one arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States, and the matter in dispute not of sufficient value to give that court jurisdiction.\n The case made by the bill was this:\n On the 10th day of October, 1900, the common council of Owensboro adopted an ordinance authorizing the borrowing of money, upon the city's bonds, for the purpose of erecting a system of waterworks for supplying the city of Owensboro and its inhabitants with water. The ordinance provided for a submission to the voters of the question of issuing city bonds to the amount of $200,000, with which to raise money for the purpose just stated.\n The election was held and the proposition was carried, more than two thirds of those voting approving the proposed issue of bonds.\n By an ordinance of December 3d, 1900, bonds to the amount of $200,000 were directed to be issued, and $14,666.66 was appropriated \n\n[200 U.S. 38, 40]\n\u00a0\n out of the revenues and public moneys of the city for the payment of the semiannual interest on the bonds, and the creation of a fund for the ultimate payment of the principal thereof, such fund to be designated as the Owensboro water bond account.\n By an ordinance approved March 11th, 1901, $14,666.66 was appropriated and set apart out of the revenues and funds of the city, to be raised by taxation or otherwise, each year, until the bonds were paid, for the purpose of paying the interest on the bonds semiannually, and for creating a sinking fund for the payment of the principal of the bonds. And, for the purpose of providing a fund for that purpose, it was ordained, the bill alleged, that there should be, and that there was thereby, levied upon all the taxable property of said city subject by law to taxation for municipal purposes, a direct annual tax for the year 1901, and for each succeeding year up to and including the year 1931, sufficient to raise the said sum of $14,666.66, to be collected annually with other municipal taxes, licenses, revenues, and public dues, and continuing from year to year until the ultimate payment of the bonds; and it was also, by the ordinance, ordained that no part of said funds should ever be used for, or appropriated to, any other purpose or use, except the payment of the principal and interest of the bonds; further, that provision to meet the requirements of said section be made in the annual budget and appropriation ordinance.\n Pursuant to the ordinance of December 3d, 1900, the city executed 200 bonds of $1,000 each, bearing 4 1\/2 per cent interest per annum from their date,-January 1st, 1901,-payable semiannually, and transferable by delivery, and at the date of the bringing of this suit all of those bonds were, the bill alleged, in the possession or under the control of the city, 'ready and about to be immediately sold and delivered to purchasers, with the exception of 7 bonds which the said mayor and council have already sold, and have received therefor the sum of $7,000.'\n In each of the years 1901, 1902, and 1903, the city, proceeding under ordinances adopted by the common council, levied an \n\n[200 U.S. 38, 41]\n\u00a0\n ad valorem tax of $2 on each $100 worth of property in the city subject to taxation, part of such tax-$14,666.66-to be appropriated annually for the payment of interest on the water bonds and for the creation of a sinking fund for the ultimate payment of the principal. A similar tax was also levied for 1904, of which $14,666.66 was appropriated to pay interest and create a sinking fund,-$8,000 to be paid on interest, and $6,666.66 to go into the sinking fund. So that under the levies made in 1901, 1902, and 1903, $44,000 had been collected for interest and the sinking fund, and $ 14,666.66 was to be collected for 1904\n\n\n Of the 200 bonds actually signed, 193 remain in the hands of the city, its officers and agents, and after applying the sum of $44,000, collected under the levies of 1901, 1902, and 1903, and the $14,666.66, to be collected under the levy of 1904, there will remain only $149,000 to be raised by the sale of bonds. Nevertheless, the city, by its agents and officers, claims to have authority, and proposes immediately to sell and dispose of, and, unless restrained, will sell and dispose of, the entire 193 bonds, amounting to $193,000. If that be done, then the city will have collected and realized $244,000 on account of the erection of the waterworks; whereas it was only authorized to raise $200,000 for that purpose. Of the $44,000 collected by the city, $20,000 has been expended for land on which the proposed water plant was to be erected, while $24, 000 has been illegally expended for purposes other than those for which it was collected.\n The bill further alleges that for each of the years 1901, 1902, and 1903, taxes were levied on the taxable property of plaintiff and other taxpayers of the city; that capitation, license, and franchise taxes were also assessed, levied, and collected by it; that all the taxes so levied were collected each year, from all sources, and for all purposes, were expended and exhausted each year, and none so collected, in either of said years, are now on hand; that no part of the $44,000 collected is on hand, nor has said city any means of replacing same, except by levying \n\n[200 U.S. 38, 42]\n\u00a0\n and collecting taxes from the taxpayers of said city for that purpose, and this it had no legal authority to do; that by the payment of the $44,000 the city paid and extinguished that amount of bonds, and bonds to that amount should be surrendered by said city and canceled, and that by law complainant and other taxpayers have the right to have said bonds so surrendered and canceled.\n The bill proceeds: 'Your orator says said bonds are negotiable by delivery, and are on the footing of commercial obligations, and if said 193 bonds, or any of them, shall be sold and transferred for value, to innocent bona fide purchasers, then complainant and all other taxpayers of said city would be compelled to pay the full amount of all of said 200 bonds, and the full amount of all interest accrued, or to accrue thereon. It says defendant and its officers and agents purpose, and are now endeavoring, to immediately sell and transfer said 193 bonds, and coupons attached, to some person for value, and are doing this without giving such persons any notice or information of the facts herein stated, or of any facts pertaining to the collection or disposition of any part of said $44, 000, and purpose to continue said efforts without giving to any person, to whom said bonds may be offered, any notice or information pertaining thereto, and said prospective purchasers have no notice, knowledge, or information of any of said facts, so far as complainant is advised or believes, and, unless restrained and prevented, defendant and its officers and agents will immediately sell said bonds and coupons to some person or persons, for value, who have no notice or information in regard to said transaction, and will do so without giving such persons any notice or information as to said facts, and thus complainant and its property, and said other taxpayers and their property, will be burthened with the payment of said entire 200 bonds and interest, and, by the means aforesaid, and without due process of law, deprived of the right to have credit on said debt for said $44,000 heretofore paid by them, and be compelled to pay said 200 bonds and all interest accrued and to accrue thereon. \n\n[200 U.S. 38, 43]\n\u00a0\n 'Your orator says that by article 14 of the Amendments to the Constitution of the United States it is provided that no state shall 'deprive any person of lief, liberty, or property, without due process of law;' but your orator says that if more than 149 of said bonds shall be sold to innocent purchasers, without notice, which defendant city is about to do, that it and the taxpayers for whom it sues, will be forced to pay such excess, both principal and interest, without opportunity to plead, or to be heard as to matters herein alleged, and so deprived of their property without due process of law, and the amount in controversy here exceeds $2,000.'\n The relief prayed was that the defendant, its officers and agents, be perpetually enjoined and restrained from selling or disposing of any of the bonds in excess of 149 in number, and, before selling them, to detach and destroy all coupons for interest that have heretofore matured or that may mature before the date when the bonds may be sold, and be ordered and compelled to cancel and surrender all of the bonds, and all coupons pertaining thereto, in excess of 149, and that the bonds and coupons be destroyed, and if the $14,666.66 levied May 16th, 1904, should be collected before the sale was made of the bonds, that said sum be applied to the extinguishment of the debt and interest, and the bonds and interest coupons be destroyed, and not sold, as prayed for in regard to the money heretofore collected; also that defendant be enjoined and restrained from levying and collecting from complainant and all the other taxpayers of the city, or their property, any taxes in excess of a sufficient amount to create a sinking fund with which to pay the 149 bonds, when sold, and the 7 bonds, already sold, and to pay the interest to accrue thereon upon the 7 bonds heretofore sold, and to accrue upon the 149 bonds, after they were sold.\n The plaintiff further prayed that the sum of $44,000, paid by the taxpayers of the city, be adjudged to have satisfied that amount of the bonds, and that it have such further or other relief in the premises as the nature of the case required. \n\n[200 U.S. 38, 44]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John D. Atchison, William T. Ellis, and Little & Slack for appellant.\n Mr. Charles S. Walker for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan delivered the opinion of the court:\n The bill presents the case of the diversion, or the intended diversion, by a municipal corporation, of certain funds which, under legislative sanction, it had collected from taxpayers for a specific public object, which funds were not applied to the object for which they were raised, and which failure of duty on the part of the corporation so to apply them may ultimately cause increased taxation if the full amount originally intended to be applied to the particular object named by the legislature is to be collected. \n\n[200 U.S. 38, 45]\n\u00a0\n We share with the court below the difficulty in understanding how such a case can be regarded as one arising under the Constitution of the United States. It certainly must be one of that character in order to sustain the jurisdiction of the circuit court,-the parties all being citizens of Kentucky.\n In support of their contention that the present suit arises under the Constitution of the United States, and is within the original cognizance of the circuit court, without regard to the citizenship of the parties, the learned counsel for the appellant cites certain cases in this court which hold that the prohibitions of the 14th Amendment 'refer to all the instrumentalities of the state,-to its legislative, executive, and judicial authorities,'-and consequently, 'whoever, by virtue of public position under a state government, deprives another of any right protected under that amendment against deprivation by the state, violates the constitutional inhibition; and, as he acts in the name and for the state, and is clothed with the state's power, his act is that of the state.'

Chicago, \n166 \nU.S. 226, 235\n, 41 S. L. ed. 979, 984, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 581.\n These were all cases in which the right sought to be protected was held to have been granted or secured by the Constitution of the United States, but yet was violated by some agency or instrumentality proceeding under the sanction or authority of the state. But no right involved in the present case has its origin in, or is secured by, the Constitution of the United States. It is not contended that the legislative enactments, by the authority of which the city intends to establish and maintain a system of waterworks, are inconsistent either with the Constitution of Kentucky or the Constitution of the United States. The plaintiff, however complains that the defendant city has not properly discharged its duties under the laws of the state. For the purposes of the present discussion, let this be taken as true; still, maladministration of its local affairs by a city's constituted \n\n[200 U.S. 38, 46]\n\u00a0\n authorities cannot rightfully concern the national, government, unless it involves the infringement of some Federal right. If the city authorities have received funds from taxation which ought strictly to have been applied to take up or cancel the bonds of the city, but have been used for other municipal purposes, and if, by reason of such misapplication of those funds, taxation may ultimately come upon the people for an amount beyond what the legislature originally intended,-if nothing more can be said,-the remedy must be found in the courts and tribunals of the state, and not in the Federal courts of original jurisdiction, where the controversy is wholly, as it is here, between citizens of the same state. When a Federal court acquires jurisdiction of a controversy by reason of the diverse citizenship of the parties, then it may dispose of all the issues in the case, determining the rights of parties under the same rules or principles that control when the case is in the state court. But, as between citizens of the same state, the Federal court may not interfere to compel municipal corporations or other like state instrumentalities to keep within the limits of the power conferred upon them by the state, unless such interference is necessary for the protection of a Federal right. There has been no actual invasion here of any right secured by the Constitution of the United States; nothing more, taking the allegations of the bill to be true, than a failure of a municipal corporation to properly discharge the duties which, under the laws of the state, it owes to its people and taxpayers. And there is here no deprivation of property without due process of law within the meaning of the 14th Amendment, even if it be apprehended that the defendant city may, at some future time, impose a tax in violation of its duty under the laws of the state.\n The utmost that can be said of the present case, as disclosed by the bill, is that the municipal authorities of Owensboro have done some things outside or in excess of any power the city possessed. But this does not of itself show that they acted without the due process of law enjoined by the 14th \n\n[200 U.S. 38, 47]\n\u00a0\n AMENDMENT; FOR, IF WHAT IS COMPLAINED Of Had been done directly by the state or by its express authority, or if the legislature could legally ratify that which the city has done, as it undoubtedly might do, no one would contend that there had been a violation of the due process clause of the amendment. It cannot be that the acts of a municipal corporation are wanting in the due process of law ordained by the 14th Amendment, if such acts, when done or ratified by the state, would not be inconsistent with that amendment. Many acts done by an agency of a state may be illegal in their character when tested by the laws of the state, and may, on that ground, be assailed, and yet they cannot, for that reason alone, be impeached as being inconsistent with the due process of law enjoined upon the states. The 14th Amendment was not intended to bring within Federal control everything done by the state or by its instrumentalities that is simply illegal under the state laws, but only such acts by the states or their instrumentalities as are violative of rights secured by the Constitution of the United States. A different view would give to the 14th Amendment a far wider scope than was contemplated at the time of its adoption, or than would be consonant with the authority of the several states to regulate and administer the rights of their peoples, in conformity with their own laws, subject always, but only, to the supreme law of the land.\n We are of opinion that this suit is not one arising under the Constitution of the United States, and, therefore, the parties being all citizens of Kentucky, it is not one of which the circuit court could take original cognizance.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","122":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPEARSON v.

Ct. Rep. 805. It is a writ of habeas corpus, addressed to the Secretary of Commerce and Labor and to the commissioner of immigration of the port of New York, on which the circuit court made an order discharging the petitioners, but the circuit court of appeals reversed the order by a divided court. 136 Fed. 734. The return to the writ discloses that the petitioners are British aliens, that they arrived in New York on February 1, 1904, were detained for examination by a board of special inquiry, were examined, and were allowed to land. The return further shows that afterwards, in March, they were arrested by order of the said Secretary, and after another hearing before a board of special inquiry were ordered to be returned to England, as being in this country in violation of the acts of Congress touching the matter. The only question is whether the Secretary had the right to direct the second hearing and to make the order of deportation under  21 of the act of March 3, 1903, chap. 1012, when there had been an inquiry at the time of the petitioners' landing, and a decision in their favor under  25, 32 Stat. at L. 1218, 1220 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1905, Supp. pp. 284, 287). It is proper to add, as giving more dramatic force to the contention of the petitioners, that the proceedings upon both inquiries are incorporated into the return by reference, and that they appear to have been before the same persons, upon the same question, namely, whether the petitioners came to this country under contract to perform labor, contrary to the statutes of the United States.

The following section,  25, directs the appointment of such boards as shall be necessary for the prompt determination of cases of aliens detained, to consist of three members, to be selected from the immigrant officials in the service. 'Such boards shall have authority to determine whether an alien who has been duly held shall be allowed to land or be deported.' They are to keep records, 'and the decision of any two members of a board shall prevail and be final,' subject to appeal by the alien or a dissenting member 'through the commissioner of immigration at the port of arrival and the Commissioner General of Immigration, to the Secretary of the Treasury' (now the Secretary of Commerce and Labor, act of February 14, 1903, chap. 552,  4, 7, 10 [32 Stat. at L. 826, 828, 829, U.

In this case the first decision of the board was unanimous, and the petitioners contend that it was final by the very words of the act.\n On the other hand, it is provided by  21 'that in case the Secretary of the Treasury shall be satisfied that an alien has been found in the United States in violation of this act, he shall cause such alien, within the period of three years after landing or entry therein, to be taken into custody and returned to the country whence he came,' with details as to the method. It is insisted by the government that this power is not qualified or cut down by  25. Of course, if the government is right on the construction of the act, there is no question of the validity of the provision. By that construction the finality given to the decision of the board is only a finality consistent with and subject to  21, as, conversely, by that contended for on the other side, the power of the Secretary is subject to  25. \n\n[202 U.S. 281, 284]\n\u00a0\n On the former view the United States admits aliens conditionally, and preserves that condition notwithstanding a preliminary decision in their favor by a board which it provides. The authority of Congress to impose such conditions hardly was disputed and is not open to doubt. Lem Moon Sing v. United States, \n158 \nU.S. 538, 543\n, 39 S. L. ed. 1082, 1084, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 967; Nishimura Ekiu v. United States, \n142 U.S. 651\n, 35 L. ed. 1146, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 336; Japanese Immigrant Case, \n189 \nU.S. 86, 97\n, 99 S., 47 L. ed. 721, 724, 725, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 611. The only question is what it has done.\n Some meaning must be found for  21, no less than for  25. For the petitioners it is said that  21 is satisfied by confining the power of the Secretary to cases where a board of special inquiry has not acted. But this would limit his action to a very narrow scope, since the act provides for such a board in every case where the alien does not appear to the inspector 'to be clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to land.' Section 24, quoted above. Again, it would defeat, in great measure, the policy of the original act of October 19, 1888, chap. 1210,  1 (25 Stat. at L. 566, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1294), (see also act of March 3, 1891, chap. 551,  11 [26 Stat. at L. 1086, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1299]), which obviously was to give a chance for fuller investigation than is possible at the moment of landing, when any inquiry necessarily must be of a very summary sort. See Japanese Immigrant Case, \n189 \nU.S. 86, 99\n, 47 S. L. ed. 721, 725, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 611. Yet this policy is emphasized and reinforced by changing the period of probation from one year to three, while in other respects  21 follows almost literally the words of the earlier act. The petitioners' construction also would empty the requirement in  20 that 'any alien who shall come into the United States in violation of law' shall be deported, of the greater part of its natural meaning, since it would limit it to such aliens only as appeared to the inspector to be entitled beyond a doubt to land, and for that reason escaped a board of special inquiry before they came in.\n Turning now to  25, that section seems to us to disclose additional reasons on the government's side. The board is an instrument of the executive power, not a court. It is made up, as we have mentioned, of the immigrant officials in the \n\n[202 U.S. 281, 285]\n\u00a0\n service, subordinates of the commissioner of immigration, whose duties are declared to be administrative by  23. Decisions of a similar type long have been recognized as decisions of the executive department, and cannot constitute res judicata in a technical sense. Nishimura Ekiu v. United States, supra; Fong Yue Ting v. United States, \n149 \nU.S. 698, 713\n, 37 S. L. ed. 905, 913, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1016; Lem Moon Sing v. United States, \n158 U.S. 538\n, 39 L. ed. 1082, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 967; Fok Yung Yo v. United States, \n185 \nU.S. 296, 305\n, 46 S. L. ed. 917, 921, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 686; Japanese Immigrant Case, \n189 \nU.S. 86, 98\n, 47 S. L. ed. 721, 724, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 611; United States v. Ju Toy, \n198 \nU.S. 253, 263\n, 49 S. L. ed. 1040, 1044, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 644. The decisions necessarily are made, as we have said, in a summary way, in order to reach the 'prompt determination' declared by  25 to be an object. The board has no power to compel witnesses to attend, but, as was said by the circuit court of appeals, must decide upon such evidence as is at hand or is readily accessible. These are considerations against the likelihood that Congress meant such decisions to be binding upon the Secretary of Commerce and Labor, the superior officer of the members of the board. On the other hand, there is a plain and sufficient meaning for the words making their decision final, and that is, that it shall be final where it is most likely to be questioned,-in the courts.\n It is true that the decision hardly will be questioned in the courts except when it is against the right to land. In the earlier acts the decision of an inspector was made final in terms, only 'when adverse to such right.' Act of March 3, 1891, chap. 551,  8 (26 Stat. at L. 1085, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1298). Since then, it is said, Congress has gone on increasing the importance of the decision, first, by providing a board in cases of doubt, with a limited appeal (act of March 3, 1893, chap. 206 ,  5 [27 Stat. at L. 570, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1302]), and then by enlarging the right of appeal and extending the finality of the ultimate decision to every case, by the present  25. But this appears to us to strain and even pervert the conclusions to be drawn from the change. There can be no doubt, we think, that the provision of the act of 1891 referred to the courts. The adverse decision of an inspector would be followed by deportation unless that should be stopped by habeas corpus. To \n\n[202 U.S. 281, 286]\n\u00a0\n prevent a retrial in that event the provision was passed. It is not likely that the purpose was changed when the words 'when adverse to such right' were dropped. More probably they were omitted simply as superfluous. If the question ever could arise in the courts, except when the alien was ordered to be deported, there was no reason why the decision to admit should not be given an effect equal to that of a decision to exclude. If the question could arise only in the former case, there was no need of the omitted clause. But the matter which was before the mind of Congress presumably was that which had been before it on the former occasion, which had been the subject of judicial discussion (Lem Moon Sing v. United States, supra; Fok Yung Yo v. United States, \n185 \nU.S. 296, 304\n, 305 S., 46 L. ed. 917, 921, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 686), and which was not quite disposed of until the last term of this court (United States v. Ju Toy, \n198 U.S. 253\n, 49 L. ed. 1040, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 644).\n There was a suggestion at the argument that the decision of the Secretary was not warranted by the evidence. But if, for the purposes of decision, we assume that question to be open, we do not think that it needs discussion. We are of opinion that the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals was right.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice Harlan, Mr. Justice Brewer, and Mr. Justice Peckham dissent. \n\n\n\n","123":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPEOPLE OF STATE OF NEW YORK EX REL. NEW YORK CENT. & H. R. R. CO.(1906)\nNo. 81\nArgued: April 9, 1906Decided: May 28, 1906\n\n\n\n\n[202 U.S. 584, 585]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Albert H. Harris, Ira A. Place, and Thomas Emery for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[202 U.S. 584, 590]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Julius M. Mayer and Horace McGuire for defendant in error.\n\n\n[202 U.S. 584, 593]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n These cases arise upon writs of certiorari, issued under the state law and addressed to the state comptroller for the time being, to revise taxes imposed upon the relator for the years 1900, 1901, 1902, 1903, and 1904, respectively. The tax was levied under New York Laws of 1896, chap. 908,  182, which, so far as material, is as follows: 'Franchise Tax on Corporations.-Every Every corporation . . . incorporated . . . under . . . law in this state, shall pay to the state treasurer annually, an annual tax, to be computed upon the basis of the amount of its capital stock employed within this state and upon each dollar of such amount,' at a certain rate, if the dividends amount to 6 per cent or more upon the par value of such capital stock. 'If such dividend or dividends amount to less than 6 per centum on the par value of the capital stock [as was the case with the relator], the tax shall be at the rate of 1 1\/2 mills upon such portion of the capital stock at par as the amount of capital employed within this state bears to the entire capital of the corporation.' It is provided further by the same section that every foreign corporation, etc., 'shall pay a like tax for the privilege of exercising its corporate franchises or carrying on its business in such corporate or organized capacity in this state, to be computed upon the basis of the capital employed by it within this state.'\n The relator is a New York corporation, owning or hiring lines without as well as within the state, having arrangements with other carriers for through transportation, routing, and rating, and sending its cars to points without as well as within the state, and over other lines as well as its own. The cars are often out of the relator's possession for some time, and may be transferred to many roads successively, and even may be used by other roads for their own independent business, before they \n\n[202 U.S. 584, 594]\n\u00a0\n return to the relator or the state. In short, by the familiar course of railroad business a considerable portion of the relator's cars constantly is out of the state, and on this ground the relator contended that that proportion should be deducted from its entire capital, in order to find the capital stock employed within the state. This contention the comptroller disallowed.\n The writ of certiorari in the earliest case, No. 81, with the return setting forth the proceedings of the comptroller, Knight, and the evidence given before him, was heard by the appellate division of the supreme court, and a reduction of the amount of the tax was ordered. 75 App. Div. 169, 77 N. Y. Supp. 401. On appeal, the court of appeals ordered the proceedings to be remitted to the comptroller, to the end that further evidence might be taken upon the question whether any of the relator's rolling stock was used exclusively outside of the state, with directions that, if it should be found that such was the fact, the amount of the rolling stock so used should be deducted. 173 N. Y. 255, 65 N. E. 1102. On rehearing of No. 81, and, with it, No. 82, before the comptroller, now Miller, no evidence was offered to prove that any of the relator's cars or engines were used continuously and exclusively outside of the state during the whole tax year. In the later cases it was admitted that no substantial amount of the equipment was so used during the similar period. But, in all of them, evidence was offered of the movements of particular cars, to illustrate the transfers which they went through before they returned, as has been stated, evidence of the relator's road mileage outside and inside of the state, and also evidence of the car mileage outside and inside of the state, in order to show, on one footing or the other, that a certain proportion of cars, although not the same cars, was continuously without the state during the whole tax year. The comptroller refused to make any reduction of the tax, and, the case being taken up again, his refusal was affirmed by the appellate division of the supreme court and by the court of appeals on the authority of the former dicision. 89 App. Div. 127, 85 N. Y. Supp. 1088, 177 N. Y. 584, 69 N. E. 1129. \n\n[202 U.S. 584, 595]\n\u00a0\n The later cases took substantially the same course. The relator saved the questions whether the statute, as construed, was not contrary to article 1 ,  8, of the Constitution of the United States, as to commerce among the states; article 1,  10, against impairing the obligation of contracts; article 4,  1, as to giving full faith and credit to the public acts of other states; and the 14th Amendment. It took out writs of error and brought the cases here.\n The argument for the relator had woven through it suggestions which only tended to show that the construction of the New York statute by the court of appeals was wrong. Of course, if the statute, as construed, is valid under the Constitution, we are bound by the construction given to it by the state court. In this case we are to assume that the statute purports and intends to allow no deduction from the capital stock taken as the basis of the tax, unless some specific portion of the corporate property is outside of the state during the whole tax year. We must assume, further, that no part of the corporate property in question was outside of the state during the whole tax year. The proposition really was conceded, as we have said, and the evidence that was offered had no tendency to prove the contrary. If we are to suppose that the reports offered in evidence were accepted as competent to establish the facts which they set forth, still it would be going a very great way to infer from car mileage the average number or proportion of cars absent from the state. For, as was said by a witness, the reports show only that the cars made so many miles, but it might be ten or it might be fifty cars that made them. Certainly no inference whatever could be drawn that the same cars were absent from the state all the time.\n In view of what we have said it is questionable whether the relator has offered evidence enough to open the constitutional objections urged against the tax. But, as it cannot be doubted, in view of the well-known course of railroad business, that some considerable proportion of the relator's cars always is absent from the state, it would be unsatisfactory to turn the \n\n[202 U.S. 584, 596]\n\u00a0\n case off with a merely technical answer, and we proceed. The most salient points of the relator's argument are as follows: This tax is not a tax on the franchise to be a corporation, but a tax on the use and exercise of the franchise of transportation. The use of this or any other franchise outside the state cannot be taxed by New York. The car mileage within the state and that upon other lines without the state affords a basis of apportionment of the average total of cars continuously employed by other corporations without the state, and the relator's road mileage within and without the state affords a basis of apportionment of its average total equipment continuously employed by it respectively within and without the state. To tax on the total value within and without is beyond the jurisdiction of the state, a taking of property without due process of law, and an unconstitutional interference with commerce among the states.\n A part of this argument we have answered already. But we must go further. We are not curious to inquire exactly what kind of a tax this is to be called. If it can be sustained by the name given to it by the local courts, it must be sustained by us. It is called a franchise tax in the act, but it is a franchise tax measured by property. A tax very like the present was treated as a tax on the property of the corporation in Delaware, L. & W. R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n198 \nU.S. 341, 353\n, 49 S. L. ed. 1077, 1081, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 669. This seems to be regarded as such a tax by the court of appeals in this case. See People ex rel. Commercial Cable Co. v. Morgan, 178 N. Y. 433, 439, 67 L. R. A. 960, 70 N. E. 967. If it is a tax on any franchise which the state of New York gave, and the same state could take away, it stands at least no worse. The relator's argument assumes that it must be regarded as a tax of a particular kind, in order to invalidate it, although it might be valid if regarded as the state court regards it.\n Suppose, then, that the state of New York had taxed the property directly, there was nothing to hinder its taxing the whole of it. It is true that it has been decided that property, even of a domestic corporation, cannot be taxed if it is perma- \n\n[202 U.S. 584, 597]\n\u00a0\n nently out of the state. Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Kentucky, \n199 \nU.S. 194, 201\n, 211 S., 50 L. ed. --, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 36; Delaware, L. & W. R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n198 U.S. 341\n, 49 L. ed. 1077, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 669; Louisville & J. Ferry Co. v. Kentucky, \n188 U.S. 385\n, 47 L. ed. 519, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 468. But it has not been decided, and it could not be decided, that a state may not tax its own corporations for all their property within the state during the tax year, even if every item of that property should be taken successively into another state for a day, a week, or six months, and then brought back. Using the language of domicil, which now so frequently is applied to inanimate things, the state of origin remains the permanent situs of the property, notwithstanding its occasional excursions to foreign parts. Ayer & L. Tie Co. v. Kentucky, \n202 U.S. 409\n, 50 L. ed. --, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 679. See also Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Kentucky, \n199 \nU.S. 194, 208\n, 209 S., 50 L. ed. --, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 36.\n It was suggested that this case is but the complement of Pullman's Palace Car Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n141 U.S. 18\n, 35 L. ed. 613, 3 Inters. Com. Rep. 595, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 876, and that, as there a tax upon a foreign corporation was sustained, levied on such proportion of its capital stock as the miles of track over which its cars were run within the state bore to the whole number of miles over which its cars were run, so here, in the domicil of such a corporation there should be an exemption corresponding to the tax held to be lawfully levied elsewhere. But, in that case, it was found that the 'cars used in this state have, during all the time for which tax is charged, been running into, through, and out of the state.' The same cars were continuously receiving the protection of the state, and, therefore, it was just that the state should tax a proportion of them. Whether, if the same amount of protection had been received in respect of constantly changing cars, the same principle would have applied, was not decided, and it is not necessary to decide now. In the present case, however, it does not appear that any specific cars or any average of cars was so continuously in any other state as to be taxable there. The absences relied on were not in the course of travel upon fixed routes, but random excursions of casually chosen cars, determined by the \n\n[202 U.S. 584, 598]\n\u00a0\n varying orders of particular shippers and the arbitrary convenience of other roads. Therefore we need not consider either whether there is any necessary parallelism between liability elsewhere and immunity at home.\n Judgments affirmed. \n\n\n\n","124":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPEORIA GAS & ELECTRIC CO. v. CITY OF PEORIA(1906)\nNo. 33\nArgued: October 30, 1905Decided: January 2, 1906\n\n\n\n\n[200 U.S. 48, 48]\n\u00a0\n This was a bill filed in the circuit court of the United States for the northern district of Illinois by the Peoria Gas & Electric Company to restrain the enforcement of an ordinance passed by the defendant, fixing the price of gas. A decree was entered in the circuit court dismissing the bill, and the case was brought directly here, as involving a constitutional question.\n The facts are these: Prior to 1899 for a period of many years the Peoria Gaslight & Coke Company had manufactured and furnished gas to the city of Peoria and its citizens. The business had been profitable and the stock was valuable. In 1899 the plaintiff company was organized to construct gas works in Peoria, and that city, by ondinance, granted to it a franchise permitting it to construct and operate a gas plant and lay mains along certain streets, etc. It is charged that in order to obtain \n\n[200 U.S. 48, 49]\n\u00a0\n this franchise the promoters of the plaintiff company represented that it was to be a Peoria company and enterprise, and that it would furnish gas at a cheaper rate than the old company; that in fact it was a scheme of certain Chicago capitalists, who, as soon as the ordinance was passed and the plant constructed, appeared as owners of substantially the entire stock. After the new company was organized and its plant constructed, the two companies became competitors, the competition being so sharp that in the early summer of 1900 the new company lowered its price to 30 cents per thousand cubic feet for both light and fuel gas. On July 31, 1900, after a conference between the managers of the two companies, both raised the rate to $1.15 net for light and 75 cents net for fuel gas, to take effect August 1, 1900. The announcements of this raise in the rates were published in the Peoria papers on the same day, each announcement being in precisely the same language. On September 4, 1900, the city passed an ordinance providing that the maximum price for gas should be 75 cents per thousand cubic feet, and that the gas to be furnished should not be less than eighteen candle power.\n On September 18, 1900, the plaintiff filed this bill of complaint, setting forth its organization, the ordinance under which it was given authority to occupy certain streets and that of September 4, 1900; alleged that the latter ordinance was invalid, as establishing a rate which was not remunerative, and in effect confiscatory, and was thus taking private property for public use without just compensation, and depriving the plaintiff of its property without due process of law. The city answered, narrating the circumstances attending the organization of the plaintiff and the passage of the ordinance authorizing it to occupy the streets and supply the city with gas, with the representation made at the time, and claimed an estoppel by reason thereof; showing also the rates which had been the result of competition, the raise in price by the two companies, charged that this was by agreement between the companies, alleged that the ordinance of September 4 was passed in good faith and to \n\n[200 U.S. 48, 50]\n\u00a0\n prevent extortion by the companies, and also that the rate fixed was reasonable. While the answer alleged that the fixing of the rates from the 1st of August was by agreement between the two corporations, it did not, in terms, plead that the agreement was in violation of any particular statute.\n By consent a special commissioner was appointed to take the proofs and report the same, with his findings and conclusions thereon. He took an enormous amount of testimony, the printed record in this court amounting to 1,780 pages. From it he found and reported that the rate prescribed by the ordinance of September 4 did not furnish compensation, was confiscatory in its effect, and therefore unreasonable. Exceptions were taken by both sides to different portions of his findings and conclusions of law. On a hearing before the circuit court the question of the reasonableness of the rates prescribed was ignored, the court found that the increase in rates on August 1, 1900, was the result of an illegal combination between the two gas companies, and in violation of the Illinois antitrust law of 1891, that, therefore, the plaintiff was not entitled to any relief against the ordinance of September 4, and entered a decree dismissing the bill.\n The antitrust act of Illinois, approved June 11, 1891 (Laws 1891, p. 206), forbids the entering into any 'pool, trust, agreement, combination, confederation, or understanding . . . to regulate or fix the price of any article of merchandise or commodity,' and punishes the same by fine. Sections 5 and 6 are as follows:\n'5. Any contract or agreement in violation of any provision of the preceding sections of this act shall be absolutely void.\n\n'6. Any purchaser of any article or commodity from any individual, company, or corporation transacting business contrary to any porvision of the preceding sections of this act shall not be liable for the price or payment of such article or commodity, and may plead this act as a defense to any suit for such price or payment.'\n\n Subsequently and in 1893 another act was passed, which was \n\n[200 U.S. 48, 51]\n\u00a0\n held by this court in Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co. \n184 U.S. 540\n, 46 L. ed. 679, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 431, to constitute class legislation, and to be void. An amendment in 1897 to the act of 1891 was subject to the same objection. The supreme court of Illinois has since held that the act of 1891 was not repealed by the act of 1893 or the amendment of 1897, and is still in force. People ex rel. Akin v.

Guthrie filed a brief on behalf of Darius O. Mills, party to another pending case involving the question of power of cities in Illinois to fix the price of gas.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Brewer:\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case was tried on one theory and decided on another. While that does not always and necessarily constitute error, yet, under the circumstances, as disclosed by the record, we \n\n[200 U.S. 48, 55]\n\u00a0\n are of opinion that injustice has probably resulted, and that there should be a reversal of the decree, and a further examination in the circuit court. As stated in the findings of the commissioner, the bill proceeds upon the theory that the ordinance of September 4, 1900, impaired the rights of contract theretofore existing between the parties, that its enforcement would constitute the taking of private property for public use without just compensation, that the penalties prescribed for a violation of the ordinance were exorbitant and not sanctioned by the laws of the state of Illinois, while the answer justified the provisions of the ordinance by the statements and representations made by the stockholders in the company to the city council at the time the plaintiff's franchise was sought, and alleged that the rate therein fixed was reasonable. On these questions the stress of the controversy was rested. The court entirely ignored them, and placed its decision on the single ground that the two companies had, by agreement, attempted to fix their prices, and therefore came within the scope of the Illinois antitrust law,-an act which had not been in terms referred to either in the pleadings or the report of the master.\n There was no positive evidence, and no finding by the commissioner, of an agreement between the two companies, and while, from their action, an inference might be drawn that they had entered into some agreement in respect to rates on August 1, 1900, neither its terms, scope, nor duration were shown. It also appears from the testimony that that rate was continued by the old company only until January 1, 1901, when an even rate of $1 per thousand was established, and that this latter rate was, on September 1, 1901, also established by the new company,-the plaintiff herein. Whether this action of the new company in adopting the rate which had been kept in force by the old company since January 1, 1901, was the result of agreement, or an independent act on its part, is not shown. It appears further that in October, 1901, the plaintiff entered into a contract with the old company to supply it with gas for the use of its customers, and that, the latter company desisting \n\n[200 U.S. 48, 56]\n\u00a0\n temporarily from manufacture, this contract continued in force until August 19, 1902; but this was found by the commissioner to have been a purely private business arrangement between the companies, and without relation to the charges made by either to its customers. Doubtless it, together with the evidence of changes in holding of stock, tended to show at least a cessation of competition between the two companies, if not of a unity of control or agreement between them.\n We shall assume that there was testimony from which the court justly found that the rates announced on August 1 were fixed by an agreement between the two companies. We shall also assume, though without deciding, that while that agreement was in force and the parties were acting under it neither could recover for the gas that it furnished, nor could this plaintiff question the validity of the ordinance of September 4. But although the stringent provisions of the Illinois antitrust law may apply to the case of an agreement between two gas companies, fixing the price of gas, and even if, while the receiving gas may avoid payment therefor on receiving gas may avoid payment therefore on that ground, and the city likewise be upheld in an ordinance establishing maximum rates which are not remunerative, yet the making of such an agreement does not subject the companies to a perpetual penalty. Parties making an agreement, unlawful by the antitrust act, may, while the agreement is in force, be subject to its penalties; but, whenever they cease to act under it, the penalties also cease. The punishment adheres to the offense, and stops when the offense itself stops. Now it is in evidence that the prices were changed by the old company on the 1st of January, 1901 (five months after the alleged agreement for a uniform rate), and that for months thereafter each company was charging a different rate; but the decree was one of absolute dismissal,-an adjudication that the ordinance of September 4 was valid,-an adjudication which became res judicata for all future litigation; and this in the face of the finding by the commissioner, undisturbed by the court, that the rates established by it are not remunerative, \n\n[200 U.S. 48, 57]\n\u00a0\n and thus work a gradual confiscation of the property belonging to the plaintiff.\n We think that under the circumstances the decree should be reversed and the case remanded with instructions either to refer it to a commissioner for further findings, with leave to take additional testimony, if that be deemed necessary, showing the terms and duration of the alleged agreement between the two companies and how far it was acted upon by them, or that the court should itself undertake this investigation and make like findings.\n The decree of the Circuit Court is reversed. \n\n\n\n","125":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPETTIBONE v. NICHOLS(1906)\nNo. 249\nArgued: Decided: December 3, 1906\n\n\n\n\n[203 U.S. 192, 193]\n\u00a0\n This is an appeal from a judgment of the circuit court of the United States for the district of Idaho, refusing, upon habeas corpus, to discharge the appellant, who alleged that he was held in custody by the sheriff of Canyon county, in that state, in violation of the Constitution and laws of the United States.\n It appears that on the 12th day of February, 1906, a criminal complaint verified by the oath of the prosecuting attorney of that county and charging Pettibone with having murdered Frank Steunenberg at Caldwell, Idaho, on the 30th day of December, 1905, was filed in the office of the probate judge. Thereupon, a warrant of arrest based upon that complaint having been issued, application was made to the governor of Idaho for a requisition upon the governor of Colorado (in which state the accused was alleged then to be) for the arrest of Pettibone, and his delivery to the agent of Idaho, to be conveyed to the latter state and there dealt with in accordance with law. The papers on which the governor of Idaho based his requisition distinctly charged that Pettibone was in that state at the time Steunenberg was murdered and was a fugitive from its justice.\n A requisition by the governor of Idaho was accordingly issued and was duly honored by the governor of Colorado, who issued a warrant commanding the arrest of Pettibone and his delivery to the authorized agent of Idaho, to be conveyed to the latter state. Pettibone was arrested under that warrant and carried to Idaho by its agent, and was there delivered by order of the probate judge into the custody of the warden \n\n[203 U.S. 192, 194]\n\u00a0\n of the state penitentiary, the jail of the county being deemed at that time an unfit place.\n On the 23d day of February, 1906, Pettibone sued out a writ of habeas corpus from the supreme court of Idaho. The warden made a return, stating the circumstances under which the accused came into his custody, and also that the charge against Pettibone was then under investigation by the grand jury. To this return the accused made an answer embodying the same matters as were alleged in the application for the writ of habeas corpus, and charging, in substance, that his presence in Idaho had been procured by connivance, conspiracy, and fraud on the part of the executive officers of Idaho, and that his detention was in violation of the provisions of the Constitution of the United States and of the act of Congress relating to fugitives from justice.\n Subsequently, March 7th, 1906, the grand jury returned an indictment against Pettibone, William D. Haywood, Charles H. Moyer, and John L. Simpkins, charging them with the murder of Steunenberg on the 30th of December, 1905, at Caldwell, Idaho. Having been arrested and being in custody under that indictment, the officer holding Pettibone made an amended return stating the fact of the above indictment, and that he was then held under a bench warrant based thereon.\n At the hearing before the supreme court of the state the officers having Pettibone in custody moved to strike from the answer of the accused all allegations relating to the manner and method of obtaining his presence within the state. That motion was sustained March 12th, 1906, and the prisoner was remanded to await his trial under the above indictment. The supreme court of Idaho held the action of the governor of Colorado to be at least quasi judicial and, in effect, a determination that Pettibone was charged with the commission of a crime in the former state and was a fugitive from its justice; that, after the prisoner came within the jurisdiction of the demanding state, he could not raise in its courts the question whether he was or had been, as a matter of fact, a fugitive from \n\n[203 U.S. 192, 195]\n\u00a0\n the justice of that state; that the courts of Idaho had no jurisdiction to inquire into the acts or motives of the executive of the state delivering the prisoner; that 'one who commits a crime against the laws of a state, whether committed by him while in person on its soil, or absent in a foreign jurisdiction, and acting through some other agency or medium, has no vested right of asylum in a sister state,' and the fact 'that a wrong is committed against him in the manner or method pursued in subjecting his person to the jurisdiction of the complaining state, and that such wrong is redressible either in the civil or criminal courts, can constitute no legal or just reason why he himself should not answer the charge against him when brought before the proper tribunal.' Ex parte Moyer, 85 Pac. 897; Ex parte Pettibone, 85 Pac. 902.\n From the judgment of the supreme court of Idaho a writ of error was prosecuted to this court. That case is No. 265 on the docket of the present term, but the record has not been printed. But the parties agree that the same questions are presented on this appeal as arise in that case, and as this case is one of urgency in the affairs of a state, we have acceded to the request that they may be argued and determined on this appeal.\n On the 15th of March, 1906, after the final judgment in the supreme court of Idaho, Pettibone made application to the circuit court of the United States, sitting in Idaho, for a writ of habeas corpus, alleging that he was restrained of his liberty by the sheriff of Canyon county, in violation of the Constitution and laws of the United States. As was done in the supreme court of Idaho, the accused set out numerous facts and circumstances which, he contended, showed that his personal presence in Idaho was secured by fraud and connivance on the part of the executive officers and agents of both Idaho and Colorado, in violation of the constitutional and statutory provisions relating to fugitives from justice. Consequently, it was argued, the court in Idaho did not acquire jurisdiction over his person. The officer having Pettibone in \n\n[203 U.S. 192, 196]\n\u00a0\n custody made return to the writ that he then held the accused under the bench warrant issued against him. It was stipulated that the application for the writ of habeas corpus might be taken as his answer to the return. Subsequently, on motion, that answer was stricken out by the circuit court as immaterial, the writ of habeas corpus was quashed, and Pettibone was remanded to the custody of the state.\n Messrs. Edmund F. Richardson, Clarence S. Darrow, and John H. Murphy for appellant.\n\n\n[203 U.S. 192, 199]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. James H. Hawley and W. E. Borah for appellee.\n\n\n[203 U.S. 192, 200]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justic e Harlan delivered the opinion of the court:\n As the application for the writ of habeas corpus was, by stipulation of the parties, taken as the answer of the accused to the return of the officer holding him in custody, and as that answer was stricken out by the court below as immaterial, we must, on this appeal, regard as true all the facts sufficiently alleged in the application, which, in a legal sense, bear upon the question whether the detention of the accused by the state authorities was in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States.\n That application is too lengthy to be incorporated at large in this opinion. It is sufficient to say that its allegations present the case of a conspiracy between the governors of Idaho and Colorado, and the respective officers and agents of those states, to have the accused taken from Colorado to Idaho under such circumstances and in such way as would deprive him, while in Colorado, of the privilege of invoking the jurisdiction of the courts there for his protection against wrongful deportation from the state,-it being alleged that the governor \n\n[203 U.S. 192, 201]\n\u00a0\n of Idaho, the prosecuting attorney of Canyon county, and the private counsel who advised them, well knew all the time that 'he was not in the state of Idaho on the 30th day of December, 1905, nor at any time near that date.' The application also alleged that the accused 'is not and was not a fugitive from justice; that he was not present in the state of Idaho when the alleged crime was alleged to have been committed, nor for months prior thereto, nor thereafter, until brought into the state as aforesaid.'\n In the forefront of this case is the fact that the appellant is held in actual custody for trial under an indictment in one of the courts of Idaho for the crime of murder, charged to have been committed in that state, against its laws, and it is the purpose of the state to try the question of his guilt or innocence of that charge.\n Undoubtedly, the circuit court had jurisdiction to discharge the appellant from the custody of the state authorities if their exercise of jurisdiction over his person would be in violation of any rights secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States. But that court had a discretion as to the time and mode in which, by the exercise of such power, it would, by its process, obstruct or delay a criminal prosecution in the state court. The duty of a Federal court to interfere, on habeas corpus, for the protection of one alleged to be restrained of his liberty in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, must often be controlled by the special circumstances of the case; and unless in some emergency demanding prompt action, the party held in custody by a state, and seeking to be enlarged, will be left to stand his trial in the state court, which, it will be assumed, will enforce-as it has the power to do equally with a court of the United States (Robb v. Connolly, \n111 \nU.S. 624, 637\n, 28 S. L. ed. 542, 546, 4 Sup. Ct. Rep. 544)-any right secured by the supreme law of the land. 'When the state court,' this court has said, 'shall have finally acted upon the case, the circuit court has still a discretion whether, under all the circumstances then existing, the accused, if convicted, shall be \n\n[203 U.S. 192, 202]\n\u00a0\n put to his writ of error from the highest court of the state, or whether it will proceed, by writ of habeas corpus, summarily to determine whether the petitioner is restrained of his liberty in violation of the Constitution of the United States.' Ex parte Royall, \n117 U.S. 241\n, 251- 253, 29 L. ed. 868, 871, 872, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 734. To the same effect are numerous cases in this court, among which may be named Ex parte Fonda, \n117 U.S. 516\n, 29 L. ed. 994, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 848; New York v. Eno, \n155 \nU.S. 89, 93\n, 39 S. L. ed. 80, 82, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 30; Cook v. Hart, \n146 \nU.S. 183, 192\n, 36 S. L. ed. 934, 939, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 40; Minnesota v. Brundage, \n180 \nU.S. 499, 501\n, 45 S. L. ed. 639, 640, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 455; Reid v. Jones, \n187 U.S. 153\n, 47 L. ed. 116, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 89; Riggins v. United States, \n199 \nU.S. 547, 549\n, 50 S. L. ed. 303, 304, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 147. This rule, firmly established for the guidance of the courts of the United States, is applicable here, although it appears that the supreme court of Idaho has already decided some of the questions now raised. But the question of Pettibone's guilt of the crime of having murdered Steunenberg has not, however, been finally determined, and cannot be except by a trial under the laws and in the courts of Idaho. If he should be acquitted by the jury, then no question will remain as to a violation of the Constitution and laws of the United States by the methods adopted to secure his personal presence within the state of Idaho.\n The appellant, however, contends that the principle settled in Ex parte Royall and other like cases can have application only where the state has legally acquired jurisdiction over the person of the accused, and cannot apply when, as is alleged to be the case here, his presence in Idaho was obtained by fraud and by a violation of rights guaranteed by the Constitution and laws of the United States. Under such circumstances, it is contended, no jurisdiction could legally attach for the purpose of trying the accused under the indictment for murder.\n In support of this view we have been referred to that clause of the Constitution of the United States providing that if 'a person charged in any state with treason, felony, or other crime, who shall flee from justice and be found in another state, shall, on demand of the executive authority of the state from which he fled, be delivered up, to be removed to the state having jurisdiction of the crime.' Art. 4,  2; \n\n[203 U.S. 192, 203]\n\u00a0\n also, to  5278 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3597), in which it is provided that 'whenever the executive authority of any state or territory demands any person as a fugitive from justice, of the executive authority of any state or territory to which such person has fled, and produces a copy of an indictment found or an affidavit made before a magistrate of any state or territory, charging the person demanded with having committed treason, felony, or other crime, certified as authentic by the governor or chief magistrate of the state or territory from whence the person so charged has fled, it shall be the duty of the executive authority of the state or territory to which such person has fled to cause him to be arrested and secured, and to cause notice of the arrest to be given to the executive authority making such demand, or to the agent of such authority appointed to receive the fugitive, and to cause the fugitive to be delivered to such agent when he shall appear. If no such agent appears within six months from the time of the arrest, the prisoner may be discharged. All costs or expenses incurred in the apprehending, securing, and transmitting such fugitive to the state or territory making such demand shall be paid by such state or territory.'\n Looking, first, at what was alleged to have occurred in the state of Colorado touching the arrest of the petitioner and his deportation from that state, we do not perceive that anything done there, however hastily or inconsiderately done, can be adjudged to be in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States. We pass by, both as immaterial and inappropriate, any consideration of the motives that induced the action of the governor of Colorado. This court will not inquire as to the motives which guided the chief magistrate of a state when executing the functions of his office. Manifestly, whatever authority may have been conferred upon the governor of Colorado by the Constitution or laws of his state, he was not required, indeed, was not authorized, by the Constitution or laws of the United States, to have the petitioner arrested, unless, within the meaning of such Consti- \n\n[203 U.S. 192, 204]\n\u00a0\n tution and laws, he was a fugitive from the justice of Idaho. Therefore he would not have violated his duty if it had been made a condition of surrendering the petitioner that evidence be furnished that he was a fugitive from justice within the meaning of the Constitution of the United States. Upon the governor of Colorado rested the responsibility of determining, in some proper mode, what the fact was. But he was not obliged to demand proof of such fact by evidence apart from the requisition papers. As those papers showed that the accused was regularly charged by indictment with the crime of murder committed in Idaho, and was a fugitive from its justice, the governor of Colorado was entitled to accept such papers, coming, as they did from the governor of another state, as prima facie sufficient for a warrant of arrest. His failure to require independent proof of the fact that petitioner was a fugitive from justice cannot be regarded as an infringement of any right of the petitioner under the Constitution or laws of the United States. Ex parte Reggel, \n114 \nU.S. 642, 652\n, 653 S., 29 L. ed. 250, 253, 254, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1148. In Munsey v Clough, \n196 \nU.S. 364, 372\n, 49 S. L. ed. 515, 516, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 282, this court said that the issuing of a warrant of arrest by the governor of the surrendering state, 'with or without a recital therein that the person demanded is a fugitive from justice, must be regarded as sufficient to justify the removal, until the presumption in favor of the legality and regularity of the warrant is overthrown by contrary proof in a legal proceeding to review the action of the governor. Roberts v. Reilly, \n116 \nU.S. 80, 95\n, 29 S. L. ed. 544, 549, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 291; Hyatt v. New York, \n188 U.S. 691\n, 47 L. ed. 657, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 456.' See also Re Keller, 36 Fed. 681, 686.\n But the petitioner contends that his arrest and deportation from Colorado was, by fraud and connivance, so arranged and carried out as to deprive him of an opportunity to prove, before the governor of that state, that he was not a fugitive from justice, as well as opportunity to appeal to some court in Colorado to prevent his illegal deportation from its territory. If we should assume, upon the present record, that the facts are as alleged, it is not perceived that they make a case of the \n\n[203 U.S. 192, 205]\n\u00a0\n violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States. It is true, as contended by the petitioner, that if he was not a fugitive from justice, within the meaning of the Constitution, no warrant for his arrest could have been properly or legally issued by the governor of Colorado. It is equally true that, even after the issuing of such a warrant, before his deportation from Colorado, it was competent for a court, Federal or state, sitting in that state, to inquire whether he was, in fact, a fugitive from justice, and, if found not to be, to discharge him from the custody of the Idaho agent, and prevent his deportation from Colorado. Robb v. Connolly, \n111 \nU.S. 624, 639\n, 28 S. L. ed. 542, 547, 4 Sup. Ct. Rep. 544; Ex parte Reggel,supra; Hyatt v. New York, \n188 \nU.S. 691, 719\n, 47 S. L. ed. 657, 664, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 456; Munsey v. Clough, \n196 \nU.S. 364, 374\n, 49 S. L. ed. 515, 517, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 282. But it was not shown by proof before the governor of Colorado that the petitioner, alleged in the requisition papers to be a fugitive from justice, was not one, nor was the jurisdiction of any court sitting in that state invoked to prevent his being taken out of the state and carried to Idaho. That he had no reasonable opportunity to present these facts before being taken from Colorado constitutes no legal reason why he should be discharged from the custody of the Idaho authorities. No obligation was imposed by the Constitution or laws of the United States upon the agent of Idaho to so time the arrest of the petitioner, and so conduct his deportation from Colorado, as to afford him a convenient opportunity, before some judicial tribunal sitting in Colorado, to test the question whether he was a fugitive from justice, and, as such, liable, under the act of Congress, to be conveyed to Idaho for trial there. In England, in the case of one arrested for the purpose of deporting him to another country, it is provided that there shall be no surrender of the accused to the demanding country until after the expiration of a specified time from the arrest, during which period the prisoner has an opportunity to institute habeas corpus proceedings. Extradition Act of 1870, 33 and 34 Vict. chap. 52,  11; 2 Butler, Treaty-Making Power,  436; 1 Moore, Extradition, 741, 742. There is no similar act of Congress in respect of a person \n\n[203 U.S. 192, 206]\n\u00a0\n arrested in one of the states of the Union as a fugitive from the justice of another state. The speediness, therefore, with which the Idaho agent removed the accused from Colorado, cannot be urged as a violation of a constitutional right, and constitutes no legal reason for discharging him from the custody of the state of Idaho.\n We come now to inquire whether the petitioner was entitled to his discharge upon making proof in the circuit court of the United States, sitting in Idaho, that he was brought into that state as a fugitive from justice when he was not, in fact, such a fugitive. Of course, it cannot be contended that the circuit court, sitting in Idaho, could rightfully discharge the petitioner upon proof simply that he did not commit the crime of murder charged against him. His guilt or innocence of that charge is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Idaho state court. The constitutional and statutory provisions referred to were based upon the theory that, as between the states, the proper place for the inquiry into the question of the guilt or innocence of an alleged fugitive from justice is in the courts of the state where the offense is charged to have been committed. The question, therefore, in the court below, was not whether the accused was guilty or innocent, but whether the Idaho court could properly be prevented from proceeding in the trial of that issue, upon proof being made in the circuit court of the United States, sitting in that state, that the petitioner was not a fugitive from justice, and not liable, in virtue of the Constitution and laws of the United States, to arrest in Colorado under the warrant of its governor, and carried into Idaho. As the petitioner is within the jurisdiction of Idaho, and is held by its authorities for trial, are the particular methods by which he was brought within her limits at all material in the proceeding by habeas corpus?\n It is contended by the state that this question was determined in its favor by the former decisions of this court. This is controverted by the petitioner, and we must therefore, and particularly because of the unusual character of this case and \n\n[203 U.S. 192, 207]\n\u00a0\n the importance of the questions involved, see what this court has heretofore adjudged.\n In Ker v. Illinois, \n119 U.S. 436\n, 30 L. ed. 421, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 225, it appeared that at the trial in an Illinois court of a person charged with having committed a crime against the laws of that state, the accused sought, by plea in abatement, to defeat the jurisdiction of the court upon the ground that, in violation of law, he had been seized in Peru, and forcibly brought against his will into the United States, and delivered to the authorities of Illinois; all of which the accused contended was in violation, not only of due process of law, as guaranteed by the 14th Amendment, but of the treaty between the United States and Peru, negotiated in 1870, and proclaimed in 1874. One of the articles of that treaty bound the contracting countries, upon a requisition by either country, to deliver up to justice persons who, being accused or convicted of certain named crimes committed within the jurisdiction of the requiring party, should seek an asylum or should be found within the territories of the other, the fact of the commission being so established 'as that the laws of the country in which the fugitive or the person so accused shall be found would justify his or her apprehension and commitment for trial if the crime had been there committed.' 18 Stat. at L. 719, 720. The plea stated, among other things, that the defendant protested against his arrest, and was refused opportunity, from the time of his being seized in Peru until he was delivered to the authorities of Illinois, of communicating with any person, or seeking any advice or assistance, in regard to procuring his release by legal process or otherwise.\n The court overruled the plea of abatement, and the trial in the state court proceeded, resulting in a verdict of guilty. The judgment was affirmed by the supreme court of Illinois, and this court affirmed, upon writ of error, the judgment of the latter court. It was held by the unanimous judgment of this court that, so far as any question of Federal right was involved, no error was committed by the state court; and that, notwithstanding the illegal methods pursued in bringing \n\n[203 U.S. 192, 208]\n\u00a0\n the accused within the jurisdiction of Illinois, his trial in the state court did not involve a violation of the due process clause of the Constitution, nor any article in the treaty with Peru, although the case was a clear one 'of kidnapping within the dominion of Peru, without any pretense of authority under the treaty or from the government of the United States.' The principle upon which the judgment rested was that, when a criminal is brought, or is in fact within the jurisdiction and custody of a state, charged with a crime against its laws, the state may, so far as the Constitution and laws of the United States are concerned, proceed against him for that crime, and need not inquire as to the particular methods employed to bring him into the state. The case, the court said, 'does not stand, when the party is in court, and required to plead to an indictment, as it would have stood upon a writ of habeas corpus in California, or in any state through which he was carried in the progress of this extradition, to test the authority by which he was held.' In meeting the contention that the accused Ker, by virtue of the treaty with Peru, acquired by his residence a right of asylum, this court said: 'There is no language in this treaty, or in any other treaty made by this country on the subject of extradition, of which we are aware, which says in terms that a party fleeing from the United States to escape punishment for crime becomes thereby entitled to an asylum in the country to which he has fled; indeed, the absurdity of such a proposition would at once prevent the making of a treaty of that kind. . . . It is idle, therefore, to claim that, either by express terms or by implication, there is given to a fugitive from justice in one of these countries any right to remain and reside in the other; and if the right of asylum means anything, it must mean this. The right of the government of Peru voluntarily to give a party in Ker's condition an asylum in that country is quite a different thing from the right in him to demand and insist upon security in such an asylum. The treaty, so far as it regulates the right of asylum at all, is intended to limit this right in the case of one who is proved to \n\n[203 U.S. 192, 209]\n\u00a0\n be a criminal fleeing from justice, so that, on proper demand and proceedings had therein, the government of the country of the asylum shall deliver him up to the country where the crime was committed. And to this extent, and to this alone, the treaty does regulate or impose a restriction upon the right of the government of the country of the asylum to protect the criminal from removal therefrom. . . . We think it very clear, therefore, that, in invoking the jurisdiction of this court upon the ground that the prisoner was denied a right conferred upon him by a treaty of the United States, he has failed to establish the existence of any such right.'\n If Ker, by virtue of the treaty with Peru, and because of his forcible and illegal abduction from that country, did not acquire an exemption from the criminal process of the courts of Illinois, whose laws he had violated, it is difficult to see how Pettibone acquired, by virtue of the Constitution and laws of the United States, an exemption from prosecution by the state of Idaho, which has custody of his person.\n An instructive case on this subject is Mahon v. Justice, \n127 U.S. 700\n, 32 L. ed. 283, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1204. The governor of Kentucky made a requisition upon the governor of West Virginia for Mahon, who was charged with the crime of murder in Kentucky, and was alleged to have fled from its jurisdiction and taken refuge in West Virginia. While the two governors were in correspondence on the subject, a body of armed men, without warrant or other legal process, arrested Mahon in West Virginia, and by force and against his will conveyed him out of West Virginia, and delivered him to the jailer of Pike county, Kentucky, in the courts of which he stood indicted for murder. Thereupon the governor of West Virginia, on behalf of that state, applied to the district court of the United States for the Kentucky dictrict for a writ of habeas corpus and his return to the jurisdiction of West Virginia. This court, after obsreving that the states of the Union were not absolutely sovereign, and could not declare war or authorize reprisals on other states, and that their ability to prevent the forcible abduction of persons from \n\n[203 U.S. 192, 210]\n\u00a0\n their territory consists solely in their power to punish all violations of their criminal laws committed within it, whether by their own citizens or by citizens of other states, said: 'If such violators have escaped from the jurisdiction of the state invaded, their surrender can be secured upon proper demand on the executive of the state to which they have fled. The surrender of the fugitives in such cases to the state whose laws have been violated is the only aid provided by the laws of the United States for the punishment of depredations and violence committed in one state by intruders and lawless bands from another state. The offenses committed by such parties are against the state; and the laws of the United States merely provide the means by which their presence can be secured in case they have fled from its justice. No mode is provided by which a person unlawfully abducted from one state to another can be restored to the state from which he was taken, if held upon any process of law for offenses against the state to which he has been carried. If not thus held he can, like any other person wrongfully deprived of his liberty, obtain his release on habeas corpus. Whether Congress might not provide for the compulsory restoration to the state of parties wrongfully abducted from its territory upon application of the parties, or of the state, and whether such provision would not greatly tend to the public peace along the borders of the several states, are not matters for present consideration. It is sufficient now that no means for such redress through the courts of the United States have as yet been provided. The abduction of Mahon by Phillips and his aids was made, as appears from the return of the respondent to the writ, and from the findings of the court below, without any warrant or authority from the governor of West Virginia. It is true that Phillips was appointed by the governor of Kentucky as agent of the state to receive Mahon upon his surrender on the requisition; but no surrender having been made, the arrest of Mahon and his abduction from the state were lawless and indefensible acts, for which Phillips and his aids may justly be \n\n[203 U.S. 192, 211]\n\u00a0\n punished under the laws of West Virginia. The process emanating from the governor of Kentucky furnished no ground for charging any complicity on the part of that state in the wrong done to the state of West Virginia.' Again: 'It is true, also, that the accused had the right, while in West Virginia, of insisting that he should not be surrendered to the governor of Kentucky by the governor of West Virginia, except in pursuance of the acts of Congress, and that he was entitled to release from any arrest in that state not made in accordance with them; but, having been subsequently arrested in Kentucky under the writs issued on the indictments against him, the question is not as to the validity of the proceeding in West Virginia, but as to the legality of his detention in Kentucky. There is no comity between the states by which a person held upon an indictment for a criminal offense in one state can be turned over to the authorities of another, though abducted from the latter. If there were any such comity, its enforcement would not be a matter within the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States. By comity nothing more is meant than that courtesy on the part of one state, by which within her territory the laws of another state are recognized and enforced, or another state is assisted in the execution of her laws. From its nature the courts of the United States cannot compel its exercise when it is refused; it is admissible only upon the consent of the state, and when consistent with her own interests and policy. Bank of Augusta v. Earle, 13 Pet. 519, 589, 10 L. ed. 274, 308; Story, Confl. Laws,  30. The only question, therefore, presented for our determination, is whether a person indicted for a felony in one state, forcibly abducted from another state, and brought to the state where he was indicted, by parties acting without warrant or authority of law, is entitled, under the Constitution or laws of the United States, to release from detention under the indictment by reason of such forcible and unlawful abduction.'\n After a review of the authorities, including the case of Ker v. Illinois, above cited, the court concluded: 'So, in this case, \n\n[203 U.S. 192, 212]\n\u00a0\n it is contended that, because, under the Constitution and laws of the United States, a fugitive from justice from one state to another can be surrendered to the state where the crime was committed, upon proper proceedings taken, he has the right of asylum in the state to which he has fled, unless removed in conformity with such proceedings, and that this right can be enforced in the courts of the United States. But the plain answer to this contention is, that the laws of the United States do not recognize any such right of asylum, as is here claimed on the part of a fugitive from justice in any state to which he has fled; nor have they, as already stated, made any provision for the return of parties who, by violence and without lawful authority, have been abducted from a state. There is, therefore, no authority in the courts of the United States to act upon any such alleged right. In Ker v. Illinois, the court said that the question of how far the forcible seizure of the defendant in another country, and his conveyance by violence, force, or fraud to this country could be made available to resist trial in the state court for the offense charged upon him, was one which it did not feel called upon to decide, for in that transaction it did not see that the Constitution, or laws, or treaties of the United States guaranteed to him any protection. So in this case we say that, whatever effect may be given by the state court to the illegal mode in which the defendant was brought from another state, no right secured under the Constitution or laws of the United States was violated by his arrest in Kentucky, and imprisonment there, upon the indictments found against him for murder in that state.'\n These principles determine the present case and require an affirmance of the judgment of the circuit court. It is true, the decision in the Mahon Case was by a divided court, but its authority is none the less controlling. The principle upon which it rests has been several times recognized and reaffirmed by this court, and is no longer to be questioned. It was held in Cook v. Hart, \n146 \nU.S. 183, 192\n, 36 S. L. ed. 934, 939, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 40, that the cases of Ker v. Illinois and Mahon v. Justice established these propositions: \n\n[203 U.S. 192, 213]\n\u00a0\n '1. That this court will not interfere to relieve persons who have been arrested and taken by violence from the territory of one state to that of another, where they are held under process legally issued from the courts of the latter state. 2. That the question of the applicability of this doctrine to a particular case is as much within the province of a state court, as a question of common law or of the law of nations, as it is of the courts of the United States;' in Lascelles v. Georgia, \n148 \nU.S. 537, 543\n, 37 S. L. ed. 549, 551, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 687, that it was settled in the Ker and Mahon Cases that, 'except in the case of a fugitive surrendered by a foreign government, there is nothing in the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States which exempts an offender, brought before the courts of a state for an offense against its laws, from trial and punishment, even though brought from another state by unlawful violence, or by abuse of legal process;' and in Adams v. New York, \n192 \nU.S. 585, 596\n, 48 S. L. ed. 575, 579, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 372 (the same cases being referred to), that 'if a person is brought within the jurisdiction of one state from another, or from a foreign country, by the unlawful use of force, which would render the officer liable to a civil action, or in a criminal proceeding, because of the forcible abduction, such fact would not prevent the trial of the person thus abducted in the state wherein he had committed an offense.' See also Re Johnson, \n167 \nU.S. 120, 127\n, 42 S. L. ed. 103, 105, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 735, in which the court recognized the principle that when a party in a civil suit has, by some trick or device, been brought within the jurisdiction of a court, he may have the process served upon him set aside; but that a different rule prevails in criminal cases involving the public interests.\n To the above citations we may add Re Moore, 75 Fed. 821, in which it appeared or was alleged that one accused of crime against the laws of a state, and in the custody of its authorities for trial, was brought back from another state as a fugitive from justice by means of an extradition warrant procured by false affidavits. In his application to the circuit court of the United States for a writ of habeas corpus the peti- \n\n[203 U.S. 192, 214]\n\u00a0\n tion stated facts and circumstances tending to show that he was not a fugitive from justice. The application was dismissed. After stating that the executive warrant issued by the surrendering state had performed its office, and that the petitioner was not held in virtue of it, the court said: 'His imprisonment is not illegal unless his extradition makes it so, and an illegal extradition is no greater violation of his rights of person than his forcible abduction. If a forcible abduction from another state and conveyance within the jurisdiction of the court holding him is no objection to his detention and trial for the offense charged, as held in Mahon v. Justice, \n127 U.S. 712\n, 32 L. ed. 287, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1204, and in Ker v. Illinois, \n119 U.S. 437\n, 30 L. ed. 421, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 225, no more is the objection allowed if the abduction has been accomplished under the forms of law. The conclusion is the same in each case. The act complained of does not relate to the restraint from which the petitioner seeks to be relieved, but to the means by which he was brought within the jurisdiction of the court under whose process he is held. It is settled that a party is not excused from answering to the state whose laws he has violated because violence has been done him in bringing him within the state. Moreover, if any injury was done in this case in issuing the requisition upon the state of Washington without grounds therefor, the injury was not to the petitioner, but to that state whose jurisdiction was imposed upon by what was done. The United States do not recognize any right of asylum in the state where a party charged with a crime committed in another state is found, nor have they made any provision for the return of parties who, by violence and without lawful authority, have been abducted from a state, and, whatever effect may be given by a state court to the illegal mode in which a defendant is brought from another state, no right secured under the Constitution and laws of the United States is violated by his arrest and imprisonment for crimes committed in the state into which he is brought. Mahon v. Justice, \n127 U.S. 715\n, 32 L. ed. 288, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1204.'\n The principle announced in the Mahon and other cases above \n\n[203 U.S. 192, 215]\n\u00a0\n cited was not a new one. It has been distinctly recognized in the courts of England and in many states of the Union. In Ex parte Scott (1829) 9 Barn. & C. 446, one accused of crime against the laws of England, and who was in custody for trial, sought to be discharged upon habeas corpus because she had been improperly apprehended in a foreign country. Lord Tenterden, Ch. J., said: 'The question, therefore, is this: Whether, if a person charged with a crime is found in this country, it is the duty of the court to take care that such a party shall be amenable to justice, or whether we are to consider the circumstances under which she was brought here. I thought, and still continue to think, that we cannot inquire into them. If the act complained of were done against the law of the foreign country, that country might have vindicated its own law. If it gave her a right of action she may sue upon it.' Some of the American cases, to the same general effect, are cited in Mahon v. Justice, namely: State v. Smith, 1 Bailey, 283, 19 Am. Dec. 679; State v. Brewster, 7 Vt. 118; State v. Ross, 21 Iowa, 467. See also Dow's Case, 18 Pa. 37; State v. Kealy, 89 Iowa, 94, 97, 56 N. W. 283; Ex parte Barker, 87 Ala. 4, 8, 13 Am. St. Rep. 17, 6 So. 7; People v. Pratt, 78 Cal. 345, 349, 20 Pac. 731; Church, Habeas Corpus,  483, and authorities cited in notes, and note to Re Fetter, 57 Am. Dec. 389, 400.\n It is said that the present case is distinguishable from the Mahon Case in the fact that the illegal abduction complained of in the latter was by persons who neither acted nor assumed to act under the authority of the state into the custody of whose authorities they delivered Mahon; whereas, in this case, it is alleged that Idaho secured the presence of Pettibone within its limits through a conspiracy on the part of its governor and other officers. This difference in the cases is not, we think, of any consequence as to the principle involved; for the question now is- and such was the fundamental question in Mahon's Case-whether a circuit court of the United States when asked, upon habeas corpus, to discharge a person held in actual custody by a state for trial in one of its courts \n\n[203 U.S. 192, 216]\n\u00a0\n under an indictment charging a crime against its laws, can properly take into account the methods whereby the state obtained such custody. That question was determined in the negative in the Ker and Mahon Cases. It was there adjudged that in such a case neither the Constitution nor laws of the United States entitled the person so held to be discharged from custody and allowed to depart from the state. If, as suggested, the application of these principles may be attended by mischievous consequences, involving the personal safety of individuals within the limits of the respective states, the remedy is with the lawmaking department of the government. Congress has long been informed by judicial decisions as to the state of the law upon this general subject.\n In this connection it may be well to say that we have not overlooked the allegation that the governor and other officers of Idaho well knew at the time the requisition was made upon the governor of Colorado, that Pettibone was not in Idaho on December 30th, 1905, nor at any time near that date, and had the purpose in all they did to evade the constitutional and statutory provisions relating to fugitives from justice. To say nothing of the impropriety of any such facts being made the subject of judicial inquiry in a Federal court, the issue thus attempted to be presented was wholly immaterial. Even were it conceded, for the purposes of this case, that the governor of Idaho wrongfully issued his requisition, and that the governor of Colorado erred in honoring it and in issuing his warrant of arrest, the vital fact remains that Pettibone is held by Idaho in actual custody for trial under an indictment charging him with crime against its laws, and he seeks the aid of the circuit court to relieve him from custody, so that he may leave that state and thereby defeat the prosecution against him without a trial. In the present case it is not necessary to go behind the indictment and inquire as to how it happened that he came within reach of the the process of the Idaho court in which the indictment is pending. And any investigation as to the motives which induced the action taken by \n\n[203 U.S. 192, 217]\n\u00a0\n the governors of Idaho and Colorado would, as already suggested, be improper as well as irrelevant to the real question to be now determined. It must be conclusively presumed that those officers proceeded throughout this affair with no evil purpose and with no other motive than to enforce the law.\n We perceive no error in the action of the Circuit Court, and its final order is affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna, dissenting:\n I am constrained to dissent from the opinion and judgment of the court. The principle announced, as I understand it, is that 'a circuit court of the United States, when asked upon habeas corpus, to discharge a person held in actual custody by a state for trial in one of its courts under an indictment charging a crime against its laws, cannot properly take into account the methods whereby the state obtained such custody.' In other words, and to illuminate the principle by the light of the facts in this case (facts, I mean, as alleged, and which we must assume to be true for the purpose of our discussion), that the officers of one state may falsely represent that a person was personally present in the state and committed a crime there, and had fled from its justice, may arrest such person and take him from another state, the officers of the latter knowing of the false accusation, and conniving in and aiding its purpose, thereby depriving him of an opportunity to appeal to the courts, and that such person cannot invoke the rights guaranteed to him by the Constitution and statutes of the United States in the state to which he is taken. And this, it is said, is supported by the cases of Ker v. Illinois, \n119 U.S. 436\n, 30 L. ed. 421, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 225, and Mahon v. Justice, \n127 U.S. 700\n, 32 L. ed. 283, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1204. These cases, extreme as they are, do not justify, in my judgment, the conclusion deduced from them. In neither case was the state the actor in the wrongs that brought within its confines the accused person. In the case at bar, the states, through their officers, are the \n\n[203 U.S. 192, 218]\n\u00a0\n offenders. They, by an illegal exertion of power, deprived the accused of a constitutional right. The distinction is important to be observed. It finds expression in Mahon v. Justice. But it does not need emphasizing. Kidnapping is a crime, pure and simple. It is difficult to accomplish; hazardous at every step. All of the officers of the law are supposed to be on guard against it. All of the officers of the law may be invoked against it. But how is it when the law becomes the kidnapper? When the officers of the law, using its forms, and exerting its power, become abductors? This is not a distinction without a difference,-another form of the crime of kidnapping, distinguished only from that committed by an individual by circumstances. If a state may say to one within her borders and upon whom her process is served, 'I will not inquire how you came here; I must execute my laws and remit you to proceedings against those who have wronged you,' may she so plead against her own offenses? May she claim that by mere physical presence within her borders, an accused person is, within her jurisdiction, denuded of his constitutional rights, though he has been brought there by her violence? And constitutional rights the accused in this case certainly did have, and valuable ones. The foundation of extradition between the states is that the accused should be a fugitive from justice from the demanding state, and he may challenge the fact by habeas corpus immediately upon his arrest. If he refute the fact he cannot be removed. Hyatt v. New York, \n188 U.S. 691\n, 47 L. ed. 657, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 456. And the right to resist removal is not a right of asylum. To call it so in the state where the accused is is misleading. It is the right to be free from molestation. It is the right of personal liberty in its most complete sense. And this right was vindicated in Hyatt v. New York, and the fiction of a constructive presence in a state and a constructive flight from a constructive presence, rejected. This decision illustrates at once the value of the right and the value of the means to enforce the right. It is to be hoped that our criminal jurisprudence will not need for its efficient administration the \n\n[203 U.S. 192, 219]\n\u00a0\n destruction of either the right or the means to enforce it. The decision in the case at bar, as I view it, brings us perilously near both results. Is this exaggeration? What are the facts in the case at bar as alleged in the petition, and which it is conceded must be assumed to be true? The complaint, which was the foundation of the extradition proceedings, charged against the accused the crime of murder on the 30th of December, 1905, at Caldwell, in the county of Canyon, state of Idaho, by killing one Frank Steunenberg, by throwing an explosive bomb at and against his person. The accused avers in his petition that he had not been 'in the state of Idaho, in any way, shape, or form, for a period of more than ten years' prior to the acts of which he complained, and that the governor of Idaho knew accused had not been in the state the day the murder was committed, 'nor at any time near that day.' A conspiracy is alleged between the governor of the state of Idaho and his advisers, and that the governor of the state of Colorado took part in the conspiracy, the purpose of which was 'to avoid the Constitution of the United States and the act of Congress made in pursuance thereof, and to prevent the accused from asserting his constitutional right under clause 2,  2, of article 4, of the Constitution of the United States and the act made pursuant thereof.' The manner in which the alleged conspiracy had been executed was set out in detail. It was in effect that the agent of the state of Idaho arrived in Denver, Thursday, February 15, 1906, but it was agreed between him and the officers of Colorado that the arrest of the accused should not be made until some time in the night of Saturday, after business hours,-after the courts had closed and judges and lawyers had departed to their homes; that the arrest should be kept a secret, and the body of the accused should be clandestinely hurried out of the state of Colorado with all possible speed, without the knowledge of his friends or his counsel; that he was at the usual place of business during Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, but no attempt was made to arrest him until 11:30 o'clock P. M. Saturday, \n\n[203 U.S. 192, 220]\n\u00a0\n when his house was surrounded and he arrested. Moyer was arrested under the same circumstances at 8:45, and he and accused 'thrown into the county jail of the city and county of Denver.' It is further alleged that, in pursuance of the conspiracy, between the hours of 5 and 6 o'clock on Sunday morning, February 18, the officers of the state and 'certain armed guards, being a part of the forces of the malitia of the state of Colorado,' provided a special train for the purpose of forcibly removing him from the state of Colorado, and between said hours he was forcibly placed on said train and removed with all possible speed to the state of Idaho; that prior to his removal, and at all times after his incarceration in the jail at Denver, he requested to be allowed to communicate with his friends and his counsel and his family, and the privilege was absolutely denied him. The train, it is alleged, made no stop at any considerable station, but proceeded at great and unusual speed; and that he was accompanied by and surrounded with armed guards, members of the state militia of Colorado, under the orders and directions of the adjutant general of the state.\n I submit that the facts in this case are different in kind and transcend in consequences those in the cases of Ker v. Illinois and Mahon v. Justice, and differ from and transcend them as the power of a state transcends the power of an individual. No individual or individuals could have accomplished what the power of the two states accomplished; no individual or individuals could have commanded the means and success; could have made two arrests of prominent citizens by invading their homes; could have commanded the resources of jails, armed guards, and special trains; could have successfully timed all acts to prevent inquiry and judicial interference.\n The accused, as soon as he could have done so, submitted his rights to the consideration of the courts. He could not have done so in Colorado, he could not have done so on the way from Colorado, At the first instant that the state of Idaho relaxed its restraining power, he invoked the aid of \n\n[203 U.S. 192, 221]\n\u00a0\n habeas corpus successively of the supreme court of the state and of the circuit court of the United States. He should not have been dismissed from court, and the action of the circuit court in so doing should be reversed.\n I also dissent in Nos. 250, 251, 265, 266, and 267. \n\n\n\n","126":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPOWERS v. DETROIT, G H & M R CO(1906)\nNo. 394\nArgued: February 26, 1906Decided: April 16, 1906\n\n\n\n\n[201 U.S. 543, 544]\n\u00a0\n This case, which is a suit brought by the appellee in the circuit court of the United States for the western district of Michigan, while involving the validity of the railroad tax law of the state of Michigan ( Acts 1901, chap. 173, p. 236), recently considered by this court (ante, page 459) involves the further question of the existence and scope of an alleged contract in respect to taxation. The Detroit & Pontiac Railroad Company was chartered by the legislature of the territory of Michigan, March 7, 1834, the Oakland & Ottawa Railroad Company by the legislature of the state of Michigan, April 3, 1848 (Laws 1848, p. 351). By an act of February 13, 1855 (Laws of 1855, p. 305), the Detroit & Pontiac Railroad was authorized to change its name to the Detroit & Milwaukee Railway Company, to purchase all the rights, property, and franchises of the Oakland & Ottawa Railroad Company for the building and operating a continuous line of road from Detroit to Lake Michigan, and the purchase and sale thus provided for was duly effected. Section 9 of this act provided that-- 'the said company shall, on or before the first day of July, pay the state treasurer an annual tax of 1 per cent on the capital stock of said company paid in, which tax shall be in lieu of all other taxes, except for penalties imposed upon said company \n\n[201 U.S. 543, 545]\n\u00a0\n by its act of incorporation, or any other law of this state. The said tax shall be estimated upon the last annual report of said corporation.'\n Since 1850 the state Constitution has contained these provisions:\n'Corporations may be formed under general laws, but shall not be created by special act except for municipal purposes. All laws passed pursuant to this section may be amended, altered, or repealed. But the legislature may, by a vote of two thirds of the members elected to each house, create a single bank with branches.' Art. 15,  1.\n\n'The legislature shall pass no law altering or amending any act of incorporation heretofore granted, without the assent of two thirds of the members elected to each house; nor shall any such act be renewed or extended. This restriction shall not apply to municipal corporations.' Art. 15,  8.\n\n In 1860 certain mortgages on the road were foreclosed and the company reorganized, and again in 1878 the road with its appurtenances and franchises was sold upon mortgage foreclosure and again reorganized as the Detroit, Grand Haven, & Milwaukee Railway Company. These foreclosures and reorganization took place under the authority of act No. 96 (Laws of 1859, p. 52).\n On the hearing in the circuit court it was held that  9, above quoted, created a contract between the state and the company which prevented the enforcement against it of the railroad tax law, and a decree was entered accordingly (138 Fed. 264) from which decree the state auditor appealed directly to this court.\n Messrs. Timothy E. Tarnsney, John E. Bird, Charles A. Blair, Loyal E. Knappen, and Roger Irving Wykes for appellant.\n\n\n[201 U.S. 543, 551]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. H. Geer and L. C. Stanley for appellee.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Brewer:\n\n\n[201 U.S. 543, 555]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the ocurt:\n Many questions which might otherwise be perplexing are settled by the decision of the supreme court of Michigan in Atty. Gen. v. Joy, 55 Mich. 94, 20 N. W. 806. That was an information brought by the attorney general in the supreme court of the state, charging the defendants with claiming and usurping the corporate rights and franchises of the Detroit, Grand Haven, & Milwaukee Railway Company. The act of 1855 was sustained, notwithstanding some alleged defects in its passage, and it was decided that it did not create a new corporation, but simply authorized the old territorial corporation, the Detroit & Pontiac Railroad Company, to change its name and extend its line of road, and, further, that this act in no respect conflicted with  1 and 8, article 15, of the state Constitution. The court also sustained the act of 1859, under which the foreclosures took place, and held that by them no new company was chartered, that there was simply a reorganization and continuance of the old company.\n The latter act provides that upon certain conditions new stock shall be issued in lieu of the old stock, the old officers of the company superseded, ' and the new stockholders and officers shall, in the law, be deemed and taken to be the stockholders and offers of said corporation, the charter and all laws appertaining thereto continuing to be the charter and laws regulating and governing said corporation, except that it may be known and called, and sue and be sued, and may contract and do all acts which in the law it could have done in its old name, in and by the name set forth in the declaration aforesaid.' (P. 253.)\n The testimony in this case shows compliance with these conditions. Compliance was also shown in Cook v. Detroit, G. H. & M. R. Co. 43 Mich. 349, 5 N. W. 390, and in that case the validity of the new organization as a continuance of the old corporation was recognized. \n\n[201 U.S. 543, 556]\n\u00a0\n We thus come to the question of the effect of  9 of the act of 1855. It has been often decided by this court, so often that a citation of authorities is unnecessary, that the legislature of a state may, in the absence of special restrictions in its Constitution, make a valid contract with a corporation in respect to taxation, and that such contract can be enforced against the state at the instance of the corporation. It is said that we are not concluded by a decision of the supreme court of a state in reference to the matter of contract; that while the rule is to accept the construction placed by that court upon its statutes, an exception is made in case of contracts, and that we exercise an independant judgment upon the question whether a contract was made, what its scope and terms are, and also whether there has been any law passed impairing its obligation. Douglas v. Kentucky, \n168 U.S. 488\n, 42 L. ed. 553, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 199. It is in order to uphold the provision of the Federal Constitution that no state shall pass a law impairing the obligation of a contract that this duty of independant judgment is cast upon this court. But here the supreme court of the state has ruled in favor of the continued existence of a corporation and the applicability of certain statutes, and when, upon the face of such statutes, a valid contract appears, we accept the ruling that the statutes are valied and applicable enactments. In other words, the supreme court of the state having sustained the validity of a statute from which a contract is claimed, this court follows that decision, and starts with the question, What contract is shown by statute?\n The particular section which it is claimed creates the contract (9 of the act of 1855) provides that the company shall pay an 'annual tax of 1 per cent on the capital stock of said company paid in, which tax shall be in lieu of all other taxes, except for penalties imposed upon said company by its act of incorporation, or any other law of this state.' It is contended in the first place that this is a mere gratuity, which can be withdrawn at any time,-a statute in respect to taxation subject to change like other revenue statutes; and Wisconsin \n\n[201 U.S. 543, 557]\n\u00a0\n & M. R. Co. v. Powers, \n191 U.S. 379\n, 48 L. ed. 229, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 107, is cited as authority. But the difference between that case and this is obvious. That arose on a general law in respect to taxation; this, on a provision in a special act having reference to a particular corporation,- an act which called for and received acceptance by the corporation. It was in the opinion in that case (p. 385, L. ed. p. 230, Sup.Ct.Rep. p. 108):\n'A distinction between an exemption from taxation contained in a special charter and general encouragement to all persons to engage in a certain class of enterprise is pointed out in East Saginaw Salt Mfg. Co. v. East Saginaw, 13 Wall. 373, 20 L. ed. 611, 19 Mich. 259, 2 Am. Rep. 82. In earlier and later cases it was mentioned that there was no counter- obligation, service, or detriment incurred, that properly could be regarded as a consideration for the supposed contract. Christ Church v. Philadelphia County, 24 How. 300, 16 L. ed. 602; Tucker v. Ferguson, 22 Wall. 527, 12 L. ed. 805; Grand Lodge, F. & A. M. v. New Orleans, \n166 U.S. 143\n, 41 L. ed. 951, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 523. . . . The presence or absence of consideration is an aid to construction in doubtful cases,-a circumstance to take into account in determining whether the state has purported to bind itself irrevocably or merely has used words of prophecy, encouragement, or bounty, holding out a hope, but not amounting to a covenant.'\n\n That there was ample consideration for a contract in this case, if consideration be necessary is shown by the opinion of the supreme court in Atty. Gen. v. Joy, supra, when it says (p. 101. N. W. p. 809):\n'The act of 1855 was not promoted exclusively in the interest of the railroad companies named in it, but the state itself was largely concerned, and expected to accomplish important public purposes by means of it. Twenty years before that time the state had planned for the construction of several parallel lines of railroad across the state from east to west, one of which was to be north of the line of the Michigan Central Railroad, and was expected to be of very high value, not only \n\n[201 U.S. 543, 558]\n\u00a0\n to all that part of the state through which it would run, but to the whole state. Much disappointment had come from the road not being constructed; and when the Detroit & Pontiac Railroad Company, which already had near 30 miles of road in successful operation, and could command means for the construction of more, proposed, on certain terms which were expressed in the act of 1855, to purchase the rights and franchises of the Oakland & Ottawa Company, and to extend their own road to Lake Michigan, there is no reason for doubting that the people of the state at large looked upon this as a favorable opportunity for accomplishing a desire which twenty years before had found expression in the legislation of the state, and which ever since had been kept constantly in view.'\n\n ... ...\n'It has already been seen that the important public purpose which the state had in view in assenting to the act of 1855 has been accomplished; the railroad from Pontiac to Lake Michigan has been constructed and for many years operated, and the state has reaped the benefits. But in order to accomplish this public purpose it seems to have become necessary to put the bonds and shares of the Detroit & Milwaukee Railway Company upon the market as well in Europe as in this country; the state recognized the necessity, and by its legislation provided for facilitating sales. The bonds and shares were sold to the amount of very many millions; and every purchaser of one of them made the purchase in reliance upon legislation of this state which appeared to sanction if not to invite it.' P. 104, N. W. p. 811.\n\n See further, Home of the Friendless v. Rouse, 8 Wall. 430, 436, 19 L. ed. 495, 497, in which we said:\n'It is objected that there is no consideration stated in the act for the release from taxation, which it is claimed is necessary in order to uphold the contract. But this is a mistaken view of the law on this subject.\n\n'There is no necessity of looking for the consideration for a \n\n[201 U.S. 543, 559]\n\u00a0\n legislative contract outside of the objects for which the corporation was created. These objects were deemed by the legislature to be beneficial to the community, and this benefit constitutes the consideration for the contract, and no other is required to support it.'\n\n Surely no clearer case of contract can be presented than one in which a legislature passes an act in respect to a particular corporation making special provision concerning taxation, and does so with a view of inducing large expenditures by the corporation and the completion of an unfinished road whose completion is deemed of great public importance, and where the special provision is, as required, formally accepted, the expenditures made, and the roal completed.\n It is suggested that this provision is not in terms made perpetual. A sufficient answer to this is found in Home of the Friendless v. Rouse, 8 Wall. 437, 19 L. ed. 497:\n'Testing the contract in question by these rules, there does not seem to be any rational doubt about its true meaning. 'All property of said corporation shall be exempt from taxation' are the words used in the act of incorporation, and there is no need of supplying any words to ascertain the legislative intention. To add the word 'forever' after the word 'taxation' could not make the meaning any clearer. It was undoubtedly the purpose of the legislature to grant to the corporation a valuable franchise, and it is easy to see that the franchise would be comparatively of little value if the legislature, without taking direct action on the subject, could at its will resume the power of taxation.'\n\n It is further contended that the contract provided in  9 is one relating to the property of the shareholders, and not to that of the corporation. The terms 'share,' 'stock,' 'capital,' 'capital stock,' are of frequent and not uniform use, and we have often to turn to the context to see what is intended by their use in a particular case. That a distinction exists between that which is the property of the shareholder, and subject to taxation as other property belonging \n\n[201 U.S. 543, 560]\n\u00a0\n to them, and that which is the property of the collective incorporated person we call a corporation, and subject to taxation as such, has been repeatedly pointed out. See Farrington v. Tennessee, \n95 U.S. 679\n, 24 L. ed. 558; Memphis & C. R. Co. v. Gaines, \n97 U.S. 697\n, 24 L. ed. 1091; St. Louis, I. M. & S. R. Co. v. Loftin, \n98 U.S. 559\n, 25 L. ed. 222; Bank of Commerce v. Tennessee, \n104 U.S. 493\n, 26 L. ed. 810; Tennessee v. Whitworth, \n117 U.S. 129\n, 29 L. ed. 830, 6 Sup.Ct.Rep. 645; Bank of Commerce v.

Pennsylvania, \n198 U.S. 341\n, 49 L. ed. 1077, 25 Sup.Ct.Rep. 669.\n In the first of these cases a bank's charter provided that the company 'shall pay to the state an annual tax of 1\/2 of 1 per cent on each share of the capital stock subscribed, which shall be in lieu of all other taxes,' and it was held that that was a contract in reference to the property of the shareholders, and prevented further taxation upon their separate property. In the opinion it was said (pp. 686, 687, L. ed. p. 560):\n'The capital stock and the shares of the capital stock are distinct things. The capital stock is the money paid or authorized or required to be paid in as the basis of the business of the bank, and the means of conducting its operations. . . . The capital stock and the shares may both be taxed, and it is not double taxation.'\n\n In the second is this ruling (p. 707, L. ed. p. 1093):\n'In general, an exemption of capital stock, without more, may, with great propriety, be considered, under ordinary circumstances, as exempting that which, in the legitimate operations of the corporation, comes to represent the capital.'\n\n And in Tennessee v. Whitworth, \n117 U.S. 136\n, 29 L. ed. 832, 6 Sup.Ct. Rep. 647, this description of separable elements of value was given:\n'In corporations four elements of taxable value are sometimes found: 1, franchises; 2, capital stock in the hands of the corporation; 3, corporate property; and, 4, shares of the capital stock in the hands of the individual stockholders. Each \n\n[201 U.S. 543, 561]\n\u00a0\n of these is, under some circumstances, an appropriate subject of taxation.'\n\n In several of the cases attention is called to the qualifying words which show an intent on the part of the legislature of something other than that generally embraced within the term 'capital stock.' But it is unnecessary to review these cases in detail.\n By  9 the tax is 'on the capital stock of said company paid in.' Clearly that refers to the property which the corporation has received and presumably holds. It is not the individual property of the shareholders which is contemplated, but that which is in the treasury of the corporation, or included among its assets. This, as we have seen from the quotations, is the ordinary meaning of the term 'capital stock.' Further, we find that this tax is to be 'in lieu of all other taxes, except for penalties imposed upon said company.' In other words, the tax upon the company of 1 per cent may be increased by any penalties imposed upon the company, and in no other way. Again, the tax is to 'be estimated upon the last annual report of said corporation.' While such report might be expected to include not merely the property belonging to the corporation but also the number and names of the stockholders and the number of shares held by each, and possibly also the amount paid in by each, yet the word 'estimated' carries with it the idea of valuation rather than of mathematical apportionment. It apparently suggests that the property reported by the corporation is to be the basis upon which the assessors shall make their valuation, so that the tax is 'estimated' upon that property rather than fixed by the mere process of multiplication or division. That the tax is to be paid by the company is of course not conclusive on the question, but it is in harmony with all the other provisions of the section. Still further, we have the practical construction placed by the authorities for a long series of years, continued up to the year 1898. Under those circumstances we are of opinion that the tax provided for by  9 is a tax upon the prop- \n\n[201 U.S. 543, 562]\n\u00a0\n erty of the corporation, and not a tax upon the shares of stock held by the shareholders. There was, therefore, a contract between the state and the corporation which prevented the subjection of the property of the corporation to any other than the tax prescribed in the statute.\n The decree of the Circuit Court is affirmed\n Mr. Justice White dissented. \n\n\n\n","127":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nRAILROAD COMMISSION OF LOUISIANA v. CUMBERLAND TELEPHONE &(1906)\nNo. 182\nArgued: Decided: August 6, 1906\n\n\n In the bill filed by the complainant it was alleged that the complainant was a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the state of Kentucky and a citizen and resident of that state, and that the railroad commission of Louisiana was a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the state of Louisiana, and was a resident of that state and of the district in which suit was brought; viz., in the eastern district of Louisiana, Baton Rouge division.\n It was also alleged that prior to August 6, 1906, the complainant had in force and effect a tariff of rates between points in the state of Louisiana, which had been promulgated and put into effect by the railroad commission of that state; that such rates were entirely fair and reasonable in so far as the public is or was concerned, as under them subscribers were and are able to use said service at a price which did not and does not afford complainant a fair, just, and reasonable compensation for its services.\n It was also averred that while such rates were in force the commission, without making any investigation, and without any evidence in regard to any of the facts necessary to reach a determination, and without any effort to obtain evidence in that direction, made and promulgated, on the 6th of August, 1906, the order known as order No. 552, by which order it greatly reduced the rates in existence up to that time, and the former rates were thereby changed to the rates specified in the order, which order was to become effective after the 1st of September, 1906.\n The complainant further averred that it had asked for a rehearing, which the commission granted, and thereafter, being still without evidence or investigation justifying the same, the commission reaffirmed the order No. 552, and declared that \n\n[212 U.S. 414, 417]\n\u00a0\n the same should become effective within ten days from the date of the second order, which was dated October 10, 1906.\n It was also further averred that the rates which preceded the rates provided for in order No. 552 were reasonable, just, and fair to the public, and not in any wise excessive, and under them complainant received for its services only a fair and reasonable return for the services rendered; that, under the tariff of rates promulgated and sought to be enforced by the commission under order No. 552, complainant would be required to render the services therein described at an unreasonable, unjust, and unremunerative rate, which would not afford to it a reasonable return for the services rendered, and that it would thereby be deprived of its property without due process of law; that said proposed tariff was unjust, unreasonable in itself, and was not justified by any conditions, either concerning the services in question or by the financial or physical condition of complainant's property or affairs; that the orders of the commission complained of were unjust, unfair, and unreasonable and unwarranted, not only with regard to the tariff as a whole, but with regard to each particular rate charged by said tariff; and that the tariff of rates, as a whole and in detail, constituted, for the reasons already set forth, a taking of complainant's property without due process of law and without compensation being previously made, contrary to and in violation of  1, article 14, of the Amendments of the Constitution of the United States and in violation of certain (named) articles of the Constitution of the state of Louisiana of the year 1898.\n For answer the defendant denied that there was no inquiry or proper investigation of the subject-matter prior to the promulgation of order No. 552 of the date of October 10, 1906; it also denied that the rates established were unjust, unreasonable, or improper, or that they would result in the taking of complainant's property without due process of law. Testimony was taken by depositions, and upon the trial the court directed a final decree, enjoining the commission from putting the rates in force as provided for in order No. 552, and restraining the com- \n\n[212 U.S. 414, 418]\n\u00a0\n mission from instituting any suit against the complainant for the recovery of any penalty by reason of complainant's failure to put into effect the rates in the order of the commission; and it was further adjudged that the tariff of rates specified in the order should be canceled and declared to be null and void and of no effect. An injunction was issued pursuant to the decree. See opinion of circuit court, 156 Fed. 823.\n Messrs. E. Howard McCaleb, Jr., and Walter Guion for appellant.\n Messrs. William L. Granbery and Denegre & Blair for appellee.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Peckham:\n\n Mr. Justice Peckham, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The complainant herein is a citizen of the state of Kentucky, while the defendant is a citizen of the state of Louisiana, and a case of diverse citizenship therefore appears on the record. The complainant is transacting its business in several states, in a territory which is said to be 400 miles wide and 1,000 miles long, beginning in Indiana and Illinois and extending through the states of Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, and Louisiana to the Gulf of Mexico. Its capital, from the time of its organization to May, 1898, was $1,695,700. This capital was thereafter increased from time to time until February 1, 1907, from and after which it was $20,174,350, represented by stock issued from time to time, to that amount. This includes the amount invested in Louisiana. The evidence in the case shows that the company's affairs had been economically administered, and that its business had been conducted in the state of Louisiana, ever since its entrance into that state, with great care and economy; that the stock had not been watered; that its capital was contributed in cash, and every economy possible had been practised. Adverse criticism was \n\n[212 U.S. 414, 419]\n\u00a0\n indulged in in the circuit court in regard to the price paid by the complainant for the property of the Great Southern Telephone & Telegraph Company, the price being, as alleged, too high; but the evidence is strongly to the contrary. And, again, the business that complainant is carrying on, the evidence shows, is regarded as hazardous by those familiar with its character, and as being still in an experimental stage with regard to the proper methods of operating, and also as to appliances and other things necessary to the conduct of its business. The property is subject to great and rapid deterioration from exposure to the weather and other causes. The profits in this kind of business are shown to be almost universally low. The complainant's charges for rates in Louisiana before the promulgation of the order No. 552 were also shown to be as low as those of any of the companies in the country, and lower than most of them. Out of more than a dozen companies, which substantially cover the whole country, there is one which declares dividends of 7 per cent. others 6 per cent, 5 per cent, and 4 per cent, and some nothing, and some are bankrupt. The dividends of complainant have not been declared on any artificial capitalization or watered stock. Complainant has declared dividends as the result of its business through all the states, for the last few years, of 7 per cent. While it is contended by the commission that, from the returns made by the complainant to it, the complainant has realized upon its investment in Louisiana from 10 to 15, and even 20 per cent, yet, on the other hand, the complainant asserts that the returns on its investment in Louisiana have been less than 6 per cent during most of the time the complainant has been in the state, and ending June 30, 1907. It is asserted that complainant had expended in Louisiana up to June 30, 1906, $ 4,711,000 in the purchase and construction of exchanges and toll lines, which amount was still further increased by June 30, 1907, to $5,394,154. 43, and it is upon these totals that the percentage of net income to investment is made up.\n The president of the company testified that, unless things \n\n[212 U.S. 414, 420]\n\u00a0\n changed, and it was permitted to charge the rates which had been charged prior to the adoption of these rates which are now in question, it would be unable to continue to pay 7 per cent, and that the company would necessarily retrograde; and that, while the company had paid 7 per cent to its stockholders for the past few years, it could not continue so to do if the rates in question were adopted. That it did not, in fact, receive anything like 7 per cent upon its investment in Louisiana, and that the average market for money in that state on good securities, and much more certain than telephone stock, was at least 7 per cent, and that there was no inducement to investors in the state of Louisiana, or in the New Orleans money market, to invest in stock in such a company as that of the complainant, where there was more risk and probably less return than in other investments which could be had in that city and state. This evidence was not, in terms, contradicted, though other contentions are made by the appellants. The differences between the parties as to the rate of the return upon the investment in Louisiana arise from the different data taken by them upon which to calculate the return, and will be referred to later. The single question before us is as to the character of the rates provided in order No. 552, whether such rates are confiscatory, or, if there is any difference, whether the rates are only unreasonable, unjust, and inadequate, although not confiscatory, and therefore not in violation of the Federal Constitution. The question under articles 284 and 285 of the Constitution of Louisiana, supra, even of the unreasonableness of the rates, may be inquired into by a Federal court, by reason of the diverse citizenship of the parties to this suit, and the complainant is not confined to a state court upon this question. Reagan v. Farmers' Loan & T. Co. \n154 \nU.S. 362, 391\n, 38 S. L. ed. 1014, 1021, 4 Inters. Com. Rep. 560, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1047. The complainant comes into court on both grounds, asserting that the rates are so low as to take its property in violation of the 14th Amendment to the Federal Constitution, and also that the rates are so low as to be unreasonable and unjust under the above cited articles of the Constitution of Louisiana. \n\n[212 U.S. 414, 421]\n\u00a0\n Like any other case, the onus rests upon this complainant to prove the existence of the fact it alleges; viz., that the rates are so low as to be confiscatory, or at least unreasonable and unjust. The court below held that the rates actually established by the commission were void, because, as was stated by the court, those rates were not established upon investigation into the question of their sufficiency, but by a merely arbitrary conjecture by the commission, not based on investigation or the exercise of judgment and discretion, and the order promulgating the establishment of the rates was, therefore, illegal and void, and hence there was no presumption of the correctness of the rates, such as generally obtains in relation to rates adopted by the legislature or a commission appointed by it. See Chicago, M. & St. P. R. Co. v. Tompkins, \n176 \nU.S. 167, 173\n, 44 S. L. ed. 417, 420, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 336; Ex parte Young, \n209 \nU.S. 123, 165\n, 52 S. L. ed. 714, 731, 13 L.R.A.(N.S.) 932, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 441.\n We are of opinion that the court below erred in its conclusion that there was no presumption in favor of the validity of the rates promulgated by the order No. 552. We think the evidence shows that these rates were really not adopted by arbitrary conjecture, nor does it show that they were based on no investigation or without the exercise of judgment or discretion.\n It seems there had been complaints as to the tariff of rates under which the complainant was operating before the order No. 552 was made, and the commission had investigated these complaints so far as to make a careful examination of the returns of complainant, made to the commission. These returns showed generally the character and operation of the business of complainant, its income, operating expenses, and investments in Louisiana. The commission, after examining them, issued the order to show cause why its rates should not be decreased; the commission, on the final hearing on the return of the order to show cause, took into consideration both the statement presented by the complainant on the return of that order and also the statements or returns previously filed by the company. The secretary to the commission stated that the items in these returns which had most weight in causing the commission to \n\n[212 U.S. 414, 422]\n\u00a0\n reach a conclusion that the rates then charged were unreasonable were the earnings and operating expenses and net earnings, as shown by these reports made to the commission. These reports were annual, and were under oath. It appeared from the evidence of the secretary that he was aware of the fact that the taxing authorities adopted a basis of valuation on telephone property which was not its full market value; that property of this nature, like all other property, was not assessed in Louisiana at its actual value, but for an appreciably less amount, and the valuation, as returned to and filed with the commission by the complainant, followed the valuation placed upon its property by the taxing authorities, and that the witness therefore knew that the valuation in these reports of the complainant's property in the state of Louisiana was not its real value. He also said that in fixing a schedule of rates the commission did not adopt that valuation as a basis. The witness further stated that the commission, in acting upon the question, was of opinion that the proof showed that the company was making what the commission considered were unreasonable earnings, and that was shown by the annual reports made by it for the years 1904, 1905, and 1906, and the statement filed by the counsel for the company on his return to the order to show cause. No proof was offered to the commission in the presence of anyone representing the complainant other than the statement of receipts and disbursements contained in the reports mentioned.\n Now it may be true that these returns did not contain all the data upon which a very close and accurate judgment could be based as to the rates that ought to be charged by complainant, under all the circumstances. This is only saying the order may have been erroneous or based upon insufficient evidence, which is no more than saying that, upon the investigation, the commission may have come to a mistaken conclusion by reason of erroneous inferences from the evidence furnished by complainant's own returns; but that is far from showing that the commission had, by a merely arbitrary order, promulgated certain rates without making the slightest effort to obtain any \n\n[212 U.S. 414, 423]\n\u00a0\n knowledge whatever upon the subject. It did not lose jurisdiction by reason of the mistakes it may have made, and, as a result, the rates adopted were not merely arbitrary conjectures, but based on reasons which, while they may have been insufficient, cannot be described as resulting in a decision wholly without evidence to support it. The rates, therefore, promulgated, must be regarded as prima facie fair and valid, or, in other words, the onus was upon the complainant to show that they were what it asserts, confiscatory or unreasonable. The court below did state in its opinion that the evidence established that the complainant had not then earned under the tariff in order No. 488 (which existed prior to No. 552, and the rates under which were higher than those under order No. 552), as much as 7 per cent on its Louisiana business, and it held that a profit of 7 per cent on the Louisiana business would be only a fair return on a business of this character, and therefore any reduction of existing rates would be unreasonable and unjust. If the conclusion of the insufficiency of the prior rates were justified, it would probably be an answer to the claim of the commission that the reduced rates provided for in order 552 were sufficient.\n There are one or two facts, however, now to be taken into consideration before the correctness of that conclusion can be affirmed. In the course of the trial various questions were argued as to the manner of conducting such a business as this, with regard to extensions, earnings, and disbursements, as well as questions of depreciation of plant and how to treat the amount collected therefor, and other questions of that nature. Exactly how the money which resulted from the rates in actual operation was used was not, in all cases, shown in detail, either from the books or by oral testimony. Something was left in doubt and to conjecture. In the course of the opinion of the circuit court the following was said: 'It is urged by the commission that, included in the Louisiana investment of complainant, is a sum earned from Louisiana business, set aside in the reserve fund and then used in extending the system in \n\n[212 U.S. 414, 424]\n\u00a0\n Louisiana, and now treated as a part of the Louisiana investment of the stockholders. This may be so to some extent,-it is certainly possible. But it is impossible for me to determine, from the figures in the record, to what extent, if at all, it is a fact. Counsel for defendant have not themselves undertaken to indicate what, even in round figures, they consider is the sum thus earned in the business and reinvested in the business, without having been distributed to the shareholders in dividends. It will be time to consider the legal results from such a state of facts when it shall have been shown to exist in a definite sum, and not in a purely conjectural amount.' And again: 'Counsel for the commission argued that the complainant's property in Louisiana was not all paid for with complainant's captial, but was partly paid for out of a surplus or reserve, or depreciation fund, which was accumulated by complainant from the receipts of its Louisiana business, and was then reinvested, not in repairs or maintenance, but in extensions and additions to the property. This may be a fact, but it is not shown to be a fact. The commission has power, if it wishes to do so, to direct the books of complainant to be so kept as to show such use of receipts. In the present state of the books this seems to be impossible. And the floating debt of the complainant would seem to be much greater than any sum which could possibly have been used from the reserve, or surplus, or depreciation fund for extensions and additions, after paying for maintenance and repairs.' [156 Fed. 831, 832.]\n If the onus rested upon the commission to show these facts, it is evident that the obligation has not been fulfilled; but it is just here that the difficulty lies. It was obligatory upon the complainant to show that no part of the money raised to pay for depreciation was added to capital, upon which a return was to be made to stockholders in the way of dividends for the future. It cannot be left to conjecture, but the burden rests with the complainant to show it. It certainly was not proper for the complainant to take the money, or any portion of it, which it received as a result of the rates under which it was \n\n[212 U.S. 414, 425]\n\u00a0\n operating, and so to use it, or any part of it, as to permit the company to add it to its capital account, upon which it was paying dividends to shareholders. If that were allowable, it would be collecting money to pay for depreciation of the property, and, having collected it, to use it in another way, upon which the complainant would obtain a return and distribute it to its stockholders. That it was right to raise more money to pay for depreciation than was actually disbursed for the particular year there can be no doubt, for a reserve is necessary in any business of this kind, and so it might accumulate; but to raise more than money enough for the purpose, and place the balance to the credit of capital upon which to pay dividends, cannot be proper treatment. The court below said it was impossible to find out from the books how much of this had been done, and it treated the fact as one to be explained by the commission, and not by the complainant. In other words, while this fact was a material one, the onus was placed upon the commission, and not the complainant, to show it. We think, on the contrary, that the obligation was upon the complainant. Now, although the books, it is said, do not show how much money collected for depreciation has been, in fact, used to increase the capital of the complainant, upon which dividends were paid to stockholders, yet still, even if the books do not show accurately, or even at all, what disposition was made of these moneys, at any rate the officers of the complainant must be able to make up some reasonable approximation of the amount, even if it be impossible to state it with entire accuracy; and this duty rests with the complainant, in order that it may discharge the duty devolving upon it to prove that the rates were not unreasonably high under order No. 488, or, in other words, that they were unreasonably low under order No. 552. It may be that the sum, if any, thus used, was not enough to affect the claim that the rates under discussion were unreasonably low. The evidence is insufficient to show clearly that which complainant is under obligations to show. Knoxville v. Knoxville Water Co. \n212 U.S. 1\n, 53 L. ed. -, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 148; Willcox v. Consolidated Gas Co. \n212 U.S. 19\n, 53 L. ed. --, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 192. We \n\n[212 U.S. 414, 426]\n\u00a0\n are not considering a case where there are surplus earnings after providing for a depreciation fund, and the surplus is invested in extensions and additions. We can deal with such a case when it arises.\n The evidence in this case applied generally to the actual operation of complainant's business under rates in existence prior to those contained in order No. 552, and higher than those contained in that order, and the evidence, as contended, showed that even under those rates the profits were not unreasonably high. It is not such a case, therefore, as looks only to the possible effects of the future enforcement of the rates claimed to be too low. If higher rates have been in operation, and the result has shown that they were only reasonable and fair rates, it would, in such a business as this, follow, with considerable certainty, that, with lower rates, the profits would be decreased and become unreasonably low. We say this because the evidence shows that, in the case of telephone companies, the general result of a reduction of rates in some other kinds of business does not always follow,-namely, that there would be an increased demand, which could be supplied at a proportionately less cost than the original business. Such, it is admitted, would be the case generally in regard to water companies, gas companies, railroad companies, and perhaps some others, where the rate is a reasonable one. For example, it is said that it would cost no more, or certainly scarcely an appreciable amount more, to haul a train of two cars, both filed, than it would to haul the same train with both cars half filled, and if the reduction in rates should result in filling the cars where previously they had not been half filled, there might be an increased carriage at a cost very little more than before, and probably an increased profit So, in the case of a water company, the reduced rate might result in furnishing more water to consumers already existing, and the increased cost of furnishing the same would be infinitesimal, where there was a supply sufficiently large to fill the demand. So, also, in furnishing gas at reduced rates, the reduction in the rate would very probably result in increased \n\n[212 U.S. 414, 427]\n\u00a0\n consumption, not only in increased demands from more consumers, but also an increased consumption by consumers already existing, and the increased cost of furnishing the gas would be nothing like in proportion to the increase in consumption. In these cases increased profits might be the result of decreased rates. But with telephone companies, as shown by the testimony of the president of the complainant, the reduction in toll rates does not bring an increased demand, except upon the condition of corresponding increase in expenses. As an illustration the witness took a telegraph company, which, as he said, 'employs one wire, and can send several messages at the same time over that one wire; it employs its own operators to send the message, who consult each other's time and convenience in the handling of it, while the telephone company has to employ two wires, the sender of the message is his own operator, and the telephone operator simply fashions up the facilities for him, and the customer sends his own message, and becomes, therefore, his own operator; hence his convenience and time must be consulted; we have to be ready, in other words, with the operators and the appliances to suit the convenience of the customer, whereas in the telegraph business it is just the other way: the customer brings in his message, and when it suits the convenience of the company to employ its operators and its apparatus to send it, they send the message.' The witness then gave further illustration in proof of his contention that the reduction of rates in the telephone business does not increase the business without corresponding increase in the expense.\n We do not think this case is one where the bill should be dismissed, even without prejudice, for the reasons that we have stated, that the inquiry has been founded upon the actual effect of rates higher than those permitted under order No. 552, and therefore that it is not merely conjecture as to what the result of such lower rates would be, the tendency of the evidence being to the effect that the higher rates are still reasonable, and that the lower rates would be unreasonably low. But the burden, as \n\n[212 U.S. 414, 428]\n\u00a0\n we have said, rests with the complainant to prove its case, and it has not performed its obligation when this fact as to the disposition of the so- called depreciation fund is left so wholly in doubt. What is the amount reserved for payments for depreciation? What, if any of it, has been carried into capital? How much of the floating debt would carry interest which might be charged as against the amount of the depreciation fund actually used for extensions and additions and charged to capital? All these are questions not answered by the evidence in the case, and which should be made as clear as possible before an attempt ought to be made to answer the question as to rates. The whole case should, therefore, be opened, so that both sides can, on a new trial, bring out all the material facts upon which a decision can finally be based.\n We, therefore, reverse the decree and direct a new trial.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice White, not having heard the argument, did not take part in the decision of the case. \n\n\n\n","128":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nRAWLINS v. STATE OF GEORGIA(1906)\nNo. 547\nArgued: April 6, 1906Decided: April 16, 1906\n\n\n\n Messrs. John Randolph Cooper and Oscar M. Smith for plaintiffs in error. \n\n[201 U.S. 638, 639]\n\u00a0\n The court declined to hear Mr. John C. Hart on behalf of defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n The plaintiffs in error were indicted for murder, tried, and found guilty. Leonard Rawlins was sentenced to the penitentiary for life, and the others were sentenced to be hanged. When the grand jury was organized each of the accused filed a written challenge to the array, on the ground that 'while there are in Lowndes county many lawyers, many preachers, ministers, many doctors, many engineers and firemen of railroad trains, and many dentists, as many as ten of each class named, or other large number of each of said class, all citizens and residents of said county, and being competent and qualified jurors, as to age and uprightness, experience and intelligence, and as to all the legal qualifications of a juror, yet each and every one of these classes of citizens, and each and every member thereof in the county, is expressly and purposely excluded from the grand jury service by the commissioners failing and refusing to put any of said names in the box, so that, not being in the box, they cannot be legally drawn for service.' The challenge was repeated as a plea in abatement, and the petit jury was challenged on the same ground. Rights under the 14th Amendment were specially set up and claimed. The challenges and pleas were overruled, subject to exceptions. The exceptions were overruled by the supreme court of the state (52 S. E. 1), and a writ of error was taken out to bring the case to this court.\n At the argument before us the not uncommon misconception seemed to prevail that the requirement of due process of law took up the special provisions of the state Constitution and laws into the 14th Amendment for the purposes of the case, so that this court would revise the decision of the state court that the local provisions had been complied with. This is a mistake. If the state Constitution and laws as construed \n\n[201 U.S. 638, 640]\n\u00a0\n by the state court are consistent with the 14th Amendment, we can go no further. The only question for us is whether a state could authorize the course of proceedings adopted, if that course were prescribed by its Constitution in express terms.\n When the question is narrowed to its proper form the answer does not need much discussion. The nature of the classes excluded was not such as was likely to affect the conduct of the members as jurymen, or to make them act otherwise than those who were drawn would act. The exclusion was not the result of race or class prejudice. It does not even appear that any of the defendants belonged to any of the excluded classes. The ground of omission, no doubt, was that pointed out by the state court,-that the business of the persons omitted was such that they either would have been entitled to claim exemption, or that probably they would have been excused. Even when persons liable to jury duty under the state law are excluded, it is no ground for challenge to the array, if a sufficient number of unexceptional persons are present. People v. Jewett, 3 Wend. 314. But if the state law itself should exclude certain classes on the bona fide ground that it was for the good of the community that their regular work should not be interrupted, there is nothing in the 14th Amendment to prevent it. The exemption of lawyers, ministers of the gospel, doctors, and engineers of railroad trains-in short, substantially the exemption complained of-is of old standing, and not uncommon in the United States. It could not be denied that the state properly could have excluded these classes had it seen fit, and that undeniable proposition ends the case.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","129":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nREARICK v. COM. OF PENNSYLVANIA(1906)\nNo. 47\nArgued: Decided: December 17, 1906\n\n\n\n Messrs. Campbell M. Voorhees and Philemon S. Karshner for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[203 U.S. 507, 508]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. S. P. Wolverton and Harry S. Knight for defendant in error.\n\n\n[203 U.S. 507, 509]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case comes here upon a writ of error to the superior court of Pennsylvania, an appeal to the supreme court of the state having been disallowed by the last-named court. The superior court affirmed a conviction of the plaintiff in error for violating an ordinance of the borough of Sunbury, which made it unlawful to solicit orders for, sell, or deliver, at retail, either on the streets or by traveling from house to house, foreign or domestic goods, not of the parties' own manufacture or production, without a license, for which a large fee was required. In the court of quarter sessions, where the plaintiff in error was convicted, the case was heard upon an agreed statement of facts. Upon these facts the plaintiff in error asked for a ruling that his acts were done in carrying on interstate commerce, and that the ordinance was void as to him, under clause 3,  8, article 1, of the \n\n[203 U.S. 507, 510]\n\u00a0\n Constitution, the commerce clause; and saved his rights. The 14th Amendment also was relied upon, but it is unnecessary to state details concerning that.\n The following is a shortened statement of the facts agreed. And Ohio corporation employed an agent to solicit in Sunbury retail orders to the company for groceries. When the company had received a large number of such orders it filled them at its place of business in Columbus, Ohio, by putting up the objects of the several orders in distinct packages, and forwarding them to the defendant by rail, addressed to him 'For A. B.,' the customer, with the number of the order also on the package, for further identification. The company ultimately kept the orders, but it kept no book accounts with the customers, looking only to the defendant. The defendant alone had authority to receive the goods from the railroad, and when he received them he delivered them, as was his duty, to the customers, for cash paid to him. He then sent the money to the corporation. The customer had the right to refuse the goods if not equal to the sample shown to him when he gave the order. In that or other cases of nondelivery the defendant returned the goods to Columbus. No shipments were made to the defendant except to fill such orders, and no deliveries were made by him except to the parties named on the packages. In the case of brooms, they were tagged and marked like the other articles, according to the number ordered, but they then were tied together into bundles of about a dozen, wrapped up conveniently for shipment. The defendant had no license, but relied upon the invalidity of the ordinance, as we have said.\n If the acts of the plaintiff in error were done in the course of commerce between several states, the law is established that his request for a ruling was right, and that he should have been discharged. Robbins v. Taxing District, \n120 \nU.S. 489, 497\n, 30 S. L. ed. 694, 697, 1 Inters. Com. Rep. 45, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 592; Leisy v. Hardin, \n135 U.S. 100\n, 34 L. ed. 128, 3 Inters. Com. Rep. 36, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 681; Caldwell v. North Carolina, \n187 U.S. 622\n, 47 L. ed. 336, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 229. It will be seen from the insertion of the statement concerning the brooms that a ground \n\n[203 U.S. 507, 511]\n\u00a0\n relied upon by the prosecution to avoid that conclusion was that the goods, or at least this part of them, were not in the original packages when delivered, and that therefore the case did not fall within the decisions last cited, but rather within Austin v. Tennessee, \n179 U.S. 343\n, 45 L. ed. 224, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 132; May v. New Orleans, \n178 U.S. 496\n, 44 L. ed. 1165, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 976; and Cook v. Marshall County, \n196 U.S. 261\n, 49 L. ed. 471, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 233. In other words, it was contended that the brooms, before they were sold, had become mingled with, or part of, the common mass of goods in the state, and so subject to the local law. But the doctrine as to original packages primarily concerns the right to sell within the prohibiting or taxing state goods coming into it from outside. When the goods have been sold before arrival the limitations that still may be found to the power of the state will be due, generally, at least, to other reasons, and we shall consider whether the limitations may not exist, irrespective of that doctrine, in some cases where there is no executed sale. Hence the prosecution, whatever its assumption on the point last mentioned, sought to show that there was no sale until the goods were delivered and the cash paid for them. The superior court contented itself with the suggestion that the contract would have been satisfied by the delivery of articles corresponding to sample, although bought at the next door. The argument submitted to us goes farther, and affirms that the order was not accepted and did not bind the corporation until the delivery took place.\n The answer to the latter of the two positions just stated is simple. The fair meaning of the agreed fact that the orders were given to agents employed to solicit them is that the company offered the goods, and that the orders were acceptances of offers from the other side. If there were the slightest reason to doubt that the contracts were made with the company through its authorized agent at the moment when the orders were given, which we do not perceive that there is, certainly the contrary could not be assumed in order to sustain a conviction. It is for the prosecution to make out its case. We may mention here, in parenthesis, that of course it \n\n[203 U.S. 507, 512]\n\u00a0\n does not matter to the question before us that the contract was made in Pennsylvania. Brennan v. Titusville, \n153 U.S. 289\n, 38 L. ed. 719, 4 Inters. Com. Rep. 658, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 829. The other suggestion, that the company would have been free to deliver any articles equal to sample, as well if bought in Pennsylvania as if coming from Ohio, of course assumes that there was a contract. With regard to this argument it might be an interesting question whether the shipments described amounted to authorized appropriations of the goods to the contracts, notwithstanding the fact that the deliveries were to be only for cash; but we are not required to go into such niceties. The decisions already in the books go as far as it is necessary for us to go in order to decide this case.\n'Commerce among the several states' is a practical conception, not drawn from the 'witty diversities' ([Yaites v. Gough] Yelv. 33) of the law of sales. Swift & Co. v. United States, \n196 \nU.S. 375, 398\n, 399 S., 49 L.ed. 518, 525, 526, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 276. The brooms were specifically appropriated to specific contracts, in a practical, if not in a technical, sense. Under such circumstances it is plain that, wherever might have been the title, the transport of the brooms for the purpose of fulfilling the contracts was protected commerce. In Brennan v. Titusville, supra, pictures were sold by sample, as the brooms were here, and although the pictures were consigned to the purchasers directly, the railroad collecting the price, there was no discussion of the question whether the title had passed. In American Exp. Co. v. Iowa, \n196 \nU.S. 133, 143\n, 49 S. L. ed. 417, 422, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 182, that question was referred to only to be waived. In Caldwell v. North Carolina, supra, the pictures were consigned to the defendant, an agent, as here, with the additional facts that the pictures and frames were sent in large packages, which were opened by the agent on their arrival, and that the pictures, then for the first time, were put into their proper frames, and, for all that appears, then for the first time appropriated to specific purchasers. In the court below all the judges agreed that the title did not pass until delivery. 127 N. C. 521, 526, 527, 37 S. E. 138. This court intimated \n\n[203 U.S. 507, 513]\n\u00a0\n nothing to the contrary. On the special verdict it well might be that the sale was by sample, as in Brennan v. Titusville. It was decided that the intervention of an agent made no difference in the result. The superior court distinguished that case as one that necessarily involved interstate commerce because it called for the skill of the seller, but no such fact appears in the case or was referred to as a ground of decision, and there is no sufficient warrant for assuming it to be true.\n\n Some argument was made, to be sure, that even if the defendant was engaged in interstate commerce when he delivered the goods, still the ordinance bound him. American Steel & Wire Co. v. Speed, \n192 U.S. 500\n, 48 L. ed. 538, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 365, was especially relied upon. But that decision did not modify the cases that we have cited. It dealt with a case where a mass of nails and iron wire was collected at Memphis from other states, by a manufacturer, for all purposes; some of the goods to be sold on the spot, some ultimately to be forwarded to purchasers in other states, but no package being consigned to or intended for any special customer, or free from the chance of being sold by a new bargain in Tennessee. Under such circumstances the goods were liable to taxation in that state. The distinction between that case and the present does not need further emphasis. In view of the many decisions upon the matter we deem further argument unnecessary to show that the judgment below was wrong.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","130":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nRECTOR v. CITY DEPOSIT BANK CO(1906)\nNo. 137\nArgued: Decided: February 19, 1906\n\n\n\n Messrs. David F. Pugh, Fred C. Rector, and Pugh & Pugh, for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[200 U.S. 405, 408]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Talfourd P. Linn, and Outhwaite, Linn, & Thurman for defendant in error. \n\n[200 U.S. 405, 409]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n The firm of Reinhard & Company, composed of John G. Reinhard and Henry A. Reinhard, carry on a banking business in Columbus, Ohio. On April 10, 1900, the firm made a general assignment under the insolvent laws of Ohio. On the following day a petition in involuntary bankruptcy under the laws of the United States was filed against the firm, and on August 10, 1900, it was adjudged bankrupt, and subsequently Rector, the plaintiff in error, was appointed the trustee.\n In a court of common pleas of the state of Ohio the trustee began this suit against the defendant in error to recover the sum of $1,300, which it was subsequently agreed was only $1,161.74. The petition alleged the adjudication in bankruptcy and the appointment of the trustee, and based his right to recover upon the ground that on April 10, 1900, the firm had transferred and assigned to the defendant bank, who had received the same, the sum of money sued for, which it was \n\n[200 U.S. 405, 410]\n\u00a0\n alleged was the property of Reinhard & Company, and, in substance, the payment to the bank was alleged to constitute a voidable preference.\n The answer admitted the making of the general assignment, the adjudication of the firm as an involuntary bankrupt, and the appointment and qualification of the plaintiff as trustee. The other averments of the petition were denied.\n A trial was had to a jury. At the close of the evidence for the plaintiff the court, at the request of the defendant, instructed a verdict in its favor, and judgment was entered dismissing the action. The circuit court of Franklin county affirmed the judgment, which was thereafter affirmed by the supreme court of Ohio, without opinion. The chief justice of the supreme court of Ohio made, and the court caused to be filed and entered on its journal, the certificate which is in the margin. \n On motion of the plaintiff in error, Fred C. Rector, trustee, this court orders it to be certified and made part of the record in this case, and the Honorable William T. Spear, chief justice of said supreme court, does now certify, that in said cause, and on the hearing before this court, it was claimed, contended, and alleged by the said plaintiff in error that, on the 10th day of April, A. D. 1900, Reinhard & Company, a partnership, by deeds of its individual members, committed an act of bankruptcy, to wit: made a general assignment for the benefit of creditors; that on the 11th day of April, A. D. 1900, a petition in bankruptcy was filed in the district court of the United States of the southern district of Ohio, eastern division; that on the 10th day of August, A. D. 1900, said Reinhard & Company were, by said court, adjudged bankrupt, and on September 13, A. D. 1900, said plaintiff in error was appointed trustee thereof; that on the 10th day of April, A. D. 1900, said Reinhard & Company, then being, to the knowledge of the defendant in error, insolvent, assigned and transferred to the defendant in error, The City Deposit Bank Company, and that the said last-named company then and there received from said Reinhard & Company, the sum of $1,161.74 of moneys belonging to said Reinhard & Company; that said assignment and transfer was an unlawful preference, given to the said defendant in error, and violated the provisions of  60a and  60b of the United States bankrupt law; that it became and was material to the said cause for this court to determine whether the said sum of $1,161.74 was so assigned and transferred; whether it was an unlawful preference; whether it was a violation of said  60a and  60b of the said bankrupt law; and whether the said plaintiff in error, under said law, was entitled to have the said assignment and transfer set aside and declared null and void, and to have a judgment and order for the recovery of said money against said defendant in error; that the decision of this court was adverse to the claims and contentions of the said plaintiff in error, in this: that said court decided that said assignment and transfer of said sum of $1,161.74 was not an unlawful preference, in violation of the said provisions of the bankrupt law, and that the said plaintiff in error was not deprived of any right under said law, and was not entitled to have said assignment and transfer set aside, and to recover the said sum of $1,161.74 from said defendant in error. \n\n[200 U.S. 405, 411]\n\u00a0\n It is contended that this court is without jurisdiction. The argument upon which this proposition is rested is this: First. It is said that whilst, in the petition, the right of recovery was based upon the ground of fraudulent preference, it was not disclosed therein whether the preference relied upon was in violation of the bankrupt law of the United States or of the insolvent laws of the state of Ohio; and therefore a Federal question was not raised, as it was necessary to specially direct the attention of the state court to such a question if it was intended to rely upon it. Second. But even if the Federal question was referred to in the petition, as the cause of action stated in nowise involved the construction or validity of any provision of the bankrupt act, therefore there is no right to review under  709 of the Revised Statutes, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 575.\n Both these contentions might well be disposed of by saying that the action was brought by a trustee appointed under the bankrupt law of the United States, seeking to recover what was asserted to be an asset of the bankrupt estate under that law. This, therefore, presented a Federal question, and the denial of the asserted right was a denial of a right or title specially claimed under a law of the United States. Peck v. Jenness, 7 How. 612, 12 L. ed. 841; Barton v. Geiler, \n108 U.S. 161\n, 27 L. ed. 687, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 387; Williams v. Heard, \n140 U.S. 529\n, 35 L. ed. 550, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 885; Dushane v. Beall, \n161 U.S. 513\n, 40 L. ed. 791, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 637; Stanley v. Schwalby, \n162 U.S. 275\n, 40 L. ed. 967, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 754. Whether expressions, relied upon in argument, contained in Cramer v. Wilson, \n195 U.S. 416\n, 49 L. ed. 258, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 94, must be taken as not in harmony with the previous cases, or whether those expressions simply implied that where a right claimed by a trustee in bankruptcy in its final aspect depended \n\n[200 U.S. 405, 412]\n\u00a0\n solely upon a state law, the courts of the United States would follow the construction given by the highest courts of the state to the state law, we do not deem it necessary now to say, for, without reference to the doctrine announced in the previous cases, and without regard to the import of the case of Cramer v. Wilson, the contention as to the want of jurisdiction is without merit. It is to be observed that the matter certified by the supreme court of Ohio was made by that court a part of the record, and, if it be considered as having the force of an opinion of that court, would clearly establish the fact that the court had considered and decided a Federal question, which, apart from other considerations, would obviously give jurisdiction. But even if the action of the court be treated as not an opinion, but a mere certificate, the same result would follow. It is elementary that the certificate of a court of last resort of a state may not import a Federal question into a record where otherwise such question does not arise; it is equally elementary that such a certificate may serve to elucidate the determination whether a Federal question exists. Applying this principle, we think, as the suit was brought by a trustee in bankruptcy in virtue of the power and authority conferred upon him by a law of the United States, the certificate makes clear the fact, if it were otherwise doubtful, that rights under the bankrupt law were relied upon and passed upon below. And as, this being true, the right of the trustee in bankruptcy to recover thus depended upon a law of the United States, there was clearly jurisdiction within the purview of  709 of the Revised Statutes, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 575. Nutt v. Knut, \n200 U.S. 12\n, 50 L. ed. --, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 216.\n Coming to the merits, we premise that if the court below had found the facts we should be bound thereby. Here, however, as we have seen, the court below did not find the facts, but instructed a verdict for the defendant, being of the opinion that, upon no view of the evidence, was there a case made which would have justified a verdict for the plaintiff. This raises a question of law, which is this: Was the evidence such as would have justified the jury, under any reasonable view thereof, to \n\n[200 U.S. 405, 413]\n\u00a0\n find for the plaintiff? In other words, Was there sufficient evidence to warrant the submission of the case to the jury? This brings us to consider the evidence, in order to ascertain what inferences, one way or the other, might reasonably have been drawn by the jury therefrom.\n Outside the testimony of the trustee as to the insolvency of the bankrupt estate, the only evidence introduced was the testimony of John Field, manager of the Columbus Clearing House Association. By that testimony the following facts were disclosed:\n Prior to the bankruptcy of Reinhard & Company that firm carried on a banking business in the city of Columbus, Ohio, and the firm, as well as the City Deposit Bank Company, were members of the clearing house association. In order to accomplish the purpose of its existence the clearing house association was an agent, for a limited purpose, of the banks composing the association; that is, its duty was to clear or balance daily the claims of the respective banks, one against the other, resulting from the checks drawn upon and held by the different members. The only source from which the association derived the means to carry on its operations was from assessments upon the members, which were made solely for the purpose of paying rent, salaries, and similar expenditures. To effect the clearings each member of the association, on banking days, sent to the clearing house, at a specified hour, the checks held by it against other banks. The checks sent by each member were considered as remaining the property of the member, the association being simply an agent for collection. Where the sum of the checks presented by one bank exceeded the sum of the checks against it presented by other members of the association, that bank had, of course, a credit balance. Where the checks presented by a particular bank against other banks were less than the sum of the checks against it presented by other banks, that bank had a debit balance. Where a bank was entitled to a credit or payment corresponding to the excess which the sum of the checks presented by it exceeded the sum \n\n[200 U.S. 405, 414]\n\u00a0\n of the checks against it, the clearing house paid that bank the difference by drawing its check upon one or more of the debtor banks; and each member constituted the manager of the association its agent to draw a check or checks upon such member for any balance found to be due by that member.\n In making the clearings on April 9, 1900, the day before the assignment or Reinhard & Company, the checks presented against that firm in the clearings exceeded the checks presented by it against other banks by $1,161.74; that is, Reinhard & Company, as a result of the clearing, was indebted in that amount. On the same day the City Deposit Bank presented in the clearings checks drawn upon other banks which exceeded by $ 10,245.63 the amount of the checks presented against that bank; in other words, as a result of the clearings it was entitled to receive the amount of money just stated. In payment of the balance the clearing house gave to the City Deposit Bank a check on Reinhard & Company for the sum due by that firm, viz., $1,161.74, and a check upon the Capital City Bank for $9, 083.89. There was nothing in the evidence to show upon what bank the checks were drawn which were held by the City Deposit Bank on April 9, and which it presented for clearing on that day, nor was there anything in the evidence to show upon what banks the checks were drawn which were presented by Reinhard & Company for clearing on the same day. The check of the clearing house on Reinhard & Company for the balance due by that firm in the clearings, and which, as we have said, was given to the City Deposit Bank, was not on that day presented by the City Deposit Bank to Reinhard & Company for payment. On the contrary, the City Deposit Bank held the clearing house check until the next day. When, on the morning of the 10th of April, the City Deposit Bank presented its checks for clearing, it treated the clearing house check on Reinhard & Company as being entitled to participate in the clearing, and included it in the checks presented for that purpose.\n On the morning of April 10, the checks, as presented to the \n\n[200 U.S. 405, 415]\n\u00a0\n clearing house by the City Deposit Bank, including the clearing house check, exceeded the amount of the checks presented against it by other banks in the sum of $4,875.98; and the clearing house gave to the City Deposit Bank its check on the Deshler National Bank for that sum. On that day the checks presented by Reinhard & Company against other banks aggregated $2,132.19, whilst the checks against it presented by other banks amounted to $6,369.30, leaving a balance due by Reinhard & Company in the clearing of $4,237.11. Shortly after the clearing was made it developed that Reinhard & Company had made a general assignment for the benefit of their creditors and had suspended payment, and as a result, of course, it was certain that the firm of Reinhard & Company would not meet its obligations. The rules of the clearing house had provided for such a contingency as follows:\n'In case of failure to respond promptly to the checks of the manager, on the part of any member of the association, they shall be immediately returned to the manager, who shall call upon the other banks or bankers to make up the sum for which payment has been refused in proportion to the amount of checks upon the defaulting member sent into the clearing house at the preceding settlement, which sums so furnished or contributed shall constitute claims in the hands of the responding members respectively against the defaulting members, and it is hereby agreed that the checks received from the clearing house by the defaulting members shall be delivered, if required, to the member owning the same, without mutilation; the agency of the clearing house in the matter, it is understood, is only as a trustee, and in no case is the association to be held responsible for any loss that may occur.'\n\n All the checks drawn against Reinhard & Company, and which figured in the morning settlement, were returned to the clearing house with the information that Reinhard & Company had failed. The clearing house thereupon revised the previous settlements by deducting, wherever appearing, the credits which had been given for checks drawn on Reinhard & Com- \n\n[200 U.S. 405, 416]\n\u00a0\n pany, which had been presented by other banks, and changed the balances to correspond with such deductions, and the dishonored checks were returned to the respective banks. Having thus returned all the checks which had been presented against Reinhard & Company on that morining, the entire sum which had been collected on the checks sent to the clearing house by Reinhard & Company on the same morning for the purpose of the clearing, viz., $2,132.19, remained in the hands of the clearing house without any debit against it. Being thus in possession of the sum referred to, the manager testified that he paid $970.45 thereof to the Commercial Bank and the balance of $1,161.74 to the City Deposit Bank. With a view of making the payment to the last-named bank, the management to the office of the City Deposit Bank. Conflicting versions were given of what took place at the interview, which was had with an officer of the City Deposit Bank named Jennings. The manager at first testified:\n'I told him that the Reinhards had failed, and that his check had been returned, and that I had a balance due Reinhard & Company, and that I would substitute a check on the Capital City Bank for this check on Reinhard, which had been returned. Mr. Jennings said that he would-I think he said he would telephone Mr. Outhwaite, and if it was all right he would return my check,-the Reinhard check . . .'\n\n Subsequently, referring to checks which the witness had carried to the City Deposit Bank to give to that bank in exchange for the prior check of $4,875.98, he said:\n'It runs in my mind . . . that I told him that I wanted to substitute those, and that he asked me what for, and I told him not to ask any questions,-I am not sure about that,-that I wanted to substitute those checks.'\n\n Certain it is, however, that the manager took up the check for $4,875. 98 drawn on the Deshler Bank, which had been given to the City Deposit Bank in discharge of the credit balance in its favor as the result of the previous clearing of that day, and substituted for it a check for $3,714. 24, drawn on the Deshler \n\n[200 U.S. 405, 417]\n\u00a0\n National Bank, and in addition gave a check drawn on the Capital City Bank for $1,161.74, the exact amount of the clearing house check which had been thrown out of the clearings.\n Analyzing these facts for the purpose of arriving at the inferences which may reasonably be deduced from them, this plainly results: When, on the morning of April 10, 1900, as the result of the failure of Reinhard & Company, the clearings of that day required revision, the clearing house having received back the checks drawn on Reinhard & Company which it had cleared for its members that morning made new settlements with those members based upon deductions from the original settlements of the sum of the checks which had been put in the clearings on that morning and were afterwards dishonored. The result of each new settlement was that the amount due to the member was reduced or the indebtedness shown on the original settlement was increased, according as, by the original settlement, the member was a creditor of or a debtor in the clearing; and, as a necessary consequence of the new settlements having eliminated all the debits against Reinhard & Company, the clearing house held, as the property of that firm, the proceeds of the checks on other banks which that firm had sent for clearing on that morning.\n The statements of the manager as to what was done with the clearing house check which had been put in the clearings by the City Deposit Bank are not perfectly clear. In one aspect he returned that check to the City Deposit Bank as he had returned the other dishonored checks, and then gave to the City Deposit Bank a check for the amount due it on the revision of the clearing ($3,714.24), and also delivered a check for $1,161.74, to take up the dishonored clearing house check. In another aspect the same result was brought about without any return of the dishonored check The mere form of the transaction, however, does not affect its nature. The payment out of this fund by the manager, in part to the City Deposit Bank and in part to another bnak, therefore amounted simply to \n\n[200 U.S. 405, 418]\n\u00a0\n this: that in the revision of the clearings, although the clearing house eliminated, and returned the checks which had been debited against Reinhard & Company, and were subsequently dishonored, it retained and appropriated the credits arising from the checks put in by Reinhard & Company for the purpose of the clearing of the morning. Having thus appropriated those credits, it used them pro tanto to pay the clearing house check on Reinhard & Company held by the City Deposit Bank as the result of the clearings of the previous day. But as the clearing house had received the checks from Reinhard & Company on the morning of April 10, 1900, for the purpose of making the clearing on that day, such agent was without power, after returning to the banks which had presented the same, the checks debited against the firm, to hold on to the credits of Reinhard & Company, and treat them as subject to be appropriated. Indeed when the inferences from the proof are thus accurately fixed it is apparent that the transaction was in substance like the one which was held by this court in Yardley v. Philler, \n167 U.S. 344\n, 42 L. ed. 192, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 835, to be a misappropriation, and besides to constitute a fraudulent preference within the meaning of the national banking act.\n The result, however, of the proof would not be different, even if it be conceded that, under the rule as to clearings, which we have quoted, the clearing house would have had the power, upon the default of one of its members, simply to call upon the other members to pay in a pro rata proportion of the amount of the check or checks which had been drawn upon the defaulting member, and to treat the credit standing in the clearing in favor of the defaulting member as belonging proportionately to the contributing members. We say this because even under such hypothesis the clearing house check held by the City Deposit Bank would not have been entitled to so participate. That check was the result of the clearings of the previous day; and, under the hypothesis as to the meaning of the rule in which we have indulged, the holder was only entitled to obtain payment, pro rata, from those who had presented checks \n\n[200 U.S. 405, 419]\n\u00a0\n against Reinhard & Company in the clearing wherein the check was given.\n Was the receipt and appropriation of the $1,161.74 by the City Deposit Bank a preference within the bankruptcy law? is, then, the question. It is said that it was not, because, to constitute a preference under that law, the transfer or payment must have been the act of the bankrupt. Western Tie & Timber Co. v. Brown, \n196 U.S. 502\n, 49 L. ed. 571, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 339. Here it is insisted that it cannot be so held, because there was nothing in the proof warranting the implication that the firm authorized or ratified the misappropriation, or that the clearing house was the agent of the firm when it made such misappropriation. The latter proposition rests on the contention that whatever agency the association possessed in virtue of its authority to make clearings was revoked by the fact of the voluntary assignment made by Reinhard & Company before the money was appropriated to the City Deposit Bank. Whilst it may be conceded that these propositions are well founded, it does not follow that the inferences deducible from the evidence did not warrant the conclusion that, under the bankrupt law of the United States, there was a duty on the part of the City Deposit Bank to pay over to the trustee the sum received by it of the funds of Reinhard & Company deposited on April 10, 1900, with the clearing house for the purposes of the clearing of that date. From the inferences, which we have stated were properly deducible from the evidence, it follows that the jury would have been amply justified in finding that the clearing house had made a wrongful disposition of a trust fund in favor of the City Deposit Bank, which institution had notice, either actual or constructive, of the misappropriation. Western Tie & Timber Co. v. Brown, supra.\n We interpret the certificate of the supreme court of Ohio as establishing that that court did not rest its affirmance of the judgment rendered by the trial court against the trustee upon the mere technical ground that the petition counted upon a voidable preference, and there could not be a recovery unless \n\n[200 U.S. 405, 420]\n\u00a0\n the facts constituted such preference, even although the evidence justified the inference that the money which the City Deposit Bank received from the clearing house association, under the circumstances we have stated, was the property of Reinhard & Company, which the bank, by operation of the bankrupt law, was obliged to account for to the bankrupt estate. We so conclude, because the supreme court of Ohio not only certified that its decision 'was adverse to the claims and contentions of the said plaintiff in error, in this: that said court decided that said assignment and transfer of said sum of $1,161.74 was not an unlawful preference, in violation of the said provisions of the bankrupt law;' but in addition, moreover, certified that the case was decided against the trustee, because, under the facts proved, the trustee 'was not deprived of any right under said (bankrupt) law, and was not entitled to have said assignment and transfer set aside, and to recover the said sum of $1,161. 74 from said defendant in error.'\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of Ohio must be reversed and the cause be remanded to that court for further proceedings, not inconsistent with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","131":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nRECTOR v.

Albery for defendant in error. \n\n[200 U.S. 420, 421]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case is governed by the principles which controlled the decision just announced in the case of the same plaintiff in error against the City Deposit Bank Company, No. 137, [\n200 U.S. 405\n, 50 L. ed. --, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 289.]\n In the trial court judgment was prayed for $970.45, on the ground that on April 10, 1900, that amount of money, the property of Reinhard & Company, had been by that firm transferred to the defendant in error, and that the transaction constituted a voidable preference. The answer was in substance a general denial of the allegations of the petition in the particulars just stated.\n The case was submitted to the court upon the pleadings and the following agreed statement of facts:\n'For ten years or more prior to April 10, 1900, Reinhard & Company kept an open account with the Commercial National Bank, depositing their outside items on places where they had no correspondent, for the purpose of saving themselves the exchange or collection charges on some of these items. The balance with the Commercial National Bank on the morning of April 10, 1900, was ten hundred and sixty-seven and 76-100 dollars ($1,067. 76). On that morning John G. Reinhard came to the Commercial National Bank with Reinhard & Company's draft on New York for two thousand (2,000.00) dollars, for which the Commercial National Bank gave him the currency. This money was used by Reinhard & Company to pay checks drawn on them, and was paid out over their counter on April 10 to their customers.\n\n'At 12.15 o'clock, P. M., on said day, Reinhard & Company, a partnership, composed of John G. Reinhard and Henry A. Reinhard, said partnership and each of said partners being then insolvent, filed a deed of assignment in the probate court of Franklin county, Ohio, and at about the same hour and afternoon of said day their banking house was closed, at the same time each of said partners filed deeds of assignment.\n\n'The following day a petition was filed in the district court \n\n[200 U.S. 420, 422]\n\u00a0\n of the United States for the southern district of Ohio by certain creditors, alleging that said assignment was an act of bankruptcy; and thereafter such proceedings were had that said Reinhard & Company were on August 11, 1900, adjudged bankrupt, and the plaintiff became their trustee, pending which election of trustee one Walter Zinn was appointed and acted as receiver of Reinhard & Company, but the fact of such insolvency and the making of said assignment were not known to said The Commercial National Bank except by hearsay until after said amount of two thousand ($2,000.00) dollars was charged back on the account of Reinhard & Company, and until after it had received the check of the manager of the clearing house for said sum of nine hundred and seventy and 45-100 ($970.45) dollars.\n\n'During said day of April 10, 1900, the Commercial National Bank learned by street rumor that Reinhard & Company's draft on New York would probably not be paid, and it charged the same back on the account of Reinhard & Company, which overdrew their account nine hundred and thirty- two and 24-100 ($932.24) dollars.\n\n'On the 10th day of April, 1900, Reinhard & Company sent their representative to the clearing house as usual at 12.30 P. M. They received checks from the clearing house as usual, which their representative took back to their bank, and the checks which they brought to the clearing house were cleared on the respective banks as usual in all cases. Then about one o'clock P. M. after the manager of the clearing house had made his adjustment of balances for the day and had made out the checks to pay for the same, Reinhard's representative brought back the checks which the different banks of the clearing house had cleared on them that day.\n\n'The manager took these checks back to the different banks that had cleared them and deducted the amounts of their clearings that day. This left a balance of $_____ due to Reinhard & Campany from the clearing house for that day. Out of this balance he gave a check for $_____ to the City Deposit Bank, \n\n[200 U.S. 420, 423]\n\u00a0\n and for the balance of $970.45 he gave a check to the Commercial National Bank.\n\n'When Mr. Field, the manager of the clearing house, went to the Commercial National Bank to return the checks which they had cleared on Reinhard & Company that day, he informed Mr. Hoffman, the cashier, that that bank had suspended, and that he had a balance on hand due Reinhard & Company of $_____, $_____ of which he was going to pay to the City Deposit bank, leaving a balance of $970.45 due the said Reinhard & Company, which he did not know what to do with. Mr. Hoffman informed him that he had advanced Reinhard & Company $2,000.00 on that morning, and suggested that he pay the balance to him. He agreed to this, and gave him the check as suggested. Said amount was credited by the Commercial National Bank to Reinhard & Company, leaving a balance, as shown by the books of the Commercial National Bank, due from said bank to Reinhard & Company of thirty-eight and 21-100 ($38.21) dollars, which amount was paid over to Walter Zinn, as receiver of Reinhard & Company, upon his check as such receiver, drawn on the Commercial National Bank on the 16th day of May, 1900.'\n\n Judgment was entered against the trustee, and that judgment was affirmed by the appellate courts. The supreme court of Ohio entered upon its journal a certificate, made by its chief justice, which is precisely like that set out in the opinion delivered in the City Deposit Bank Case.\n A motion assailing the power of this court to entertain this writ of erro is overruled, for the reasons given in passing upon a similar motion filed in case No. 137. And, applying the principles announced in the case just referred to, it inevitably follows that the payment made on April 10, 1900, by the clearing house association, out of the credits of Reinhard & Company in the hands of the clearing house association, was a transfer of property belonging to Reinhard & Company which the trustee in bankruptcy was entitled to demand and receive from the defendant in error. We need not dwell upon the-contention \n\n[200 U.S. 420, 424]\n\u00a0\n made in argument that because the defendant in error, on the morning of April 10, 1900, gave Reinhard & Company $2,000 in currency in return for Reinhard & Company's draft on New York for a like sum, the transaction, even if fraudulent, invested the defendant in error with the right, upon the suspension of Reinhard & Company, to appropriate any property belonging to Reinhard & Company which they might be able to possess themselves of, and to apply the same in reduction of the advance made upon the seourity of the draft. The doctrine of rescission and following of trust funds can have no application, especially when, as expressly agreed in the statement of facts, the money which the defendant in error gave to Reinhard & Company in exchange for its draft 'was used by Reinhard & Company to pay checks drawn on them, and was paid out over their counter on April 10, 1900, to their customers.'\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of Ohio must be reversed and the case remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","132":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSAN ANTONIO TRACTION CO. v. ALTGELT(1906)\nNo. 131\nArgued: December 13, 1905Decided: January 22, 1906\n\n\n\n Mr. Charles W. Ogden for plaintiff in error.\n No counsel for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Brown:\n This was a petition by Altgelt, suing by his next friend, originally filed in the district court of Bexar county, for a peremptory mandamus against the traction company, a Texas corporation operating a street railway system, commanding it to issue to the plaintiff twenty half-fare street car tickets upon the payment of 50 cents, the same being at the rate of 2 1\/2 cents per ticket.\n Both parties relied upon the legal effect of certain legislation of the state of Texas hereafter set forth. The mandamus was granted by the district court, whose action was affirmed by the court of civil appeals. An application for a writ of error from the supreme court was denied. \n\n[200 U.S. 304, 305]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Brown delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case depends upon the construction and validity of certain legislative acts of the state of Texas from 1874, the date of the original charter, to 1903, the date of the act complained of as an impairment of the traction company's contract.\n The Constitution of 1869, in force at the time the original company was chartered, contained no limitation upon the power of the legislature to grant franchises in towns, cities, and other subdivisions of the state. The San Antonio Street Railway Company was incorporated in 1874 by special act, in which it was provided,  8, that 'all contracts made and entered into between the mayor and aldermen of the city of San Antonio and said company, or any privileges and rights granted . . . to said company, shall be in all respects legal and binding on the aforesaid contracting parties;' and by  9, that the charter 'shall remain in full force and effect for the period of fifty years.'\n By ordinance of the city council of October 5, 1875, privilege was granted to the San Antonio Street Railway Company to construct a first- class horse railway, during the term of its charter, upon the streets of said city, upon certain routes; but the ordinance did not fix the rate of fare to be charged for the transportation of persons over its projected lines.\n By article 10,  7, of the Constitution of Texas of 1876, it was provided that 'no law shall be passed by the legislature granting the right to construct and operate a street railway within any city, town, or village, or upon any public highway, without first acquiring the consent of the local authorities having control of the street or highway proposed to be occupied by said railway.'\n Section 17 of article 1 of the Bill of Rights of the same Constitution provides that 'no irrevocable or uncontrollable grant of special privileges or immunities shall be made; but all privileges and franchises granted by the legislature, or \n\n[200 U.S. 304, 306]\n\u00a0\n created under its authority, shall be subject to the control thereof.'\n On March 16, 1899, twenty-three years after the adoption of this Constitution, an ordinance of the city was passed, granting an extension of time to the San Antonio Street Railway, and the San Antonio Edison Company, and imposing certain limitations upon the exercise of their franchises, among which was that 'said street railway companies shall charge 5 cents fare for one continuous ride over any one of their lines, with one transfer to or from either line to the other.'\n It was also provided, by  11 of the same ordinance, that 'the rights, privileges, and franchises, or either of them herein referred to and hereby extended, may be assigned by the grantee or grantees to any person or corporation, and the limitations of this ordinance shall apply to the assignee thereof.'\n On April 4, 1900, all the property of this company was sold under the decree of a state court to a trustee for the stockholders, subject to the payment of the debts of the company, and to the performance of all outstanding contract obligations, which were declared 'a preference lien' against all the property sold in the hands of the purchaser. The conveyance expressly stipulated that 'within the meaning of the words 'contract obligations' shall be understood any and all existing contracts of the said Antonio Street Railway Company for street railway service over its road, or any portion thereof, had with any person or persons, now binding on said street railway company.'\n On August 7, 1900, the common council of the city passed an ordinance reciting the sale of the property and privileges of the former corporations, the San Antonio and Edison Companies, to the traction company, and enacting that all the rights and privileges therefore granted to the former companies, which were said to be 'now defunct,' with all the limitations, duties, contracts, and obligations imposed and required of the said San Antonio Street Railway Company, were \n\n[200 U.S. 304, 307]\n\u00a0\n imposed upon the traction company. This ordinance was accepted.\n The legislation remained in this condition until April 10, 1903, when the legislature of the state passed a new act, the 2d section of which reads as follows:\n'Sec. 2. All such persons or corporations owning or operating street railways shall sell or provide for the sale of tickets in lots of twenty, each good for one trip over the line or lines owned or operated by such person or corporation, at and for one half the regular fare or charge collected for the transportation of adult persons, to students not more than seventeen years of age, in actual attendance upon any academic public or private school, of grades not higher than the grades of the public high schools of this state, situated within or adjacent to the town or city in which such street railway is located. Such tickets are required to be sold only on the presentation by the student desiring to purchase the same, of the written certificate of the principal of the school upon which he is in attendance, showing that he is not more than seventeen years of age, is in regular attendance upon such school, and is within the grades hereinbefore provided. Such tickets are not required to be sold to such students, and shall not be used, except during the months of the year when such schools are in actual session, and such students shall be transported at half fare only upon the presentation of such tickets.'\n\n It is insisted by the plaintiff in error that, under article 10,  7, of the state Constitution, above quoted, the power to grant to street railways the property rights and franchises to construct and operate a street railway within a city is withdrawn from the legislature, and conferred, if not by express words, then by necessary implication, upon the municipal authorities. We do not so read the section. It merely provides that no such law shall be passed by the legislature, granting the right to construct and operate a street railway, without first acquiring the consent of the local authorities; but we see nothing to prevent the legislature from chartering a street railway, \n\n[200 U.S. 304, 308]\n\u00a0\n provided such consent be acquired. Such we understand to be the ruling of the supreme court of that state in Taylor v. Dunn, 80 Tex. 659, 16 S. W. 732, and Houston v. Houston City Street R. Co. 83 Tex. 548, 29 Am. St. Rep. 679, 19 S. W. 127. But whether an act of the legislature be necessary to charter a street railway is not involved in this case, as we are cited only to the original charter of the San Antonio Street Railway Company of 1874; although it is clear that a new charter would be inoperative to authorize the construction of the road without the consent of the municipal authorities.\n Assuming, but not deciding, that the ordinance of March 16, 1899, extending the franchise of the San Antonio Street Railway, and imposing certain limitations, constituted a contract pro tanto the question still remains whether the provision 'that said street railway companies shall charge 5 cents fare for one continuous ride over any one of their lines, with one transfer to or from either line to the other,' constituted a contract with respect to which no further legislation upon that subject could be enacted without impairing its obligation. Even if construed as a contract, it was still subject to the provision of the Constitution of 1876, which, in  17 of the Bill of Rights, declared that no irrevocable or uncontrollable grant of special privileges or immunities should be made; but that all privileges granted by the legislature or created under its authority shall be subject to the control thereof.\n An important consideration in this connection is that the alleged contract was made twenty-three years after the Constitution of 1876 was adopted, declaring that all privileges granted by the legislature shall be subject to its control. Clearly, it was not deprived of that control by the fact that the contract was not entered into by the legislature itself, but by a municipal corporation, since that is but an agency of the state, to which is delegated the power to regulate street railways and other municipal franchises. We have repeatedly held that where a railway was originally chartered before a new constitution took effect (and hence such charter was not limited \n\n[200 U.S. 304, 309]\n\u00a0\n thereby), yet, if such road be subsequently consolidated with other roads, or accepts new privileges, after a new constitution takes effect, all contracts, privileges, and franchises conferred after the adoption of such constitution are subject to its provisions. Shields v. Ohio, \n95 U.S. 319\n, 24 L. ed 357; Maine C. R. Co. v. Maine, \n96 U.S. 499\n, 24 L. ed. 836; Atlantic & G. R. Co. v. Georgia, \n98 U.S. 359\n, 25 L. ed. 185; Keokuk & W. R. Co. v. Missouri, \n152 U.S. 301\n, 38 L. ed. 450, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 592; Yazoo & M. Valley R. Co. v. Adams, \n180 \nU.S. 1, 23\n, 45 S. L. ed. 395, 407, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 240.\n In this case not only did the original San Antonio Street Railway Company become extinct by the foreclosure and sale of its property, but, under the ordinance of August 7, 1900, declaring the prior companies to be 'now defunct,' the traction company also became the owner of all the property, assets, rights, and privileges of another company, known as the San Antonio Edison Company, which thus became absorbed with the street railway company in the new corporation known as the traction company, which is admitted to have been incorporated since 1876, though the charter is not in the record. We are clearly of the opinion that, under these circumstances, it received its franchise under the Constitution of 1876, which forbade either the legislature or the municipal authorities to make any irrevocable contract.\n It is true that in this ordinance it was provided that all rights and privileges previously granted to the street railway company and the Edison company were conferred unto the traction company, including all the limitations, contracts, and obligations; but this ordinance must be construed in connection with the Constitution of 1876, which made all such privileges and franchises subject to the control thereof. Such was the view taken by the court of civil appeals of Texas in this case, which expressly waived the question whether the provision of the former ordinance fixing a 5 cent fare constituted a contract or not, declaring that if it did, it was subject to further legislative control.\n Under the Bill of Rights of that Constitution, the legislature could not reduce the fares to a confiscatory amount, or to an \n\n[200 U.S. 304, 310]\n\u00a0\n amount which would render it unprofitable to operate the road. There is no allegation of that kind in this bill, and no evidence that the reduction of the school tickets in question would seriously impair its revenues. Indeed, it was found in the opinion of the court below that it was not contended there, and that there was nothing in the evidence tending to show, that the rate of fare claimed by the appellee under the act of 1903 is not such as to leave to the company a sufficient income to pay for repairs and a fair income on its investment.\n The judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","133":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSANTA FE PAC R.

On the morning of the collision, November 20, 1901, train No. 3 was unusually delayed, and special orders became necessary for the operation of the trains on the Arizona division. The first order was issued before train No. 4 had left Needles. The order was as follows: 'No. 3 eng. 482 has right of track over No. 4 eng. 444 and 452 to Needles, but will run 1 hour 50 minutes late Kingman to Needles.' The copy of the order was delivered to train No. 4 before 4:22 A. M., before its departure from Needles, and to No. 3 upon its arrival at Kingman at 4: 21 or 4:22 A. M. Train No. 4 ran east to Mellen, a distance of 11.9 miles, where it stopped upon signal. In the meantime the second order (No. 23) was issued by the train despatcher, train No. 3 having been more delayed in arriving at Kingman than had been expected. This order was delivered to train No. 4 at Mellen. It read as follows: 'No. 3 eng. 482 will run two (2) hours late Kingman to Needles.' A copy of the order was delivered to No. 3 at Kingman. The effect of these orders and the general rules of the company was that No. 3 was to run according to the time card, except that it was to run two hours late and was to have the right of track over No. 4, the latter to look out for No. 3, and run with refer- \n\n[202 U.S. 438, 440]\n\u00a0\n ence to its movement as provided for by the special orders in connection with the time-table. The orders and the time-table would have made Franconia the proper place of passing of the trains, No. 3 being due to arrive there at 5:17, No. 4 at 5:06, or eleven minutes ahead of No. 3. Train No. 3 should have left Kingman at 4:25. It left at 4:31, six minutes late. It passed Yucca, however, at 4:55 (this is disputed, but upon what evidence we shall presently consider); it should not have passed until 4: 57; and it passed Franconia six minutes ahead of time. The operator at Yucca (the only night telegraph office between Kingman and Franconia) at 4: 58 or 59 reported to the train despatcher that No. 3 had passed at 4:55.\n No. 4 left Mellen, which was the only night office between Needles and Franconia, between 4:45 and 4:47, and ran 6.8 miles to Powell, arriving there at 5 o'clock. A stop was made of three or four minutes for the purpose of adjusting the flow of oil in the leading locomotive, and then proceeded towards Franconia. In the meantime No. 3 had arrived at Franconia six minutes ahead of the schedule time under the special order for leaving that station. On approaching the station the engineer signaled an inquiry for orders and received by semaphore signal from the operator the reply: 'No orders from the train despatcher.' He did not stop at Franconia, and, while the train was going at a speed of from 60 to 70 miles an hour, about 1 1\/4 miles from Franconia, it collided with No. 4, which was running from 40 to 50 miles an hour. Both trains were wrecked, the engineer of the leading locomotive of No. 4 and several others were killed, and the defendant in error sustained serious injuries. The operator at Franconia had no orders that morning for either No. 3 or No. 4. But for the collision, No. 4 would have reached and have been placed on the siding at Franconia, notwithstanding the delay at Powell, two or three minutes before No. 3 was due at Franconia. Plaintiff in error's rule No. 385 only requires the train not having the right of \n\n[202 U.S. 438, 441]\n\u00a0\n track to take a siding and be clear of the main track before the leaving time of the opposing train. Other facts are stated in the opinion.\n Messrs. Gardiner Lathrop, T. J. Norton, E. W. Camp, and Robert Dunlap for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. W. H. Stilwell, Byron Waters, and Win Wylie for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice McKenna:\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna, after stating the case as above, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The case here is in narrow compass both as to the facts and the law. It is apparent that none of the operators of train No. 4 was guilty of negligence. The second special order indicated Franconia as the meeting point of the trains and that train No. 4 should reach there before 5:17, the leaving time of train No. 3. This it could have accomplished notwithstanding the delay at Powell. It is equally apparent that train No. 3 was ahead of time and we may consider that its engineer was culpable. The question is yet presented whether the company is not charged with liability. In this question there are involved two elements,-one of law and one of fact. It is not denied that the train despatcher represented the company in the promulgation of the special orders. It is, however, asserted that this representation ceased by the promulgation of the orders, and that he was not required to repeat them or promulgate new ones. 'There is no ground,' it is insisted, 'either upon reason or authority, for holding that a principal is bound to stand over his servants to enforce proper and sufficient orders once given to them.' There is an instant answer to the contention. Instead of according with principle and authority, it is opposed to both. It contradicts a concession elsewhere made in the argument, that it is the \n\n[202 U.S. 438, 442]\n\u00a0\n duty of a railroad company to promulgate adequate rules and regulations for the safety of employees engaged in the dangerous duty of operating trains, and at times telegraph orders for the movements of trains. It is the duty of a master to furnish safe places to work in and safe instruments to work with, and of this there need be no discussion. The duty is a continuing one and must be exercised whenever circumstances demand it. It may indeed often be discharged by one exercise. It may recur at any moment in keeping moving and opposing trains in safe relation. The rules of the company recognize this. They require telegraph operators to report the time of departure and passing of trains. This is absolutely necessary for supervision. The business is hazardous. Trains may be rushing towards each other upon a single track. All may go well. The observance of time alone may be sufficient for safety. But something may occur to one of the trains, with or without fault of anybody, which may endanger the other. May a train despatcher know it and not guard against it? A negative answer would be revolting.\n There can be no doubt of the duty of the train despatcher in such case. His duty is clear if the circumstances call for action. Did the circumstances in the case at bar call for action? In answering this it will do no good to discuss cases. The principles of law are clear. A master must furnish a safe place for his servant to work in, and the risk the servant assumes of the negligence of a fellow servant does not exempt from that duty. Or, to put the matter more guardedly, there is no circumstance in this case which exempted from that duty. The special orders were an assurance of the company, through its train despatcher, to train No. 4, that it could run with safety between Mellen and Franconia if it arrived at the latter station before 5:17. If anything occurred to change that condition which came to the knowledge of the company, train No. 4 was entitled to know it; and we are brought to the simple question, Did anything occur? It is admitted all around that train No. 3 did not comply with orders, and ar- \n\n[202 U.S. 438, 443]\n\u00a0\n rived and departed from Franconia ahead of time. It is disputed whether it arrived at or departed from Yucca ahead of time. Both of the lower courts found that it did, and we cannot say that the evidence does not sustain the finding. The telegraph operator at Yucca notified the train despatcher that the train passed two minutes ahead of time,-passed at 4:55; its time was 4:57; and we know that it passed Franconia six minutes ahead of time,- a circumstance which tends to show that the operator at Yucca was right. That there was an error in the operator's clock was an afterthought of the train despatcher. He received and recorded on the 'train sheet' the time ( 4:55) which was given him. He testified (his deposition was taken by defendant in error) that he received the report of the operator at 4:58, and that he made the entry at 4:55, 'just before the accident, and placed '7' over the second '5' just after the accident.' He was asked no further explanation by either of the parties. The operator (who was also called by the defendant in error) testified that shortly after he had reported the passing of train No. 3 he was called up by the train despatcher, who asked: 'What time have you got?' The operator gave the time 4:51 or 2, and the despatcher replied: 'Your clock is two minutes slow,' or such a matter. And this testimony has corroboration in the testimony of the operator at Kingman, who heard the conversation. It appears, therefore, that the attention of the train despatcher was challenged to the fact and felt the importance of the fact that train No. 3 was running contrary to orders. What should he have done considering that two trains were rushing toward each other upon a single track, the safety of both dependent upon the exact observance of time by both? Minutes were important, and how important the testimony exhibits everywhere. The clocks of the telegraph operators are adjusted by standard, and not allowed to vary three seconds. The practice and safety of special orders are recognized as dependent upon the exact observance of time. Their superiority to meeting points for trains is attempted to be \n\n[202 U.S. 438, 444]\n\u00a0\n demonstrated by witness by saying that 'it is one of the objects of good railroading to cover the greatest distance in the least time, and to keep in motion the largest number of trains on a division.' The object was beset with dangers and demanded a proportionate care. It allowed little margin for inevitable delays. There was no place in it for any negligence. A train was in fault if it was behind time. It was the height of culpability to be ahead of time. A close connection at 'clearance' points was expected. It was testified that trains of the first class, which No. 3 and No. 4 were, 'can clear each other to a second.' If the trains are of different classes the inferior must clear by at least five minutes.\n Such was the system, and what it demanded the train despatcher must have known. In such a system minutes-and even seconds-are important, and it was the duty of the train despatcher to regard them. He knew, to use the testimony of the company's chief despatcher, that it was the duty of train No. 3 'not to run less than two hours late with reference to her schedule, as prescribed in the regular time-table.' She was not allowed, was his emphatic declaration, 'to make up one second of that two hours as long as that order was in effect.' She (to keep up the personification of the witness) was running two minutes ahead of time. This might of itself have caused a collision. The other train was to be considered, and that minutes were important should not have been out of the train despatcher's mind an instant. He knew that No. 3 had the right of way, with no obligation to No. 4 but to observe time. He knew that No. 4 was 'to get into the clear and out of No. 3's way,' and had no other guide but the time prescribed.\n These comments do not lose their force or application by reason of the fact that, under the special orders, the trains had an allowance of eleven minutes at Franconia. This allowance was made upon the basis of a strict observance of time, the perfect working of machinery, and exact accordance of clocks. But such perfection, in the nature of things, was liable to dis- \n\n[202 U.S. 438, 445]\n\u00a0\n turbance, and, when disturbance was observed, should have been provided against, and immediately provided against. It was no time to take chances or debate probabilities. It is to be remembered that at all stations there were not night telegraph offices. Yucca was the only one between Yucca and Franconia, and between those stations the train was lost to observation and control. The train despatcher indeed exhibited his concern. All of the fatal significance of train No. 3 running ahead of time came to his mind. His mistake was to account for it by an error in the telegraph operator's clock (giving to him this excuse against the finding of the lower courts), although he knew that the clock must have been adjusted that day under the rules with the standard time. If we were forced to find the fact, we should find it against him; but it is enough to say that there was brought to him, considering his position and the responsibilities upon him, a demand for a care which he omitted to observe. If he had been as considerate as he ought to have been, he would have stopped No. 3 at Franconia. And for this conclusion we need not the proof afforded by the collision. The collision, however, and the excuses offered for it, make the conclusion irresistible. Plaintiff in error excuses the train despatcher by a defect in the clock of the telegraph operator at Yucca. The engineer of No. 3 excuses himself by virtually condemning the clocks of the company by which he had tested his watch. He is sure if No. 4 had been running on time he would have met her at Haviland, the station between Yucca and Franconia. A system which permits such confusion and the endangering of human lives is wrong or wrongly administered. We need go no farther in the present case than to say that it was wrongly administered. The train despatcher failed to take into account and do what a prudent man would have taken into account and have done.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice Brewer dissents. \n\n\n\n","134":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSAWYER v. U S(1906)\nNo. 553\nArgued: Decided: April 30, 1906\n\n\n\n [Messrs. \n\n[202 U.S. 150, 151]\n\u00a0\n The writ of error in this case brings before this court a judgment of conviction of murder, rendered in the circuit court of the United States for the eastern district of North Carolina.\n The plaintiffs in error were indicted at the fall term, 1905, of the United States district court for the eastern district of North Carolina, Wilmington division, for the murder, by shooting, on the 28th day of October, 1905, of E. R. Rumill, captain, John T. Hall, mate, John Falbe, cook, C. L. Smith, engineer, and John S. Coakley, seaman, committed on the high seas and within the jurisdiction of the court wherein the indictment was found, and on board of the American vessel called the Harry A. Berwin. The indictment alleged that after the shooting the deceased were thrown into the sea. Upon the trial of the plaintiffs in error in November, 1905, in the United States circuit court for the eastern district of North Carolina, to which court the indictment had been duly transferred for trial, they were convicted of the murder of the first four named in the indictment. The court told the jury that the defendants were not charged with killing Coakley, and, if charged in the bill, there was no evidence to support the charge. \n\n[202 U.S. 150, 152]\n\u00a0\n There is no question made as to the sufficiency of the indictment or of the jurisdiction of the court.\n It appeared on the trial that the plaintiffs in error were part of the crew, and, together with one Henry Scott, who was also one of the crew, were the only living persons found on the Berwin when they were arrested by the crew of a small boat, that was put off from a schooner called the Blanche H. King, which was then proceeding on a voyage up the coast from Brunswick, Georgia, to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and had arrived at a point about 32 miles southwest from Cape Fear bar. The attention of Captain Hohn W. Taylor, of the schooner, was directed about 9 o'clock in the evening in the month of October, 1905, to a vessel just ahead of him, on account of the manner in which she was carrying her lights, and because she was right in the track of his own vessel. He sent a small boat, manned by several seamen, to the vessel (which proved to be the Berwin), and the boat brought back the plaintiffs in error and Scott, who, on being brought to the deck of the vessel and telling their story, were put in irons by direction of the captain, who then steered his vessel for the nearest port, which was Southport, North Carolina, where the men were delivered to the Federal authorities. Upon the trial of the indictment which was found against the plaintiffs in error, the man Scott was called as a witness, and swore to the murder by the plaintiffs in error while the vessel was at sea, and on or about October 28, 1905\n\n\n Scott was subsequently indicted alone for the murders, and was also convicted, the plaintiffs in error being witnesses against him, and they testified that he committed the murders. He has been reprieved by the President, so that he may be again used as a witness against the plaintiffs in error in case of a new trial being granted to them.\n Corcoran Thom, George Rountree, and Henry P. Blair for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n[202 U.S. 150, 154]\n\u00a0\n Solicitor General Hoyt for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[202 U.S. 150, 157]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Peckham, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The first question to be noticed in this case arises by reason of these facts: When the case was called for trial the clerk proceeded to call the names of the jurors, and the record shows that: \n\n[202 U.S. 150, 158]\n\u00a0\n 'While the jury was being impaneled several jurors were called, and as each juror appeared he was told by the district attorney to stand at the foot of the panel, without any challenge on the part of the government, and without an opportunity given to defendants to accept, challenge for favor or cause, or to peremptorily challenge any and all of said jurors so stood aside.\n'To each and to every action in this respect on the part of the government the defendants promptly and in due time objected, but the court overruled the objections, saying the state practice would be followed, and there was no United States statute on the subject; to which ruling of the court the defendants, by their counsel, then and there duly excepted, and the exceptions were allowed. It appeared that neither the government nor the defense had exhausted all their peremptory challenges when the jury was impaneled.'\n\n The inquiry is whether the court had the power to permit such conditional challenge by the government.\n The origin of this practice is stated by Mr. Justice Field in delivering the opinion of the court in Hayes v. Missouri, \n120 U.S. 68\n-71, 30 L. ed. 578-580, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 350, 351, It is there said:\n'Originally, by the common law, the Crown could challenge peremptorily, without limitation as to number. By act of Parliament passed in the time of Edward the First, the right to challenge was restricted to challenges for cause. But, by a rule of court, the Crown was not obliged to show cause until the whole panel was called. Those not accepted on the call were directed to stand aside. If, when the panel was gone through, a full jury was obtained, it was taken for the trial. If, however, a full jury was not obtained, the Crown was required to show cause against the jurors who had been directed to stand aside; and, if no sufficient cause was shown, the jury was completed from them.'\n\n The question here involved was not directly before the court in that case, but the accuracy of the statement is not questioned. It is not disputed that the practice has prevailed in \n\n[202 U.S. 150, 159]\n\u00a0\n the state of North Carolina ever since the foundation of the state, and it has also prevailed in South Carolina and Pennsylvania.\n In 1790 Congress provided for granting certain peremptory challenges to the defendant (1 Stat. at L. 119, chap. 9), but no peremptory challenge was allowed to the government.\n While the government was thus situated in regard to peremptory challenges, the case of United States v. Marchant, 12 Wheat. 480, 6 L. ed. 700, came before the court. The question directly involved was whether persons jointly charged in the same indictment for a capital offense had a right by law to be tried separately without the consent of the prosecutor, and it was held that persons so jointly charged had not that right, but that such separate trial was a matter to be allowed in the discretion of the court. In the course of the opinion, however, which was delivered by Mr. Justice Story, it was stated as follows:\n'But a still more direct conclusion against the right may be drawn from the admitted right of the Crown to challenge in criminal cases, and the practice under that right. We do not say that the same right belongs to any of the states in the Union; for there may be a diversity in this respect as to the local jurisprudence or practice. The inquiry here is not as to what is the state prerogative, but, simply what is the common-law doctrine as to the point under consideration. Until the statute of 33 Edw. I., the Crown might challenge peremptorily any juror, without assigning any cause; but that statute took away that right, and narrowed the challenges of the Crown to those for cause shown. But the practice since this statute has uniformly been, and it is clearly settled, not to compel the Crown to show cause at the time of objection taken, but to put aside the juror until the whole panel is gone through. Hawkins, on this point, says (2 P. C. chap. 43,  2, 3), 'if the King challenged a juror before the panel is perused, it is agreed that he need not show any cause of his challenge till the whole panel be gone through, and it appears that there will not be a full jury without the person so challenged. And \n\n[202 U.S. 150, 160]\n\u00a0\n if the defendant, in order to oblige the King to show cause, presently challenge touts paravaile; yet it hath been adjudged that the defendant shall be first put to show all his causes of challenge before the King need to show any.' And the learned author is fully borne out by the authorities which he cites, and the same rule has been recognized down to the present times.\n\n'This acknowledged right of peremptory challenge existing in the Crown before the statute of 33 Edw. I. and the uniform practice which has prevailed since that statute, to allow a qualified and conditional exercise of the same right, if other sufficient jurors remained for the trial, demonstrate, as we think, that no such power of selecting his jury belongs, or was ever supposed to belong, by the common law, to the prisoner; and that, therefore, he could not demand, as matter of right, a separate trial to enable him to exercise it. In a separate or joint trial he could at any time be defeated by the Crown of such choice, by its own admitted prerogative.'\n\n It is true that the matter involved in the Marchant Case did not call for this statement, as the direct question was not in issue. It was made argumentatively, as one reason for denying the right claimed by defendant in that case. Subsequently the circuit court of the United States in Pennsylvania, in 1830, followed the views expressed in the Marchant Case. United States v. Wilson, Baldw. 78, Fed. Cas. No. 16,730. In that case the right was claimed by the district attorney and denied by counsel for defendant, but was allowed by the court upon the ground that it considered the opinion of the Supreme Court as a recognition of the qualified right of the United States to challenge, and directed the juror to be put aside until the panel was exhausted, declaring that if that should happen and the juror be again called, the United States could not then challenge him without showing cause.\n Again, in the case of United States v. Douglass, 2 Blatchf. 207, Fed. Cas. No. 14, 989, which was decided in 1851, this qualified right of challenge was conceded to exist by Mr. Justice Nelson, who presided on \n\n[202 U.S. 150, 161]\n\u00a0\n the trial in that case, but was denied by District Judge Betts, who sat with him. The case was tried in the southern district of New York, in which state no such right of conditional challenge existed. A motion for a new trial was made before the same court, and Judge Nelson said in his opinion, in denying the motion, that 'this qualified right of challenge without cause is the settled doctrine of the common law, and has been recognized by the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of United States v. Marchant, supra, and has been practised upon in some of the circuits.' The judge then said that the doubt as to the right of the government arose by reason of the passage of the act of July 20, 1840 (5 Stat. at L. 394, chap. 47), providing for the designation of jurors to serve in the Federal courts, and empowering those courts to make rules and regulations for conforming the designation and impaneling of jurors to the laws and usages of the states as they may exist at the time. A rule to that effect has been adopted in the southern district of New York. The justice further stated in his opinion that the act of 1840 applied only to the mode and manner of drawing or selecting the jury,-that is, by ballot, lot, or otherwise,-as prescribed by the state laws, and that it did not affect the questions involved in the right of challenging the jurors called, whether peremptorily or for cause; and that those questions stand upon the common law, except where regulated by the act of Congress. Judge Betts, in his opinion, which is set forth in the report, held that no such right existed, certainly not in the states where such practice was not recognized.\n In 1855 the case of United States v. Shackleford, 18 How. 588, 15 L. ed. 495, came before the court. It arose on a certificate of difference of opinion between the judges holding the circuit court of the United States for the district of Kentucky. The question was whether the defendant, who was indicted for a misdemeanor, was entitled to any peremptory challenges, and, as the judges were divided in opinion, they certified the question of difference to this court. Mr. Justice Nelson, in delivering the opinion of the court, stated that the power conferred upon \n\n[202 U.S. 150, 162]\n\u00a0\n the Federal courts under the act of 1840, supra, enabled those courts to adopt rules and regulations for conforming the designation and impaneling of jurors to the laws and usages in force at the time in that state, and that by virtue of that act the courts were enabled to adopt those laws and usages in respect to challenges of jurors, whether peremptorily or for cause, and in cases both civil and criminal, with the exception therein stated. It was further held that, as the act of 1790 (1 Stat. at L. 119, chap. 9) gave persons indicted for treason a certain number of peremptory challenges, etc., that act expressly recognized the right of peremptory challenge, and the right should be regarded as excepted out of the power of the courts to regulate the subject by rule or order under the aforesaid act of 1840. Mr. Justice Nelson further observed as to the common law that it 'gave to the King a qualified right of challenge in these cases, which had the effect to set aside the juror till the panel was gone through with, without assigning cause, and if there was not a full jury without the person so challenged, then the cause must be assigned or the juror would be sworn.' Continuing, he said:\n'The court is of opinion that the right of challenge by the prisoner, recognized by the act of 1790, does not necessarily draw along with it this qualified right, existing at common law, by the government, and that, unless the laws or usages of the state, adopted by rule under the act of 1840, allow it on behalf of the prosecution, it should be rejected, conforming in this respect the practice to the state law.'\n\n In the case before us the laws or usages of the state permitted this qualified right of challenge by the government. No case in this court has been cited, nor have we found one, that decides the question now before us. Those which we have referred to, whether of this court or the circuit courts of the United States, were, at any rate, decided before the passage of the act of Congress of 1865 (13 Stat. at L. 500, chap. 86), amended in some particulars by the act of 1872 (17 Stat. at L. 282, chap. 333). These statutes gave peremptory challenges to the government, and the ques- \n\n[202 U.S. 150, 163]\n\u00a0\n tion now presented is whether, after Congress has dealt with the subject of such challenges, the former qualified right of challenge on the part of the government still exists in those states where such practice obtains, and the practice has been adopted by a rule of court in the courts of the United States. Section 800 of the Revised statutes of the United States (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 623) in substance reproduces the act of 1840 above referred to, so that the subject must be considered with reference to that section as well as the statute which gives challenges to the government.\n The question arose in United States v. Butler, 1 Hughes, 457-467, Fed. Cas. No. 14-700, The trial was held before Chief Justice Waite and Judge Bond in the United States circuit court for the district of South Carolina in April, 1877. Upon the impaneling of the jury a juror was called and was examined on his voir dire, and was then told by the counsel for the government to stand aside. The defense objected, and insisted that the prosecution must either exercise the right of challenge or waive it entirely and at once. The court held that this rule was in force when the government had no right of peremptory challenge, but as the right of peremptory challenge had been given to the prosecution, it should be given the same right with the defense and should exercise the right at once or not at all.\n This decision of the Federal circuit court is the only one brought to our attention that has been decided since the passage of the acts of Congress, giving the right of peremptory challenge to the government. It was by virtue of the act of 1840, already mentioned (Rev. Stat.  800), that the Federal courts have been enabled to adopt the laws and usages of the state in respect to the challenging of jurors, whether peremptorily or for cause. United States v. Shackleford, supra.\n When the Federal statute granted the right to a certain number of peremptory challenges to the defendant in criminal cases, it was said that such right must be regarded as excepted out of the power of the court to regulate the same by rule or \n\n[202 U.S. 150, 164]\n\u00a0\n order under the act of 1840. As the statute prescribed the number of challenges to the defendant, the court could not, therefore, proceed under the act of 1840, and by rule or order prescribe any other number, or none at all, in accordance with the practice of the state courts in that respect. The Federal statute was held to be exclusive of any other regulation on the subject, because to give any other number of challenges to the defendant would be inconsistent with the provisions of the Federal statute, even though the matter of peremptory challenge was provided for by the state practice. In such a case the power to provide by rule of court was to be regarded as excepted from the provisions of the act of 1840.\n But, in giving by statute the right of peremptory challenge to the government in certain cases, it does not necessarily affect the exercise of the power of the government to challenge in this qualified manner. A conditional or qualified right of challenge is not inconsistent with the existence of the right of peremptory challenge given by statute. The two may co-exist, and the government may exercise the right of peremptory challenge given by statute and in the same case exercise the qualified or conditional challenge, as in the case at bar.\n It was stated in the opinion in the Shackleford Case that unless the laws or usages of the state (adopted by rule by the Federal courts under the act of 1840) allowed it, the right should be rejected, and the practice conformed in that respect to the state law. But in North Carolina the state law permits such qualified right of challenge, and the court in this case made the order to follow the state practice, there being no United States statute on the subject.\n In Pennsylvania, which is one of the states where the practice has always obtained, the supreme court held that a statute giving peremptory challenges does not take away this right of the government. Haines v. Com. 100 Pa. 317, 322; Com. v. O'Brien, 140 Pa. 555, 560, 21 Atl. 385.\n To the same effect are the decisions in North Carolina. The \n\n[202 U.S. 150, 165]\n\u00a0\n right remains notwithstanding the enactment of a law giving peremptory challenges to the state. State v. Benton, 19 N. C. (2 Dev. & B. L.) 196- 203; State v. Hensley (1886) 94 N. C. 1021.\n The courts of Georgia and Florida are of a different opinion. Sealy v. State, 1 Ga. 213, 44 Am. Dec. 641; Mathis v. State, 31 Fla. 291, 315, 12 So. 681.\n We are of opinion that the passage of the acts of Congress, granting peremptory challenges to the government, has not taken away the qualified right of challenge under discussion in this case. As we have said, there is certainly nothing in the statute granting peremptory challenges to the government to prevent its exercise of the other kind of challenge when permitted in the state, and where it has been adopted by the Federal court as a rule, or by special order, as in this case. The exercise of this right is under the supervision of the court, and it ought not to be permitted to be exercised unreasonably, or so that the interests of the defendant might be unduly prejudiced. The court should take special care to that end.\n In this case it appears that neither the goverment nor the defendants had exhausted all their peremptory challenges when the jury was obtained. We think it plain that the government's right of qualified challenge was not unreasonably exercised, and the rights of the plaintiffs in error suffered no injury by the course permitted by the court.\n Another question argued arises upon the cross-examination by the district attorney, of the plaintiff in error Adams, who voluntarily became a witness on the trial on his own behalf and in behalf of his fellow plaintiff in error. The cross-examination referred to the conduct of the witness on a previous voyage and on a different vessel, in regard to which nothing had been said on the examination of the witness in chief.\n It has been held in this court that a prisoner who takes the stand in his own behalf waives his constitutional privilege of silence, and that the prosecution has the right to cross-examine him upon his evidence in chief with the same latitude as would \n\n[202 U.S. 150, 166]\n\u00a0\n be exercised in the case of an ordinary witness, as to the circumstances connecting him with the crime. Fitzpatrick v. United States, \n178 U.S. 304\n, 44 L. ed. 1078, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 944.\n It is contended on the part of the plaintiffs in error that within this rule the cross-examination was improper, as the subject-matter of the cross-examination had no tendency to connect the prisoner with the alleged crime for which he was on trial.\n The district attorney, on his cross-examination, began with questions relating to the experience which the witness had had as a seaman, and asked him in regard to the vessels that he had sailed on. It appeared that he had been one of the crew, among others, of the schooner Benefit, for some fifteen months, whose captain was a man named Falkner. He was then asked if during the latter part of the fifteen months he was on the schooner he did not have trouble and try to create insubordination on board that vessel. This question was duly objected to by counsel for defendants, and the objection overruled by the court and an exception allowed. He answered that he was not logged, and then stated that the trouble arose from the cook giving them molasses to make tea, which he said was not right, and he and three other men went to the captain and asked him if he thought it was right, and the captain said they did not have sugar and would have to use molasses. The witness took the tea and threw it overboard; that he never went among the men and tried to create dissatisfaction among them; that the captain never threatened to put him in irons, and when he left the Benefit he shipped on another vessel named the Benj. Russell, where he stayed for over three months.\n It is unnecessary in this case to inquire whether the cross- examination was within the prescribed limits, because the witness denied that he had any trouble, or that he had ever tried to create any trouble, or that there was any insubordination on his part on board the vessel named. What he said in regard to the facts showed that there was neither trouble nor \n\n[202 U.S. 150, 167]\n\u00a0\n insubordination. The government made no attempt to contradict the evidence of the witness on this subject, and hence there could have been no harm arising from the cross-examination. There are some state authorities which hold that the error, if any, is not cured by answer of the witness denying the charge. But we think the better rule is where, as in this case, it is plain that there is no injury, the exception is not available.\n The plaintiffs in error also ask for a new trial because of the remarks made by the district attorney in summing up to the jury, and the action of the court thereon.\n In the course of his remarks, and in speaking of the fact that during the time these murders were being perpetrated, one of the plaintiffs in error had testified that he drank some coffee, the district attorney said, 'A man, under such circumstances, who would drink coffee, ought to be hung on general principle.' This remark the counsel for the plaintiffs in error objected to, and, after hearing counsel on the objection, the court directed the district attorney to confine himself to a proper argument, and thereupon the district attorney expressed his regret if he had made an improper argument, and withdrew the remark.\n When the objection was first made by counsel for the plaintiffs in error the court asked if he wanted to cut the district attorney off from making any argument, but thereupon the court immediately directed the district attorney to confine himself to a proper argument, as above stated.\n Counsel for the plaintiffs in error objected to both the remarks of the district attorney and the comments of the court as made, and counsel asked to be allowed to file an exception. Upon this request the court replied, 'I will give counsel the benefit of a statement that he has made an exception which the court considers frivolous.'\n The remark of the district attorney was not appropriate argument and should not have been made, but we see nothing more that could have been done than was done by the court as soon as the objection was made by the counsel for the plain- \n\n[202 U.S. 150, 168]\n\u00a0\n tiffs in error. Counsel, in summing up to a jury, are under some excitement, and may naturally make a remark or statement which is improper. But there is not, on that account, any ground laid for setting aside a verdict where, as in this case, the court held it was improper, and the counsel withdrew and apologized for it. Dunlop v. United States, \n165 U.S. 486\n-498, 41 L. ed. 799-803, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 375. Under such circumstances it does seem as if the exception were frivolous, and the court, in stating its opinion to that effect, is not open to censure.\n The error assigned that the court said the plaintiffs in error were not charged with the murder of Coakley, when in fact the bill contained his name, has not been pressed, and we think there is no merit in it. The court said that if charged in the bill, there was no evidence to support such charge. Certainly no harm was thereby done the plaintiffs in error.\n Upon full consideration of all the objections urged by counsel for the plaintiffs in error, we think no ground appears for granting a new trial. The judgment is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice White dissented. \n\n\n\n","135":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSEABOARD AIR LINE RY. v. STATE OF FLORIDA EX REL ELLIS(1906)\nNo. 10\nArgued: Decided: December 3, 1906\n\n\n\n These cases resemble the one immediately preceding, in this: that review is sought in each of an award of a peremptory writ of mandamus by the supreme court of Florida to compel compliance with an order of the state railroad commission. In the first, the court sustained an order of the commission, made June 25, 1903, and to go into effect July 1, 1903, prescribing rates on the Florida West Shore Railway, charged to be under the control and management of the plaintiff in error (48 Fla. 129-152, 37 So. 314, 657, 658), the order being in these words: 'It is hereby ordered and adjudged by the railroad commission of the state of Florida that the following schedule of freight tariffs shall be allowed and adopted for freight shipments over the \n\n[203 U.S. 261, 262]\n\u00a0\n Seaboard Air Line Railway, to apply only to shipments from or destined to points on the Florida West Shore Railway, and from points on the Florida West Shore Railway to points on the Florida West Shore Railway, and the same shall be put into operation and be effective on the 1st day of July, A. D. 1903,' and followed by the schedule; and in the second, it enforced the order of the commission in respect to phosphates (which was noticed by us in the opinion in the preceding case). 48 Fla. 150, 37 So. 658.\n The proceedings before the commission are not disclosed, nor is there anything to show upon what the orders were based. There was notice and a hearing. And in the pleadings in the first case appear the contracts between the plaintiff in error and the Florida West Shore Railway.\n In the supreme court the relator presented no testimony, relying upon the statutory presumption which attends an order of the commission. The defendant introduced the report which it had made to the railroad commission for the year ending June 30, 1904, and the report of the railroad commission to the governor of the state for the year ending March 1, 1904, and upon these two reports the cases were considered by the supreme court.\n Messrs. Hilary A. Herbert, George P. Raney, and Benjamin Micou for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[203 U.S. 261, 266]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. J. M. Barrs and W. H. Ellis for defendant in error.\n\n\n[203 U.S. 261, 268]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n There are no special findings of facts in these cases, and only from an examination of the opinions filed by the supreme court can we ascertain what its conclusions were or upon what its judgments were based. It may well be doubted whether a railroad company can rely, as evidence in its own behalf, upon a report made and filed by it, and while a report of the railroad commission to the governor may undoubtedly be used against it in an application made at its instance to secure compliance with one of its orders, yet there is little in its report which throws light upon the questions in these cases.\n Referring to the first case, in which is presented the reasonableness of an order made by the commission respecting local rates for business on, to, or from the Florida West Shore Railway, we find it stated in the brief of the plaintiff in error that the railroad commission on December 22, 1903, made an order, to go into effect July 1, 1904, reducing local freight rates generally; that from this order no appeal was taken; that in November, 1903, an order was made reducing by 10 per cent rates on certain freights going over two or more roads, and that from such order no appeal was taken. These are the \n\n[203 U.S. 261, 269]\n\u00a0\n orders referred to in the report of the commission to the governor. But the order in controversy was made on June 25, 1903, to go into effect July 1, 1903, and is applicable solely to the Florida West Shore road. Now, whether this order of June 25, 1903, was simply operative to make the rates on the Florida West Shore road the same as those then obtaining generally in the state, or whether it made them higher or lower than such rates, does not appear. For some reason, not disclosed, the order touched only the local freight rates to and from the Florida West Shore Railway and over the Seaboard Air Line Railway. Even if the total receipts by the latter company from local freight rates were insufficient to meet what could properly be cast as a burden upon that business, such insufficiency would not justify it in an inequality of rates between different parts of the state, in one part too high and in the other too low. The state might properly insist that there should be equality in the rates,-the conditions being the same,-and, if nothing more was accomplished by the order of the commission than to establish such equality, we cannot hold that the judgment of the supreme court was erroneous.\n With reference to the second of these cases, the order made by the railroad commission is said by the plaintiff in error to be an 'irregular, unjust, and unreliable method of rate fixing;' and this upon the theory that the order makes the rate per mile the same for any distance, whether one mile or a hundred miles. It appears that 16.43 per cent of all the local freight business of the company in Florida comes from the carrying of phosphates, and reference is made to several cases in which the courts have noticed the fact that the cost of moving local freight is greater than that of moving through freight, and the reasons for the difference. But evidently counsel misinterpret the order of the railroad commission. It does not fix the rate at 1 cent per ton per mile. It simply provides that it shall not exceed 1 cent per ton per mile,-prescribes a maximum which may be reduced by the railway company, and, if distance \n\n[203 U.S. 261, 270]\n\u00a0\n demands a reduction, the company may and doubtless will make it. In addition it must be borne in mind that it is to be presumed that the railroad commission acted with full knowledge of the situation; that phosphates were in Florida possibly carried a long distance, the place of mining being far from the place of actual use or preparation for use. Further, when we turn to the report of the railroad company (which, of course, is evidence against it), we find that the company's average freight receipt per ton per mile in the state of Florida was 8 15\/100 mills; so that the rate authorized for phosphates was nearly 2 mills per ton larger than such average. Under these circumstances it is impossible to say that there was error in the conclusions of the Supreme Court of the state, and its judgments are affirmed. \n\n\n\n","136":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSECURITY MUT. LIFE INS. CO. v. PREWITT(1906)\nNo. 178\nArgued: Decided: May 14, 1906\n\n\n\n Messrs. F. W. Jenkins, Julien T. Davies, Charles S. Grubbs, and William Marshall Bullitt for plaintiff in error in No. 178.\n Messrs. John G. Johnson and Edmund F. Trabue for plaintiff in error in No. 184. \n\n[202 U.S. 246, 247]\n\u00a0\n Mr. J. H. Hazelrigg for defendant in error in both cases.\n\n Mr. Justice Peckham delivered the opinion of the court:\n Motions for rehearing have been presented by plaintiffs in error. The cases were commenced in the proper state court in Kentucky, and were argued here on their merits in January of this term, and the writs of error were dismissed (\n200 U.S. 446\n, 50 L. ed. --, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 314) because, as appeared from the record, only abstract questions remained to be decided, the licenses to do business within the state of Kentucky in both cases, which had been granted on July 1, 1904, for one year, having expired since issuing the writs of error.\n In No. 178 the petition stated that the permission or authority to continue to do business in Kentucky had been renewed and extended from year to year by the state insurance commissioner, and that he had, on July 1, 1904, 'continued the authority to the Security Mutual to transact the business of life insurance,' as evidenced by the permit 'for a period of one year from July 1st, 1904.' It was also averred that the permit had been revoked in September, 1904, and the company asked to have the revocation canceled.\n In No. 184 the petition stated that the company had been granted authority to transact business in the state of Kentucky for the period of one year then next ensuing, that is, from July 1, 1904. The petition showed that the permit had not then (October, 1904) been revoked, but it was alleged that the superintendent of insurance threatened to revoke it ( on grounds substantially similar to those set forth in the Security Case, in 200 U. S., supra, viz., the removal to a Federal court of a case commenced against the company in the state court), and an injunction was asked to prevent the revocation of the permit on that account.\n On these motions for a rehearing it is now shown, what did \n\n[202 U.S. 246, 248]\n\u00a0\n not appear in the records, that the permits in fact had been renewed for another year, from July 1, 1905, to July 1, 1906, for the purpose, as it would seem, of having the point involved reviewed by this court. Neither party adverted to this fact on the argument, and the cases were fully presented by counsel on both sides, on the merits, and the question treated as still existing.\n As the dismissal was ordered on a mistaken assumption of fact, justified by the records, that the permits had expired by lapse of time and had not been renewed, the applications for rehearing are granted and the judgments of dismissal set aside, and the cases will be decided upon the arguments already made in full by counsel for both parties.\n The facts upon the main question sufficiently appear in the report in \n200 U.S. 446\n, 50 L. ed. --, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 314. The court of appeals of Kentucky held the statute valid. 26 Ky. L. Rep. 1239, 1 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1019, 83 S. W. 611; dissenting opinion, 27 Ky. L. Rep. 77, 84 S. W. 527.\n The matter to be now determined is whether a state has the right to provide that if a foreign insurance company shall remove a case to the Federal court, which has been commenced in a state court, the license of such company to do business within the state shall be thereupon revoked.\n The statute under which the question arises is known as  631 of the Kentucky statutes, and reads as follows:\n'Before authority is granted to any foreign insurance company to do business in this state, it must file with the commissioner a resolution adopted by its board of directors, consenting that service of process upon any agent of such company in this state, or upon the commissioner of insurance of this state, in any action brought or pending in this state, shall be a valid service upon said company; and if process is served upon the commissioner, it shall be his duty to at once send it by mail, addressed to the company at its principal office; and, if any company shall, without the consent of the other party to any suit or proceeding brought by or against it in any court \n\n[202 U.S. 246, 249]\n\u00a0\n of this state, remove said suit or proceeding to any Federal court, or shall institute any suit or proceeding against any citizen of this state in any Federal court, it shall be the duty of the commissioner to forthwith revoke all authority to such company and its agents to do business in this state, and to publish such revocation in some newspaper of general circulation published in the state.'\n\n A state has the right to prohibit a foreign corporation from doing business with in its borders, unless such prohibition is so conditioned as to violate some provision of the Federal Constitution. Among the later authorities on that proposition are Hooper v. California, \n155 U.S. 648\n, 39 L. ed. 297, 5 Inters. Com. Rep. 610, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 207; Allgeyer v. Louisiana, \n165 U.S. 578\n-583, 41 L. ed. 832, 833, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 427; Orient Ins. Co. v. Daggs, \n172 U.S. 557\n, 43 L. ed. 552, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 281; Waters-Pierce Oil Co. v. Texas, \n177 U.S. 28\n, 44 L. ed. 657, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 518; New York L. Ins. Co. v. Cravens, \n178 U.S. 389\n-395, 44 L. ed. 1116-1122, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 962; John Hancock Mut. L. Ins. Co. v. Warren, \n181 U.S. 73\n, 45 L. ed. 755, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 535.\n Having the power to prevent a foreign insurance company from doing business at all within the state, we think the state can enact a statute such as is above set forth.\n The question is, in our opinion, settled by the decisions of this court. In Home Ins. Co. v. Morse, 20 Wall, 445, 22 L. ed. 365, a statute of Wisconsin, passed in 1870, in relation to fire insurance companies, after providing for certain conditions upon which the foreign company might do business within the state, continued:\n'Any such company desiring to transact any such business as aforesaid by any agent or agents in this state shall first appoint an attorney in this state, on whom process of law can be served, containing an agreement that such company will not remove the suit for trial into the United States circuit court or Federal courts, and file in the office of the secretary of state a written instrument, duly signed and sealed, certifying such appointment, which shall continue until another attorney be substituted.'\n\n While that statute was in force the Home Insurance Company of the state of New York established an agency in Wis- \n\n[202 U.S. 246, 250]\n\u00a0\n consin, and, in compliance with the provisions of the statute, the company duly filed in the office of the secretary of state of Wisconsin the appointment of one Durand as their agent, upon whom process might be served. The power of attorney was filed, containing the following agreement: 'Said company agrees that suits commenced in the state courts of Wisconsin shall not be removed by the acts of said company into the United States circuit or Federal courts.'\n After doing business in the state for some time, the company issued a policy to Morse, and a loss having occurred, Morse sued the company in one of the state courts of Wisconsin to recover the amount alleged to be due on the policy. The company entered its appearance in the suit and filed its petition to remove the case, which petition was in proper form, and was accompanied by the required bond and bail. Being presented to the state court of Wisconsin, in which the suit was brought, that court held that the statute justified the denial of the petition to remove the case into the Federal court, and a trial having been had in the state court, it gave judgment for the plaintiff on a verdict found in his favor. Upon a review of the judgment by the supreme court of Wisconsin, it was affirmed. Thereupon the insurance company sued out a writ of error from this court, and the sole question was whether the statute and agreement were sufficient to justify the state court in refusing to permit the removal of the case to the Federal court, and proceeding to judgment therein. This court held that the agreement was void, inasmuch as, if carried out, it would oust the Federal courts of a jurisdiction given them by the Constitution and statutes of the United States. It was said that the statute of Wisconsin was an obstruction to the right of removal provided for by the Constitution of the United States and the laws made in pursuance thereof, and that the agreement of the insurance company derived no support from the unconstitutional statute, and it was void as it would have been had no such statute been passed. The Chief Justice, with whom concurred Mr. Justice Davis, dissented, holding that, as \n\n[202 U.S. 246, 251]\n\u00a0\n the state had the right to exclude foreign insurance companies from the transaction of business within its jurisdiction, it had the right to impose conditions upon their admission, which was a necessary consequence from the right to exclude altogether.\n It will be seen the statute provided that in the power of attorney, appointing an agent for the company within the state, there should be an agreement that the company would not remove a case to a Federal court, and the statute was held to be void.\n Subsequently the case of Doyle v. Continental Ins. Co. \n94 U.S. 535\n, 24 L. ed. 148, involving the same statute, came before this court. In that case the court reaffirmed the decision of the Morse Case, supra, as to the invalidity of the agreement. But, in distinguishing the two cases, it was said, in the course of the opinion, that, as the state had the right to entirely exclude such company from doing business in the state, the means by which it caused such exclusion or the motives of its action were not the subject of judicial inquiry; that the conclusion reached in the Morse Case that the statute of Wisconsin was illegal was to be understood as spoken of the provision of the statute then under review; viz., that portion thereof requiring a stipulation against transferring cases to the courts of the United States; that the decision was upon that portion of the statute only, and that other portions thereof, when presented, must be judged on their merits. The court further said that the Morse Case had not undertaken to decide what the powers of the state of Wisconsin were in revoking a license previously granted, as no such question had arisen upon the facts therein, and was neither argued by counsel nor referred to in the opinion; but that in the case then before the court (that of Doyle) the point as to the power of the state to revoke a license was distinctly presented. It is stated in the opinion, as follows:\n'We have not decided that the state of Wisconsin had not the power to impose terms and conditions as preliminary to the right of an insurance company to appoint agents, keep \n\n[202 U.S. 246, 252]\n\u00a0\n offices, and issue policies in that state. On the contrary, the case of Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall. 168, 19 L. ed. 357, where it is held that such conditions may be imposed, was cited with approval in Home Ins. Co. v. Morse.'\n\n The opinion concludes as follows:\n It is said that we thus indirectly sanction what we condemn when presented directly; to wit, that we enable the state of Wisconsin to enforce an agreement to abstain from the Federal courts. This is an 'inexact statement.' The effect of our decision in this respect is that the state may compel the foreign company to abstain from the Federal courts, or to cease to do business in the state. It gives the company the option. This is justifiable, because the complainant has no constitutional right to do business in that state; that state has authority at any time to declare that it shall not transact business there. This is the whole point of the case and, without reference to the injustice, the prejudice, or the wrong that is alleged to exist, must determine the question. No right of the complainant under the laws or Constitution of the United States, by its exclusion from the state, is infringed; and this is what the state now accomplishes. There is nothing, therefore, that will justify the interference of this court.'\n In these two cases this court decided that any agreement made by a foreign insurance company not to remove a cause to the Federal court was void, whether made pursuant to a statute of the state providing for such agreement, or in the absence of such statute; but that the state, having power to exclude altogether a foreign insurance company from doing business within the state, had power to enact a statute which, in addition to providing for the agreement mentioned, also provided that if the company did remove a case from the state to a Federal court, its right to do business within the state should cease, and its permit should be revoked. It was held there was a distinction between the two propositions, and one might be held void and the other not.\n The case of Barron v. Burnside, \n121 U.S. 186\n, 30 L. ed. 915, 1 Inters. Com. Rep. 295, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 931, has been cited \n\n[202 U.S. 246, 253]\n\u00a0\n as overruling the Doyle Case, and as holding that a statute of the nature of the one in question here is void as a violation of the Federal Constitution. In that case a statute of Iowa was under consideration. It is set out in the report. The first section provides for an application by the foreign company to the secretary of state, requesting that a permit may be issued to the corporation to transact business in the state. It also provides that the application shall contain a stipulation that the permit shall be subject to each of the provisions of the act. The 3d section provides that if any cases commenced in a state court were removed by the corporation into a Federal court, the corporation should thereupon forfeit any permit issued or authority granted to it to transact business in the state. The 4th section provides for punishing the agents, officers, or servants of the corporation for doing business as such in the state, if the corporation had not complied with the statute and taken out and retained a valid permit to do business within the state. The corporation had not, in fact, taken out a permit. Barron, the plaintiff in error, was a servant of the corporation, and was engaged as engineer in running a train of the corporation, which started from Chicago and was running in the state of Iowa. He was arrested in Iowa for acting as the agent of the company in that state, while the company had no permit. Having been arrested, he applied to the supreme court of the state for a writ of habeas corpus, which was issued and a return made, and the case heard upon an agreed statement, containing the above facts. The state court upheld the validity of the statute, and the case was brought to this court by writ of error, where the judgment was reversed and the statute held invalid.\n In the opinion delivered in this court it will be observed that the agreement or stipulation provided for in the statute was the material fact upon which the court proceeded, and it was held that the statute did require such agreement. The various requirements mentioned in the 1st section of the statute were referred to as forming in fact but one proceeding, and as indis- \n\n[202 U.S. 246, 254]\n\u00a0\n solubly bound up with the application for a permit that could not be issued unless the stipulation was given which made the permit specially subject to each of the provisions of the act, including the provision not to remove. It is clear from the whole case that the stipulation not to remove was regarded as the material part, and the case was decided on that foundation. Mr. Justice Blatchford said:\n'The statute is not separable into parts. An affirmative provision requiring the filing by a foreign corporation, with the secretary of state, of a copy of its articles of incorporation, and of an authority for the service of process upon a designated officer or agent in the state, might not be an unreasonable or objectionable requirement, if standing alone; but the manner in which, in this statute, the provisions on those subjects are coupled with the application for the permit, and with the stipulation referred to, shows that the real and only object of the statute and its substantial provision is the requirement of the stipulation not to remove the suit into the Federal court.'\n\n For this reason the statute was held void.\n Reference is then made in the opinion to the Morse Case, supra, wherein it was stated that agreements in advance to oust the court of a jurisdiction conferred by law were illegal and void, and that parties could not bind themselves in advance by such an agreement thus to forfeit their rights at all times and on all occasions, whenever the case might be presented.\n The Doyle Case, supra, was also referred to, and Mr. Justice Blatchford said in regard to it as follows:\n'The point of the decision seems to have been, that, as the state had granted the license, its officers would not be restrained by injunction, by a court of the United States, from withdrawing it. All that there is in the case beyond this, and all that is said in the opinion which appears to be in conflict with the adjudication in Home Ins. Co. v. Morse, must be regarded as not in judgment.'\n\n This is the language which it is contended overrules the Doyle \n\n[202 U.S. 246, 255]\n\u00a0\n Case. We do not think so. A reference to the Doyle Case will show that the first part of the abovequoted statement is inaccurate, as the case does not seem to have been decided upon the proposition that an injunction was improper from a court of the United States to state officers. The Morse Case was referred to and approved, and the court held there was nothing inconsistent between the two cases. The Doyle opinion proceeds upon that theory.\n If it had been the intention of the court in Barron v. Burnside to overrule the Doyle Case, it was easy to have said so. Instead of that, the opinion rests upon the ground of the agreement to be exacted as a condition of granting the permit, and that the statute was not separable into parts, and it was held that the requirement of such a stipulation was void. It was not held that such a statute as the one of Kentucky, now under consideration, was void. Such statute exacts no agreement or stipulation in any form or in any part of the statute.\n In Southern P. Co. v. Denton, \n146 \nU.S. 202, 207\n, 36 S. L. ed. 942, 945, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 44, the same principle was stated, although the question was not directly involved, as the case was brought in the Federal court and the corporation contended it was not served with process in the proper district, and that the court was, on that account, without jurisdiction. The court, per Mr. Justice Gray, in the course of the opinion, remarked that a statute requiring the corporation as a condition precedent to obtaining a permit to do business within the state, to surrender a right and privilege secured by the Federal Constitution and laws, was unconstitutional and void. (Page 207, 36 L. ed. 945, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 44.) It was the same, in substance, as the Iowa statute, which was held void on account of the exaction of the agreement.\n In Barrow S. S. Co. v. Kane, \n170 U.S. 100\n, 42 L. ed. 964, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 526, Justice Gray, in delivering the opinion of the court, again stated what was regarded as the holding in the two cases of Home Ins. Co. v. Morse and Barron v. Burnside and said that 'statutes requiring foreign corporations, as a condition of being permitted to do business within the state, to stipulate not to remove into \n\n[202 U.S. 246, 256]\n\u00a0\n the courts of the United States suits brought against them in the courts of the state, have been adjudged to be unconstitutional and void.' It was the exaction of a stipulation or agreement that rendered the statute illegal.\n It is also said in Blake v. McClung, \n172 \nU.S. 239, 255\n, 43 S. L. ed. 432, 438, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 165, that a statute providing that a stipulation should be made that the company would not remove a case into a Federal court was void because it made the right to do business under the license or permit depend upon the surrender by the corporation of a privilege secured to it by the Constitution.\n It is urged that the Iowa and Texas statutes do not require an agreement not to remove. But those statutes do require such agreement. The Iowa statute provided that the application for a permit should contain a stipulation that the permit should be subject to each of the provisions of the act, among which was one that the corporation should forfeit the permit if it should remove the case. This was held to be, in effect, a stipulation not to remove, exacted as a condition for granting the permit. And so the court said:\n'As the Iowa statute makes the right to a permit dependent upon the surrender by the foreign corporation of a privilege secured to it by the Constitution and laws of the United States, the statute requiring the permit must be held to be void.' Barron v. Burnside, \n121 U.S. 200\n, 30 L. ed. 919, 1 Inters. Com. Rep. 299, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 936.\n\n In other words, the statute was regarded as exacting an agreement in advance not to remove a case, and, such being the fact, it was held that the statute was void. The Texas statute is to the same effect as that of Iowa.\n The most that can be contended for is that the Barron Case holds that where the statute exacts a stipulation in advance, as a condition of granting a permit, and the statute is not separable into parts, the whole statute is void, and a provision for withdrawing the permit, if a case is removed, is not saved. That principle, as we have said, does not touch this case, as there is no exaction of a stipulation at any time.\n It has not been decided that a statute which has no require- \n\n[202 U.S. 246, 257]\n\u00a0\n ment for a stipulation or agreement not to remove is void if there be simply a provision therein for a revocation of the permit, such as is contained in the statute under review.\n As a state has power to refuse permission to a foreign insurance company to do business ness at all within its confines, and as it has power to withdraw that permission when once given, without stating any reason for its action, the fact that it may give what some may think a poor reason or none for a valid act is immaterial.\n Counsel for the companies, in their brief, admit that the state 'has the right at any time to pass a statute expelling a company or revoking its license, and the validity of the statute of expulsion would not be affected by the motives of the state in so doing, even though the preamble expressly recited that the license was revoked because the company had removed a case. The statute would be valid-for the company had no constitutional right to remain in the state any longer than it chose to allow; and the statute would not abridge any right of removal-for, as the case had already been fully removed before the statute was in existence, the right of removal could not be said to have been hindered or abridged by a statute not even in existence.'\n Thus it is admitted that a state has power to prevent a company from coming into its domain, and that it has power to take away its right to remain after having been permitted once to enter, and that right may be exercised from good or bad motives; but what the companies deny is the right of a state to enact in advance that if a company remove a case to a Federal court its license shall be revoked.\n We think this distinction is not well founded. The truth is that the effect of the statute is simply to place foreign insurance companies upon a par with the domestic ones doing business in Kentucky. No stipulation or agreement being required as a condition for coming into the state and obtaining a permit to do business therein, the mere enactment of a statute which, in substance, says if you choose to exercise your right to re- \n\n[202 U.S. 246, 258]\n\u00a0\n move a case into a Federal court, your right to further do business within the state shall cease and your permit shall be withdrawn, is not open to any constitutional objection. The reasoning in the Doyle Case we think is good.\n The orders heretofore entered dismissing the writs of error in these cases are set aside, and the judgments of the Court of Appeals of Kentucky are affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice Day (with whom concurs Mr. Justice Harlan), dissenoing:\n In view of the importance and far-reaching effect of the decision just announced, and being unable to concur therein, we have deemed it not improper to briefly state the grounds upon which our objection to the decision of the court rests.\n Certain principles of constitutional law are firmly settled by the decisions of this court, and need no citation of cases in their support. The Constitution of the United States and the laws passed in pursuance thereof are the supreme law of the land, and of controlling authority over all the people, and in all the states of the Union. It is equally well settled that the privilege of resorting to the Federal courts for litigation of rights in controversies between citizens of different states is created by, and exercised under authority of, the Constitution of the United States, which secures to citizens of another state, when sued by a citizen of a state in which the suit is brought, the absolute right to remove their cases into the Federal court upon compliance with the terms of the act of Congress enacted to effect that purpose. This principle was announced in terms in Home Ins. Co. v. Morse, 20 Wall. 445, 22 L. ed. 365, has never been questioned, and is affirmed in frequent decisions of this court. No state regulation in hostility to this principle can be recognized without endangering the supremacy of the national Constitution.\n The Kentucky statute imposes but a single condition neces- \n\n[202 U.S. 246, 259]\n\u00a0\n sary to be now considered upon the right of foreign corporations to do business in that state. It says in effect to a company not yet licensed to transact business within its borders, there is no objection to the company transacting business in this state; on the other hand, it is desirable that it shall do so, subject to the condition that the company cease to do business in the state and its license be revoked the moment it attempts to avail itself of its constitutional right to remove a controversy into the Federal court under the terms of the Federal statute passed to make the constitutional right effectual. From that time its further right to do business shall cease and determine and its license be revoked. To companies lawfully within the state, as are the plaintiffs in error in these cases, it makes the like proposition: You may carry on your business, having complied with other conditions, but the moment you undertake to exercise the constitutional right of removal to a Federal court, your license shall be revoked, and all authority to do business in the state shall cease. That this can be constitutionally done is affirmed in the decision of the court in these cases, because of the principle that the state, having the right to exclude foreign corporations from its borders, may do so for any reason, although such action, as in the present case, is based solely upon the denial of the right of removal in proper cases by a nonresident citizen, of cases coming within the act of Congress, to the Federal courts.\n As a general proposition it is undoubtedly true that a state may prevent foreign corporations, at least those not engaged in interstate commerce, from doing business within its borders, and may impose restrictions upon the right to transact local business as it may see fit. But this right, in our opinion, is not without limitation. It is the established doctrine of this court that a restriction of this power is found in the denial of the right to a state to impose a condition in direct conflict with the Constitution of the United States, in requiring a corporation, as a sole condition of doing business within the state, to surrender the right of removal created and enforced by the Federal Con- \n\n[202 U.S. 246, 260]\n\u00a0\n stitution and laws in advance, or give it up after its admission to do business in the state.\n The question came directly before this court in the case of Home Ins. Co. v. Morse, supra, in which it was held that a state might not require a foreign corporation, as a condition of doing business within its borders, to file an agreement that such company would not remove the suit for trial into a United States circuit court or other Federal court. The act was held to be repugnant to the Constitution of the United States and the laws passed in pursuance thereof, as it denied the right of removal secured to the citizens of another state by the Constitution and laws of the United States. The question arose again in the case of Doyle v. Continental Ins. Co. \n94 U.S. 535\n, 24 L. ed. 148. In that case it was held by the majority of the court, Mr. Justice Bradley, Mr. Justice Miller, and Mr. Justice Swayne dissenting, that the state of Wisconsin might lawfully enact a statute providing that if any foreign insurance company should transfer a suit brought in the state to a Federal court, its license to do business would be canceled and revoked, and the doctrine was laid down that as a state had the right to exclude the company for any reason, the means by which it should cause such exclusion or the motives of her action were not the subjects of judicial inquiry. Thus the decisions of this court stood until the case of Barron v. Burnside, \n121 U.S. 186\n, 30 L. ed. 915, 1 Inters. Com. Rep. 295, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 931, was brought to its attention, in which it was held that a statute of Iowa, requiring a foreign corporation, as a condition of doing business in the state, to stipulate that it would not remove cases into the Federal court, which it had the right, under the laws of the United States, to remove, was void. And the case of Home Ins. Co. v. Morse, supra, was approved, and Doyle v. Continental Ins. Co. supra, qualified and explained. In this case Mr. Justice Blatchford delivered the unanimous opinion of the court. It is apparent from its perusal that the principle stated in Home Ins. Co. v. Morse and in the dissenting opinion in the Doyle Case was recognized and affirmed, and the unqualified right of exclusion denied. After \n\n[202 U.S. 246, 261]\n\u00a0\n showing that the right to remove was the creation of the Federal Constitution and laws, and could not be impaired without deprivation of a Federal right, the ground of the decision was stated to be:\n'As the Iowa statute makes the right to a permit dependent upon the surrender by the foreign corporation of a privilege secured to it by the Constitution and laws of the United States, the statute requiring the permit must be held to be void.'\n\n And further, in speaking of the Doyle Case:\n'The point of the decision seems to have been that, as the state had granted the license, its officers would not be restrained by injunction, by a court of the United States, from withdrawing it. All that there is in the case beyond this, and all that is said in the opinion, which appears to be in conflict with the adjudication in Home Ins. Co. v. Morse, must be regarded as not in judgment.'\n\n And that the court did not regard the right of a corporation in that respect as differing from that of an individual is shown in the observation:\n'Its right, equally with any individual citizen, to remove into the Federal court, under the laws of the United States, such suits as are mentioned in the 3d section of the Iowa statute, is too firmly established by the decisions of this court to be questioned at this day; and the state of Iowa might as well pass a statute to deprive an individual citizen of another state of his right to remove such suits.'\n\n In concluding the decision the court said: 'In all the cases in which this court has considered the subject of the granting by a state to a foreign corporation of its consent to the transaction of business in the state, it has uniformly asserted that no conditions can be imposed by the state which are repugnant to the Constitution and laws of the United States. Lafayette Ins. Co. v. French, 18 How. 404, 407, 15 L. ed. 451, 452; Ducat v. Chicago, 10 Wall. 410, 415, 19 L. ed. 972, 973; Home Ins. Co. v. Morse, 20 Wall. 445, 456, 22 L. ed. 365, 369; St. Clair v. Cox, \n106 \nU.S. 350, 356\n, 27 S. L. ed. 222, 225, 1 Sup. Ct. Rep. 354; Fire Asso. of Philadelphia v. New York, \n119 \nU.S. 110, 120\n, 30 S. L. ed. 342, 347, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 108.' \n\n[202 U.S. 246, 262]\n\u00a0\n It is thus apparent that the decision was made to turn, not upon the question of whether the agreement not to remove had been required in advance, or imposed as a condition of remaining in the state after entry therein, but rested upon the doctrine that, conceding the right of the state to exclude foreign corporations, its right to do business within the state could not be conditioned upon the surrender of a privilege secured to it by the Constitution and laws of the United States, and that the right to remove given to a foreign citizen or corporation was a right thus secured. The doctrine of Barron v. Burnside is, in our judgment, decisive of the contention made in the present case. If it be true, as specifically declared in that case, that the right to exclude a foreign corporation could not be made to depend solely upon the surrender by the foreign corporation of this constitutional right and privilege, it irresistibly follows that its application is fatal to the constitutionality of the statute here in question. The right of the insurance company under the present statute to do business within the state of Kentucky turns upon its willingness to surrender this privilege. If it will do so, it may continue to do business with the state; if it will not, its license will be revoked, and its right to do local business destroyed. In short, it may continue to do business within the state if it will consent to the surrender of a Federal right. We think this brings the case squarely within the limitations of the right of the state to exclude foreign corporations from its midst, and, to sustain the statute, permits a state, because of the exercise of a constitutional right, to close its gates to corporations equally entitled with private citizens in this respect to the protection given by the Constitution. The doctrine that the surrender of rights granted or secured by the Constitution of the United States may be made a condition of the privilege of doing or continuing business within a state is at war with that instrument, and if adopted or sanctioned by all the states would nullify the supreme law of the land in some of its most essential provisions.\n An examination of the decisions subsequent quent to Barron v. \n\n[202 U.S. 246, 263]\n\u00a0\n Burnside, supra, is convincing to the effect that it has been accepted cepted by the courts, national and state, as decisive of the proposition therein announced, that a state statute giving the right to do business or to terminate a business already instituted, upon the sole condition of the surrender of a Federal right, secured by the Constitution, is void and of no effect. The case, thus interpreted, has been cited and followed in subsequent cases in this and other Federal courts.\n In Southern P. Co. v. Denton, \n146 \nU.S. 202, 207\n, 36 S. L. ed. 942, 945, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 44, 46, Mr. Justice Gray, delivering the unanimous judgment of this court and referring to a statute of Texas similar to the one now under consideration, said: 'That statute, requiring the corporation, as a condition precedent to obtaining a permit to do business within the state, to surrender a right and privilege secured to it by the Constitution and laws of the United States, was unconstitutional and void, and could give no validity or effect to any agreement or action of the corporation in obedience to its provisions,'-citing Home Ins. Co. v. Morse and Barron v. Burnside. The same eminent judge, delivering again the unanimous judgment of this court in Martin v. Baltimore & O. R. Co. ( Gerling v. Baltimore & O. R. Co.) \n151 \nU.S. 673, 684\n, 38 S. L. ed. 311, 315, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 533, 537, and again citing the Morse and Barron Cases, said: 'The Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, not being a corporation of West Virginia, but only a corporation of Maryland, licensed by West Virginia to act as such within its territory, and liable to be sued in its courts, had the right, under the Constitution and laws of the United States, when so sued by a citizen of this state, to remove the suit into the circuit court of the United States, and could not have been deprived of that right by any provision in the statutes of the state.' Again, upon the authority of the same cases, including the Denton Case, this court, by its unanimous judgment in Barrow S. S. Co. v. Kane, \n170 \nU.S. 100, 111\n, 42 S. L. ed. 964, 968, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 526, 530, said: 'So statutes requiring foreign corporations, as a condition of being permitted to do business within the state, to stipulate not to remove into the courts of the United States suits brought against them in the courts of the \n\n[202 U.S. 246, 264]\n\u00a0\n state, have been adjudged to be unconstitutional and void.' To the same effect was the case of Blake v. McClung, \n172 \nU.S. 239, 255\n, 256 S., 43 L. ed. 432, 438, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 165, 171, in which it was said, upon the authority of the Morse, Barron, and Denton Cases: 'It was accordingly adjudged in Barron v. Burnside, \n121 \nU.S. 186, 200\n, 30 S. L. ed. 915, 919, 1 Inters. Com. Rep. 295, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 931, that an Iowa statute requiring every foreign corporation named in it, as a condition of obtaining a license or permit to transact business in that state, to stipulate that it would not remove into the Federal courts suits that were removable from the state courts under the laws of the United States, was void because it made the right to do business under a license or permit dependent upon the surrender by the corporation of a privilege secured to it by the Constitution. . . . So statutes requiring foreign corporations, as a condition of being permitted to do business within the state, to stipulate not to remove into the courts of the United States suits brought against them in the courts of the state, have been adjudged to be unconstitutional and void. In Chattanooga, R. & C. R. Co. v. Evans, 14 C. C. A. 116, 120, 31 U. S. App. 432, 441, 66 Fed. 809, 814, heard before Judges Taft, Lurton, and Severens, the circuit court of appeals for the sixth circuit, speaking by Judge Lurton, and referring to the Morse and Barron Cases, recognized the right of the state to prescribe terms upon which a corporation of another state or country may carry on business within its borders, but taking care at the same time to say: 'That there are limitations upon this power is equally well settled, for it cannot impose as a condition that such nonresident corporation shall not resort to the courts of the United States.'\n In Bigelow v. Nickerson, 30 L. R. A. 341, 17 C. C. A. 9, 34 U. S. App. 275, 70 Fed. 121, Judge Jenkins, speaking for the circuit court of appeals, seventh circuit, after reviewing the cases in this court, said:\n'We consider the question foreclosed and no longer open to discussion. No condition imposed upon a right granted by a state, which prevents one from availing himself of his constitutional prerogative of appeal to the courts of the United States, can be upheld.' \n\n[202 U.S. 246, 265]\n\u00a0\n In Reimers v. Seatco Mfg. Co. 30 L. R. A. 366, 17 C. C. A. 229, 37 U. S. App. 430, 70 Fed. 575, Judge Taft, speaking for the circuit court of appeals, sixth circuit, said:\n\n'The right of a state to impose conditions upon foreign corporations doing business therein is not unlimited. In Lafayette Ins. Co. v. French, 18 How. 404, 15 L. ed. 451, Mr. Justice Curtis, speaking for the supreme court, said:\n\n\"A corporation created by Indiana can transact business in Ohio only with the consent, express or implied, of the latter state. Bank of Augusta v. Earle, 13 Pet. 519, 10 L. ed. 274. This consent may be accompanied by such conditions as Ohio may think fit to impose, and these conditions must be deemed valid and effectual by other states and by this court, provided they are not repugnant to the Constitution or laws of the United States, or inconsistent with those rules of public law which secure the jurisdiction and authority of each state from encroachment by all others, or that principle of natural justice which forbids condemnation without opportunity for defense.'\n\n'In Southern P. Co. v. Denton, \n146 U.S. 202\n, 36 L. ed. 942, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 44, it was held that a law which permitted a nonresident corporation to do business within its territory on condition that it should forfeit such permit if it removed a suit brought against it into the court of the United States held within the state was unconstitutional and void, and could give no validity and effect to any agreement or action of the corporation in obedience to its provisions, because it thereby was compelled to surrender a right and privilege secured to it by the Constitution and laws of the United States; citing Home Ins. Co. v. Morse, 20 Wall. 445, 22 L. ed. 365, and Barron v. Burnside, \n121 U.S. 186\n, 30 L. ed. 915, 1 Inters. Com. Rep. 295, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 931.'\n\n Notwithstanding these cases, it is now adjudged that so far as the Constitution of the United States is concerned, it is competent for any state to withdraw or cancel a license given to a corporation of another state to do business within its limits whenever and solely because that corporation, being sued in a state court, has the case removed to the Federal court for trial or hearing. If each state should enact a statute such as the \n\n[202 U.S. 246, 266]\n\u00a0\n one before us, the right secured to a corporation when sued in the courts of a state other than the one creating it, to invoke the jurisdiction of the Federal court, would be abrogated throughout the whole United States, although such right is secured by the Constitution and by valid acts of Congress. We cannot assent to this view. It amounts to a practical nullification in respect to such corporations of the supreme law of the land, and places important constitutional rights at the mercy of the several states.\n In the state from which this case comes, after a full review of the decisions of this court, the same conclusion was reached in Com. v. East Tennessee Coal Co. 97 Ky. 238, 30 S. W. 608.\n The same view of the effect of Barron v. Burnside has been accepted by the text writers. 2 Cook, Corp. 3d ed. 1675; Moon, Removal of Causes, 1901,  30 and 31, and notes in which the author expresses the view that the Doyle Case has become obsolete and is practically overruled by Barron v. Burnside and subsequent cases in this court ( 30, note 3); Curtis, Jurisdiction of U. S. Courts, 2d ed. by Merwin, 187.\n The principles announced in Doyle v. Continental Ins. Co. and Barron v. Burnside are directly opposed the one to the other, and cannot both prevail. The former case was decided upon the principle that, as the state has the full right to exclude a foreign corporation, it may do so for any reason or for no reason. The latter case qualified this doctrine with the limitation that the exclusion may not be solely because the corporation was exercising, or would not yield the right to avail itself of, a privilege created and protected by the Federal Constitution.\n After such repeated affirmance and general acceptance, we do not think the doctrine announced in Barron v. Burnside ought to be qualified or detracted from, and certainly it seems to us that the court should not return turn to the rejected doctrine of the Doyle Case.\n If a state may lawfully withhold the right of transacting business within its borders, or exclude foreign corporations from \n\n[202 U.S. 246, 267]\n\u00a0\n the state upon the condition that they shall surrender a constitutional right given in the privilege of the companies to appeal to the courts of the United States, there is nothing to prevent the state from applying the same doctrine to any other constitutional right, which, though differing in character, has no higher or better protection in the Constitution than the one under consideration. If the state may make the right to transact business dependent upon the surrender of one constitutional privilege, it may do so upon another, and finally upon all. In pursuance of the principle announced in this case, that the right of the state to exclude includes the right, when exercised for any reason or for no reason, the state may say to the foreign corporation, 'You may do business within this state, provided you will yield all right to be protected against deprivation of property without due process of law, or provided you surrender your right to have compensation for your property when taken for private use, or provided you surrender all right to the equal protection of laws;' and so on through the category of rights secured by the Constitution, and deemed essential to the protection of people and corporations living under our institutions. This dangerous doctrine, asserted in the majority opinion in the Doyle Case, destroyed and overthrown, as we think, in Barron v. Burnside, which latter case has been consistently and repeatedly followed in this court and in other courts, Federal and state, from that day to this, ought not now to be rehabilitated and restored to its power to work destruction of rights deemed so essential to the safety of citizens, natural and artificial, that they have been secured by the provisions of the Federal Constitution.\n In the opinion of the court in this case the doctrine that a corporation cannot be permitted to be deprived of its right to do business because of the assertion of a Federal right is said not to be denied, because the right of a foreign corporation to do business in a state is not secured or guaranteed by the Federal Constitution. Conceding the soundness of this general proposition, it by no means follows that a foreign corpora- \n\n[202 U.S. 246, 268]\n\u00a0\n tion may be excluded solely because it exercises a right secured by the Federal Constitution. For, conceding the right of a state to exclude foreign corporations, we must not overlook the limitation upon that right, now equally well settled in the jurisprudence of this court, that the right to do business cannot be made to depend upon the surrender of a right created and guaranteed by the Federal Constitution. If this were otherwise, the state would be permitted to destroy a right created and protected by the Federal Constitution under the guise of exercising a privilege belonging to the state, and, as we have pointed out, the state might thus deprive every foreign corporation of the right to do business within its borders, except upon the condition that it strip itself of the protection given it by the Federal Constitution. Furthermore, it is stated in the prevailing opinion that while the state may exclude in advance or deprive a foreign corporation of the privilege of doing business after it is lawfully in the state, because of the exercise of a Federal right, it cannot require the corporation to agree in advance that it will waive such right, as that, it is admitted, would be unconstitutional.\n We think the distinction is without a substantial difference, and makes the validity of the act turn upon the means of attaining the same unlawful end. In either alternative the corporation is excluded from the state because it will not consent to surrender the right given it under the Federal Constitution. While we concede the right of a state to exclude foreign corporations from doing business within its borders for reasons not destructive of Federal rights, we deny that the right can be made to depend upon the surrender of the protection of the Federal Constitution, which secures to alien citizens the right to resort to the courts of the United States.\n In the cases decided in this court subsequently to Barron v. Burnside, while the general proposition is affirmed that a state may prescribe conditions upon which a foreign corporation may do business within its borders, in no one of them is it asserted that the state may exclude or expel such corporations because \n\n[202 U.S. 246, 269]\n\u00a0\n they insist upon the exercise of a right created by the Federal Constitution. On the contrary, this court has repeatedly said that such right of exclusion was qualified by the superior right of all citizens to enjoy the protection of the Federal Constitution. The Federal authority gives no right to deny to the citizens of a state access to the local courts of a state. For wise purposes the Federal Constitution has provided courts for citizens of different states, believed to be free from local influence and prejudice, and laws have been passed by Congress to make the privilege of resort to them effectual. In our view no state enactment can lawfully abridge this right or destroy it, directly or indirectly, by affixing heavy penalties to its assertion by those lawfully entitled to its enjoyment. We think Barron v. Burnside was intended to overrule the contrary declaration, which is found only in the Doyle Case, which is inconsistent with or opposed to every other declaration directly upon the subject in the opinions of this court.\n We are of opinion that the statute in question, so far as it authorizes the cancelation of a license given by a state to a corporation to do business within its limits, whenever such corporation, in the exercise of a constitutional right, has a suit brought against it in a state court removed to the Federal court for trial, is unconstitutional and void.\n For the reasons stated we are constrained to dissent. \n\n\n\n","137":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSECURITY MUT.

PREWITT(1906)\nNo. 178\nArgued: January 16, 1906Decided: February 19, 1906\n\n\n\n The plaintiff in error seeks by this writ to review the judgment of the court of appeals of Kentucky, reversing the judgment of the court below and dismissing the petition of plaintiff in error. The trial court granted such petition, which was to cancel the revocation, by the state insurance commissioner, of the permit granted by him to the plaintiff in error to do business in the state.\n The facts are as follows: The company is an insurance company, existing under the laws of the state of New York, and having its principal office in the city of Binghamton, in that state. In the year 1900 the company, pursuant to the laws of the state of Kentucky, applied to the insurance commissioner of that state for a permit to do business therein, and it was granted for one year from the date of such permit, which was annually renewed thereafter. On July 1, 1904, it was renewed for the last time, and the permit contained a statement that it was granted for one year, provided it was not sooner revoked. Section 635, Kentucky Statutes, provides that these licenses or permits must be renewed annually. At the time of the first application by the company for admission (A. D. \n\n[200 U.S. 446, 447]\n\u00a0\n 1900), the following statute of Kentucky was, and it ever since has been, in existence. It is known as  631, Kentucky Statutes. The section reads as follows:\n'Before authority is granted to any foreign insurance company to do business in this state it must file with the commissioner a resolution adopted by its board of directors, consenting that service of process upon any agent of such company in this state or upon the commissioner of insurance in this state, in any action brought or pending in this state, shall be a valid service upon said company; and, if process is served upon the commissioner, it shall be his duty to at once send it by mail, addressed to the company at its principal office; and if any company shall, without the consent of the other party to any suit or proceeding brought by or against it in any court of this state, remove said suit or proceeding to any Federal court, or shall institute any suit or proceeding against any citizen of this state in any Federal court, it shall be the duty of the commissioner to forthwith revoke all authority to such company and its agents to do business in this state, and to publish such revocation in some newspaper of general circulation published in the state.'\n\n In September, 1904, certain parties, named Crain and Gayle sued the company in a state court of Kentucky, and the company, without their consent, removed the suit to the circuit court of the United States for the eastern district of Kentucky. Thereupon Crain and Gayle notified the state insurance commissioner of such removal, and demanded that the commissioner should revoke the authority of the company to do business in the state, as provided for by the above statute.\n The company avers that the insurance commissioner did, on the sole ground of such removal, revoke the authority of the company to do business after September 29, 1904. The company thereupon demanded of the commissioner that he should set aside such revocation and cancel the same, which the commissioner refused to do. \n\n[200 U.S. 446, 448]\n\u00a0\n The company then commenced these proceedings in the proper state court of Kentucky, asking that the insurance commissioner be required to cancel the revocation of the authority of the plaintiff and its agents to do business in the state, and that he should grant, or continue, the authority to the plaintiff and its agents, to transact the business of life insurance in the state; and that the commissioner should be required to publish in a newspaper the fact of such cancelation, and that he should be restrained and enjoined from notifying the general agents of the plaintiff of the suspension of its license. The company specially set up the claim that, under the Constitution and laws of the United States, it was entitled to remove the suit mentioned from the state court into the United States circuit court for the eastern district of Kentucky, and that any statute of the state of Kentucky in anywise restricting or affecting that right was void as a violation of the Federal Constitution.\n The defendant demurred to the petition on the ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The trial court overruled the demurrer, and the defendant commissioner declining to plead further, the prayer of the insurance company was granted, and judgment was entered (1) directing the defendant to cancel the revocation of the permit ; (2) granting authority to the company to transact business in the state; ( 3) restraining the commissioner from notifying the general agents of the company of the suspension of its license and its right to do business in the state; (4) enjoining the commissioner from applying to any judge for an injunction restraining the company from further proceeding with its business. The defendant prayed an appeal to the court of appeals of the state, which was granted, and that court reversed the judgment of the trial court, and remanded the case, with instructions to dismiss the petition, and judgment to that effect was thereupon entered. 26 Ky.

Hazelrigg, N. B. Hays, H. R. Prewitt, and Hazelrigg & Hazelrigg for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Peckham:\n\n Mr. Justice Peckham, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n It appears that the laws of Kentucky require the annual renewal of the permit to any foreign insurance company, in order that the company may continue to do business in the state, and without such license the company is prohibited from doing any business therein.\n The writ of error in this case was filed January 27, 1905, and the license was granted July 1, 1904, and expired by its terms, if not sooner revoked, on the 1st day of July, 1905. The permit, even if illegally revoked prior to that time, became a dead letter on July 1, 1905, so far as constituting any authority to the company to remain in the state and do business therein. If the court should now assume to cancel the revocation it could not thereby reinstate the permit, which has already expired, and the company would still be without power to do business in the state until another permit should be granted. To adjudge that the old permit remained good until the expiration of the year is to adjudge an abstract question, as no relief can be now awarded concerning it. The refusal on the part of the insurance commissioner to grant authority to plaintiff to transact business after the old permit had expired does not raise a Federal question. Since the writ of error was filed the permit has ceased to have any effect, and, therefore, an event has occurred which renders it impossible for this court to grant any effectual relief in favor of plaintiff in error. In such case the court will dismiss the writ of error. Mills v. \n\n[200 U.S. 446, 450]\n\u00a0\n Green, \n159 U.S. 651\n, 40 L. ed. 293, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 132; Tennessee v.

CITY OF LEXINGTON(1906)\nNo. 55\nArgued: Decided: December 3, 1906\n\n\n\n The plaintiff in error, which was plaintiff below, filed its \n\n[203 U.S. 323, 324]\n\u00a0\n petition in the Fayette county circuit court, state of Kentucky, in equity, on February 3, 1899, for the purpose of obtaining an injunction restraining the defendants in error from the collection of certain back taxes accruing during the years 1894 to 1898, both inclusive, imposed in favor of the city of Lexington, and which the plaintiff asserted were illegally assessed. A temporary injunction was prayed for and granted, restraining the collection of the tax, and upon the trial the amount of the taxes was reduced, and, as so reduced, declared to be a lien on the property of the plaintiff in error as trustee, and judgment accordingly was entered, which judgment was, upon appeal to the court of appeals of the state, affirmed, and the plaintiff brings the case here by writ of error.\n In the amended petition it is averred that the plaintiff, as trustee, owned certain real estate in the city of Lexington, and that the tax collector of the city, asserting a claim for back taxes from 1894 to 1898, both inclusive, in favor of the city, against the trust estate in the plaintiff's hands, for $13,964.96, had, to satisfy the claim, levied on the real property held by it as trustee and described in the petition, and had advertised the same to be sold, and would sell the same, unless restrained by order of the court. It was averred that the claim for back taxes was for alleged omissions of personal property owned by the plaintiff as trustee, which had not been assessed for city taxation for the years stated, and that the tax was based on alleged assessments imposed in December, 1898, for these years, made by the city assessor of Lexington. The plaintiff denied that the pretended assessments made in 1898 for those years were any assessments at all, and alleged that there had been no assessment for the back taxes of those years or for any of them. It was averred that certain entries which had been made in the assessor's books for the years mentioned, purporting to assess the property for these back taxes, were interpolated among the assessments for those years, but were not legally made; that such entries were not assessments, nor any step in the valid assessment of back taxes in those years, and \n\n[203 U.S. 323, 325]\n\u00a0\n were made by the city assessor without any notice to, or conference with, the plaintiff of his intention to make the same, or any assessment, and the plaintiff at no time, either before or since said pretended assessment, had been given or allowed any opportunity or privilege to make any complaint or show cause against the assessment before any competent officer or tribunal whatever. It was also averred that all the property of plaintiff as trustee, during each of the years covered by the claim for back taxes, had been duly assessed, and, if it had been given the opportunity, plaintiff would have established the fact of such assessment, and that it had been fully and legally paid.\n The plaintiff averred that collection of taxes based on assessments made as above stated would be in violation of the Constitution of the United States and of the state of Kentucky, forbidding that a citizen should be deprived of his property without due process of law.\n The defendants in their answer averred that all of the property (with an exception not material) on which the defendants were claiming taxes as upon omitted property, had in fact been omitted by the plaintiff from its assessment lists during the years mentioned, and that the lists made out by the plaintiff for those years had been imperfect and improper lists, and that there was omitted therefrom a large part of the personalty owned by the plaintiff as trustee. The defendants averred that all the omitted property was properly assessable for the respective years, and that there was due thereon, in 1898, as the back taxes on the said omitted property, the sum named, to wit, $13,964,96; and the defendants denied that the valuation of the property, as fixed in the assessment, was any larger in proportion than the value of the assessment generally placed on similar property in the city of Lexington. After the assessment was made, it was averred that the delinquent tax collector demanded payment of the same, which was refused and thereupon he levied upon the property on the 31st of December, 1898. The answer then set up the making of the assessment \n\n[203 U.S. 323, 326]\n\u00a0\n on the property omitted, and showed that it was made substantially as averred in the amended petition, by inserting in each of the books for the various years an additional assessment on account of omitted property, and that, after each of the entries of assessment in the various books had been made by the assessor, he signed his name after the words, 'Assessed by me;' and it is averred that the assessment was also recorded by the assessor in the back-tax assessment book kept by the city of Lexington, and was by him reported to the auditor of the city of Lexington on the day that the assessment was made, December 31, 1898. The defendants also averred that, more than thirty days prior to the time the assessment was made, the city, through its duly authorized officers and agents, had notified the plaintiff that it had omitted from its assessments for the years 1894 to 1898, both inclusive, a large portion of the estate held by it as trustee, and, at the time of giving such notice, the officers of the city had furnished and delivered, as a part of such notice, an itemized statement of the securities and other personal property belonging to the estate, and held by the plaintiff, on the respective dates for taxation for the respective years, and that payment of the taxes upon this omitted property was repeatedly demanded of the plaintiff by the city during a period of more than thirty days prior to the assessment, and the plaintiff refused to pay any additional taxes or to list the omitted property, and that ample time and opportunity were afforded plaintiff to show that the property had not been omitted from the yearly assessments, and the plaintiff failed to do so.\n A reply and rejoinder were filed, and, upon the pleadings, the parties went to trial.\n Judgment was given for the defendants, refusing the injunction, and providing for the sale of the real estate to satisfy the amount due for back taxes, as stated in the judgment. The total amount of back taxes due on the omitted property was, by such judgment, reduced from $13,964.96, the amount claimed by the defendants, to the sum of $8,626.63. \n\n[203 U.S. 323, 327]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John T. Shelby, George R. Hunt, Joseph D. Hunt, and John R. Allen for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[203 U.S. 323, 329]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George C. Webb, George S. Shanklin, J. R. Morton, and E. P. Farrell for defendants in error.\n\n\n Mr. Justice Peckham, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n There are in the state of Kentucky two distinct methods by which an assessment for so-called back taxes can be made. One method is an assessment by a special backtax assessor, \n\n[203 U.S. 323, 330]\n\u00a0\n elected as provided for by an ordinance of the city of Lexington. This ordinance the court of appeals of the state of Kentucky has held, contrary to the contention of the plaintiff in this case, did not displace the regular assessor, or affect his right to make an assessment for back taxes. The other method provides for an assessment by the regular assessor, under  3179 of the laws relating to the city of Lexington, which section, among other things therein contained, provides that: 'Whenever the assessor shall ascertain that there has, in any former year or years, been any property omitted which should have been taxed, he shall assess the same against the person who should have been assessed with it, if living; if not, against his representative.'\n In this case the assessment for back taxes was made by the regular assessor, but not until December 31, 1898, under the abovequoted provision in  3179. It was, however, a special assessment, made after the regular assessment in the assessor's books of 1898, and after such books had been transmitted within the time prescribed by law ( 3180), December 1, 1898, to the auditor, subject to the inspection of the public. In regard to the regular assessment, the statutes of Kentucky provide ( 3181) for a board of equalization, which sits on the first Monday of January, and continues in session not longer than four weeks. The auditor must deliver to the board the assessment books filed with him by the assessor, and it is to hear all complaints against the assessments made by the assessor, and may determine the same, but it cannot increase the assessment without notice to the party whose property is to be increased. The section is part of the general statutes as to assessments for the annual taxes, and it refers evidently to the assessments made by the assessor up to the 1st of December preceding, and which appear in the book which the law directs to be sent to the auditor and by him transmitted to the board of equalization. It does not refer to an extraordinary assessment made by the assessor for back taxes subsequently to the time provided for by law for \n\n[203 U.S. 323, 331]\n\u00a0\n the making of the general assessment. The assessor must return the general assessment which he makes in his book under  3179 to the auditor on or before December 1 in each year. Section 3180. This book remains in the auditor's office subject to the inspection of the public until transmitted, in the January following, to the board of equalization under  3181. In the case before us the assessment for the back tax was made December 31, 1898, by entering a separate assessment for each year in the assessor's book for that year, and therefore these various assessments were not contained in the books of the assessor as they were sent to the auditor on December 1 of each year, respectively. The assessor's books for the years prior to 1898 were obtained in some way, and the entries of the assessments were therein made, because, as stated, there were no other books provided. We find no provision of the statute as to assessments for back taxes, which requires notice of such assessment if made at any time other than in the regular course for the general assessment as provided for in the general statute. If the assessment happens to be made in the assessor's book prior to December 1 in any year, it, of course, goes with the book to the auditor, and remains there for inspection by the public until taken before the board of equalization. Such an assessment would carry with it the provision of the law of the state applicable to the city on the subject of assessments, including the general notice under the law providing for such assessment. But that, of course cannot apply where the assessment is not made on or before December 1 in the regular assessment book. That book the taxpayer must omit to examine at his peril, when filed with the auditor, or when before the board of equalization. As sent to the auditor December 1, 1898, the book did not contain the assessment in question. And as to the books of the former years, they had passed out of the legal custody of the assessor, and he could not take any such books, and, without notice, impose a conclusive assessment for back taxes for the particular year the book had been made \n\n[203 U.S. 323, 332]\n\u00a0\n use of as an assessment book. Such assessment could not be enforced unless the taxpayer could thereafter at some time, and as a matter of right, be heard upon the question of the validity and the amount of such tax. The general statutory notice as to the regular assessment proceedings cannot be regarded as notice of this special assessment, made years after the completion of the old assessments.\n In regard to the question of notice, the court of appeals held that the burden of proof in such a proceeding as this was upon the plaintiff to establish that there was no notice of the assessment given it; but it also held that the defendant had, in fact, proved that there was notice given to the plaintiff in error before the assessment was made. This applies to a notice in fact, but the court of appeals did not hold that there was any notice made necessary by the statute in regard to such a special assessment as above described. An assessment made on December 31, 1898, in the manner set forth, although imposed before the meeting of the board of equalization in January following, was not imposed at a time which made the general statutes as to assessments applicable, and therefore the taxpayer had no statutory notice or opportunity furnished him to appear and be heard before the board. He may have examined the assessor's books for the various years 1894-1898, when filed in the auditor's office on the 1st of December, by the assessor, and prior to December 31, when this assessment was made, and found that there was no assessment made against him for any back taxes. There was no statutory obligation imposed on him to again examine the books, lest perchance they may have had an interlined assessment made in them, for the making of which the law provided no notice. It follows that the subsequent assessments placed in such books, and not appearing on any book when sent to the auditor by the assessor, would not be made under any statutory provision for notice, and would not afford the taxpayer an opportunity to be heard before the board of equalization in regard to the illegality of such tax. \n\n[203 U.S. 323, 333]\n\u00a0\n If the statute did not provide for a notice in any form, it is not material that, as a matter of grace of favor, notice may have been given of the proposed assessment. It is not what notice, uncalled for by the statute, the taxpayer may have received in a particular case, that is material, but the question is whether any notice is provided for by the statute. Stuart v. Palmer, 74 N. Y. 183, 30 Am. Rep. 289. Before this special assessment could be actually enforced or during the process of enforcement the taxpayer must have an opportunity to be heard as to its validity and extent. In Weyerhaueser v. Minnesota, \n176 U.S. 550\n, 44 L. ed. 583, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 485, it was held that the taxpayer was entitled to an opportunity to be heard before the tax could be enforced (see page 556, L. ed. page 586, Sup. Ct. Rep. page 488), that the filing of the tax list therein spoken of was, in effect, as held by the court, the institution of an action against each tract of land described in it, and the taxpayer thereafter had opportunity to make any defense he might have. This the court held was sufficient. The proceedings leading up to that assessment originated in a complaint, in writing, to the governor, who thereupon appointed a commission to hear the matter, and if proper, impose the tax, but before it could be enforced or during the process of collection the landowner had a right to be heard. The statute now before us does not provide for a notice of the special assessment, nor did the plaintiff have an opportunity to be heard as to the assessment before the board of equalization.\n But in this case the state court has afforded to the taxpayer full opportunity to be heard on the question of the validity and amount of the tax, and, after such opportunity, has rendered a judgment which provides for the enforcement of the tax as it has been reduced by the court, the reduction amounting to over $5,000. The plaintiff has, therefore, been heard, and on the hearing has succeeded in reducing the assessment. What more ought to be given? Whether the opportunity to be heard which has been afforded to the plaintiff has been pursuant to the provisions of some statute, as in McMillen v. Anderson, \n95 U.S. 37\n, 24 L. ed. 335, and Hagar v. \n\n[203 U.S. 323, 334]\n\u00a0\n Reclamation Dist. No. 108, \n111 U.S. 701\n, 28 L. ed. 569, 4 Sup. Ct. Rep. 663, or by the holding of the court that the plaintiff has such right in the trial of a suit to enjoin the collection of the tax, is not material. The state court in this case has held the taxpayer entitled to a hearing, and has granted and enforced such right, and upon the trial has reduced the tax. In so doing the court below has not assumed the legislative function of making an assessment. It has merely reduced, after a full hearing, the amount of an assessment made by the assessor under color, at least, of legislative authority.\n The court of appeals has held that the power of the trial court in giving the hearing has been properly exercised.\n It is urged that the court below has not in fact decided that the assessment against plaintiff as reduced was legal, but only that plaintiff will not be heard upon the question of enjoining the collection of the tax until plaintiff tenders the amount of tax equitably due. The plaintiff denies that there is any amount equitably due, and it contends that it has not had an opportunity to show the invalidity of the assessment. We think the contention not well founded. The court has held that the burden rested upon the plaintiff to show the invalidity of the tax. Even if erroneous, the decision is not of a Federal nature. It had the chance, at all events, to show the invalidity of the tax in whole or in part. Upon the evidence given on the trial the tax was reduced, and the court of appeals has said:\n'The claim of appellant to escape a retrospective assessment of the property of its cestui que trust in this case is wholly technical. That it owes the tax it seeks to evade is made apparent by an examination of this record. Although it had in its hands the means of instantly and most conclusively showing either that the trust estate did not own the property with which it was assessed, or that the values were too high, it introduced no evidence whatever on this subject. While it was not incumbent upon the appellees to introduce any evidence, being authorized under the principles herein enunciated to \n\n[203 U.S. 323, 335]\n\u00a0\n await the evidence of appellant showing the invalidity of the assessment complained of, yet they did introduce evidence which we think clearly establishes that appellant justly owes the amount of the tax which has been adjudged against the estate of its cestui que trust.' [27 Ky. L. Rep. 595, 85 S. W. 1083.]\n\n We think it sufficiently appears that the plaintiff had an opportunity to be heard upon the question of the validity of the tax, both for want of notice in fact, and whether the property assessed for back taxes had really been omitted from the original list for the years in question, and was therefore properly taxable under the assessment for back taxes. Even if the assessment had been made by the assessor without notice, yet if, upon the hearing in this cause, the plaintiff had the right and an opportunity to be heard, and the assessment was thereon reduced, it has obtained all the hearing it was entitled to. We think the plaintiff did have such a hearing, and the judgment is correct, so far, at least, as this court is authorized to review it. It is therefore affirmed. \n\n\n\n","139":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSOPER v. LAWRENCE BROS. CO.(1906)\nNo. 206\nArgued: Decided: April 2, 1906\n\n\n\n\n[201 U.S. 359, 360]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. William Frye White, Taber D. Bailey, and John B. Cotton for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[201 U.S. 359, 364]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Orville Dewey Baker and Amos K. Butler for defendant in error.\n [ ] \n\n[201 U.S. 359, 365]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is an action of trover for logs, brought by the plaintiff in error in the supreme judicial court of Maine. The defendant admitted carrying off the logs, but set up title to the land on which they were cut, one half in itself and one half in its licensors. At the trial the plaintiff proved a prima facie title to an undivided interest in the land. The defendant relied upon the Maine Public Laws of 1895, chap. 162,  1. With regard to that, the chief justice, presiding, instructed the jury that if the defendant and its licensors, respectively, had satisfied the conditions of  1, it was entitled to a verdict. A verdict was found for the defendant on that ground. The ruling was taken to the full court on exceptions and a motion for a new trial. At the argument there it was urged that the statute, if applicable to the plaintiff, was contrary to the 14th Amendment, and void. But the court, adverting to the question, decided the contrary, and the defendant had \n\n[201 U.S. 359, 366]\n\u00a0\n judgment. 98 Me. 268, 99 Am. St. Rep. 397, 56 Atl. 908. The case then was brought to this court.\n The material sections of the act of 1895 are as follows:\n'Sec. 1. When the state has taxed wild land, and the state treasurer has deeded it, or part of it, for nonpayment of tax, by deed purporting to convey the interest of the state by forfeiture for such nonpayment, and his records show that the grantee, his heirs or assigns, has paid the state and county taxes thereon, or on his acres or interest therein, as stated in the deed, continuously for the twenty years subsequent to such deed; and when a person claims under a recorded deed describing wild lands taxed by the state, and the state treasurer's record shows that he has, by himself or by his predecessors under such deed, paid the state and county taxes thereon, or on his acres or interest therein, as stated in the deed, continuously for twenty years subsequent to recording such deed; and whenever, in either case, it appears that the person claiming under such a deed, and those under whom he claims, have, during such period, held such exclusive, peaceable, continuous, and adverse possession thereof as comports with the ordinary management of wild lands in Maine, and it further appears that during such period no former owner, or person claiming under him, has paid any such tax, or any assessment by the county commissioners, or done any other act indicative of ownership, no action shall be maintained by a former owner, or those claiming under him to recover such land, or to avoid such deed, unless commenced within said twenty years, or before January 1, 1900. Such payment shall give such grantee or person claiming as aforesaid, his heirs or assigns, a right of entry and seisin in the whole, or such part, in common and undivided, of the whole tract, as the deed states, or as the unmber of acres in the deed is to the number of acres assessed.\n\n'Sec. 4: This act shall not apply to actions between cotenants, nor to actions now pending in court, nor to those commenced before January 1, 1900.' \n\n[201 U.S. 359, 367]\n\u00a0\n The defendant and his licensors claimed under the second branch of the statute. They held under recorded warranty deeds describing wild lands taxed by the state, running back for more than twenty years, and, although it must be taken that the first deed of the series was executed by owners of a part interest only, that deed naturally was held by the state courts to be a repudiation of the tenancy in common and to lay a foundation for the working of the act. With that question we have nothing to do. The state treasurer's record showed that the defendant, its licensors, and those under whom they claim had paid the taxes thereon continuously down to the bringing of this suit. The same persons had held such exclusive, peaceable continuous, and adverse possession of the land as comports with the ordinary management of wild lands in Maine, and during the same period no former owner had paid any tax or done any other act indicative of ownership. These facts are admitted or must be assumed to be established by the verdict. This action was brought in 1902 for acts done from 1900 to 1902, after the time allowed by  4 had run. The question is whether the statute is constitutional as applied to such a case.\n\n Before considering the construction of the statute we will deal with an objection which seems to be made to it, even if solely prospective, as we subsequently shall explain. Suppose that the law gives no effect whatever to acts done before its passage, still it is suggested that when it went into operation the plaintiff, but for its provision, would have been in constructive possession, and the statute purported at once to disseise him and to put him to an action to recover the land. But so far as the statute is prospective it merely enacts, subject to the qualification in  4, of which we shall speak in a moment, that certain acts, if done in the future, shall constitute a disseisin, and that the disseisin, if continued for the due time, shall ripen into title. The distinction between trespass and disseisin may be modified by statute as properly as it may be established by common law. Also statutes of limitation \n\n[201 U.S. 359, 368]\n\u00a0\n may be passed where formerly there were none. So far as the 14th Amendment is concerned, there is nothing to hinder a state from enacting that in future the doing of such overt acts of ownership as are possible on wild land, under a recorded deed which shows that the actor claims title, coupled with payment of the taxes, the owner meantime not paying them, and doing no act indicative of ownership, shall constitute a disseisin, or that such disseisin, if continued long enough, shall bar an action for the land. We think it unnecessary to cite the state decisions on similar statutes, or to argue that proposition at greater length. See Leffingwell v. Warren, 2 Black, 599, 17 L. ed. 261.\n The main argument for the plaintiff is that if, as was the fact, the defendant had maintained the statutory occupation for the twenty years before the passage of the act, the statute purported retrospectively to give it the title, or, if the statute did not go to that length, that at least it counted the fifteen years preceding the enactment with the five following it to January 1, 1900, in order to make up the twenty years required by  1, in any suit brought after that date. The former, more extreme suggestion, is answered by  4. By the words of that section the statute did not apply to actions brought before January 1, 1900. Therefore, if, but for the statute, the plaintiff would have had a constructive seisin and might have declared in trespass, he still had it during five years and might have declared in the same way.\n The only matter requiring analysis is the question of the former owner's position after January 1, 1900, when the act applied. The action then required to be brought by the former owner is an action 'to recover such land, or to avoid such deed.' An action to recover the land presupposes that the former owner still is out by a continuance, up to the time when the suit is brought of the acts and omissions of the parties concerned respectively which are made to constitute a disseisin. The requirement that the statutory disseisin should continue until the action was brought is further shown by \n\n[201 U.S. 359, 369]\n\u00a0\n the word 'said' in the phrase 'unless commenced within said twenty years,' to which 'or before January 1, 1900,' is the alternative. Said twenty years are the years during which the disseisor has been paying taxes and holding possession. If between 1895 and 1900 the former owner had been paying the taxes and doing acts indicative of ownership, he would be seised by the very terms of the statute. He would have no occasion to sue, and we hardly understand it to be suggested that he could be sued on the strength of a disseisin satisfying the statute during the twenty years before it was passed, but ending in 1895. If such a suggestion should be made, it would be disposed of by recalling again that for five years after the enactment, for purposes of suit, at least, he stood constructively seised by force of  4, whenever apart from the statute he would not have been disseised. Of course, therefore, he was not disseised retrospectively before the date of the act. It is still more absurd to suppose that the act meant that if he had paid the taxes and done acts of ownership, so that he was not merely constructively, but actually, seised during the five years, his title was to vanish when that time had elapsed.\n The discussion is narrowed, then, to the consideration of an action begun, as this was, after January 1, 1900, when the defendant has held that statutory possession for the five years following the act and for fifteen years before. If the plaintiff had brought a real action instead of the present suit, he would have been barred if the statute is good. The plaintiff says that the counting of the fifteen years before the enactment makes the statute bad. But suppose that the statute had enacted simply that if the conditions of  1 should be maintained from the date of the act until January 1, 1900, and no action brought, the former owner should be barred, there can be no question that it would have been valid. It was not and could not be argued that a statute of limitations allowing nearly five years would be unreasonably short. Turner v. New York, \n168 U.S. 90\n, 42 L. ed. 392, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 38; Terry v. Anderson, \n95 U.S. 628\n, 24 L. ed. 365. \n\n[201 U.S. 359, 370]\n\u00a0\n But, if such a statute would be constitutional, the requirement of a continuance of similar conditions for a time before the statute long enough to make twenty continuous years when taken with the five years following it was a pure advantage to the plaintiff, a further condition which did him only good. It was not argued that the statute was invalid because a less time was allowed to persons in the plaintiff's position than to those whose twenty years should begin to run after the statute went into effect. Similar provisions are common and seem to have been before the court in Terry v. Anderson and Turner v. New York, supra, and in Koshkonong v. Burton, \n104 U.S. 668\n, 26 L. ed. 886.\n Some objection was made to the effect given to a tax deed in the first part of the section. But that is not before us. We see nothing to indicate an intent to go beyond the law. Marx v. Hanthorn, \n148 U.S. 172\n, 37 L. ed. 410, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 508. As to the possibility that the taxes may have been assessed unlawfully or the recorded deed under which the defendant claims forged, it is admitted that such matters might be proved. As they are public facts, give color to the overt acts done upon the land, and must be accompanied by a necessarily conscious omission of the plaintiff to pay taxes or do any acts of ownership, we see nothing to hinder the legislature making them sufficient, prima facie, at least, to set the statute running and to put the former owners to a suit.\n The act, as we construe it, does not infringe the 14th Amendment. We understand our construction to agree with that adopted by the supreme judicial court of the state. That court says of the statute: 'It is not only not retrospective, but it is distinctly made prospective only in its operation, and the reasonable period of five years after the date of the enactment is allowed, during which all controversies respecting such titles might be adjusted according to 'the principles and the nature of those facts by means of which those titles had existed' before the passage of the act.' [98 Me. 282, 99 Am. St. Rep. 407, 56 Atl. 912.] Of course, if the statute, as construed by the state court, is constitutional, we follow its \n\n[201 U.S. 359, 371]\n\u00a0\n construction. Tampa Waterworks Co. v. Tampa, \n199 \nU.S. 241, 243\n, 50 S. L. ed . --, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 23. We have made some little analysis of the words simply because the state court went into no detail.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","140":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSOUTHERN PAC CO. v. INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION(1906)\nNo. 158\nArgued: Decided: February 26, 1906\n\n\n\n\n[200 U.S. 536, 537]\n\u00a0\n These are appeals from orders or decrees of the circuit court of the United States for the southern district of California, in proceedings wherein that court affirmed, and ordered to be enforced, the determination of the Interstate Commerce Commission, relating to the above-named railroad companies, directing them to desist from maintaining or enforcing a rule adopted by them and pertaining to shippers of oranges and other citrus fruits in soutern California, whereby those shippers were denied their alleged right of designating the routes for the transportation of their property from California to the Eastern markets, under a tariff of through rates, as mentioned in the orders or decrees.\n The proceeding in each case was commenced before the Commission under  13, 14, and 15 of the interstate \n\n[200 U.S. 536, 538]\n\u00a0\n commerce act (24 Stat. at L. 379, chap. 104, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 3154-3165,) by the filing of a petition with the Commission, on the part of certain corporations of the state of California, called the Consolidated Forwarding Company, and the Southern California Fruit Exchange, engaged in the business of shipping oranges and other citrus fruit from southern California to the Eastern markets. The proceeding was continued in the circuit court under  16 of the act. The petition charged the railroads with various violations of the interstate commerce act, including specially the agreement for 'routing,' hereinafter set forth, and asked the Commission to enjoin such companies from any further violation of the act. The companies put in answers to the petition, denying its material averments.\n Testimony was then taken before the Commission, and the following, among other facts, were shown:\n The through tariff of rates from California to the East, with the right of routing, which had been agreed upon between the companies complained of (hereinafter called the initial carriers) and their Eastern connections regarding the orange and other citrus fruit transportation, was in force January 1, 1900, and these proceedings were commenced February 26, 1900. Before the adoption of the rule for routing, there had been among the Eastern connections of the initial carriers under the through joint tariff rates then existing, the greatest rivalry to obtain the California fruit freight business; and this rivalry led, on the part of the connecting carriers, to a system of rebates from the through tariff rates, which was a clear violation of the commerce act, and was demoralizing in every was to honest business. Indeed, the president of one of complainants before the Commission admitted that his company (the Southern California Fruit Exchange) had in four years received rebates to an amount of over $174,000. The practice had become so general that the shippers came to regard a rebate as part of the legitimate returns from the orange business. Among those who participated in this system of rebates were what is termed the car line companies, which were incorporated companies \n\n[200 U.S. 536, 539]\n\u00a0\n owning cars in which the fruit was packed, described as ventilator or refrigerator cars, which were peculiarly adapted to the carriage of the fruit, and were hired by the initial carriers because they did not want to own equipment cars which they could keep in service only part of the year, while the car companies could use the cars for other purposes in other parts of the United States when the orange transportation was over. These car companies made arrangements with the connections of the initial carrier east of Chicago and New Orleans, by which a certain bonus, varying from $10 to $40 per car, was given the car line companies, in consideration of the car being routed over the line paying the bonus, a part of the bonus, varying from a quarter to a half, being usually turned over to the shipper by the car company, for the privilege allowed the latter of routing the shipment.\n The initial carriers form two systems,-one called the Southern Pacific System, and the other the Santa F e System. There are numerous points of junction on these lines of the defendants, where connection is made with other carriers, and at their termini in Chicago, Ogden, and New Orleans such connection is made, and through lines are formed over which the citrus fruit is transported to practically all the markets of the United States. The two systems are the only ones which reach the section of country where the orange industry in Southern California exists, and they about equally divide the transportation of the oranges therefrom. The Commission said the evidence was unsatisfactory as a basis for a conclusion whether the initial carriers pooled their citrus fruit traffic or divided the earnings therefrom; and it therefore retained such question for further hearing and investigation.\n Prior to January, 1900, the rebates by the Eastern companies, already referred to, had become so great and demoralizing that the initial carriers at length determined to try and crush the whole thing. The connecting carriers were themselves dissatisfied with this state of things, but each felt it necessary in order to compete with the others. It had been \n\n[200 U.S. 536, 540]\n\u00a0\n assumed that the car line companies were not common carriers, and were not within the commerce act, and therefore they were more ready to indulge in the practice of getting rebates whenever they could, and paying part of the amount to the shippers for giving them the right to route the shipment. Prior to the adoption of the through rate tariff with this rule under discussion, the shippers had been permitted by the initial carriers to control the routing of the freight, and also to divert it, en route, from the destination point named in the bill. In order stop the rebating on these joint through rates it was proposed to agree upon a through rate tariff, to be assented to and accepted by the railroads interested in the fruit transportation, or by as many of them as posible, with the rule in question to form part of the agreement. Such a tariff agreement was made between some of the roads (and subsequently assented to and joined in by most of the roads) and filed with the Commission, for the transportation of oranges and other citrus fruit from Southern California at $1.25 per hundred pounds, to practically all points east of the Missouri river. The tariff agreed upon by the companies contains the rule complained of, which is part of such agreement, and by it the initial carriers agreed to guarantee the through rates to the shipper, but only on the following conditions:\n'In guaranteeing the through rate named herein, the absolute and unqualified right of routing beyond its own terminal is reserved to initial carrier giving the guaranty. In accordance with this rule, agents will not accept shipping orders or other documents, if routing instructions are shown documents, if routing instructions cept verbal routing instructions.'\n\n Another rule reads:\n'Initial carrier will route each car from point of origin to point of destination, and diversions in transit will not be permitted except by consent of initial carrier, who will thereupon designate new routing when diversion necessitates change therein.'\n\n Notwithstanding the rule thus published in regard to rout- \n\n[200 U.S. 536, 541]\n\u00a0\n ing, the initial carriers generally thereafter permitted the shippers to route the cars containing their fruit as they desired. The right to divert freight from the destination point or route named in the bill of lading, and before the freight reached the billed destination, had been exercised generally by shippers, and had been allowed by the carriers throughout the country, and the practice was regarded of value to the shippers, as it enabled them sometimes to realize higher prices than they otherwise might if the freight were continued to the original destination. This diversion by the shippers also continued to be generally allowed.\n The reason for the rule, reserving to the initial carrier this right to route the traffic, is stated to have been because it enabled the initial carriers to secure the discontinuance of the practice of paying rebates. Since the adoption of that rule the rebates which had been paid to shippers and to owners of car lines were discontinued, and the Commission says there is no evidence that the practice has been resumed. They were discontinued for the obvious reason that the shippers could not control the route, and hence it would be useless for the Eastern railroad company to pay the shippers or the car line companies rebates on freight the Eastern company might not receive, and which the initial carrier alone had the routing of. As soon as the routing was agreed upon and the through tariff rates fixed, the Eastern connections had to do business with the initial carriers instead of the car company or the shipper. The shippers prepay or guarantee freight charges to destination. The initial carrier does not assume liability from damage resulting from negligence of any connecting line.\n The Commission (the chairman, Mr. Commissioner Knapp, dissenting) ordered the defendants to cease from exacting from the shippers the right to themselves make the route which the freight should take. The ground taken by the Commission was that such routing by the initial carriers subjected the shippers to undue, unjust, and unreasonable prejudice and disadvantage, and gave to the carrier an undue and unrea- \n\n[200 U.S. 536, 542]\n\u00a0\n sonable preference and advantage, and was a violation of the 3d section of the act.\n The initial carriers, believing the Commission had erred in its decision, refused to obey the order which it made, and thereupon the Commission, pursuant to the 16th section of the act, filed its bill in the circuit court for the purpose of enforcing its order.\n The bill thus filed by the Commission was demurred to by the defendants, and that demurrer was overruled. 123 Fed. 598.\n The railroad companies then answered, and the case, after the taking of further evidence, came up for final hearing, when the order of the Commission was affirmed and directed to be enforced (132 Fed. 829), although the circuit court put the affirmance on the ground that the agreement as to routing showed that there was a violation of  5 of the interstate commerce act, in that such agreement amounted to a contract or combination for the pooling of freights. The court passed upon no other question raised in the case. A very full statement of facts is contained in the report in 132 Fed. supra.\n A motion was made for a supersedeas pending the hearing of this appeal, which, for the reasons stated in the opinion of the circuit court, was denied. 137 Fed. 606.\n Messrs. Maxwell Evarts, Robert Dunlap, R. S. Lovett, Thomas J. Norton, and Gardiner Lathrop for appellants.\n\n\n[200 U.S. 536, 547]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. L. A. Shaver and Joseph H. Call for appellee.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Peckham:\n\n\n[200 U.S. 536, 550]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Peckham, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n Although there are separate proceedings in these various cases, the question arising in all is identical, and the cases will hereafter be spoken of as if there were but one proceeding before the court. The single question presented is, Has the carrier that takes the fruit from the shipper in California the right, under the facts herein, to insist upon the rule permitting such carrier to route the freight at the time it is received from the shipper?\n The Commission has decided that the carrier has not the right, and that the rule denies to shippers the use of their transportation facilities, which such shippers are entitled, to and that, in its application by the initial carriers to the fruit traffic, the shippers are subjected to undue, unjust, and unreasonable prejudice and disadvantage, and the carriers are given an undue and unreasonable preference and advantage. \n\n[200 U.S. 536, 551]\n\u00a0\n If this be the necessary effect of the rule, it may be assumed to be a violation of  3 of the interstate commerce act, and the Commission, therefore, rightly ordered the carriers to desist from observing it.\n By  16 of the act, the circuit court is given authority to enforce 'any lawful order or requirement of the Commission.' If the order be not a lawful one, the court is without power to enforce it. Whether or not such order was lawful is the matter to be determined.\n The Commission does not find that any contract existed between the initial carrier and its Eastern connections to bill the fruit according to certain proportions among the connecting railroads. The Commission said:\n'The situation warrants the inference, however, that these two initial carriers or systems, connecting with other carriers at various points, and they, in turn, connecting with numerous other carriers, as shown by the tariff, are able, by acting in concert, and routing as they see fit, to only send traffic over the roads of such carriers as fulfilled an agreement to refrain from making any rate concession to the shippers, and some influence of like character could doubtless be exerted by them upon the car lines which are also hereinafter referred to.'\n\n Such statement simply shows that if any Eastern railroad with which an agreement for joint through rates existed should give rebates on the joint through rate tariff, thus carrying freight below the rates agreed upon as the through rate tariff, that road would not get the freight.\n We see nothing in the initial carrier endeavoring to maintain the rates agreed upon as a through rate tariff, and thereby preventing the paying of rebates, which in itself is a violation of the act. The act especially prohibits, in the 6th section, any alteration of the rates agreed upon, in favor of any person or persons. There is no finding that there has in fact, as a result of the rule, been any discrimination or unjust action as between the initial carriers and the shippers themselves, and there is no evidence that any was ever practised. \n\n[200 U.S. 536, 552]\n\u00a0\n In the examination of the rule it is well to bear in mind the situation of the companies and the business at the time of its adoption. It is fully set forth in the foregoing statement of facts. The payment of the rebates was a shame, and was in truth unsatisfactory to all the railroads, besides being plainly a violation of the commerce act.\n We think there is nothing in the act which clearly prohibits the roads from adopting the rule in question. The decision turns upon the construction of a statute which at least does not in terms prohibit.\n In cases such as this a court is bound to consider the bearing of the result of either construction upon the general purposes of the act. In enacting the commerce act this court has stated that the object of Congress was to facilitate and promote commerce by the adoption of regulations to make charges for transportation just and reasonable, and to forbid undue and unreasonable preferences or discriminations. Taxas & P. R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n162 U.S. 197\n, 40 L. ed. 940, 5 Inters. Com. Rep. 405, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 666.\n The importance of the rule in this case, so far as the shipper is concerned, is not so great as is its importance to the railroads in preventing rebates. If the right of routing be looked at alone, without any connection with the claimed right of diverting the freight, the rule itself would be generally of little importance to the shipper. In all probability the freight gets to its destination when routed by the carrier as early as if routed by the shipper, and in that event the particular route taken is not very important to the latter. The evidence before the circuit court shows that the routing, when done by the carrier, was fairly apportioned among the Eastern connections, having an eye to good service and expedition, and the roads that the routing was done over were the best roads in the country; the roads that have been eliminated were the roundabout roads; there were no roads that were insolvent, so far as known by the witnesses. Now, as the fact appears that the actutl routing is generally conceded the shipper, and also his request for a diversion allowed, there is nothing in the mere \n\n[200 U.S. 536, 553]\n\u00a0\n right of routing by the companies, spearate from other facts, of which the shipper can properly complain. The Commission says it does not distinctly appear in testimony that a delivery by a particular terminal road has been denied in any particular case, yet the manifest evil results of an arbitrary application of the rule must be considered in determining its legality. If there is no such arbitrary application, we do not agree that the rule itself is to be held illegal because a violation of the act may be committed, while the evidence is that none in fact was committed. It does appear that the mere existence of the right to route on the part of the company has ended the practice of rebating. But the opportunity to obtain rebates on the part of the shipper is surely not a ground for action by the Commission or by the court. Of course, if, in attempting to cut off rebates, there is a violation of the act, the act must be followed, and that means of prohibiting them must be abandoned. Courts may well look with some degree of care before so construing a statute which confessedly does not in terms so provide, as to prohibit such a rule one the ground that it would be a violation of the statute. We are of opinion that the rule is not a violation thereof.\n It is conceded that the different railroads forming a continuous line of road are free to adopt or refuse to adopt joint through tariff rates. The commerce act recognizes such right, and provides for the filing, with the Commission, of the through tariff rates, as agreed upon between the companies. The whole question of joint through tariff rates, under the provisions of the act, is one of agreement between the companies, and they may, or may not, enter into it, as they may think their interests demand. And it is equally plain that an initial carrier may agree upon joint through rates with one or several connecting carriers, who, between each other, might be regarded as competing roads.\n It is also undoubted that the common carrier need not contract to carry beyond its own line, but may there deliver to the next succeeding carrier, and thus end its responsibility, \n\n[200 U.S. 536, 554]\n\u00a0\n and charge its local rate for the transportation. If it agree to transport beyond its own line, it may do so by such lines as it chooses. Atchison, T . & S. F. R. Co. v. Denver & N. O. R. Co. \n110 U.S. 667\n, 28 L. ed. 291, 4 Sup. Ct. Rep. 185; Louisville & N. R. Co. v. West Coast Naval Stores Co. \n198 U.S. 483\n, 49 L. ed. 1135, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 745. This right has not been held to depend upon whether the original carrier agreed to be liable for the default of the connecting carrier after the goods are delivered to such connecting carrier. As the carrier is not bound to make a through contract, it can do so upon such terms as it may agree upon; at least, so long as they are reasonable and do not otherwise violate the law. In this case, the initial carrier guarantees the through rate, but only on condition that it has the routing. It was stated by the late Mr. Justice Jackson of this court, when circuit judge, in the case of Interstate Commerce Commission v. Baltimore & O. R. Co. 3 Inters. Com. Rep. 192, 43 Fed. 37, as follows:\n'Subject to the two leading prohibitions that their charges shall not be unjust and unreasonable, and that they shall not unjustly discriminate, so as to give undue preference or advantage, or subject to undue prejudice or disadvantage persons or traffic similarly circumstanced, the act to regulate commerce leaves common carriers as they were at common law, free to make special contracts looking to the increase of their business, to classify their traffic, to adjust and apportion their rates so as to meet the necessities of commerce, and generally to manage their important interests upon the same principles which are recognized as sound, and adopted in other trades and pursuits.'\n\n This statement was approved by this court in Cincinnati, N. O. & T. P. R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n162 U.S. 184\n-197, 40 L. ed. 935, 939, 5 Inters. Com. Rep. 391, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 700.\n Having this right to agree on a joint through tariff on terms mutually satisfactory, we cannot find anything in the commerce act which forbids the agreement with such a condition therein as to routing. It is said that the 6th section, properly construed, prohibits such condition. We confess our inability to find anything in that section which does so. \n\n[200 U.S. 536, 555]\n\u00a0\n The fact that the rate, when agreed upon, must be filed with the Commission, and made public by the common carriers when directed by the Commission, does not prevent the adoption of an agreement for a through rate tariff with the condition as stated. Nor does the provision granting power to the Commission to prescribe forms of schedules of rates, as provided for in the 6th section, have any such effect. Where there is an agreed through rate tariff, and as part of such agreement, which is joined in by several railroads, the right to route cars is reserved to the initial carrier, we do not think that the shipper, by virtue of the 6th section, has the right to ignore the condition which is part of the agreement under which the through rate is made and is guaranteed.\n We cannot see that the rule violates the 3d section of the act. All the facts referred to by the Commission are nothing but statements as to how, under such a rule, there might occur a violation of that section, but we find nothing in the facts stated by the Commission, showing that such violation had occurred. In truth, the companies did not always even enforce the rule; still less did they discriminate against shippers or in favor of carriers. On the contrary, the Commission stated that 'while the initial carriers do not always route as requested by the shippers, they generally comply with their request.' The mere failure to do so does not, however, prove a violation of the section.\n The right to route is also complained of because the rule confined it to the fruit business, and therefore it was, as contended, a discrimination against those engaged in it or against the traffic itself. The transportation of this fruit is a special business; large interests are involved in it, and particular pains are taken to transport it as speedily as possible. With regard to all other freight it has substantially nothing in common. The cases are wholly unlike, and there has been no proof or complaint as to rebates being given in connection with other freight, and the witnesses for the railroad state if there were any evidence or complaint of such rebates, the same rule as to \n\n[200 U.S. 536, 556]\n\u00a0\n routing would be immediately adopted. As has been said, there is no pretense of discrimination under this rule between the shippers of freight themselves. There seems to be unanimous agreement that all shippers are treated alike and are granted the same privileges, and the routing is generally accorded them. It is the power to route, which rests with the initial carrier, that really takes away the motive for a rebate in the manner indicated, and, therefore, the granting of the request of the shipper as to a particular route may be, and is, generally conceded without danger that the rebate business may be again practised.\n The important facts that control the situation are that the carrier need not agree to carry beyond its own road, and may agree upon joint through tariff rates or not, as seems best for its own interests. Having these rights of contract, the carrier may make such terms as it pleases; at least, so long as they are reasonable and do not otherwise violate the law. We think the routing rule is not unreasonable under the facts herein, and that it does not violate the 3d section of the act.\n Because opportunities for the violation of the act may occur by reason of the rule is no ground for holding, as a matter of law, that violations must occur, and that the rule itself is therefore illegal. We are, consequently, unable to concur in the view taken by the Commission that the rule violates the 3d section of the act.\n Upon the proceeding before the circuit court, that court did not pass upon the question decided by the Commission, but held that the routing rule agreed to between the initial carrier and the various Eastern companies, and forming a part of the subsequent joint through tariffs which were filed with the Commission, was in itself a contract or combination for the pooling of freights.\n The defendants objected that the circuit court had no authority to decree the enforcement of the order upon any other ground than that taken by the Commission itself. We think that the court was not confined to those grounds, and if it \n\n[200 U.S. 536, 557]\n\u00a0\n found the rule was, in itself, for any reason illegal as a violation of the act, the order might be valid and be a lawful order, although the Commission gave a wrong reason for making it. If it held the rule to be a violation of one section, the order to desist might be valid if, instead of the section named by the Commission, the court should find that the rule was a violation of another section of the act. All the facts being brought out before the Commission or the court, the court could decide whether the order was a lawful one, without being confined to the reasons stated by the Commission. We therefore look to see the ground taken by the circuit court.\n That court found that the rule was adopted to uphold their published rates; or, in other words, to maintain the rates on the joint through tariff. Although, under previous through rate tariff, these rates had been secretly cut by the Eastern connections of the initial carriers, yet, when the routing rule was agreed to as part of the through rate tariff, these rebates ceased. Hence, as the court said, the purpose of the rule was undoubtedly to maintain the through rate tariff, and that it was effectual. But the court held, as a result, that this routing provision, being part of the through rate tariff agreed to by the various Eastern roads, made a contract among those roads for the pooling of freights on competing railroads within the meaning of  5 of the commerce act. It held that it was not necessary, in order to form a pool, in violation of that section, that the contract or agreement should fix the percentages of freight the several railroads were to receive, or that the railroads should know in advance what the percentages should be; that it was sufficient to constitute a pool if the contract or agreement provided for special means or agencies for apportioning freights, which would destroy the rivalry which would otherwise exist between the competing railroads; and an agreement by which the apportionment was left to the will of the initial carrier accomplished that purpose as effectually as though definite percentages were fixed in the contract; that defendant's plan to maintain through rates \n\n[200 U.S. 536, 558]\n\u00a0\n through the operation of the routing rule necessarily destroyed competition, and the adoption of the routing rule put the shippers in a position where their patronage could not possibly be competed for by the defendant's Eastern connections.\n Thus the mere fact that the initial carrier was granted by this through tariff agreement the right to route the freight was held to result in the formation of a pool, in violation of the 5th section of the act. There was no other agreement proved in the case. It is stated by the Commission that the shipments are forwarded by the initial carrier so as to give certain percentages of the traffic to connecting lines. At the same time the Commission finds that initial carriers generally comply with the requests of the shippers to route the freight as desired. The substance of the report of the Commission is, therefore, that there is a certain percentage of the traffic given the connecting carriers when there is no request for routing given by the shippers. It amounts to the giving of fair treatment to the connecting carriers. It is true the Commission calls this a tonnage pool between the connecting carriers, to which the initial carriers give effect by their routing arrangement, and that its object was not so much to prevent rebates, which was but an incident, as to affect the tonnage division. We are of opinion, however, that the evidence is substantially one way, and that is, that the arrangement for routing was to break up rebating, and that it has been accomplished. The evidence before the circuit court was to the effect that there was no agreement whatever with the eastern connections that any of them should have any particular proportion of the freight, but the Eastern roads entered into the routing agreement because they was satisfied that it would be better that the then present practice of rebating, and they thought that they would get a fair share of the business; or, in other words, would be fairly treated by the initial carriers, who gave them to understand that they would be so treated. The tonnage pool was, as the witnesses said, a myth; and it was testified to that there was not one of the Eastern \n\n[200 U.S. 536, 559]\n\u00a0\n companies that knew what percentage of the whole business that company secured. They simply knew that the through rates were maintained under the aperation of the routing agreement and that rebating ceased; and they were satisfied with the manner of their treatment by the initial carrier.\n The circuit court, in order to arrive at its result, necessarily treated the connecting carriers as rival and competing transportation lines for this freight, and assumed that between these lines there would exist, but for the routing agreement, a competition for the fruit transportation which could not be extinguished by any agreement as to routhing, as a condition for making through tariff rates; that as competition was destroyed by this rule, it was idle to say that such result was not intended by the defendant, and so it was held that the carrying out of the routing agreement violated the act.\n We thing these various roads were really not competing roads within the meaning of the 5th section of the commerce act, when the facts are carefully examined. That act recognizes the right of the carriers to agree upon, and provides for the publication of, joint through tariff rates between continuous roads, on such terms as the roads may choose to make, provided, of course, the rates are reasonable, and no discrimination or other violation of the act is practised. The initial carrier did not, on its line, reach the Eastern markets, but it reached various connecting railroads which did reach those markets. The initial carrier had the right to enter into an agreement for joint through rates with all or any one of these connecting companies, though such companies were competing ones among themselves. And the agreements could be made upon such terms as the various companies might think expedient, provided they were not in violation of any other provision of the act.\n Prior to the adoption of the routing rule these connecting railroads were already acting under a through rate tariff which continued up to the time when the agreement for the routing was adopted. When so acting it was no longer possible to \n\n[200 U.S. 536, 560]\n\u00a0\n compete with each other as to rates (and it is upon the rebates as to rates that this whole controversy is founded) provided the companies fulfilled their joint rate tariff agreements. The only way the rate competition could exist under the through rate tariff was by violating the law. This, unfortunately, was habitually done, and during that time the competition consisted in a rivalry between these roads as to which would be the greatest violator of the law by giving the greatest rebates.\n In truth, the only way in which these connecting lines could legally become competing railroads for this California fruit trade would be in the absence of all joint tariff rate agreements. The moment they made such agreements, and carried them out, rate competition would cease.\n All that would be needed for the total suppression of rate competition among the connecting railroads would be the honest fulfilment of their agreement as to joint through rates. And just here is where they failed and where they violated their agreement and the law by granting rebates; or, in other words, by competing, as to rates, for the freight, in violation of the joint rates. In such case we do not see any violation of the pooling section of the act, by putting in the agreement for joint through rates the provision for routing by the initial carrier. It achieved its purpose and stopped rebating, although it thereby also stopped rate competition which, in the presence of the through rate tariff, was already illegal. The railroads are no longer rate-competing roads after the adoption of a through rate tariff by them, and they have no right to privately reduce their rates.\n Now, while the most important, if not the only, effect of the routing agreement is to take away this rebating practice, and to hold all parties to that greement as part of the joint through rate tariff, we think no case is made out of a violation of the pooling provision in the 5th section of the act, even where the initial carrier promises fair treatment to the connecting roads, and carries out such promises.\n We must remember the general purpose of the act, which is, \n\n[200 U.S. 536, 561]\n\u00a0\n as has been said, to obtain fair treatment for the public from the roads, and reasonable charges for the transportation of freight, and the honest performance of duty, with no improper or unjust preference or discrimination. Under such circumstances, the court ought not to adopt such a strict and unnecessary construction of the act as thereby to prevent an honest and otherwise perfectly legal attempt to maintain joint through rates, by destroying one of the worst abuses known in the transportation business. The effort to maintain the published through joint tariff rates is entirely commendable.\n We think that the agreement in question, upon its face, does violate any provision of the commerce act, and there is no evidence in the case which shows that in fact there has been any such violation.\n The decree of the Circuit Court is reversed and the case remanded with instructions to dismiss the bill.\n Reversed, etc. \n\n\n\n","141":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSOUTHERN PAC R. CO. v. U S(1906)\nNo. 141\nArgued: January 24, 1906Decided: February 19, 1906\n\n\n\n\n[200 U.S. 341, 341]\n\u00a0\n This was a suit begun in the circuit court of the United States for the southern district of California, by bill filed April 13, 1899. The parties named as defendants were the Southern Pacific Railroad Company, the trustees in certain mortgages, and a number of individuals sued as representatives \n\n[200 U.S. 341, 342]\n\u00a0\n of a class. In a general way it may be said that the bill averred that a large body of lands, some 30,000 acres and over, had been erroneously patented to the railroad road company, and that portions thereof had been conveyed by it to bona fide purchasers. The relief sought was the confirmation of the titles of bona fide purchasers, the cancelation of the patents to the other lands, and the recovery from the railroad company of the value of the lands conveyed by it to bona fide purchasers, in accordance with the terms of the acts of Congress of March 3, 1887 (24 Stat. at L. 556, chap. 376, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1595), February 12, 1896 (29 Stat. at L. 6, chap. 18, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1596), March 2, 1896 (29 Stat. at L. 42, chap. 39, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1603), providing for the adjustment of railroad land grants. After answers by the railroad company and some of the individual defendants, proofs were taken, and upon a hearing a decree was entered which, in separate paragraphs, specifically confirmed the titles to the several tracts held by bona fide purchasers, adjudged that the United States recover from the railroad company the value of those lands, a sum amounting in the aggregate to $33, 596.92. 117 Fed. 544. This decree was affirmed by the court of appeals (66 C. C. A. 581, 133 Fed. 651), from whose decision the railroad company and the trustees appealed to this court.\n Mr. Maxwell Evarts for appellants.\n\n\n[200 U.S. 341, 344]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Joseph H. Call for appellee.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Brewer:\n\n\n[200 U.S. 341, 348]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court: \n\n[200 U.S. 341, 349]\n\u00a0\n The appellants challenge the decree on two grounds: First, that a suit in equity cannot be maintained because there is a plain, adequate, and complete remedy at law; and, second, that the United States cannot by legislation create an obligation of the railroad company for the value of the land patented to and conveyed by it to bona fide purchasers.\n No objection was made to the jurisdiction of the court as a court of equity by any pleading or before the hearing. It is undoubtedly true that a suit in equity cannot be maintained when there is a plain, adequate, and complete remedy at law. Such is the mandate of the Revised Statutes (Rev. Stat.  723, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 583) as well as the general rule in equity. Lewis v. Cocks, 23 Wall. 466, 26 L. ed 70; Killian v. Ebbinghaus, \n110 U.S. 568\n, 28 L. ed. 246, 4 Sup. Ct. Rep. 232; Litchfield v. Ballou, \n114 U.S. 190\n, 29 L. ed. 132, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 820; Allen v. Pullman's Palace Car Co. \n139 U.S. 658\n, 35 L. ed. 303, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 682. It is also true that this objection need not always be raised by some pleading, but may be presented on the hearing even in the appellate court; and, if not suggested by counsel, may be enforced by the court on its own motion. See authorities just cited. But, on the other hand, it is equally true that where the objection that the plaintiff has an adequate remedy at law is not made until the hearing, and the subject-matter is of a class over which a court of equity has jurisdiction, the court is not necessarily obliged to entertain it, even though, if taken in limine, it might have been worthy of attention.

It is necessary, therefore, to notice more in detail the allegations in the bill. That sets forth land grants to the Atlantic & Pacific Railroad Company, the Southern Pacific Railroad Company, and the Texas Pacific Railroad Company. It shows the acceptance by the Atlantic & Pacific Company of its grant, the filing of its maps of definite location, a failure to complete its road within the state of California, an act of Congress forfeiting \n\n[200 U.S. 341, 350]\n\u00a0\n the lands along the line of said road within that state, a claim of the Southern Pacific Company to some of those lands, the erroneous patenting of them to that company, a demand for a reconveyance, and the acts of Congress in respect to the adjustment of railroad land grants. The bill further alleges that more than one thousand persons, among whom are the individual defendants named in the bill, who are sued as representatives of the class, had purchased by immediate or mesne conveyances from the Southern Pacific Company certain of those lands specifically described in Exhibit A; that all these purchasers claim an interest in the lands, but the nature and extent of their claims are unkown; that a prior suit, brought to vacate and annul patents, included those lands, and had been dismissed as to them without prejudice, upon the claim of the Southern Pacific Company that it had conveyed them to bona fide purchasers. In an amendment to the bill is a prayer (in order to secure an accounting with the railroad company) for a statement of the sales of these tracts, with the names of the purchasers, dates of sales, purchase prices, and amounts paid. The bill also alleges that there is a dispute between the railroad company and the persons purchasing or contracting with it, in respect to the validity of the title conveyed, or attempted to be conveyed by the company; avers that the United States has no desire to question the title of bona fide purchasers, but, on the contrary, seeks to have such title confirmed. It prays for a determination of the tracts sold to bona fide purchasers, to the end that the titles thereto may be confirmed, for a decree vacating and annulling the patents for any lands not so sold, and quieting the title of the United States thereto, and that the railroad company be required to account to the United States for the value of the lands sold to bona fide purchasers, or such sum as had been received by the company from those sales, not exceeding $1.25 per acre, and for such other and further relief as is just and equitable.\n It is contended by the railroad company that this is merely \n\n[200 U.S. 341, 351]\n\u00a0\n an action in assumpsit to recover the amount claimed to be due for the lands patented to and sold by it to bona fide purchasers. But this ignores the full scope of the suit. The bill asked cancelation of the patents and a quieting of the title of the plaintiff to those lands still held by the company, or not sold to bona fide purchasers. It prayed a discovery of all sales and conveyances, with the dates of the sales and the amounts received thereon. It also sought a confirmation specifically of the titles of bona fide purchasers, and finally an accounting with and recovery from the company. A cancelation of patents and a quieting of title is obtainable in equity. Hughes v. United States, 4 Wall. 232, 18 L. ed. 303; Moore v. Robbins, \n96 U.S. 530\n, 24 L. ed. 848; Mullan v. United States, \n118 U.S. 271\n, 30 L. ed. 170, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1041; Williams v. United States, \n138 U.S. 514\n, 34 L. ed. 1026, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 457; Germania Iron Co. v. United States, \n165 U.S. 379\n, 41 L. ed. 754, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 337. It is true no decree was entered for the cancelation of any patents, and that matter was thus eliminated from the litigation. But the confirmation of the title of specific tracts to bona fide purchasers, which did pass into decree is equally within the jurisdiction of a court of equity. While discovery is now seldom the object of a suit in equity, and doubtless would not uphold such a suit when the full information was obtainable by proceedings at law, yet it was a well-recognized ground of equity jurisdiction (Kennedy v. Creswell, \n101 \nU.S. 641, 645\n, 25 S. L. ed. 1075, 1076; 1 Story, Eq. Jur. 11th ed.  689 and following; 1 Pom. Eq. Jur.  193 and cases cited in notes), and whether in any given case a court of equity would be justified in acting is a question for its determination. It is unnecessary to determine whether, if properly challenged, the allegations in this bill were sufficient. Probably not. United States v. Bitter Root Development Co. \n200 U.S. 451\n, 50 L. ed. --, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 318. It is enough that discovery was sought, that discovery is not obtainable in an action at law, but only in a suit in equity. It may be that in order to support a recovery from the railroad company it was not necessary that there be a formal confirmation of the titles of the purchasers from it, or that the purchasers be made parties defendant, \n\n[200 U.S. 341, 352]\n\u00a0\n yet it was competent for the court, under the pleadings, to enter such a decree, and the government was justified in asking for it. Indeed, such action seems to have been contemplated by the statute, for in the 2d section of the act of March 2, 1896, it is provided: 'An adverse decision by the Secretary of the Interior on the bona fides of such claimant shall not be conclusive of his rights, and if such claimant, or one claiming to be a bona fide purchaser, but who has not submitted his claim to the Secretary of the Interior, is made a party to such suit, and if found by the court to be a bona fide purchaser, the court shall decree a confirmation of the title, and shall render a decree in behalf of the United States against the patentee, corporation, company, person, or association of persons for whose benefit the certification was made, for the value of the land as hereinbefore provided.'\n If only an action at law had been brought to recover the value of these lands from the railroad company, unless the verdict had been for the full amount claimed, $1.25 an acre, or unless there had been specific findings of fact showing the particular tracts on account of which recovery was given, it would be open to grave doubt whether any titles would be confirmed even by inference; and a cloud would be left hanging over the titles of each of these purchasers. Clearly the case here presented was within the jurisdiction of a court of equity; and if there was any objection to that jurisdiction it should have been made in limine, and not after pleadings had been perfected and proofs taken.\n Passing to the other question, it is charged in the bill that these statutes constituted a valid contract between the government and the railroad company. Now whether that be strictly true we need not stop to consider. It is enough that upon the facts the government was entitled to recover from the company. Erroneously and by mistake the officers of the government executed patents to the railroad company conveying the legal title to the lands. The railroad company accepted such title and subsequently conveyed the lands to \n\n[200 U.S. 341, 353]\n\u00a0\n parties who dealt with it in good faith. When by mistake a tract of land is erroneously conveyed, so that the vendee has obtained a title which does not belong to him, and before the mistake is discovered the vendee conveys to a third party purchasing in good faith, the original owner is not limited to a suit to cancel the conveyances and re-establish in himself the title, but he may recover of his vendee the value of the land up to at least the sum received on the sale, and thus confirm the title of the innocent purchaser. The conveyance to the innocent purchaser is equivalent to a conversion of personal property. Irrespective, therefore, of the act of Congress, the government had the right, when it found that these lands had been erroneously patented to the railroad company, and by it sold to persons who dealt with it in good faith, to sue the railroad company, and recover the value of the lands so wrongfully received and sebsequently conveyed. The acts of Congress really inure to the benefit of the railroad company, and restrict the right of the government, for they provide that the recovery shall in no case be more than the minimum government price. In other words, the government asks only its minimum price for public land, land, no matter what the value of the tracts or the amounts received by the company may be.\n It may be noticed in this connection that in no case was the value of any land sold fixed in the decree above the sum received by the company therefor, and that in many instances that sum exceeded the minimum price of $1.25 per acre. It may also be noticed that by stipulation it appears that within the indemnity limits there still remains a large body of lands from which the railroad company can select lands in lieu of those involved in the suit.\n We see nothing in this decision of which the railroad company can complain. The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","142":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSOUTHERN PAC R. CO. v. U S(1906)\nNo. 142\nArgued: Decided: February 19, 1906\n\n\n\n This case, in which, on February 28, 1901, the United States filed its bill in the circuit court for the southern district of California, resembles the one immediately preceding, in that it was a suit to cancel certain patents erroneously issued to the Southern Pacific Railroad Company, and to quiet the title of the government to the lands mentioned therein; to confirm the title of certain other lands erroneously patented to the company and by it conveyed to bona fide purchasers; and to obtain an accounting and recovery from the company of the value of the lands so conveyed to bona fide purchasers. By the decree the full relief asked- cancelation, confirmation, and recovery-was granted. The question presented is different in that the railroad company denies that the patents were erroneously issued. The lands were within the place limits of the railroad company's grant, but the plaintiff contends that they \n\n[200 U.S. 354, 355]\n\u00a0\n were excluded from the grant because within the claimed and undetermined limits of a Mexican land grant.\n In 1838 one Juan Bandini received from the Mexican government a grant of what is termed the Jurupa ranch. After California was acquired under the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo [9 Stat. at L. 922], and on September 25, 1852, Bandini presented his petition to the commissioners appointed under the act of Congress of March 3, 1851 (9 Stat. at L. 631, chap. 41), asking confirmation of his title, and on October 17, 1854, it was confirmed, the order of confirmation describing the boundaries of the rancho in substantially the language of the act of juridical possession.\n An appeal was taken to the district court of the United States for the southern district of California, as authorized by the statute, which court, on April 5, 1861, sustained the action of the commissioners. The boundaries of the grant were thus described:\n'The said boundaries being as follows: Commencing at the foot of a small hill, standing alone, at the ca nada which the Messrs. Yorba recognize as their boundary, on the further side of the river of Jurupa. which hill the Indians in their tongue call 'Pachappa,' which was taken for a landmark, placing on it certain stones on top of others; thence course westerly along the bank of the said river thirty thousand varas to the point of the same table land on which Mr. Bandini had established his house; and where the said river makes a bend, where a stake was driven for a landmark; thence northerly, fronting towards the mountains of Cucamonga, seven thousand varas, passing between the two springs of Guspar, ending at the first white sand bank which there is on said course towards Cucamonga; thence easterly the same thirty thousand varas to a small lone mountain on the left hand of the high road going from San Gabriel to San Bernardino, called by the Indians 'Catalmacay,' and which was designated as a landmark; thence southerly seven thousand varas to the point of beginning at the foot of the small hill called 'Pachappa,' which makes a corner east, west.' \n\n[200 U.S. 354, 356]\n\u00a0\n The confirmation was made in the name of Abel Stearns, a purchaser pending the proceedings, and substituted of record for the original petitioner. On January 14, 1869, the surveyor general of California, on application of the claimant and deposit by him of the estimated cost thereof, directed a survey of the rancho. This was made, and on February 26, 1872, the survey and field notes were filed in the office of the surveyor general of California, and by him approved. On May 13, 1876, the Commissioner of the General Land Office at Washington directed a correction of some alleged errors in this survey. On appeal from this order the Secretary of the Interior, on February 21, 1877, ordered a resurvey. This was made, and on May 23, 1879, a patent was issued conforming to such resurvey. The lands in dispute are within the limits of the first, but outside those of the second, survey, and are not included in the patent.\n\n On May 1, 1862, an appeal to this court was prayed and allowed in the district court of California. On January 8, 1875, an order was here entered which, after stating that an appeal had been allowed by the district court, as shown by an inspection of the certificate of the clerk of that court, recites:\n'And whereas, in the present term of October, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and seventy-four, the said cause came on to be heard before the said Supreme Court, and it appearing that the said appellant has failed to have its cause filed and docketed in conformity to the rules of this court, it is now here ordered, adjudged, and decreed by this court that this appeal from the district court of the United States for the district of California be, and the same is hereby, docketed and dismissed.'\n\n Upon these facts a decree in favor of the plaintiff was entered by the circuit court, June 15, 1903 (59 C. C. A. 683, 123 Fed. 1007), which was affirmed by the circuit court of appeals on October 17, 1904 (66 C. C. A. 560, 133 Fed. 662), and thereupon this appeal was taken. \n\n[200 U.S. 354, 357]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Maxwell Evarts for appellants.\n Mr. Joseph H. Call for appellee.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Brewer:\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n The single question is whether these lands were, between the dates of the two surveys, sub judice, and therefore not passing under the grant to the railroad company. The map of definite location was filed and approved in 1874, and at that time, which was between the dates of the two surveys, the grant took effect. The description of the lands in the Mexican grant and in the decree of confirmation was not in the language of the United States land legislation, by section, township, and range, nor was it such that, without a survey, the exact boundaries could be determined. No one could say from reading this description whether the true north boundary was shown by the first or the second survey. The regular land surveys made by the government, establishing section, township, and range lines, would not locate the boundaries of the grant, nor would they identify either of those lines with any particular boundary. There was that generality of description which required a special survey to locate the grant. It is said that the patentee never claimed the land north of the boundary line established by the second survey, and therefore that it was in no just sense sub judice. But the boundaries being uncertain, he applied to the department authorized by Congress to determine them. It acted upon his application, and, by its survey, located the boundaries. He made no challenge of its action, but, so far as the record shows, was content therewith. While a new survey was subsequently ordered, it was not at his instance. So, at least until the first survey was set aside, it was the measure of his claim, and the lands within the boundaries established by it were sub judice. No affirmative declaration that he insisted \n\n[200 U.S. 354, 358]\n\u00a0\n upon his right to them was essential to make them a part of his claims.\n But the special contention of the appellants is that the first survey was without any authority of law, because the statute provides that upon final confirmation of the claim a survey may be ordered, and it is insisted that there was no final confirmation until the order made by this court in 1875; that, although the confirmation by the district court was in 1861, yet an appeal was allowed which transferred the case to this court, and held the question of confirmation in abeyance until the order here made in 1875. The state ( 13) provides:\n' . . . and for all claims finally confirmed by the said commissioners, or by the said district or Supreme Court, a patent shall issue to the claimant upon his presenting to the General Land Office an authentic certificate of such confirmation, and a plat or survey of the said land, duly certified and approved by the surveyor general of California, whose duty it shall be to casue all private claims which shall be finally confirmed to be accurately surveyed, and to furnish plats of the same.'\n\n Hence it is contended that the entire proceedings under the first survey were void and may be put out of consideration in determining whether the lands were sub judice. But this ignores the fact that, anterior to the first survey, the United States had practically abandoned its appeal from the order of the district court. It had for ten years failed to file any transcript in this court, and the petitioner had been entitled to the formal entry of docket and dismissal which he obtained in 1875,-an entry implying an abandoned appeal, and made to place that fact upon record. The government, which was the party interested against the petitioner, and the party taking the appeal, did not, when the application was made in 1869 to the surveyor general of California, question the right to a survey. It did not suggest that there had been no final order of confirmation, nor has it at any time raised any question of the right to that survey, and the Land Department ordered \n\n[200 U.S. 354, 359]\n\u00a0\n the second only upon a doubt of the accuracy of the first. It does not lie within the mouth of a third party to say that the government had a right to appeal, could have insisted on that right, and could have objected to the first survey on the ground of a failure to obtain a final order of confirmation. It is enough that the government recognized that it had abandoned its appeal, and was willing that proceedings should be taken looking to a survey and patent. Nor were the proceedings so absolutely void that it can be said that no claim was pending. The surveyor general was the official of the government, placed in charge of surveys, who, on application, was to determine whether the conditions had arisen which justified him in acting. If he decided erroneously his action could be set aside on review, but it was not a nullity. Even between individuals, if one brings a suit in a Federal court to quiet his title to a tract of land, and obtains a decree in accordance with his bill, and on appeal this court sets aside the decree and orders the suit to be dismissed for lack of proper allegations in respect to divers citizenship,-while it may be that the proceedings are ineffectual to determine the title, yet, can it be said that no suit was pending, no claim was made? Put the question in another aspect: Suppose no challenge of the first survey had been made, and the Land Department, acting on that survey, had caused a patent to be issued,-could the government obtain a decree setting it aside upon that showing alone, and without a disclosure of equities? In Williams v. United States, \n138 U.S. 514\n, 34 L. ed. 1026, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 457, and Germania Iron Co. v. United States, \n165 U.S. 379\n, 41 L. ed. 754, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 337, something more than premature action in certificate and patent was shown,-something which presented an equity entitling the United States to maintain its suit for cancelation.\n Another matter; at the time the map of definite location was filed and approved, this first survey had been made and approved by the surveyor general of California, and by that survey the lands in dispute were included within the Mexican grant. The railroad company, therefore, took title to its land grant with this fact apparent on the records of the Land Department. \n\n[200 U.S. 354, 360]\n\u00a0\n In an early case in this court (Kansas P. R. Co. v. Dunmeyer, \n113 U.S. 629\n, 28 L. ed. 1122, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 566) in which the question of the relative rights of railroads to granted lands and individuals claiming rights to separate tracts within the place limits was presented, we said ( p. 641, L. ed. p. 1126, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 571):\n'It is not conceivable that Congress intended to place these parties as contestants for the land, with the right in each to require proof from the other of complete performance of its obligation. Least of all is to be supposed that it was intended to raises up, in antagonism to all the actual settlers on the soil whom it had invited to its occupation, this great corporation, with an interest to defeat their claims, and to come between them and the government as to the performance of their obligations.\n\n'The reasonable purpose of the government undoubtedly is that which is expressed; namely, while we are giving liberally to the railroad company, we do not give any lands we have already sold, or to which, according to our laws, we have permitted a preemption or homestead right to attach. No right to such land passed by this grant.'\n\n And this proposition has been repeatedly reaffirmed in later cases. Hastings & D. R. Co. v. Whitney, \n132 U.S. 357\n, 33 L. ed. 363, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 112; Sioux City & I. F. Town Lot & Land Co. v. Griffey, \n143 U.S. 32\n, 36 L. ed. 64, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 362; Whitney v. Taylor, \n158 U.S. 85\n, 39 L. ed. 906, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 796.\n One thing more; it appears from a stipulation of counsel that within the indemnity limits of the grant to the Southern Pacific Railroad there remain more than 50,000 acres of surveyed public lands for which there has been no selection or application to select by the company. So that there is no such equity in favor of the company as was suggested in the case of United States v. Winona & St. P. R. Co. \n165 \nU.S. 463, 482\n, 41 S. L. ed. 789, 797, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 368.\n The decree of the Court of Appeals is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","143":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSPEER v. COLBERT(1906)\nNo. 153\nArgued: Decided: January 2, 1906\n\n\n\n\n[200 U.S. 130, 131]\n\u00a0\n Statement by Mr. Justice Peckham:\n One of the appellants, Mrs. Speer, on the 5th of March, 1901, filed this bill in her own behalf and by her husband and next friend, Emory Speer, in the supreme court of the District of Columbia, to obtain a judicial construction of the will of her deceased brother, Ethelbert Carroll Morgan, who died, testate, on May 5, 1891, a resident of the District of Columbia. Answers to the bill were duly filed and the supreme court gave judgment construing the will, which, upon appeal to the court of appeals of the District of Columbia, was reversed, and judgment was entered, construing the will, by the court of appeals. From that judgment Mrs. Speer, together with some of the parties defendant in the suit, appealed, and brought the case here for review.\n The will in question was executed on the 22d day of April, 1891, and the testator died May 5, 1891. He was never married, and left as his next of kin and heirs at law two brothers and three sisters, viz.: James D. and Cecil Morgan, and Mrs. Speer, the plaintiff in this suit, and Mrs. Anna M. Mosher and Mrs. Ada M. Hill. He appointed William J. Stephenson and John H. Magruder the executors and trustees of his will, the former of whom subsequently died and the \n\n[200 U.S. 130, 132]\n\u00a0\n latter resigned, and Michael J. Colbert and James Mosher were duly appointed by the court as substituted trustees under the will. The estate of the testator was treated by him in his will as consisting of two parts,- that which he had himself accumulated, and that which came to him through the will of his father, who died in June, 1889. His own accumulations amounted to a little over $23,000, while the estate which he received from his father somewhat exceeded $55,000, the total being a trifle over $78, 000. The estate of the deceased had been received by the substituted trustees, Colbert and Mosher, when this bill was filed by Mrs. Speer against them, and also against Mrs. Anna M. Mosher, the wife of James Mosher, and a sister of the testator, and also against the two corporations incorporated as St. Vincent's Orphan Asylum and as Trustees of St. Joseph's Male Orphan Asylum, both being in the District of Columbia, who were made parties because, as the plaintiff in her bill, they claim to be the beneficiaries under the clauses of the will of the testator, leaving a legacy to be equally divided between St. Vincent's and St. Joseph's Catholic Orphan Asylums in the city of Washington, and in order that they might make proof of their identity, if any existed, with the St. Vincent, and also with the St. Joseph, Catholic Orphan Asylums, mentioned in the will, and that they might be bound by the adjudication which might be made by the court in all respects hereafter; and also against John D. Whitney, James P. Fagan, Edward McTammany, James B. Becker, and Edward I. Devitt, who, the plaintiff alleged, claimed to be, by succession, the president and directors of Georgetown College, and who, as such, claimed an interest in the estate of the testator, under the clauses of his will mentioning Georgetown University, in the District of Columbia, and the plaintiff alleged that they were made defendants in order that they might make proof of succession to the original incorporators of Georgetown College, and that their claims to the legacy mentioned in the will might be \n\n[200 U.S. 130, 133]\n\u00a0\n adjudicated by the court. The bill alleged that the will of the testator was duly admitted to probate in the proper court in the District of Columbia. After making certain provisions, not here material, the will of the testator is as follows:\n'All the rest and residue of my estate real, personal and mixed of which I am now possessed or shall possess at my death (other than my share under my father's will of which I would become possessed at my mother's death) I give bequeath and devise to my trustees hereinafter named and their heirs and assigns with full power to sell convey mortgage and reinvest, in trust nevertheless to apply the income and profits to the use and benefit of my sisters Eleanora Speer wife of Emory Speer and Minnie Mosher wife of James Mosher in equal parts during their lives and at their death to deliver and convey each sister's share to her issue and if either sister die without issue living at her death, to deliver and convey said part to the survivor or her issue if any survive her.\n\n'And if my said two sisters shall both die leaving no issue living at their deaths I direct my said trustees to deliver and convey all the said rest and remainder of my estate (excepting my share aforesaid under my father's will) to Georgetown University in the District of Columbia to be an endowment in equal shares of the literary and medical departments thereof.\n\n ... * *\n'And I hereby give bequeath and devise any and all the estate real personal and mixed devised to me under my father's will and to which I become entitled to have and possess upon my mother's death to my trustees hereinafter named their heirs and assigns forever with full power to sell convey mortgage encumber and reinvest in trust nevertheless to pay and see to the application of\n\n'First the sum of ten thousand ($10,000) dollars to Georgetown University in the District of Columbia to be used and held as an endowment for the prosecution of research in the colonial history of Maryland and the territory now embraced in the District of Columbia and obtaining and preserving \n\n[200 U.S. 130, 134]\n\u00a0\n archives and papers having relation thereto, and known as the James Ethelbert Morgan fund.\n\n'Second a sum not to exceed five thousand ($5,000) dollars to be applied and expended under the personal supervision of my trusttees to the purchase and erection of a chime of bells and either a side altar or memorial window or a bell and either a side altar or a memorial window for some one Catholic church . . . said church to be in the District and to- designated by my mother by her last will or otherwise and if she fail so to do I direct my trustees to carry out this trust as a memorial of my mother Nora Morgan and donate the same to some Catholic church . . . giving a preference, if there be one, built by the Jesuits. And in event this clause & gift be void I direct said sum not exceeding $5,000 five thousand dollars shall be equally divided between St. Vincents' and St. Joseph's Catholic orphan asylums in the city of Washington.\n\n'Third. A sufficient sum not to exceed three thousand dollars the income to be applied to maintain a scholarship in the study of medicine preferably in Georgetown University; otherwise in some medical college in the District, to be known as the E. Carroll Morgan scholarship.\n\n'Fourth, the sum of five thousand ($5000) dollars to form a fund known as the E. Carroll Morgan fund or scholarship to be applied as I may hereafter verbally indicate to my trustees or if I fail, as my trustees with the advice of proper persons may decide to the maintenance of a scientific department, or the foundation and the application of the income to a scholarship in the classical department, in the University of Georgetown in the District of Columbia. That the qualifications under both or either of the two last clauses of this will shall be that the applicant be born in the District of Columbia and at the time or within a year a student in a Catholic or a public school of the District of Columbia and most excellent in a competitive examination conducted by the faculty of the University of Georgetown.\n\n'And lastly as to all the rest and residue of my aforesaid \n\n[200 U.S. 130, 135]\n\u00a0\n share of my father's estate my said trustees their heirs and assigns shall hold the same for the benefit of my aforesaid sisters Ellenora and Minnie upon the same limitations conditions remainders and powers and in the same manner as the trustees under my father's will, will then hold retain and possess the 'remainder' and bulk of the respective shares of my said two sisters I wish my brother Cecil to have my share of my father's library I nominate and appoint William J. Stephenson and John H. Magruder my executors and trustees of this my last will and testament.\n\n'In witness whereof I have signed and sealed and published and declared this as my will this 22nd day of April, 1891.'\n\n The plaintiff alleged that the bequest and devise to Georgetown University, upon the death of the two sisters, without issue living at the time of their death, were void, because, as alleged, there was no such incorporated institution in the District of Columbia as Georgetown University, capable of taking the bequest and devise, and also upon the ground that, assuming there was a simple misnomer, and that Georgetown College was meant instead of Georgetown University, yet, even upon that assumption, Georgetown College was incapable of taking the devise and bequest, because it was under the supervision and control of the Order of Jesuits, and that the college was therefore a sectarian institution. It was also averred that the bequest of $10,000 to Georgetown University in the District of Columbia, to be used and held as an endowment for the prosecution of research in the colonial history of Maryland and the territory now embraced in the District of Columbia, 'was void, upon the same ground, and also because there was no charter power or authority in Georgetown College (assuming that institution to be meant) to receive the bequest.' Also that the bequest of a sum not to exceed the amount of $5, 000, to be applied and expended under the personal supervision of the trustees, for the purchase and erection of a chime of bells, etc., was void as was also the alternative bequest of an amount not to exceed that sum for \n\n[200 U.S. 130, 136]\n\u00a0\n the benefit of the two Catholic orphan asylums in the city of Washington, the alternative bequest being void on the ground that those asylums were under the charge and control of persons belonging to religious orders, and therefore incapable of taking the bequest, and on the further ground that the amount of the bequest was uncertain. The bill averred also that the remaining bequest of a sum not to exceed $3,000, and also the bequest of $ 5,000, for the purpose of maintaining and founding scholarships, etc., were void, because of their uncertainty and the want of clearly defined conditions under which the funds should be applied. The defendants answered the bill and none of them conceded the validity of the claims made therein. Colbert, one of the substituted trustees, and also John D. Whitney and others, for and on behalf of the president and directors of Georgetown College, and also the trustees of St. Joseph's Male Orphan Asylum and of St. Vincent's Orphan Asylum, all claimed the validity of the bequests contained in the will, while the answer of Mosher, the other substituted trusttee, simply expressed his willingness that the provisions of the will of the testator should be given effect and carried out only so far as they were legal and valid.\n On the trial proof was taken in regard to the name and corporate status of Georgetown College, claiming the devises and bequests made to and on behalf of Georgetown University.\n The supreme court, in an elaborate opinion (reported in 31 Wash. L. Rep. 630, 646), held that the devises and bequests to trustees named in the will, of the testator's estate, exclusive of that which came to him under the will of his father, were valid and effectual. The court also held that all the clauses and subclauses in the will of the testator, disposing of property acquired by the testator under his father's will, were void, and that the property therein spoken of became part of the residuum of the estate of the testator, and vested in the beneficiaries entitled to take under the residuary clause of the will. The court of appeals, upon review \n\n[200 U.S. 130, 137]\n\u00a0\n of this judgment, held that the clauses of the will were valid, except the bequest of 'a sum not to exceed five thousand dollars,' to be expended under the personal supervision of the trustees in the purchase and erection of a chime of bells, and the erection of an altar or memorial window, etc.; but the alternative bequest of the sum not to exceed $5,000, to be equally divided between St. Vincent and St. Joseph's Orphan Asylums in the city of Washington, was good. It also held that the clause in the will, providing for the application of $5,000 to form a fund to be known as the E. Carroll Morgan fund or scholarship, to be applied as 'I [the testator] may hereafter verbally indicate to my trusttees or if I fail, as my trustees with the advice of proper persons may decide, to the maintenance of a scientific department, or the foundation and the application of the income to a scholarship in the classical department in the University of Georgetown in the District of Columbia,' was void. No appeal has been taken from this last portion of the judgment of the court of appeals.\n\n\n Messrs. Joseph R. Lamar, Conway Robinson, and Marion Erwin for appellants.\n\n\n[200 U.S. 130, 140]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George E. Hamilton and M. J. Colbert for appellees.\n\n\nMr. Justice Peckham, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The opinion of the court of appeals in this case, delivered by Chief Justice Alvey (24 App. D. C. 187), is entirely satisfactory to us, and leaves little to be said in addition. For \n\n[200 U.S. 130, 141]\n\u00a0\n the purpose, however, of simply stating the opinion of this court upon the various questions, without discussing them at length, we add what follows.\n The appellants insist that the gift of the property to the Georgetown University is void, as having been made to a sectarian institution less than one calendar month prior to the testator's death, and that such disposition was therefore in violation of  457 of the Revised Statutes of the District of Columbia. That section makes valid and effectual all sales, gifts, and devises prohibited by the 34th section of the Declaration of Rights of the state of Maryland, adopted in 1776, 'provided, that in case of gifts and devises, the same shall be made at least one calendar month before the death of the donor or testator.' 14 Stat. at L. 232, chap. 237; passed July 25, 1866. The 34th section of the Maryland Bill of Rights makes void:\n'Every gift, sale, or devise of lands to any minister, public teacher, or preacher of the Gospel as such, or to any religious sect, order, or denomination, or to or for the support, use, or benefit of or in trust for any minister, public teacher, or preacher of the Gospel as such, or any religious sect, order, or denomination; every gift or sale of goods or chattels to go in succession or take place after the death of the seller or donor, to or for such support, use, or benefit, and also every devise of goods or chattels to or for support, use, or benefit of any minister, public teacher, or preacher of the Gospel as such, or any religious sect, order, or denomination, without leave of the legislature.'\n\n It is also insisted that there is a misnomer of the corporation, now claiming the right to the corporation, now claiming the poration was incorporated under the name of 'The President and Directors of Georgetown College,' while the bequest is to 'Georgetown University, in the District of Columbia.' It is contended that Georgetown College is a corporation, incorporated on the 10th of June, 1844, under an act of Congress (6 Stat. at L. 912, chap. 41), entitled 'An Act to Incorporate George- \n\n[200 U.S. 130, 142]\n\u00a0\n town College, in the District of Columbia,' and that there was and is another institution in Georgetown, sometimes called the University of Georgetown, or Georgetown University, which was distinct from the college incorporated under the above-mentioned act of Congress, and not covered by it, and that the testator knew of this so-called university, that he was a professor therein, and that such university was, at the time of the testator's death, a sectarian institution within the 34th section of the Maryland Bill of Rights above mentioned. The 4th section of the above act expressly provides that no misnomer of the corporation shall defeat or annul any donation, etc., to the corporation. We agree with the supreme court and the court of appeals of the District of Columbia in the opinion that there was not, at the time of the execution of his will by the testator, or at the time of his death, any incorporated institution existing as Georgetown University or University of Georgetown, separate and apart from, or having powers other than, those granted to 'The President and Directors of Georgetown College,' by the act of Congress of 1844, above cited. It appears in the evidence that this college was frequently spoken of as Georgetown University, and known as such, but the evidence entirely fails to show that there were two incorporated institutions, the one, 'Georgetown University,' and the other, 'The President and Directors of Georgetown College.' And we have no doubt that the testator meant the corporation called Georgetown College when he used in his will the word 'university.' He meant to give the property to a corporation, and to one that could take it, and the evidence shows there was no other corporation of that kind. Upon this question the court of appeals said: 'It is expressly alleged in the bill as a fact that there is no such incorporated institution as Georgetown University, though Georgetown College is frequently referred to and spoken of as Georgetown University, notwithstanding it has never been incorporated as such. It is simply a popular designation applied to the college. It is alleged in the bill \n\n[200 U.S. 130, 143]\n\u00a0\n that the defendants Whitney and others, under the name of The President and Directors of Georgetown College, in this District, claim to be the beneficiaries entitled to the legacies mentioned in the will of the testator as for Georgetown University. It is not attempted to be shown that there was, or is, in existence, in this District, any such incorporated institution of learing as 'Georgetown University,' separate from and independent of Georgetowh College.' It was not to any unincorporated so-called institution that the testator intended to leave the property, but to one that was incorporated and capable of taking a legacy.\n Various acts of the legislature of Maryland were referred to on the argument, particularly the act of 1792, chapter 55; that of 1797, chapter 40; the act of 1805, chapter 118; that of 1808, chapter 37; also the act of Congress of March 1, 1815, chapter 70 (6 Stat. at L. 152), entitled 'An Act Concerning the College of Georgetown in the District of Columbia;' also that of March 2, 1833 (6 Stat. at L. 538, chap. 86), in which the government grants certain lots in Washington city to the dollege above referred to. These various statutes were cited for the purpose of showing the validity of the claim that an institution called Georgetown Uninversity, as distincy from Georgetown College, was meant in the will of the testator. In regard to these particular acts we think they do not bear upon the case other than, as remarked by the court of appeals, to show the origin and growth of Georgetown College, and to identify the early foundation of the school with the president and directors of Georgetown College, as that institution was fully and completely incorporated by the above-cited act of Congress of June 10, 1844. That act must be resorted to as the measure of the powers and duties, as well as to define the character, of the corporation created thereby. Bradfield v. Roberts, \n175 U.S. 291\n, 44 L. ed. 168, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 121.\n Taking the character of the college from the act of Congress, we are of opinion that it is not a sectarian institution or within  34 of the Maryland Bill of Rights. The reasoning upon \n\n[200 U.S. 130, 144]\n\u00a0\n this subject (as well as that upon the alleged misnomer of the college) set forth in the opinion of the supreme court (31 Wash. L. Rep. 630) and in that of the court of appeals is entirely satisfactory, and we concur therein.\n There is, in our judgment, no merit in the contention that the persons claiming as president and directors of the college are not the legal successors of the original incorporation. There is no evidence that the same has been dissolved. The franchise of a corporation is not taken away or surrendered, nor is the corporation dissolved, by the mere failure to elect trustees. We do not think that in this case there was any failure to elect, nor was there any dissolution.\n We now come to the consideration of the validity of the disposition made of the testator's property which came to him from the will of his father. The testator gives and bequeaths all of that property to his trustees, thereafter named, in the will, and their heirs and assigns forever, 'with full power to sell, convey, mortgage, encumber, and reinvest, in trust nevertheless to pay and see to the application of: First, the sum of ($10,000) ten thousand dollars to Georgetown University in the District of Columbia, to be used and held as an endowment for the prosecution of research in the colonial history of Maryland and the territory now embraced in the District of Columbia, and obtaining and preserving archives and papers having relation thereto, and known, as the James Ethelbert Morgan fund.'\n Aside from the objections to the bequest to Georgetown University already considered, a further objection is made, and the disposition is alleged to be void, because there is no charter power in any institution which could take under this bequest that authorizes it to prosecute such research, and obtain and preserve the archives relating thereto. It is well said, in the opinion of the court of appeals in this case, that the act of incorporation of Georgetown College, in 1844, confers 'corporate power upon the institution for the instruction of youth in the liberal arts and sciences, and also clothes the corporation \n\n[200 U.S. 130, 145]\n\u00a0\n with power to take any estate whatsoever, in any lands, etc., or goods, chattels, moneys, and other effects, by gift, bequest, devise, etc., and the same to grant convey or assign, and to place out on interest for the use of said college, and to apply the same [thereto]. The cultivation of historical research would seem to be a part of a liberal education, such as should be encouraged by a college intended to confer degrees upon students in acquiring a liberal education in the arts and sciences.' In Jones v. Habersham, \n107 U.S. 189\n, 27 L. ed. 407, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 336, it is said that 'a corporation may hold and execute a trust for charitable objects in accord with or tending to promote the purposes of its creation, although such as it might not, by its charter or by general laws, have authority itself to establish or to spend its corporate funds for. A city, for instance, may take a devise in trust to maintain a college, an orphan school, or an asylum.'\n Although it is, under the will, the duty of the trustees therein named to exercise supervision over the administration of the fund, nevertheless, the death or resignation of the trustees, named in the will cannot, and does not, defeat the bequest. There is not such a personal trust as renders it necessary to have the personal action of the trustee named in the will, and the trust does not fail upon the death or resignation of the named trustee. The court may appoint his successor. Inglis v. Sailors' Snug Harbor, 3 Pet. 99, 7 L. ed. 617.\n Both courts below have held the bequest of a sum not to exceed $5,000, to be expended under the personal supervision of the trustees in the purchase and erection of a chime of bells, etc., to be void. We agree with those courts in that respect. We also agree with the views of the court of appeals, holding that the alternative bequest of this same sum, not to exceed $5,000, to be divided equally between the two orphan asylums, is valid. There in no material misnomer in either case, althouth they are incorporated institutions, one by the name of St. Vincent's Orphan Asylum and the other as St. Joseph's Male Orphan Asylum in the city of Washington, and they are referred to in \n\n[200 U.S. 130, 146]\n\u00a0\n the will simply as St. Vincent's Orphan Asylum and St. Joseph's Catholic Orphan Asylum.\n Nor does the bequest violate the 34th section of the Maryland Bill of Rights, already referred to. The same reasoning on that point governs this bequest as is applicable to the bequest to the University of Georgetown. Neither of these orphan asylums is a sectarian institution under the acts of incorporation. The other objection made is that the clause directs that a sum, not exceeding $5,000, shall be equally divided between these orphan asylums; and it is said that there is such uncertainty in the amount of the bequest as to render it impossible to execute it, that it might be fulfilled by dividing a dollar between the asylums, or any other sum within the $5,000 named in the bequest. But it seems to us that the intention of the testator is clear to give the full sum of, but not to exceed, $5,000. That is, he gives $5,000 to be equally divided between these two asylums. While the amount is not to exceed $5,000, the direction for an equal division, taken in connection with the other facts, renders it, in our opinion, clear that the intention of the testator was that that sum should be the amount of the bequest. Courts are always reluctant to hold a bequest void for uncertainty, and they only do it when actually compelled to do so by the language used. Inglis v. Sailor's Snug Harbor, 3 Pet. 99, 7 L. ed. 617. If the testator had really intended that any less sum than $5,000 should be disposed of by and equally divided under this clause in his will, he would have said so.\n Objection is also made to the bequest of 'a sufficient sum, not to exceed three thousand ($3,000) dollars, the income to be applied to maintain a scholarship in the study of medicine, preferably in Georgetown University; otherwise in some medical college in the District, to be known as the E. Carroll Morgan scholarship.' The first objection, as to the uncertainty of the amount of the bequest, we do not regard as meritorious. \n\n[200 U.S. 130, 147]\n\u00a0\n It is a sum sufficient to found a scholarship, and it shall not exceed, in any event, $3,000. If one can be founded, within the conditions named in the will, for a less sum than $3,000, then that less sum only can be used. The discretion to be exercised by the trustee in selecting the college with which to connect the scholarship does not render the bequest void. The testator has, by this clause in his will, himself expressed his preference for Georgetown College, if the scholarship can be maintained in that institution, but if not, it is to be a scholarship in some medical college of the District. This, we think, is not an improper or uncertain disposition of the bequest, or an illegal placing of a discretion in the trustee under the will. See Atty. Gen. v. Gleg, 1 Atk. 356; Atty. Gen. v. Fletcher, 5 L. J. Ch. N. S. 75, 2 Perry, Tr. 4th ed.  721.\n The last bequest objected to is that of $5,000, to form a fund known as the E. Carroll Morgan fund or scholarship, to be applied as the testator might thereafter indicate to his trustees, etc. This has been declared void by both courts, and no appeal has been taken from the judgment of the court of appeals, adjudging that item to be void. That bequest being adjudicated invalid, the fund provided for therein forms part of the residue of the testator's estate, and passes under the residuary clause of the will.\n These views call for an affirmance of the judgment of the court of appeals, with costs to the several parties, to be paid out of the residuary fund, as provided for by the judgment of that court.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","144":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nST JOHN v.

In February, 1903, \n\n[201 U.S. 633, 634]\n\u00a0\n he exposed for sale and sold a quantity of milk in violation of  20 and 22 of chapter 338 of the laws of New York for the year 1893, and its amendments and supplements, in that the said milk contained more than 88 per cent of water and less than 12 per cent of milk solids, to wit, 89.24 per cent of water and 10.36 per cent of milk solids.\n The commissioner of agriculture of the state, in pursuance of said laws, filed a complaint against plaintiff in error in the supreme court of the state, charging him with the violation of the laws, and that it was his second offense. Judgment was prayed for the sum of $200, in pursuance of 37. Plaintiff in error admitted the charge, but alleged in defense that the laws were in contravention of  1 of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States; also of the Constitution of New York.\n At the trial he offered to show that the milk from which the sample exhibited in the case was taken was in the same condition when the sample was taken as it was when it left the herd of the producer. The testimony was rejected and plaintiff in error excepted. The court directed the jury to find a verdict against him for $100 and costs, which was done. He excepted to the ruling. Under the procedure in New York the court ordered the exceptions to be heard in the appellate division. In that court the exceptions were overruled, a motion for a new trial was denied, and judgment entered on the verdict. On appeal, the court of appeals affirmed the judgment, and the record and proceedings were remanded to the supreme court, where judgment was entered in accordance with the remittitur from the court of appeals. This writ of error was then sued out.\n The purpose of the law which is assailed is to prevent the sale of adulterated and unwholesome milk. Section 20 de-\n Sec. 20. Definitions. . . .\n The term 'adulterated milk,' when so used, means:\n\n 1. \nMilk containing more than 88 per centum of water or fluids. 2. Milk containing less than 12 per centum of milk solids. 3. Milk containing less than 3 per centum of fat. 4. Milk drawn from cows within fifteen days before and five days after parturition. 5. Milk drawn from animals fed on distillery waste or any substance in a state of fermentation or putrefaction, or any unhealthy food. 6. Milk drawn from cows kept in a crowed or unhealthy condition. 7. Milk from which any part of the cream has been removed. 8. Milk which has been diluted with water or any other fluid, or to which has been added or into which has been introduced any foreign substance whatever.\n All adulterated milk shall be deeemed unclean, unhealthy, impure, and unwholesome.\n Sec. 22. Prohibition of the sale of adulterated milk.-No person shall sell or exchange, or offer or expose for sale or exchange, any unclean, impure, unhealthy, adulterated, or unwholesome milk. . . . \n\n[201 U.S. 633, 635]\n\u00a0\n fines what milk shall be deemed adulterated, and it gives a very comprehensive meaning to the word. Section 22 prohibits the sale or offering for sale of such milk, or 'any unclean, impure, unhealthy, or unwholesome milk.' Section 7 makes intention immaterial. Section 37 provides for the forfeiture to the people of the state of New York of not less than $50 for the first violation of the law, and increased sums for second and subsequent violations, and also makes violations of the law misdemeanors. Section 12 is the one which is especially complained of. It was added to the original law in 1898, and is (omitting matter not necessary to quote) as follows:\n'Sec. 12. Inspection, how conducted. . . . In taking samples of milk for analysis at a creamery, factory, platform, or other place where the same is delivered by the producer for manufacture, sale, or shipment, or from a milk vender who produces the milk which he sells, with a view of prosecuting the producer of such milk for delivering, selling, or offering for sale adulterated milk, the said commissioner of agriculture or assistant or his agent or agents shall, within ten days thereafter, with the consent of the said producer, take a sample in a like manner of the mixed milk of the herd of cows from which the milk first sampled was drawn, and shall deliver the duplicate sample to the said producer, and shall cause the sample taken by himself or his agent to be analyzed. If the sample of \n\n[201 U.S. 633, 636]\n\u00a0\n milk last taken by the commissioner of agriculture or his agent or agents shall, upon analysis, prove to contain no higher percentage of milk solids or no higher percentage of fat than as the sample taken at the creamery, factory, platform, or other place, then no action shall lie against the said producer for violation of subdivisions 1, 2, 3, 7, and 8 of  20 of the agricultural law. In taking a second sample, as above set forth, from the mixed milk of the herd, it shall be the duty of the commissioner of agriculture to have an assistant, agent, or agents present during the entire time in which the said cattle are being milked, to observe closely so as to be sure that the milk thus to be sampled is not adulterated, and to see that it is thoroughly mixed, so that the sample taken shall be a fair sample of the average quality of the mixed milk of the entire dairy or herd of cows of said producer. If, however, the said producer refuses to allow such examination of the milk produced by his dairy, then he shall be precluded from offering any evidence whatever tending to show that the milk delivered by him at the said creamery, factory, platform, or other place was just as it came from the cow. If the said producer does permit such examination, the commissioner of agriculture shall, upon receiving application therefor, send to said producer a copy of the analysis of each of the samples of milk so taken and analyzed as above provided.' [N. Y. Laws, 1898, chap. 557,  1]\n\n The contention of plaintiff in error is that nonproducing venders are discriminated against, and hence denied the equal protection of the laws, contrary to the provisions of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, in that they may not, as producing venders may, exempt themselves from actions or penalties for violations of subdivisions 1, 2, 3, 7, and 8 of  20 by showing that the milk sold or offered for sale by them is in the same condition as when it left the herd of the producer.\n It has been decided many times that a state may classify persons and objects for the purpose of legislation. We will assume the cases are known and proceed immediately to con- \n\n[201 U.S. 633, 637]\n\u00a0\n sider whether the classification of the law is based on proper and justifiable distinctions, considering the purpose of the law and the means to be observed to effect that purpose.\n By referring to  20 it will be observed that adulterated milk, as there defined, includes not only that to which something has been added, but milk from which the cream has been removed, or which is deficient naturally in certain substances, or taken from cows fed on certain things, or cows in certain conditions when milked. In other words, the purpose of the law is to secure to the population, adult and infant, milk attaining a certain standard of purity and strength. All other milk is declared to be 'unclean, impure, unhealthy, adulterated, or unwholesome.'\n It is not contended that such purpose is not within the power of the state, but it is contended that the power is not exercised on all alike who sand in the same relation to the purpose, and quite dramatic illustrations are used to show discrimination. A picture is exhibited of producing and nonproducing venders selling milk side by side; the latter, it may be, a purchaser from the former; the act of one permitted, the act of the other prohibited or penalized. If we could look no farther than the mere act of selling, the injustice of the law might be demonstrated; but something more must be considered. Not only the final purpose of the law must be considered, but the means of its administration,-the ways it may be defeated. Legislation, to be practical and efficient, must regard this special purpose as well as the ultimate purpose. The ultimate purpose is that wholesome milk shall reach the consumer, and it is the conception of the law that milk below a certain strength is not wholesome, but a difference is made between milk naturally deficient and milk made so by dilution. It is not for us to say that this is not a proper difference, and regarding it the law fixed its standard by milk in the condition that it comes from the herd. It is certain that if milk starts pure from the producer it will reach the consumer pure, if not tampered with on the way. To prevent such tampering the law is framed and \n\n[201 U.S. 633, 638]\n\u00a0\n its penalties adjusted. As the standard established can be proved in the hands of a producing vender, he is exempt from the penalty; as it cannot certainly be proved in the hands of other venders so as to prevent evasions of the law, such venders are not exempt. In the one case the source of milk can be known and the tests of the statute applied; in the other case this would be impossible, except in few instances. We cannot see that any particular hardship results. The nonproducing vender must exercise care in his purchases, and good all around may be accomplished. Through penalty on the nonproducing vender the producer is ultimately reached, though he may seem to be indulged. He will have to raise the standard of the milk of his herd if he would keep or extend his trade as anything but a mere retailer of his product.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","145":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nST MARY'S FRANCO-AMERICAN PETROLEUM CO. v. STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA(1906)\nNo. 98\nArgued: Decided: December 3, 1906\n\n\n\n This is a writ of error to review a judgment of the supreme court of appeals of West Virginia awarding a peremptory writ of mandamus, commanding the St. Mary's Franco-American Petroleum Company, by power of attorney, duly executed, acknowledged, and filed in the office of the auditor for the state of West Virginia, 'to appoint said auditor and his successors in office, attorney in fact to accept service of process and notice in this state for said St. Mary's Franco-American Petroleum* \n\n[203 U.S. 183, 184]\n\u00a0\n Company, and by the same instrument to declare its consent that service of any process or notice in this state on said attorney in fact, or his acceptance thereof indorsed thereon, shall be equivalent for all purposes to, and shall be and constitute, due and legal service upon the said St. Mary's Franco-American Petroleum Company, and that the petitioner recover from the respondent her costs about the prosecution of her petition in this court in this behalf expended.'\n It was agreed by the parties that no rule to show cause need be issued on the petition for mandamus, nor any alternative writ, but that the petition might stand as such writ, and the case be determined on demurrer thereto, which was filed.\n The petition, among other things, averred that the St. Mary's Company was 'a nonresident domestic corporation, organized, chartered, existing, and carrying on its corporate business under and by virtue of the laws of the state of West Virginia, but having its principle office and place of business and chief works in the city of Lima, in the state of Ohio;' that the corporation 'was organized, and now exists by virtue of a charter issued to it by the secretary of state of the state of West Virginia on the 18th day of January, 1902;' and that 'on the 17th day of February, 1902, the said defendant corporation, by power of attorney, duly and legally executed, filed, and recorded, appointed one Wm. M. O. Dawson, a resident of the county of Kanawha in the state of West Virginia, to accept service on behalf of said corporation, and as a person upon whom service may be had of any process or notice, and to make returns of its property for taxation.'\n At the time the company was incorporated  8 of chapter 53 of the state Code read:\n'Where the legislature has the right to alter or repeal the charter or certificate of incorporation heretofore granted to any joint stock company, or to alter or repeal any law relating to such company, nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to surrender or impair such right. And the right is hereby reserved to the legislature to alter any charter or \n\n[203 U.S. 183, 185]\n\u00a0\n certificate of incorporation hereafter granted to a joint stock company, and to alter or repeal any law applicable to such company. But in no case shall such alteration or repeal affect the right of the creditors of the company to have its assets applied to the discharge of its liabilities, or of its stockholders to have the surplus, if any, which may remain after discharging its liabilities and the expenses of winding up its affairs, distributed among themselves in proportion to their respective interests.'\n\n And  24 of chapter 54:\n'Every such corporation having its principal office or place of business in this state shall, within thirty days after organization, by power of attorney duly executed, appoint some person residing in the county in this state wherein its business is conducted, to accept service on behalf of said corporation, and upon whom service may be had of any process or notice, and to make such return for and on behalf of said corporation to the assessor of the county or district wherein its business is carried on, as is required by the 41st section of the 29th chapter of the Code. Every such corporation having its principal office or place of business outside this state shall, within thirty days after organizing, by power of attorney duly executed, appoint some person residing in this state to accept service on behalf of said corporation, and upon whom service may be had of any process or notice, and to make return of its property in this state for taxation as aforesaid. The said power of attorney shall be recorded in the office of the clerk of the county court of the county in which the attorney resides, and filed and recorded in the office of the secretary of state, and the admission to record of such power of attorney shall be deemed evidence of compliance with the requirements of this section. Corporations heretofore organized may comply with said requirements at any time within three months after the passage of this act. Any corporation failing to comply with said requirements within six months after the passage of this act shall forfeit not less than two hundred nor more \n\n[203 U.S. 183, 186]\n\u00a0\n than five hundred dollars, and shall, moreover, during the continuance of such failure, be deemed a nonresident of this state, and its property, real and personal, shall be liable to attachment in like manner as the property of nonresident defendants; any corporation failing so to comply within twelve months after the passage of this act shall, by reason of such failure, forfeit its charter to the state, and the provisions of  8, chapter 20, Acts 1885, relative to notice and publication, shall apply thereto.'\n\n On the 22d day of February, 1905, the legislature of West Virginia passed an act-chapter 39 of the Acts of 1905-which is as follows:\n'Sec. 1. The auditor of this state shall be, and he is hereby constituted, the attorney in fact for and on behalf of every foreign corporation doing business in this state, and of every nonresident domestic corporation. Every such corporation shall, by power of attorney, duly executed, acknowledged, and filed in the auditor's office of this state, appoint said auditor and his successors in office, attorney in fact to accept service of process and notice in this state for such corporations, and by the same instrument it shall declare its consent that service of any process or notice in this state on said attorney in fact, or his acceptance thereof indorsed thereon, shall be equivalent for all purposes to, and shall be and constitute, due and legal service upon said corporation.\n\n'Sec. 2. Such foreign or nonresident domestic corporation shall, at the time of taking out its charter, or procuring its authority to do business in this state, as the case may be, pay to the auditor as its said attorney $10 for his services as such for the then current year ending on the 30th day of April next ensuing; and on or before the 1st day of May, for each year, such corporation shall pay to said auditor the like sum of $ 10 for his services as such attorney. And all such corporations as have heretofore taken out charters, or procured authority to do business in this state, shall, for the fiscal year \n\n[203 U.S. 183, 187]\n\u00a0\n commencing on the 1st day of May, 1905, pay the sum of $10 to the auditor as the fee for such attorney to receive service of process, and annually thereafter a like sum, and such corporation shall not be required to pay any fee to the person who may have been heretofore appointed its attorney to receive service of process. All moneys received by the auditor under this chapter shall belong to the state, and be by him immediately paid into the state treasury. The auditor shall keep in a well bound book in his office a true and accurate account of all moneys so received and paid over to him.\n\n'Sec. 3. The postoffice address of such corporation shall be filed with the power of attorney, and there shall be filed with the auditor, from time to time, statements of any changes of address of said corporation. Immediately after being served with, or accepting, any such process or notice, the auditor shall make and file with said power of attorney a copy of such process or notice, with a note thereon indorsed of the time of service or acceptance, as the case may be, and transmit such process or notice by registered mail to such corporation at the address last furnished as aforesaid. But no such process or notice shall be served on the auditor or accepted by him less than ten days before the return thereof.\n\n'Sec. 4. In addition to the auditor, any such company may designate any other person in this state as its attorney in fact, upon whom service of process or notice may be made or who may accept such service. And, when such local attorney is appointed, process in any suit or proceeding may be served on him to the same effect as if the same were served on the auditor.\n\n'Sec. 5. Failure to pay the attorney's fee as hereinbefore required shall have all the force and effect, and subject such corporation to the same penalties and forfeitures, as are or may be prescribed by law for failure to pay the license tax required to be paid by such corporation.\n\n'Sec. 6. Any corporation failing to comply with the pro- \n\n[203 U.S. 183, 188]\n\u00a0\n visions of this act in so far as it relates to the appointment of the auditor as its statutory attorney, within ninety days from its incorporation, shall forfeit $100 as a penalty for such failure, and upon failure to pay such penalty, the charter of such corporation shall thereby be forfeited and void.'\n\n The company refused to comply with the act, and, thereupon, this proceeding was instituted.\n Messrs. W. E. Chilton and Chilton, MaeCorkle, & Chilton for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[203 U.S. 183, 190]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Clarke W. May for defendant in error. \n\n[203 U.S. 183, 191]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n It is argued that the act of February 22, 1905, is invalid under the 14th Amendment, in that it deprives the company of liberty of contract and property without due process of law, and denies it the equal protection of the laws. But, in view of repeated decisions of this court, the contention is without merit. The state had the clear right to regulate its own creations, and a fortiori, foreign corporations permitted to transact business within its borders.\n In this instance it put all nonresident demestic corporations, which elected to have their places of business and works outside of the state, and all foreign corporations coming into the state, on the same footing in respect of the service of process, and the law operated on all these alike.\n Such a classification was reasonable, and not open to constitutional objection.

Rep. 126; Brannon, 14th Amendment, chap. 16.\n It is true that the prior law left it to the corporation to appoint an attorney to represent it, and that the act of February, 1905, changed this so as to make the auditor such attorney, but this, at the most, was no more than an amendment as to the appointment of an agent, and when the St. Mary's Company accepted its charter it did so subject to the right of amendment. And we agree with the state court that the \n\n[203 U.S. 183, 192]\n\u00a0\n requirement of the payment of $10 to the auditor for the use of the state does not amount to a taking of property without due process, or an unjust discrimination.

Rep. 880. If the act is valid, that is.\n The objections going to the expediency or the hardships and injustice of the act, and its alleged inconsistency with the state Constitution and laws, are matters with which we have nothing to do on this writ of error, and the question whether the provision that the corporation shall not be required to pay any fee to anyone theretofore appointed an attorney is invalid or not requires no consideration on this record.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","146":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nST. LOUIS DRESSED BEEF & PROVISION CO. v. MARYLAND CASUALTY CO.(1906)\nNo. 197\nArgued: March 7, 1906Decided: March 19, 1906\n\n\n\n This case was brought here on the following certificate:\n'The judgment which the writ of error challenges sustained a demurrer to the petition and dismissed the action. The plaintiff in its petition alleged the existence of these facts: The plaintiff is a corporation of the state of Missouri, and the defendant is a corporation of the state of Maryland. On June 16, 1900, the defendant, in consideration of the payment of $168, issued to the plaintiff a policy which contained these provisions: 'In consideration of the application for this policy, a copy of which is hereto attached and which is made part \n\n[201 U.S. 173, 174]\n\u00a0\n of this contract, and of one hundred sixty-eight dollars ($168) premium, Maryland Casualty Company, of Baltimore, Maryland (hereinafter called 'the company'), does hereby agree to indemnify St. Louis Dressed Beef & Provision Company of St. Louis, county of _____, state of Missouri, hereinafter called 'the assured,' for the term of one year, beginning on the 5th day of July, 1900, at noon, and ending on the 5th day of July, 1901, at noon, standard time, at the place where this policy has been countersigned, against loss from common-law or statutory liability for damages on account of bodily injuries, fatal or nonfatal, accidentally suffered by any person or persons, and caused through the negligence of the assured, by means of the horses or vehicles in his services, and the use thereof, as described in the application, and while in the charge of the assured or his employees. Provided, however, that:\n\n\"A. The company's liability for an accident resulting in injuries to, or in the death of, one person, is limited to five thousand dollars ($5, 000) and subject to the same limit for each person; the total liability for any one accident resulting in injuries to, or in the death of, any number of persons is limited to ten thousand dollars ($10,000).\n\n\"This insurance is subject to the following conditions, which are to be construed as conditions precedent of this contract:\n\n\"1. The assured, upon the occurrence of an accident, shall give immediate notice thereof in writing, with full particulars, to the home office of any claim which may be made on account of such accident.\n\n\"2. If thereafter any suit is brought against the assured to enforce a claim for damages on account of an accident covered by this policy, immediate notice thereof shall be given to the company, and the company will defend against such proceeding, in the name and on behalf of the assured, or settle the same at its own cost, unless it shall elect to pay the assured the indemnity provided for in clause 'A' of special agreements, as limited therein. \n\n[201 U.S. 173, 175]\n\u00a0\n\n\"3. The assured shall not settle any claim, except at his own cost, nor incur any expense, nor interfere in any negotiation for settlement or in any legal proceeding, without the consent of the company, previously given in writing, but he may provide at the time of the accident such immediate surgical relief as is imperative. The assured, when requested by the company, shall aid in securing information and evidence, and in effecting settlements, and in case the company calls for the attendance of any employee or employees as witnesses at inquests and in suits, the assured will secure his or their attendance, making no charge for his or their loss of time.'\n\n\n\"8. No action shall lie against the company as respects any loss under this policy unless it shall be brought by the assured himself to reimburse him for loss actually sustained and paid by him in satisfaction of a judgment after trial of the issue. No such action shall lie unless brought within the period within which a claimant might sue the assured for damages unless, at the expiry of such period, there is such an action pending against the assured, in which case an action may be brought against the company by the assured within thirty days after final judgment has been rendered and satisfied as above. In no case except that of minors shall any action lie against the company after the expiration of six years from the date of the given injuries or death. The company does not prejudice by this clause any defenses to such action which it may be entitled to make under this policy.\n\n\"This policy shall only cover losses sustained by and liability for any claims against the assured as a result of the risk specified in the contract or contracts hereto attached, and is issued and accepted upon the condition that all the provisions printed on the slip or slips attached to this policy are accepted and shall be fulfilled by the assured as part of this contract as fully as if they were recited at length over the signatures hereto affixed.'\n\n\"The portion of the policy hereinbefore quoted, commencing with the words 'against loss from common-law or statutory \n\n[201 U.S. 173, 176]\n\u00a0\n liability' and ending with the words 'entitled to make under this policy,' at the close of paragraph numbered 8, were printed on the slip attached to the policy.\n\n'On May 25, 1901, the plaintiff became liable for damages on account of bodily injuries accidentally suffered by Mrs. Nellie Heideman, and caused through the negligence of the plaintiff by means of a horse and vehicle in its service and the use thereof, as described in the application for the policy, and while in charge of one John Berry, who was one of the plaintiff's employees. The plaintiff immediately gave the defendant notice of the accident and of the fact that Nellie Heideman made a claim against the plaintiff for damages on account of the bodily injuries she had suffered from the accident, and that Henry Heideman, her husband, also made a claim for damages against it on account of the loss of the services of ihs wife and of the expenses of physicians and nurses which resulted to him from her bodily injuries. On August 16, 1901, the defendant notified the plaintiff that it denied that it was liable to it on account of the damages resulting from the accident under its policy because, as it alleged, the driver of the plaintiff's wagon was not an employee of the plaintiff, but the fact was that this driver was an employee of the plaintiff, and the accident and the damages were covered by the policy. On November 23, 1901, Nellie Heideman sued the plaintiff for $10,000 damages on account of the bodily injuries to her caused by the negligence of the plaintiff's driver and by the accident, and Henry Heideman brought an action against it for $3,000 damages, which he alleged he sustained from the same cause. On November 29, 1901, the plaintiff in writing notified the defendant of the commencement of these suits, and requested it to undertake the defense of said suits as its said policy provides it would do. But the defendant declined to undertake the defense, upon the alleged ground that its policy did not cover the accident or the claims, while the fact was that it covered both. The injuries to Mrs. Heideman were, among thers, the breaking of her right hipjoint socket bone, were serious and permanent, and \n\n[201 U.S. 173, 177]\n\u00a0\n the plaintiff was liable for damages in each of the suits. It feared heavy judgments if the actions were permitted to proceed to trial. Thereupon, on April 15, 1902, it compromised the suits, and paid Mrs. Heideman $2,000 damages and her husband $500 damages on account of the injuries caused by the accident and the negligence of its driver.\n\n'The petition also contained the following averments: 'The plaintiff served on defendant a written notice, notifying it of the terms of settlement offered by said Nellie Heideman and Henry Heideman for the injuries sustained and damages suffered by them respectively, as aforesaid, and that plaintiff proposed to accept said settlements and pay said amounts, and to hold defendant responsible for such payment under its aforesaid policy; that defendant interposed no objection to said proposed settlements, relying upon its said disclaimer of any liability under said policy by reason of its alleged claim that the driver of said wagon was not in the employ of the plaintiff herein; and that said defendant, by reason of the said denial and disclaimer of any liability, waived all the conditions of the said policy as herein set forth. Plaintiff further states that by reason of defendant's failure and refusal to defend said actions brought by Nellie Heideman and Henry Heideman against plaintiff, and by reason of the waiver aforesaid, it was obliged to and did defend said actions and employed counsel for that purpose, at an expense of two hundred and fifty dollars ($250.00), and that said employment of counsel was reasonably necessary, and that said sum of $250.00 is the reasonable value of said services so performed.'\n\n'And the circuit court of appeals for the eighth circuit further certifies that the following questions of law are presented by the assignment of errors in this case, that their decision is indispensable to a decision of this case, and that to the end that this court may properly decide the issues of law presented it desires the instruction of the Supreme Court of the United States upon the following questions:\n\n'1. Did the denial of all liability by the assurer and its refusal \n\n[201 U.S. 173, 178]\n\u00a0\n to defend the suits in the name and on behalf of the assured, as provided by paragraph 2 of the policy, constitute such a breach of the contract on its part that it released the assured from its agreement in paragraph 3, that it would not settle any claim except at its own cost without the consent of the assurer, previously given in writing, and from the provision of paragraph 8, that no action should lie against the assurer as respects any loss unless for loss actually sustained and paid by the assured in satisfaction of a judgment after trial of the issue?\n\n'2. Where the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 8 of the policy, that the assured should not settle any claim except at its own cost, without the consent of the assurer, previously given in writing, and that no action should lie against the assurer as respects any loss under the policy unless brought by the assured to reimburse it for loss actually sustained and paid by it in satisfaction of a judgment after trial of the issue, waived by the assurer's denial of liability under the policy, and by its failure and refusal to defend the suits against the assured, according to the provision in paragraph 2?\n\n'3. Did the compromise by the assured of the suits against it after the assurer denied liability and refused to defend them, and the payment by the assured of the damages claimed of it pursuant to the compromise, without the consent of the assurer and without the rendition of a judgment or a trial of the issues, prevent the assured from securing any recovery of the assurer upon the policy on account of the negligence, accident, and injuries described?\n\n'4. Considering the terms of the policy, is the right of the assurer to insist upon the condition of paragraph 8 respecting the rendition of judgment after trial and its satisfaction by the assured dependent upon the assurer's defense of the action against the assured, according to the provision in paragraph 2?\n\n'5. Considering the terms of the policy, is the assurer's denial of liability under the policy a waiver of the condition in paragraph 8 respecting the rendition of judgment after trial and its satisfaction by the assured? \n\n[201 U.S. 173, 179]\n\u00a0\n 6. Under the terms of the policy, may the liability of the assured to the injured person and the extent of that liability be litigated in the first instance in an action between the assured and the assurer, where the assurer has denied its liability under the policy, and has refused to defend an action brought against the assured by the injured person?'\n\n Messrs. Ford W. Thompson, William B. Thompson, and Ralph Crews for the St. Louis Dressed Beef & Provision Company. \n\n[201 U.S. 173, 180]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George Weems Williams and Frank Gosnell for the Maryland Casualty Company.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Holmes:\n An elementary remark or two will do something toward answering these questions. The form of the declaration does not appear, but we may suppose a count upon the casualty company's refusal to defend the suit against the plaintiff. If the defendant's contention is right, that breach made it impossible for the plaintiff to entitle itself to the payment promised in the policy according to its terms. But the defendant could not set \n\n[201 U.S. 173, 181]\n\u00a0\n itself free by so simple a device. In general, when one party, by his fault, prevents the other party to a contract from entitling himself to a benefit under it according to its terms, the former is liable for the value of that benefit, less the value or cost of what the plaintiff would have had to do to get it. In this case the plaintiff had nothing more to do or to pay after it had been compelled to satisfy the claim against it. And therefore on general principles, it would be entitled to demand the whole amount which the jury might find that it would have received had the contract been performed. Hinckley v. Pittsburgh Bessemer Steel Co. \n121 U.S. 264\n, 30 L. ed. 967, 7 Sup.Ct.Rep. 875.\n It is suggested, to be sure, that the plaintiff should have defended the suit against it. But not only was that not one of the plaintiff's undertakings, but it was expressly forbidden to the plaintiff by the contract, as no doubt the defendant would have pointed out had that course been taken. Moreover, the defendant, by its refusal, cut at the very root of the mutual obligation, and put an end to its right to demand further compliance with the supposed term of the contract on the other side. The only concern of the plaintiff was to establish reasonable ground for believing that if the defendant had not broken its contract it would have been called on to make a payment to the plaintiff, and how much that payment would have been.\n Looking at the substance of the matter, it makes no practical difference, no difference in the amount of the defendant's liability, whether we say that the defendant, by its conduct, made performance of the conditions by the plaintiff impossible, and therefore was chargeable for the sum which it would have had to pay if those conditions had been performed, or answer, in the language of the questions, that performance of the conditions was waived. The sole difference would be in the form of the declaration. In either case the plaintiff would declare upon the policy, only the breaches assigned would not be the same. In the former, the breach would be the refusal to defend; in the latter, the refusal to pay. If it is necessary to consider \n\n[201 U.S. 173, 182]\n\u00a0\n the question in a technical aspect, we think that the plaintiff was entitled to treat the contract as on foot, notwithstanding the defendant's act, and go on with it cy-pres. Under the circumstances it could not comply literally with the words, and was justified in doing the best thing that could be done for the interest of both. The defendant, by its abdication, put the plaintiff in its place, with all its rights. To limit its liability as if its only promise was to pay a loss paid upon a judgment is to neglect the meaning and purpose of the reference to a judgment, and even the words of the promise. The promise in form is to indemnify against loss by certain kinds of liability. The judgment contemplated in the condition is a judgment in a suit defended by the defendant in case it elects not to settle. The substance of the promise is to pay a loss which the plaintiff shall have been compelled to pay, after such precautions and with such safeguards as the defendant may insist upon. It saw fit to insist upon none.\n We assume that the settlement was reasonable, and that the plaintiff could not expect to escape at less cost by defending the suits. If this were otherwise, no doubt the defendant would profit by the fact. The defendant did not agree to repay a gratuity, or more than fairly could be said to have been paid upon compulsion. But a sum paid in the prudent settlement of a suit is paid under the compulsion of the suit as truly as if it were paid upon execution.\n But there is another aspect of the eighth condition of the slip which requires a few words more. It is said that this condition expressly contemplates a breach of contract by the company, and defines the plaintiff's rights in that case. The words 'no action shall lie against the company as respects any loss under this policy unless,' etc., certainly do contemplate a case in court in which the company may turn out to be in the wrong, and therefore technically guilty of a breach of contract. But notwithstanding the contrary suggestion in Sanders v. Frankfort Marine, Acci. & Plate Glass Ins. Co. 72 N. H. 485, 498, 499, 101 Am. St. Rep. 688, 57 Atl. 655, we think that the only breach which that condition has \n\n[201 U.S. 173, 183]\n\u00a0\n in view is a refusal by the company to pay after the decision in a case of which it has taken charge, when, notwithstanding the judgment, it conceives itself to have a defense. The action referred to is an action for money alleged to be due under the policy. Contracts rarely provide in detail for their nonperformance. It would be stretching the words quoted to a significance equally hurtful to both parties, and probably equally absent from the minds of both, to read them as having within their scope an initial repudiation of liability by the defendant, and a requirement that, in that event, the plaintiff should be bound to try the case against itself, although it should be plain that by a compromise it could reduce its claim on the defendant as well as its own loss.\n If there is anything in the doubt whether the defendant, by assuming the defense of the original suit, would not lose its right to deny that the policy applied, even if it purported to save that right, it does not change our opinion. The requirement of a trial and judgment would not accomplish the object suggested, to make collusion impossible. The objections to thus hampering the dominus litis have been touched upon, and there would be presented the anomaly, if not the monstrosity, of a party attempting to provide by contract that if he should do what, by general principles of contract, forfeited his right to make further requirements of the other side, his conduct, on the contrary, should impose new obligations on the other side. If the defendant kept its contract, it would defend the suit, and the plaintiff would have no duties. If it refused to do as it had promised, we cannot think that it was entitled to complain that the plaintiff did not do it, when the interest of both was the other way. Before a policy should be construed to have such an extraordinary effect honesty requires that the assured should be notified of his duties in unmistakable words.\n We answer the first, second, fourth, and fifth questions in the affirmative, the third in the negative, and the sixth in the affirmative, so far as the question is warranted by the facts set forth. It will be so certified. \n\n\n\n","147":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF IOWA v.

STATE OF MISSISSIPPI(1906)\nNo. 11\nArgued: Decided: March 5, 1906\n\n\n\n\n[202 U.S. 1, 2]\n\u00a0\n The state of Louisiana, by leave of court, filed her bill against the state of Mississippi, October 27, 1902, to obtain a decree determining a boundary line between the two states, and requiring the state of Mississippi to recognize and observe the line so determined.\n The bill alleged:\n'1st. That the state of Louisiana was admitted into the Union of the United States of America by the act of Congress found in chapter 50 of the United States Statutes at Large, vol. 2, page 701, approved April 8th, 1812, and therein the boundaries of the said state of Louisiana, in the preamble of said act, were described as follows:--\n\n'Whereas, the representatives of the people of all that part of the territory or country ceded under the name of 'Louisiana,' by the treaty made at Paris on the 30th day of April, 1803 [8 Stat. at L. 200], between the United States and France, contained within the following limits, that is to say: Beginning at the mouth of the \n\n[202 U.S. 1, 3]\n\u00a0\n river Sabine, thence by a line drawn along the middle of said river, including all islands to the 32d degree of latitude; thence due north to the northernmost part of the 33d degree of north latitude; thence along the said parallel of latitude to the River Mississippi; thence down the said river to the River Iberville, and from thence along the middle of said river and Lakes Maurepas and Pontchartrain to the Gulf of Mexico; thence bounded by the said gulf to the place of beginning, including all islands within three leagues of the coast,' etc.\n\n'2nd. That according to the foregoing description, the eastern boundary of the state of Louisiana was formed by the Mississippi river, beginning at the northeast corner of said state and extending south to the junction of the said river with the River Iberville (now known as Bayou Manchac), and thence extending eastwardly through the lower end of the Amite river, through the middle of Lake Maurepas, Pass Manchac, and Lake Pontchartrain, and in order to reach the Gulf of Mexico its only course was through the Rigolets, into Lake Borgne, and thence by the deep-water channel through the upper corner of Lake Borgne, following said channel, north of Half Moon island, through Mississippi sound to the north of Isle a Pitre, through the Cat Island channel, southwest of Cat island, into the Gulf of Mexico, which said eastern boundary of the state of Louisiana is more fully shown on diagram No. 1, made part of this bill. [See ante.]\n\n'3rd. That by the act of Congress found in the United States Statutes at Large, vol. 2, p. 708, chap. 57, approved April 14th, 1812, additional territory was added to the then-existing state of Louisiana which additional territory was described in the following language:--\n\n'Beginning at the junction of the Iberville with the River Mississippi; thence along the middle of the Iberville, the River Amite, and of the Lakes Maurepas and Pontchartrain to the eastern mouth of the Pearl river; thence up the eastern branch of Pearl river to the 31st degree of north latitude; thence along the said degree of latitude to the River Mississippi; thence \n\n[202 U.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n down the said river to the place of beginning, shall become and form a part of the said state of Louisiana.'\n\n'4th. That the effect of this legislation, as to the eastern boundary of the state of Louisiana, was to retain the Mississippi river as the original eastern boundary, as far south as the 31st degree of north latitude. The change then moved the eastern boundary eastward along the 31st degree of north latitude to the Pearl river, whence it then ran south down the said river, through its eastern branch, till it entered the northern corner of Lake Borgne, where the state's eastern boundary then joined and followed the boundary line originally fixed in the act of April 8th, 1812, and followed, as heretofore stated, \n\n[202 U.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n the deep-water channel through the upper corner of Lake Borgne, north of Half Moon island, eastward through the deep-water channel along the Mississippi sound till it reached the Cat Island channel north of Isle a Pitre, and southwest of Cat island, whence passing through Chandeleur sound, northeast of Chandeleur islands, it entered the Gulf of Mexico, and ran south around the delta of the Mississippi river and then north and westward to the point where the Sabine river enters the Gulf of Mexico, as will be more fully seen from the diagram No. 2, made part of this bill. [ See ante.]\n\n'5th. That the territory lying adjacent to, and to the eastward of, the state of Louisiana, is the state of Mississippi, which \n\n[202 U.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n latter state was admitted into the Union of the United States of America by the act of Congress found in the United States Statutes at Large, vol. 3, chap. 23, page 348, approved March 1st, 1817, whereby the inhabitants of the western part of the then Mississippi territory were authorized to form for themselves a state constitution and to be admitted into the Union, the boundaries of the then-to-be-created state being described as follows:--\n\n'Beginning on the River Mississippi at the point where the southern boundary line of the state of Tennessee strikes the same; thence east along the said boundary line to the Tennessee river; thence up the same to the mouth of Bear creek; thence by a direct line to the northwest corner of the county of Washington [Alabama]; thence due south to the Gulf of Mexico; thence westwardly, including all the islands within six leagues of the shore to the most eastern junction of Pearl river with Lake Borgne; thence up said river to the 31st degree of north latitude; thence west along the said degree of latitude to the Mississippi river; thence up the same to the beginning.'\n\n'6th. That by the said act, Congress intended that the southern boundary line of the state of Mississippi, beginning at the point dividing it from the state of Alabama, should run westwardly till it joined the Louisiana eastern boundary line, and that, in doing so, the said southern boundary would in effect start westward from a point 18 miles south of the coast line, and include in its westwardly direction the western end of Petit Bois island, all of Horn island, Ship island, and Cat island, and the smaller islands north of these, those islands being the ones contemplated in the act of Congress, as being within 18 miles of the southern coast line of Mississippi, and that the said southern boundary of Mississippi, extending in its westwardly direction through the Gulf of Mexico, would gradually approach the coast line, and meet the eastern boundary line of Louisiana, just as the said eastern boundary line of Louisiana emerges from the Cat Island channel into the Gulf of Mexico, and thence follow and become the same as the \n\n[202 U.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n Louisiana boundary line extending westwardly to the south of Cat island, through Mississippi sound to the north of Half Moon or Grand island to the most southern junction of the \n\n[202 U.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n east branch of the Pearl river with Lake Borgne, being identical with the Louisiana eastern boundary, and thence estending up the channel of Pearl river.\n\n'7th. That the islands included between the shore line and the southern boundary of the state of Mississippi are the islands heretofore described, viz.: the western end of Petit Bois island, with all of Horn island, Ship island, and Cat island, and the small islands north of them, those islands being large, and well known to Congress at the time of the passage of the act, all of which islands and the southern boundary of the state of Mississippi will more fully appear from the diagram No. 3, made a part of this bill. [See ante.]\n\n'8th. That the islands contemplated in the act of Congress of [April 8] 1812, creating the state of Louisiana, and intended to be embraced within the state of Louisiana, as provided by the clause, 'Thence bounded by the said gulf to the place of beginning, including all islands within three leagues of the coast,' were all of the other islands, except those heretofore named as going to the state of Mississippi, as all other islands, and all other mainland, are south and west of the boundary line thus passing from Pearl river through the deep-water channels in Lake Borgne and Mississippi sound, through the deep-water channel southwest of Cat island to the eastward of the Chandeleur islands, and thence south, taking in the delta of the Mississippi river, and extending westward along the Gulf coast, including all islands along the coast, to the Sabine river, where the state of Louisiana is thence bounded on the westward by the state of Texas, all of which will more fully appear from diagram No. 2, heretofore referred to.\n\n'9th. Now your orator avers that there has developed in recent years in the waters south of the state of Mississippi and east of the southern portion of the state of Louisiana a considerable growth of oysters, and an industry of large proportions, in the handling of said bivalves, either in their fresh or in a canned condition, has resulted therefrom.\n\n'10th. That the state of Mississippi has by legislative \n\n[202 U.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n enactments, regulated the oyster industry in the waters of said state, and permits the dredging of oysters on the natural oyster reefs in waters of the said state, as will more fully appear from the statutes of said state to which reference is made.\n\n'11th. That the state of Louisiana has, by legislative enactments, regulated the oyster industry in the said state of Louisiana, and prohibits the dredging of oysters on the natural reefs in the waters of said state, as will more fully appear from the statutes of said state to which reference is made.\n\n'12th. That the provisions of the laws of the said two states differ considerably in many other respects.\n\n'13th. That the existence and location of the natural oyster reefs in the waters of the parish of St. Bernard, in the state of Louisiana, which adjoins the state of Mississippi, is shown by the map made from a reconnaissance by the United States Fish Commission steamer 'Fish Hawk,' in February, 1898, as will more fully appear from diagram No. 4, now made part of this bill. [See ante.]\n\n'14th. Now your orator avers that the boundary line dividing the two states in the waters thereof has been clearly defined by the acts of Congress creating the states of Louisiana and Mississippi, as will be seen from the diagram No. 5, made up from the boundary descriptions taken from the acts of Congress creating the said states of Louisiana and Mississippi, which diagram is also made part of this bill. [See ante.]\n\n'15th. That the said boundary line in the waters between said states has never been designated by buoys or marks of any kind by either state, nor designated in any manner, except by the United States government in so far as it has buoyed the deep-water channel, extending from the mouth of the Pearl river through the upper corner of Lake Borgne, north of Half Moon island, eastward to the Cat Island pass, north of Isle a Pitre, and southwest of Cat island, which buoys were placed by the Coast Survey of the United States government.\n\n'16th. That owing to the differences in the laws of the states of Louisiana and Mississippi, regulating the oyster industry of \n\n[202 U.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n the respective states, the said statutes providing penalties for the violation thereof, much confusion has resulted, and a great public demand has arisen in Louisiana to definitely mark the boundary line dividing the two states in the waters thereof; that citizens of the state of Mississippi, in violation of the laws of the state of Louisiana, have been fishing oysters with dredges \n\n[202 U.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n on the natural reefs in the waters of the state of Louisiana, said fishermen claiming that they were in the waters of the state of Mississippi, and consequently not violating the laws of the state of Louisiana.'\n\n The bill then set forth that 'to avoid an armed conflict between the sheriff and officers of the parish of St. Bernard, in the state of Louisiana, and the sheriff and officers of the county of Harrison in the state of Mississippi,' a meeting of citizens of Louisiana was called by the governor of that state, which met in New Orleans, and resulted in the appointment by the governor of commissioners on the part of Louisiana 'to consider the determination of the water boundary line between the two states, and arrange for its easy location and identification by a proper system of buoys,' and the request that the governor of Mississippi appoint like commissioners on the part of that state, which appointment was made.\n The joint commission met and considered the subject, and subsequently the Mississippi commission reported its inability to agree with the Louisiana commission, stating, among other things, 'It is apparent that the only hope of settlement is a friendly suit in the Supreme Court of the United States, and we respectfully suggest that course.'\n The bill continued:\n'24th. That the eastern water boundary line, as claimed by your orator, viz., a line beginning at the most southern junction of the channel of the east branch of the Pearl river with Lake Borgne, and thence eastward, following the deep-water channel to the north of Half Moon island, through the Mississippi Sound channel, to Cat Island pass, northeast of Isle a Pitre into the Gulf of Mexico, thereby dividing the waters between the two states, agrees, and is in accord, with the acts of Congress creating respectively the state of Louisiana and the state of Mississippi, as already shown by diagram No. 5; that any other boundary than the deep-water channel as aforesaid would cause the limits of the two states to conflict and overlap, and that it is not to be presumed that the Congress of the United States \n\n[202 U.S. 1, 12]\n\u00a0\n intended to, or would, establish in its description, a boundary for the state of Mississippi, conflicting with the already-existing Louisiana eastern boundary, when there is a construction of the wording of the two acts, in fact, the only construction that suggests itself, that shows a boundary readily ascertained, harmonizing with the words of the acts as they now read, and clearly defining the limits of the two states in the waters between them.\n\n'25th. Your orator further avers that the use of the word 'westwardly' in the description of the southern boundary of the state of Mississippi, as that southern boundary line extends westwardly from the Alabama state line to the Louisiana eastern boundary line, shows that it was not the intention of Congress to have it run direct or due west throughout the whole course, and that it was evidently the intention of Congress, in giving to the state of Mississippi the islands north of that westwardly-drawn line, that the 18-mile limit shall gradually decrease as it approached the Louisiana line on the east, till it met and followed it to its source. If the Mississippi line ran parallel to the southern coast of Mississippi, at a distance of 18 miles from such coast line, following the meander of the coast, and thence joined at right angles a line emerging from the mouth of Pearl river, such line would not only include Grassy, Half Moon, Round, Le Petit Pass islands and Isle a Pitre, already belonging to Louisiana as being within 9 miles or 3 leagues of the Louisiana shore line, but such line would also include part of the mainland of the state of Louisiana. as will be seen from the following diagram (No. 6), made a part of this bill, and it certainly could not have been the intention of Congress to take away from the state of Louisiana any islands or mainland already belonging to it, and to give them to the state of Mississippi, as such a proceeding, without the consent of the legislature of the state of Louisiana, would be a violation of  3 of art. 4 of the Constitution of the United States.\n\n'26th. You orator avers that the marsh lands claimed by \n\n[202 U.S. 1, 13]\n\u00a0\n the state of Mississippi to be islands are in truth, with the exception of the Isle a Pitre, Grassy, Half Moon, Round, and Le Petit Pass islands, low-lying marsh lands, forming part of the mainland of the state of Louisiana; that said swamp or marsh lands and islands have been known as and called, since time immemorial, 'the Louisiana marshes;' that they were approved to the state of Louisiana by the Commissioner of the General Land Office on May 6, 1852, as will appear from a certified copy of said record of approval from the United States Land Office, made a part of this bill, marked Exhibit (G) and, where not since sold by the state of Louisiana to private purchasers, have always stood on the books of the register of the Louisiana state land office as state lands, to be offered for sale, until recently transferred by the state of Louisiana to the board of commissioners for the Lake Borgne basin levee district by the provisions of act No. 14 of the legislature of the state of Louisiana for the year 1892, for the purpose of enabling the said levee board, by the proceeds of sale of said lands, to secure the funds to aid in the building of levees in that levee district, to protect the lands from overflow.\n\n'27th. That parts of said disputed territory claimed by the state of Mississippi to be islands within 18 miles of its shore line are in fact part of the mainland of the state of Louisiana, and therefore belong to and form part of said state of Louisiana; but if your Honors should feel that any part of this disputed area was islands by reason of the presence of shallow water, then, as islands, they are within the 9-mile limit of distance from the shore line of the state of Louisiana, and therefore belong to and form part of the state of Louisiana by that second provision of the act of Congress giving Louisiana all islands within 3 leagues of its shore line.\n\n'28th. Your orator further avers that where contiguous states or countries are separated by water it is, and always has been, the custom to regard the channel as establishing the boundary line of such states, and that the state of Mississippi has itself recognized this principle in the description of \n\n[202 U.S. 1, 14]\n\u00a0\n its territorial limits, as found in the 2d article of its own Constitution, adopted November, 1890, in the following words:\n\n ... * *\n'29th. Your orator avers that, as heretofore stated, the Congress of the United States, as well as the various departments of the United States government having authority in the premises, have themselves recognized the boundary line contended for by the state of Louisiana by reason of the fact that the United States government has confirmed to the state of Louisiana the lands composing Half Moon island, which is just south of the deep-water channel' [by sections and townships as set forth] and also 'the lands forming what is commonly known as Isle a Pitre' [by sections and townships, as stated], all of them 'recognized as belonging to and forming part of the state of Louisiana by the said United States government, and have always heretofore been so recognized by the people of the said two states; that the lands forming the Isle a Pitre were sold by the state of Louisiana,' etc., etc., 'and said lands have been assessed on the assessment rolls of the parish of St. Bernard, state of Louisiana, and taxes thereon have been paid to the state of Louisiana for the past thirty- five years, and said lands have never been assessed on the rolls of, nor have any taxes ever been paid to, the state of Mississippi, and that this is the case with all other lands and islands now claimed by the state of Mississippi, but which in truth and fact belong to the state of Louisiana.'\n\n'30th. Your orator therefore further avers that all constituted authorities competent to create, adopt, or consider the said boundary line have declared the water boundary line claimed by the state of Louisiana, viz., the deep-water channel running from the most southern junction of the eastern mouth of Pearl river, through Lake Borgne, north of Half Moon island, through Mississippi sound, north of Isle a Pitre, and Southwest of Cat island, through Cat Island pass, through Chandeleur sound northeast of Chandeleur islands to the Gulf \n\n[202 U.S. 1, 15]\n\u00a0\n of Mexico, to be the true water boundary between the said states.'\n\n The bill prayed that it be adjudged and decreed 'that the boundary line dividing the states of Louisiana and Mississippi, in the waters between the said states to the south of the state of Mississippi, and to the southeast of the state of Louisiana, is the deep-water channel, commencing at the most southern junction of the eastern mouth of Pearl river with Lake Borgne, thence by the deep-water channel through Lake Borgne, north of Half Moon island, through Mississippi sound, north of Isle a Pitre, through Cat Island Pass channel, southwest of Cat Island, through Chandeleur Island sound, northeast of the Chandeleur islands, to the Gulf of Mexico, as is delineated on the original map submitted by the Louisiana boundary commission to the Mississippi boundary commission, and now made part of this bill, marked Exhibit 'E;' that the said deep-water channel be located throughout its course and permanently buoyed at the joint expense of the two states; that the state of Mississippi and its citizens be perpetually enjoined from disputing the sovereignty and ownership of the state of Louisiana in the said land and water territory south and west of said boundary line,' and for costs and general relief.\n [Exhibit 'E' is not reproduced in the printed record, but it to be found in the Louisiana Atlas of Maps, p. 60. It consists of coast survey charts Nos. 189, 190, and 191, showing the coast from Mobile to Lakes Borgne and Pontchartrain, with boundary lines added in red ink. The maps given in this statement are sufficient to supply the lack of this particular exhibit.]\n The state of Mississippi, by leave, filed a demurrer to the bill, which was, by stipulation, submitted to the consideration of the court on printed arguments, and was subsequently overruled.\n Thereupon the state of Mississippi, on leave, filed her answer and cross bill. \n\n[202 U.S. 1, 16]\n\u00a0\n The state denied articulately nearly every material allegation of the bill, and therefore the accuracy of the diagrams or maps attached thereto, and asserted the true boundary to be as set forth in her cross bill. and while she admitted 'that the deep-water channel out of the mouth of Pearl river, through the upper course of Lake Borgne, and on into the Gulf, as stated in the bill, has been marked by buoys by and under the direction of the United States government, for navigation and commercial purposes,' she denied 'that said marking of the deep-water channel was ever intended to fix in any manner whatsoever any part of the boundary line between said states,' and further denied 'the correctness of complainant's statement that where contiguous states or countries are separated by water, the channel of the waters dividing said states constitutes a boundary line, and defendant specifically denies that such rule is applicable to this case.'\n The cross bill averred that the southern boundary line of the state of Mississippi was fixed by the act of Congress, approved March 1, 1817, 3 Stat. at L. 348, chap. 23,  2.\n That by that act Mississippi was given 'all lands under the waters south of her well-defined shore line to the distance of six leagues from said shore at every point between the Alabama line and the most eastern junction of Pearl river with Lake Borgne, including all islands within said limit,' and 'all territory within said limits, not being a part of the mainland of the state of Louisiana, became, was, and is a part of the territory of the state of Mississippi.'\n That the acts of 1812, creating the state of Louisiana, failed 'to describe the water line from the most eastern mouth of Pearl river to the Gulf of Mexico,' and hence Louisiana proposed, 'without authority in law, to follow the deep-water channel from the mouth of Pearl river to the Gulf of Mexico,-that is, as far south as that point in the sea where the waters of Chandeleur sound merge into the waters of the Gulf of Mexico.'\n That the act creating the state of Mississippi was the organi- \n\n[202 U.S. 1, 17]\n\u00a0\n zation of a state government in the western part of Mississippi territory; that the southern part of the territory of Mississippi was added thereto by an act of Congress approved May 14, 1812, which provided: 'That all that portion of territory lying east of Pearl river, west of the Perdido, and south of the thirty-first degree of latitude, be, and the same is hereby, annexed to the Mississippi territory; to be governed by the laws now in force therein, or which may hereafter be enacted, and the laws and ordinances of the United States, relative thereto, in like manner as if the same had originally formed a part of said territory; and until otherwise provided by law, the inhabitants of the said district, hereby annexed to the Mississippi territory, shall be entitled to one representative in the general assembly thereof.' 2 Stat. at L. 734, chap. 84.\n That this act and the act admitting the state of Mississippi 'recognized the fact that the boundary line of the state of Louisiana embraced no island in the waters to the east of said state and to the south of the Mississippi mainland, or shore, and within 6 leagues of the Mississippi shore; that the said Louisiana acts are not in conflict with the aforesaid Mississippi acts, the boundaries of Louisiana only embracing such islands, as clearly shown by said acts creating and admitting her, as were within the Gulf of Mexico and also within 3 leagues of her gulf coast,- that is to say, within the Gulf of Mexico proper and to the south of said state of Louisiana, as contemplated by Congress; that the said line from the mouth of Pearl river to the Gulf of Mexico, dividing the territory of Mississippi from the state of Louisiana, was never defined until the passage of the act creating the state of Mississippi, when, for the first time, the southern boundary of the Mississippi territory, the western part of which was, by said act, made the state of Mississippi, was accurately defined and established, as herein stated; that the line above described and defined by the said Mississippi acts includes no islands which are within 3 leagues of the Louisiana mainland and also in the Gulf of Mexico, as the limits \n\n[202 U.S. 1, 18]\n\u00a0\n of the Gulf of Mexico are defined by the said state in her original bill herein.'\n That the state of Louisiana 'claims title and sovereignty over some of the islands belonging to the state of Mississippi by virtue of certain alleged action of certain officers of the United States government and local officers of the state of Louisiana,' but the claim 'is not well founded because of the matters herein set forth, and because said islands and territory have not been susceptible to actual use and occupation, and because said claim is in violation of  3, art. 4, of the Constitution of the United States . . .' But if the court should adjudge said islands and territory approved by the aforesaid officials to the state of Louisiana to belong to said state, then cross complainant prayed that the claim of title of Louisiana thereto 'be restricted to the real lands or islands so lost to the state of Mississippi, and be in no case permitted to affect any lands under the waters, or any of the public oyster reefs thereunder.'\n It was then alleged that Mississippi had 'exercised sovereignty and jurisdiction over said waters within 18 miles of her shore aforesaid,' and that by her statutes, as codified in 1857, had asserted such jurisdiction.\n And that, by the legislation of Congress and the state, the \" Mississippi sound' was recognized as a body of water, 6 leagues wide, wholly within the state of Mississippi, from Lake Borgne to the Alabama line, separate and distinct from 'the Gulf of Mexico.\"\n The cross bill further averred that Congress, 'in the early history of the Republic, in dealing with the Gulf coast or shore,' was not perfectly familiar with the line, and by several acts 'creating the Gulf states, respectively, treated the said Gulf coast or shore as a line running generally from east to west,' and said states were, in the contemplation of Congress, 'so formed and bounded as to give to each state jurisdiction over the waters adjacent to its shore or coast for a certain specified distance southward from its mainland line; that it was \n\n[202 U.S. 1, 19]\n\u00a0\n not intended to give to any state jurisdiction over waters adjacent to and immediately south and in front of any other state or territory.' But that the deep-water channel line contended for by Louisiana would take nearly all of the Hancock county water front, much of that of Harrison county, and possibly some of that of Jackson county, over all which Mississippi had exercised jurisdiction since her admission.\n Reference was then made to the organization of Hancock and Jackson counties in December, 1812, and of Harrison county, in 1841; and to certain sections of the Revised Code of Mississippi of 1880 and a codification of 1892, making a general reference to islands within 6 leagues of the Mississippi shore; and it was charged that during all this time the government of the Mississippi territory and that of the state of Mississippi had exercised full and complete jurisdiction and sovereignty over the waters in the 'Mississippi sound' as a part of the three counties aforesaid.\n The prayer was that it be decreed 'that the boundary line dividing the states of Mississippi and Louisiana is the line which, beginning at a point 6 leagues due south of that point on the shore where the Alabama and Mississippi line enters the Gulf of Mexico, runs westwardly with the meanderings of the shore 6 leagues always therefrom until said line reaches and touches the real mainland of Louisiana about 2 miles due west of the 'Indian mound' and 'Lake of the Mound,' and thence in an almost due northward direction along and on the high-tide mark of the said Louisiana mainland to Mississippi sound at or near Nine Mile bayou, and thence further along said mainland at the high-tide mark westwardly to that point due south of the middle of the most southern or eastern junction of Pearl river with Lake Borgne, and thence from said point due north to the said Pearl river; that the said line be located and permanently buoyed at the joint expense of the two states; that the full title and sovereignty over all the islands and the land under the waters north and east of the said line so established be decreed and adjudged to be in the \n\n[202 U.S. 1, 20]\n\u00a0\n state of Mississippi, and that the state of Louisiana and her citizens be perpetually enjoined from disputing such title and sovereignty of the state of Mississippi therein,' and for costs and general relief.\n The following 'Exhibit Map' was attached. [See post.]\n The state of Louisiana filed replication, and also an answer to the cross bill, the allegations of which were in substance denied. \n\n[202 U.S. 1, 21]\n\u00a0\n As to the act of May 14, 1812, the state said that it could not and did not change the boundaries of Louisiana, and that, in fact, the southern portion of the Mississippi territory as claimed was not then in possession of the United States, and did not extend south of the 31st degree of north latitude; that February 12, 1813, an act was passed 'authorizing the President of the United States to take possession of a tract of country lying south of the Mississippi territory and west of the river Perdido,' but that this was not published until 1818; nor were the resolution of January 15 and the act of March 3, 1811, on the relations of the United States to Spain, published until after April 20, 1818. 3 Stat. at L. 471, 472.\n The cause being at issue, much evidence, documentary and otherwise, was taken, and the case was argued October 10, 11, and 12.\n\n Messrs. John Dymond, Jr., Francis C. Zacharie, Walter Guion, Albert Estopinal, Jr., and Alexander Porter Morse for complainant.\n\n\n[202 U.S. 1, 27]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Hannis Taylor, James N. Flowers, Monroe McClurg, and William Williams for defendant.\n\n\n\n[202 U.S. 1, 33]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n The demurrer was overruled because the court was of opinion that the bill presented a prima facie case of justiciable controversy between the state of Louisiana and the state of Mississippi as to the boundary line between them, and we are clear that the proofs establish the existence of such a controversy as to fully sustain our jurisdiction\n It is apparent that the enforcement of the oyster legislation of the two states led to a conflict between the authorities of both, which involved a dispute as to the true boundary line.\n In 1886 the state of Louisiana passed an act vesting the power to control the oyster industry in the hands of the officials of the parishes of the state in their several localities, along general lines laid down in the law. La. Laws 1886, act No. 106. This was followed by the acts of 1892 ( No. 110), 1896 (No. 121), and 1900 (No. 159). By the act of 1896 nonresident oyster fishermen were prohibited from fishing oysters in Louisiana waters, and the dredging of oysters was also prohibited, in this particular differing from the laws of Mississippi, which permitted it. By a concurrent resolution of 1900 a legislative commission was created, to investigate and report on the oyster industry of the state.\n In January, 1898, the parochial authorities of the parish of St. Bernard equipped and sent out an official expedition to exclude from the oyster water of the parish any nonresident \n\n[202 U.S. 1, 34]\n\u00a0\n oyster fishermen who might be found fishing therein. Nonresident Mississippi oystermen were found fishing oysters there, and they were notified that they must stop fishing and move out of those waters. These Mississippians then complained to the Mississippi authorities and a conference ensued between representatives of the parish of St. Bernard and the county of Hancock. In January, 1901, at the instance of the Louisiana legislative commission appointed under the act of 1900, and of committees appointed from the police juries of the Louisiana parishes of St. Bernard and Plaquemines, a meeting of the state officials of Louisiana was held in New Orleans to consider the subject of the dispute with the state of Mississippi, and the invasion by nonresidents of the Louisiana oyster waters. This meeting resulted in the appointment by the governor of Louisiana of a commission of five members, and an official communication from the governor of Louisiana addressed to the governor of Mississippi, requesting the latter to appoint a similar commission to see if it were possible to effect an amicable settlement of the dispute between the two states. This Mississippi commission was accordingly appointed, and the two commissions held a joint conference in New Orleans in March, 1901. Louisiana presented at the conference a map showing the Louisiana contention as to the boundary, which is the map attached to the bill, and marked Exhibit E. The Mississippi commission reported that it was impossible to effect an amicable extrajudicial settlement of the dispute, and that the only hope of settlement was a friendly suit in the Supreme Court of the United States. This report was submitted by the Mississippi commission to the governor of Mississippi, and was transmitted to the legislature of that state. At this session the state of Mississippi passed a new law controlling her oyster waters and oyster industry. Laws 1902, chap. 58. This act created a state oyster commission, vested with entire control of the Mississippi oyster industry. It took the control of the industry out of the hands of the coast county authorities and centralized it in this state department, which was authorized to establish a \n\n[202 U.S. 1, 35]\n\u00a0\n system of patrol of the Mississippi oyster waters, and to maintain patrol boats to sustain the oyster laws in her territory. In July, 1902, the state of Louisiana followed the example of the state of Mississippi and adopted an act (Acts 1902, No. 153) creating a state oyster commission of Louisiana as a state department, vested with full control of the oyster industry of Louisiana, and authorized to establish patrol boats and maintain an armed patrol on the Louisiana oyster waters to protect her rights in the oyster industry therein. In view of the danger of an armed conflict, the oyster commissions of both states, in September, 1902, adopted a joint resolution establishing a neutral territory between the two states 'pending the final decision by the Supreme Court of the United States in the boundary suit to be instituted,' to remain a common fishing ground. This modus vivendi did not include all of the disputed territory, but the waters of Mississippi sound between the deep-water channel and the north shore line of the Louisiana marshes were embraced by it.\n In the following October this bill was filed. Louisiana appeared through her governor and her attorney general, and the action of the governor in instituting the suit was subsequently approved, ratified, and confirmed by the legislature.\n The facts that the act of Congress admitting the state of Louisiana gave that state all islands within 3 leagues or 9 miles of her coast, and that the subsequent act of Congress admitting the state of Mississippi purported to give that state all islands within 6 leagues or 18 miles of her shore, and that some islands within 9 miles of the Louisiana coast were also within 18 miles of the Mississippi shore, furnished the basis for a boundary controversy, although, in our judgment, the apparent inconsistency is reconcilable, as hereinafter explained. And that controversy involved to each state pecuniary values of magnitude, as is shown by the evidence on both sides. We think that there existed between the two states, in their sovereign capacity as states, a controversy affecting the boundary line separating them in the locality in \n\n[202 U.S. 1, 36]\n\u00a0\n question of a character to justify the exercise of our original jurisdiction within the rules laid down in Miscourt v. Illinois, \n200 U.S. 496\n, 50 L. ed. --, 26 Sup.Ct.Rep. 268; Missouri v. Illinois, \n180 U.S. 208\n, 45 L. ed. 497, 21 Sup.Ct.Rep. 331; Pennsylvania v. Wheeling & B. Bridge Co. 13 How. 589, 14 L. ed. 279; Louisiana v. Texas, \n176 U.S. 1\n, 44 L. ed. 347, 20 Sup.Ct.Rep. 251; Kansas v. Colorado, \n185 U.S. 125\n, 46 L. ed. 838, 22 Sup.Ct.Rep. 552.\n\n 2. \nThe state of Louisiana was admitted into the Union by the act of Congress approved April 8, 1812 (2 Stat. at L. 701, chap. 50), which commenced as follows:\n'Whereas, the representatives of the people of all that part of the territory or country ceded under the name of 'Louisiana' by the treaty made at Paris on the thirtieth day of April, one thousand eight hundred and three, between the United States and France, contained within the following limits, that is to say: Beginning at the mouth of the River Sabine; thence by a line to be drawn along the middle of said river, including all islands, to the thirty-second degree of latitude; thence due north to the northernmost part of the thirty-third degree of north latitude; thence along the said parallel of latitude to the River Mississippi; thence down the said river to the River Iberville; and from thence along the middle of the said river and Lakes Maurepas and Ponchartrain to the Gulf of Mexico; thence bounded by the said gulf to the place of beginning including all islands within three leagues of the coast ; . . .'\n\n Map of diagram No. 1, given in the opening statement, shows the limits as thus defined.\n By an act of Congress approved April 14, 1812 (2 Stat. at L. 708., chap. 57), additional territory was added to the state of Louisiana, described thus:\n'All that tract of country comprehended within the following bounds, to wit: Beginning at the junction of the Iberville with the River Mississippi; thence along the middle of the Iberville, the River Amite and of the Lakes Maurepas and Pontchartrain to the eastern mouth of the Pearl river; thence up the eastern branch of Pearl river to the thirty-first degree of north latitude; thence along the said degree of latitude to the River Mississippi; thence down the said river to the place of be- \n\n[202 U.S. 1, 37]\n\u00a0\n ginning, shall become and form a part of the said state of Louisiana, and be subject to the Constitution and laws thereof in the same manner, and for all intents and purposes, as if it had been included within the original boundaries of the said state.'\n\n This added territory is shown on map or diagram No. 2. The eastern boundary of Louisiana was thereby moved eastward from the Mississippi to Pearl river, and Louisiana was given the country south of the 31st degree of north latitude, and north of the boundary formed by the River Iberville, the middle of Lakes Maurepas and Pontchartrain, and the Rigolets.\n The River Iberville is called on this map Bayou Manchac, and is still known by that name. The Rigolets is a gut connecting the waters of Lakes Pontchartrain and Borgne, both of which are bodies of salt water and were originally arms of the sea. In order to reach the open waters of the Gulf of Mexico from the middle of Lakes Maurepas and Pontchartrain the line ran through the Rigolets into Lake Borgne, and after the addition to the state by the act of April 14, 1812, the eastern boundary line of Louisiana entered Lake Borgne to the south by Pearl river as well as the Rigolets. To get from Lake Borgne into the open water of the Gulf of Mexico beyond Chandeleur islands and around to the western boundary of Louisiana, it was necessary, as Louisiana contends, to follow the deep-water channel north of Half Moon or Grand island, through Mississippi sound, and thence by the pass between Cat island and Isle a Pitre, north of the Chandeleur islands, into the open Gulf. Many maps are given in the record, some made at dates long prior to the admission of Louisiana as a state, some at that time, and some within a few years thereafter, and all show the St. Bernard peninsula to be geographically a true part of the state of Louisiana, or of an area of country that was to form the state, and that the said peninsula projected itself as a well-defined arm of land out into the waters of the Gulf, branching off as a projection from the main body of land com- \n\n[202 U.S. 1, 38]\n\u00a0\n posing the state, and forming a part of it. We observe that on many of these early maps the term 'peninsula' is applied to this projection, and that designation is sufficiently accurate for the purpose of description.\n November 14, 1803, President Jefferson sent a communication to Congress, in which, among other things, he said:\n'The object of the following pages is to consolidate the information respecting the present state of Louisiana, furnished to the Executive by several individuals among the best informed on the subject.\n\n'Of the province of Louisiana no general map, sufficiently correct to be depended upon, has been published, nor has any been yet procured from a private source. It is indeed probable that surveys have never been made upon so extensive a scale as to afford the means of laying down the various regions of a country which, in some of its parts, appears to have been but imperfectly explored. . . .\n\n'St. Bernardo.\n\n'On the east side of the Mississippi, about 5 leagues below New Orleans, and at the head of the English bend, is a settlement known by the name of the Poblacion de St. Bernardo, or the Terre aux Aoeufs, extending on both sides of a creek or drain, whose head is contiguous to the Mississippi, and which, flowing eastward, after a course of 18 leagues, and dividing itself into two branches, falls into the sea and Lake Borgne. This settlement consists of two parishes, almost all the inhabitants of which are Spaniards from the Canaries, who content themselves with raising fowls, corn, and garden stuff for the market at New Orleans. The lands cannot be cultivated to any great distance from the banks of the creek, on account of the vicinity of the marsh behind them, but the place is suspectible of great improvement, and of affording another communication to small craft of from 8 to 10 feet draught, between the sea and the Mississippi.'\n\n'Country from Plaquemines to the Sea, and Effect of the Hurricanes. \n\n[202 U.S. 1, 39]\n\u00a0\n 'From Plaquemines to the sea is 12 or 13 leagues. The country is low, swampy, chiefly covered with reeds, and having little or no timber, and no settlement whatever. It may be necessary to mention here, that the whole lower part of the country, from the English turn downwards, is subject to overflowing in hurricanes, either by the recoiling of the river, or reflux from the sea on each side; and, on more than one occasion, it has been covered from the depth of 2 to 10 feet, according to the descent of the river, whereby many lives were lost, horses and cattle swept away, and a scene of destruction laid. The last calamity of this kind happened in 1794, but fortunately they are not frequent. In the preceding year the engineer who superintended the erection of the fort at Plaquemines was drowned in his house near the fort, and the workmen and garrison escaped only by taking refuge on an elevated spot in the fort, on which there were, notwithstanding, 2 or 3 feet of water. These hurricanes have generally been felt in the month of August. Their greatest fury lasts about twelve hours. They commence in the southeast, veer about to all the points of the compass, are felt most severely below, and seldom extend more than a few leagues above, New Orleans. In their whole course they are marked with ruin and desolation. Until that of 1793, there had been none felt from the year 1780.'\n\n This communication was, of course, before Congress when the act of 1812, admitting Louisiana, was approved, and the peninsula was clearly recognized as forming part of the parish of St. Bernard, as was its marshy character and that of the adjoining parish.\n By the act of Congress, approved March 1, 1817 (3 Stat. at L. 348, chap. 23,  2), the inhabitants of the western part of the then Mississippi territory were authorized to form for themselves a state constitution and to be admitted into the Union, with the following boundaries: 'Beginning on the river Mississippi at the point where the southern boundary line of the state of Tennessee strikes the same; thence east along the said boundary line to the Tennessee river; thence up the same to the mouth of Bear \n\n[202 U.S. 1, 40]\n\u00a0\n creek; thence by a direct line to the northwest corner of the county of Washington; thence due south to the Gulf of Mexico; thence westwardly, including all the islands within six leagues of the shore, to the most eastern junction of Pearl river with Lake Borgne; thence up said river to the thirty-first degree of north latitude; thence west along the said degree of latitude to the Mississippi river; thence up the same to the beginning.'\n The people in convention, August 15, 1817, formed a constitution and state government (approved subsequently by popular vote), and the state was admitted by resolution December 10, 1817. 3 Stat. at L. 472.\n The state of Alabama was admitted by the act of March 2, 1819 (3 Stat. at L. 489, chap. 47,  2), which provided: 'That the said state shall consist of all the territory included within the following boundaries, to wit: Beginning at the point where the thirty-first degree of north latitude intersects the Perdido river; thence, east, to the western boundary line of the state of Georgia; thence along said line to the southern boundary line of the state of Tennessee; thence, west, along said boundary line, to the Tennessee river; thence, up the same, to the mouth of Bear creek; thence, by a direct line, to the northwest corner of Washington county; thence, due south, to the Gulf of Mexico; thence, eastwardly, including all islands within six leagues of the shore to the Perdido river; and thence, up the same to the beginning.'\n The islands, marsh or otherwise claimed by Louisiana in this case were all within 3 leagues of her coast. The act admitting Mississippi was passed five years after the Louisiana act, yet Mississippi claims thereunder the disputed territory, as being islands within 18 miles of her shore. If it were true that this repugnancy between the two acts existed, it is enough to say that Congress, after the admission of Louisiana, could not take away any portion of that state and give it to the state of Mississippi. The rule, Qui prior est tempore, portior est jure, applied, and  3 of art. 4 of the Constitution does not permit the claims of any particular state to be \n\n[202 U.S. 1, 41]\n\u00a0\n prejudiced by the exercise of the power of Congress therein conferred.\n But it is said that the act admitting Louisiana, the act admitting Mississippi, and the act admitting Alabama, must be construed as in pari materia; and, being so construed, that Congress must be held to have had in view in the three acts a division of the coast along the Gulf of Mexico so as to equalize the water frontage of Mississippi, Louisiana, and Alabama.\n We do not regard these acts as in pari materia in any proper sense. They provided for the admission of three separate states, and the subject of each was not only not identical with, but not even similar to, that of the others. They did not form part of a homogeneous whole, of a common system, so as to allow a claimant under the later act to successfully contend that it changed the earlier act by construction or effected such change because declaratory of the meaning of the prior act.\n And assuming, for the sake of argument, that the Louisiana and Mississippi acts were irreconcilably inconsistent, but remembering that when Louisiana was admitted into the Union, the territory now composing the coast counties of Mississippi, that is, below the 31st degree of north latitude, was not actually a part of the Mississippi territory, but was in dispute between the United States and Spain the theory of any preconcerted design in regard to the water front of the two states is too unreasonable to be entertained.\n In the treaty of peace between England, France, and Spain of February 10, 1716, article 7, on the subject of the boundary line separating the dominions of England and France in the New World, provided: 'That for the future the confines between the dominions of His Britannic Majesty and those of His Most Christian Majesty in that part of the world shall be fixed irrevocably by a line drawn along the River Mississippi from its source to the River Iberville, and from thence by a line drawn along the middle of this river and the Lakes Maurepas and Pontchartrain to the sea.' According to this treaty England retained the port of Mobile and its river and everything east \n\n[202 U.S. 1, 42]\n\u00a0\n of the Rigolets. The island of Orleans, formed by the River Iberville, Lakes Maurepas, and Pontchartrain, the Rigolets, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Mississippi river, remained the property of France. In the treaty of February 10, 1763, practically the same language is used in describing the boundary line separating the British from the French territory, and by the twentieth article the cession to England of Florida by Spain and all that Spain possessed on the continent of North America was provided for. By the treaty of September 3, 1783, between England and Spain, England retroceded East and West Florida to Spain. By the treaty of St. Ildefonso of October 1, 1800, Spain ceded to France 'the colony or province of Louisiana with the exent that it now has in the hands of Spain, and that it had when France possessed it, and such as it should be after the treaties subsequently entered into between Spain and other states.' April 30, 1803, France ceded to the United States 'the colony or province of Louisiana' using the same description as used by Spain in ceding the territory to her, and stating in article 2: 'In the cession made by the preceding article are included the adjacent islands belonging to Louisiana . . .' [8 Stat. at L. 202.]\n There is nothing in any of these transfers to raise a doubt that the peninsula of St. Bernard was part of the Island of Orleans, and that this Island of Orleans was in fact formed by the extension to the sea of the boundary line coming down through the middle of Lakes Maurepas and Pontchartrain, and so finding its way to the sea by the deep-water channel.\n March 26, 1804, an act of Congress was approved, dividing the country acquired as Louisiana from France into two parts, providing:\n'That all that portion of country ceded by France to the United States under the name of Louisiana, which lies south of the Mississippi territory and of an east and west line to commence on the Mississippi river at the thirty-third degree of north latitude, and to extend west to the western boundary of the said cession, shall constitute a territory of the United \n\n[202 U.S. 1, 43]\n\u00a0\n States under the name of the territory of Orleans, the government whereof shall be organized and administered as follows:\n\n ... * *\n'Section 12. The residue of the province of Louisiana ceded to the United States, shall be called the district of Louisiana, the government whereof shall be organized and administered as follows: . . .' [2 Stat. at L. 283, 287, chap. 38.]\n\n Congress manifestly regarded the lands to the east, that were south of the Mississippi territory, and which form the disputed area of to-day, as part of the original island of Orleans, included in the treaty of April 30, 1803; and these were given to the territory of Orleans, whose southeastern boundary was the original southeastern boundary of the island of Orleans. At that date the Mississippi territory did not extend south of the 31st degree of north latitude, and its domain did not reach the shore of Mississippi sound, so-called.\n February 20, 1811 (2 Stat. at L. 641, chap. 21), an act of Congress was approved 'to enable the people of the territory of Orleans to form a constitution and state government, and for the admission of such state into the Union on an equal footing with the original states and for other purposes.' The description of the limits was as follows: 'Beginning at the mouth of the River Sabine, thence, by a line to be drawn along the middle of the said river, including all islands, to the thirty-second degree of latitude, thence due north to the northernmost part of the thirty-third degree of north latitude, thence along the said parallel of latitude to the River Mississippi, thence down the said river to the River Iberville, and from thence along the middle of the said river and Lakes Maurepas and Ponchartrain to the Gulf of Mexico, thence, bounded by the said gulf to the place of beginning including all islands within three leagues of the coast etc., etc.'\n The eastern boundary thus described is a water boundary, and, in exending this water boundary to the open sea or Gulf of Mexico, we think it included the Rigolets and the deep-water sailing channel line to get around to the westward. A little \n\n[202 U.S. 1, 44]\n\u00a0\n over one year later Louisiana was created a state by the act of Congress of April 8, 1812, with this identical eastern boundary line; and the addition of territory by the act of April 14, 1812, did not affect the deep-water sailing channel line as a boundary.\n April 7, 1798 (1 Stat. at L. 549, chap. 28,  3), an act was approved 'for an Amicable Settlement of Limits with the State of Georgia, and Authorizing the Establishment of a Government in the Mississippi Territory,' which read in part: 'That all that tract of country bounded on the west by the Mississippi; on the north by a line to be drawn due east from the mouth of the Yasous to the Chatahouchee river; on the east by the River Chatahouchee; and on the south by the 31st degree of north latitude shall be, and hereby is, constituted one district, to be called the Mississippi territory.' This was in conformity with the treaty between Spain and the United States of October 27, 1795. [8 Stat. at L. 138]. Maps of that date, and subsequently, show that the admitted rights of the United States did not at the time extend south of the 31st degree of north latitude at that point.\n By an act of January 15, 1811, the President of the United States was authorized, among other things, in the event that any foreign government attempted to occupy the same, to take possession of the country lying east of the River Perdido, and south of the state of Georgia and the Mississippi territory. The River Perdido is in the state of Alabama east of the state of Mississippi, and flows into the Gulf of Mexico between Mobile bay, in Alabama, and Pensacola bay, in Florida. A few days later, and on March 3, 1811, an act of Congress was approved, providing that the act of January 15, 1811, and this act, should not be published until the end of the next session of Congress, unless with the consent of the President.\n By resolution approved January 15, 1811, it was specifically declared that the United States could not, without serious inquietude, see any part of the territory adjoining the southern border of the United States pass into the hands of any foreign power, 'and that a due regard to their own safety compels \n\n[202 U.S. 1, 45]\n\u00a0\n them to provide, under certain contingencies, for the temporary occupation of the said territory.' 3 Stat. at L. 471.\n May 14, 1812, an act of Congress was passed (2 Stat. at L. 734, chap. 84) to enlarge the boundaries of the Mississippi territory, which used the following language: 'That all that portion of territory lying east of Pearl river, west of the Perdido, and south of the thirty-first degree of latitude, be, and the same is hereby, annexed to the Mississippi territory,' etc. The country described was not at the time in the possession of the United States, and on February 12, 1813, Congress passed an act 'authorizing the President of the United States to take possession of a tract of country lying south of the Mississippi territory and west of the River Perdido,' which act referred to the tract as 'not now in possession of the United States.' 3 Stat. at L. 472. But it was not until the enabling act in respect of Mississippi, approved March 1, 1817, that the language was used: 'Thence due south to the Gulf of Mexico; thence, westwardly including all the islands within six leagues of the shore, to the most eastern junction of Pearl river with Lake Borgne,' etc. [3 Stat, at L. 348, chap. 23,  2.]\n The claim of Mississippi is that the disputed area is composed of islands, and as those islands are within 18 miles of her shore, that they were given to her by the act of March 1, and the resolution of December 10, 1817. It is true there are some islands in that area, such as Grassy, Half Moon, Petit Pass, and Isle a Pitre, all of which are between the deep- water channel on the north and the main coast line of St. Bernard peninsula on the south.\n The contention of Louisiana is that these islands were previously given to her by the act of April 8, 1812, more than five years prior to the admission of Mississippi, and that her title thereto, even if the acts were in conflict, is superior to that of the state of Mississippi; and she also contends that the islands belong to her because they are south of the deep-water sailing channel line, which she submits is the true boundary line between the two states. Mississippi denies that the peninsula \n\n[202 U.S. 1, 46]\n\u00a0\n of St. Bernard and the Louisiana marshes constitute a peninsula in the true sense of the word, but insists that they constitute an archipelago of islands. Certainly there are in the body of the Louisiana marshes or St. Bernard peninsula portions of sea marsh which might technically be called islands, because they are land entirely surrounded by water, but they are not true islands. They are rather, as the Commissioner of the General Land Office wrote the Mississippi land commissioner in 1904, 'in fact, hummocks of land surrounded by the marsh and swamp in said townships. . . .'\n And when the Louisiana act used the words: 'Thence bounded by the said gulf to the place of beginning, including all islands within three leagues of the coast' [2 Stat. at L. 701, chap. 50], the coast referred to is the whole coast of the state, and the peninsula of St. Bernard formed an integral part of it. Lake Borgne and Mississippi sound are bodies of salt water, and, as such, parts of the sea or gulf, and as the coast of Louisiana began along the north shore of the peninsula, it is not to be supposed that the islands referred to by Congress in the Louisiana act were solely those islands to the south of that state.\n The contention of Mississippi is based upon an assumed inconsistency between the Louisiana and the Mississippi acts, but we think, upon a true interpretation, in the light of the facts, that no such inconsistency can be imputed. The maps show that there is a chain, not of alluvial, but of sea-sand islands, running from the west shore of Mobile bay, in the state of Alabama, westward to and inclusive of Cat island, in the state of Mississippi. This chain forms the southern boundary of Mississippi sound, and the islands are all relatively the same distance from the shore of the states of Mississippi and of Alabama. They, beginning at the eastern end, are Dauphin, Petit Bois, Horn, Ship, and Cat islands, and there are some other islands lying within this chain. If Congress referred to these islands as being thus within 6 leagues of the shore, when the act creating the state of Mississippi was passed, it follows that there would be no conflict with prior existing boundaries of \n\n[202 U.S. 1, 47]\n\u00a0\n the state of Louisiana, particularly if the deep-water sailing channel line be taken as the correct boundary between the states. And when Congress created a separate territorial government for the eastern part of Mississippi territory and called it Alabama, by the act of March 3, 1817 [ 3 Stat. at L. 372, chap. 59], it used the same language concerning the western and southern boundary of the territory: 'Thence due south to the Gulf of Mexico, thence eastwardly, including all the islands within six leagues of the shore to the Perdido river and thence up same to the beginning.' It seems obvious to us that it was to this chain of islands that Congress referred when it admitted Mississippi into the Union, and that it had no intention whatsoever of giving Mississippi any claim of ownership in the sea-marsh islands, which had been previously granted to the state of Louisiana.\n We are of opinion that the peninsula of St. Bernard in its entirety belongs to Louisiana; that the Louisiana marshes at the eastern extremity thereof form part of the coast line of the state; and that the islands within 9 miles of that coast are hers, except as restricted by the deep- water sailing channel regarded as a boundary. Cat island, for instance, is within the 9 miles, but it is north of the deep-water channel, is not alluvial, and is conceded by both states to belong to Mississippi.\n\n 3. \nThat there is a deep-water sailing channel line emerging from the mouth of Pearl river, and extending east between Lower Point Clear and Grand island, is shown by the numerous maps, surveys, and sketches in the record. It separates into two branches, one of them passing between Cat island and Isle a Pitre.\n Among the maps put in evidence by Louisiana is one prepared by George Gauld, M. A., for the British Admiralty, in the year 1778, and, from the relative depths of water given, the existence of this same channel, extending out into the Gulf, southwest of Cat island, is shown, and is the same as noted on maps of subsequent years.\n February 14, 1839, an act of the legislature of Mississippi was \n\n[202 U.S. 1, 48]\n\u00a0\n approved, providing for a survey of the Mississippi coast. The survey and report are given in full in the record, and the deep-water channel above referred to is traceable in detail on the sketch. The channels indicated on this survey and on the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey map are the same channels. It may be noted, in passing, that the body of water now known as 'Mississippi sound,' is not so designated on this sketch, and the first map which uses this name, to which our attention has been called, was issued in 1866\n\n\n Louisana lies between the states of Mississippi to the east and Texas to the west. The southern portion of Louisiana is geologically of an alluvial formation, containing the delta of the Mississippi river. The peninsula of the parish of St. Bernard is practically a part of this delta formation.\n Mississippi's mainland borders on Mississippi sound. This is an enclosed arm of the sea, wholly within the United States, and formed by a chain of large islands, extending westward from Mobile, Alabama, to Cat island. The openings from this body of water into the Gulf are neither of them 6 miles wide. Such openings occur between Cat island and Isle a Pitre; between Cat and Ship islands; between Ship and Horn islands; between Horn and Petit Bois islands; between Petit Bois and Dauphin islands; between Dauphin island and the mainland on the west coast of Mobile bay. The maps show all this, and, among others, reference may be made to Jeffrey's map of 1775, given in the record, and which, in reduced form, is reproduced from Jeffrey's Atlas of 1800 as the frontispiece of vol. 2, Adams's History of the United States.\n Now to repeat, the boundary of Louisiana separating her from the state of Mississippi to the east is the thread of the channel of the Mississippi river, and this extends south until it reaches the 31st degree of north latitude and then runs directly east along that degree until Pearl river is reached; thence south along the channel of that river to Lake Borgne. Pearl river flows into Lake Borgne, Lake Borgne into Mississippi sound, and Mississippi sound into the open Gulf of Mexico \n\n[202 U.S. 1, 49]\n\u00a0\n through, among other outlets, South pass separating Cat island from Isle a Pitre.\n If the doctrine of the thalweg is applicable, the correct boundary line separating Louisiana from Mississippi in these waters is the deep- water channel.\n The term 'thalweg' is commonly used by writers on international law in definition of water boundaries between states, meaning, the middle, or deepest, or most navigable channel. And while often styled 'fairway' or 'midway' or 'main channel,' the word itself has been taken over into various languages. Thus, in the treaty of Lunevillc, February 9, 1801, we find 'le thalweg de l'Adige,' 'le thalweg du Rhin,' and it is similarly used in English treaties and decisions, and the books of publicfsts in every tongue.\n In Lowa v. Illinois, \n147 U.S. 1\n, 37 L. ed. 55, 13 Sup.Ct.Rep. 239, the rule of the thalweg was stated and applied. The controversy between the states of Iowa and Illinois on the Mississippi river, which flowed between them, was as to the line which separated 'the jurisdiction of the two states for the purposes of taxation and other purposes of government.' Iowa contended that the boundary line was the middle of the main body of the river, without regard to the 'steamboat channel' or deepest part of the stream. Illinois claimed that its jurisdiction extended to the channel upon which commerce on the river by steamboats or other vessels was usually conducted. This court held that the true line in a navigable river between states is the middle of the main channel of the river.\n Mr. Justice Field, delivering the opinion of the court, said:\n'When a navigable river constitutes the boundary between two independent states, the line defining the point at which the jurisdiction of the two separates is well established to be the middle of the main channel of the stream. The interest of each state in the navigation of the river admits of no other line. The preservation by each of its equal right in the navigation of the stream is the subject of paramount interest. It is therefore, laid down in all the recognized treatises of inter- \n\n[202 U.S. 1, 50]\n\u00a0\n national law of modern times that the middle of the channel of the stream marks the true boundary between the adjoining states up to which each state will, on its side, exercise jurisdiction. In international law, therefore, and by the usage of European nations, the term 'middle of the stream,' as applied to a navigable river, is the same as the middle of the channel of such stream, and in that sense the terms are used in the treaty of peace between Great Britain, France, and Spain, concluded at Paris in 1763. By the language, 'a line drawn along the middle of the River Mississippi from its source to the River Iberville,' as there used, is meant along the middle of the channel of the River Mississippi.'\n\n This judgment related to navigable rivers. But we are of opinion that, on occasion, the principle of the thalweg is applicable, in respect of water boundaries, to sounds, bays, straits, gulfs, estuaries, and other arms of the sea.\n As to boundary lakes and landlocked seas, where there is no necessary track of navigation, the line of demarcation is drawn in the middle, and this is true of narrow straits separating the lands of two different states; but whenever there is a deep-water sailing channel therein, it is thought by the publicists that the rule of the thalweg applies. 1 Martens ( F. de) 2d ed. p. 134; Hall,  38; Bluntschli, 5th ed.  298, 299; 1 Oppenheim, pp. 254, 255.\n Thus Martens writes: 'What we have said in regard to rivers and lakes is equally applicable to the straits or gulfs of the sea, especially those which do not exceed the ordinary width of rivers or double the distance that a cannon can carry.'\n So Pradier Fod er e says (vol. 2, p. 202), that as to lakes, 'in communication with or connected with the sea, they ought to be considered under the same rule as international rivers.'\n The same view is confirmed by decisions of this court and of many arbitral tribunals.\n In Re Devoe Mfg. Co. \n108 U.S. 401\n, 27 L. ed. 764, 2 Sup.Ct.Rep. 894, the question at issue was in regard to the boundary line between New York and New Jersey, under an agreement between the two \n\n[202 U.S. 1, 51]\n\u00a0\n states. The jurisdiction of the state of New Jersey was claimed 'to extend down to the bay of New York, and to the channel midway of said bay,' and this court sustained the claim. See Hamburg American S. S. Co. v. Grube, \n196 U.S. 407\n, 49 L. ed. 529, 25 Sup.Ct.Rep. 352.\n In the San Juan water boundary controversy versy between the United States and Great Britain, Emperor William I. gave the award in favor of the United States, October 21, 1871, by deciding 'that the boundary line between the territory of Her Brittanic Majesty and the United States should be drawn through the Haro channel;' and it is apparent that the decision was based on the deep-channel theory as applicable to sounds and arms of the sea, such as the straits of San Juan de Fuca; indeed, in a subsequent definition of the boundary, signed by the Secretary of State, the British Minister, and the British representative, the boundary line was said to be prolonged until 'it reaches the center of the fairway of the straits of San Juan de Fuca.' The fairway was the equivalent of the thalweg.\n Again, in fixing the boundary line of the Detroit river, under the 6th and 7th articles of the treaty of Ghent, the deep-water channel was adopted, giving Belle isle to the United States, as lying north of that channel. [8 Stat. at L. 221.]\n So in the Alaskan boundary case, the majority of the arbitration tribunal, made up of Baron Alverstone, Lord Chief Justice of England, Mr. Secretary Root, and Senators Lodge and Turner, held that the middle of the Portland channel was the proper boundary line, and included Wales island, to the north of which the channel passed. This sustained the American contention in regard to the thalweg and the island lying south of it.\n But counsel contend that the rule 'as to the flow of the midchannel or thalweg of the River Iberville (now known as Manchac) through the east, through Lakes Maurepas and Pontchartrain, expires by its own limitation when such midchannel reaches Lake Borgne, which, in contemplation of the rule, is the \n\n[202 U.S. 1, 52]\n\u00a0\n open sea, and part of the waters of the Gulf of Mexico.' This contention is inconsistent, as matter of fact, with the allegation of the cross bill that 'the Mississippi sound was recognized as a body of water 6 leagues wide, wholly within the state of Mississippi, from Lake Borgne to the Alabama line, separate and distinct from the Gulf of Mexico,' and with Mississippi's Exhibit Map A, presenting her claim, while the record shows that the strip of water, part of Lake Borgne and Mississippi sound, is not an open sea, but a very shallow arm of the sea, having outside of the deep- water channel an considerable depth.\n The maritime belt is that part of the sea which, in contradistinction to the open sea, is under the sway of the riparian states, which can exclusively reserve the fishery within their respective maritime belts for their own citizens, whether fish, or pearls, or amber, or other products of the sea. See Manchester v. Massachusetts, \n139 U.S. 240\n, 35 L. ed. 159, 11 Sup.Ct.Rep. 559; McCready v. Virginia, \n94 U.S. 391\n, 24 L. ed. 248.\n In Manchester v. Massachusetts, the court said: 'We think it must be regarded as established that, as between nations, the minimum limit of the territorial jurisdiction of a nation over tide waters is a marine league from its coast; that bays wholly within its territory, not exceeding 2 marine leagues in width at the mouth, are within this limit; and that included in this territorial jurisdiction is the right of control over fisheries, whether the fish be migratory, freeswimming fish, or free- moving fish, or fish attached to or embedded in the soil. The open sea within this limit is, of course, subject to the common right of navigation; and all governments, for the purpose of selfprotection in time of war or for the prevention of frauds on its revenue, exercise an authority beyond this limit.'\n Questions as to the breadth of the maritime belt or the extent of the sway of the riparian states require no special consideration here. The facts render such discussion unnecessary.\n Islands formed by alluvion were held by Lord Stowell, in respect of certain mud islands at the mouth of the Mississippi, \n\n[202 U.S. 1, 53]\n\u00a0\n to be 'natural appendages of the coast on which they border, and from which, indeed, they are formed.' The Anna (1805) 5 C. Rob. 373.\n As to these particular waters, the observations of Mr. Hall, 4th ed. p. 129, are in point: 'Off the coast of Florida, among the Bahamas, along the shores of Cuba, and in the Pacific, are to be found groups of numerous islands and islets rising out of vast banks, which are covered with very shoal water, and either form a line more or less parallel with land or compose systems of their own, in both cases inclosing considerable sheets of water, which are sometimes also shoal and sometimes relatively deep. The entrance to these interior bays or lagoons may be wide in breadth of surface water, but it is narrow in navigable water.'\n He then states the specific case of the Archipi elago de los Canarios on the coast of Cuba, and says: 'In cases of this sort the question whether the interior waters are, or are not, lakes inclosed within the territory, must always depend upon the banks, and the width of the entrances. Each must be judged upon its own merits. But in the instance cited, there can be little doubt that the whole Archipie elago de los Canarios is a mere salt water lake, and that the boundary of the land of Cuba runs along the exterior edge of the bank.'\n In such circumstances as exist in the present case, we perceive no reason for declining to apply the rule to the thalweg in determining the boundary.\n\n 4. \nMoreover, it appears from the record that the various departments of the United States government have recognized Louisiana's ownership of the disputed area; that Louisiana has always asserted it; and that Mississippi has repeatedly recognized it, and not until recently has disputed it.\n The question is one of boundary, and this court has many times hled that, as between the states of the Union, long acquiescence in the assertion of a particular boundary and the exercise of dominion and sovereignty over the territory within it should be accepted as conclusive, whatever the international \n\n[202 U.S. 1, 54]\n\u00a0\n rule might be in respect of the acquisition by prescription of large tracts of country claimed by both. Virginia v. Tennessee, \n148 U.S. 503\n, 37 L. ed. 537, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 728; Indiana v. Kentucky, \n136 U.S. 479\n, 34 L. ed. 329, 10 Sup.Ct.Rep. 1051; Missouri v. Kentucky, 11 Wall. 395, 20 L. ed. 116; Rhode Island v. Massachusetts, 4 How. 591, 11 L. ed. 116.\n The Louisiana enabling act of February 20, 1811, provided that all the waste and unappropriated lands in said state should be and remain the property of the United States government. In the disputed area of to-day are included lands and waters located in various townships, all of which are enumerated in the southeastern land district of Louisiana, east of the Mississippi river. The lands in these townships were surveyed by the government about the year 1842, all of them as being in and forming a part of the state of Louisiana. By the swamp land grants of 1849 and 1850, the United States granted to certain states the swamp and overflowed lands within their respective limits, in order that these lands might be reclaimed, protected from overflow, and brought into use. Louisiana made application to the United States for the approval to her of these lands as being part of her territory and situated within her limits. They all lay south of the deepwater channel and were all approved to the state of Louisiana May 6, 1852. They were then offered by the state through the register therefor as a department of the many sales of them were made from time to time to individuals, and patents issued therefor in various years from 1853 to 1894. In 1892, in furtherance of the better protection of the lands of the parishes of St. Bernard and Plaquemines from overflow, the legislature of Louisiana adopted an act which created a Lake Borgne basin levee commission, and provided a board of commissioners therefor, as a department of the state government, and the register of the state land office was authorized to transfer all of the unsold lands to the board, which was done in April, 1895. The board was authorized by law to sell these lands, and also to levy taxes to be used in establishing a protective levee system in the district. The board made sales of a considerable number of acres \n\n[202 U.S. 1, 55]\n\u00a0\n to different individuals from September 16, 1898, to March 7, 1902. Isle a Pitre was composed of certain enumerated sections of township 10, south of range 20 east, and these lands were approved to Louisiana by the Commissioner of the General Land Office of the United States May 6, 1852, as forming part of that state, and they were subsequently patented, sold, and conveyed to various individuals, the chain of title extending from 1852,-a period of over fifty years. The lands forming Isle a Pitre have been paying taxes to the state of Louisiana for years. Political and police control and jurisdiction by the parish of St. Bernard officials were exercised over the disputed area, and many instances are given of police control and jurisdiction by Louisiana officials over this general territory. This territory consisted, as heretofore stated, of what was known as the Louisiana marshes, and it is admitted that they have immemorially been known by that name, though some of the witnesses for Mississippi said that they were also known as Grand marshes; admitting, however, that they were quite as frequently called the Louisiana marshes.\n Some other matters may properly be referred to as showing the general understanding of and acquiescence in the boundary asserted by Louisiana.\n In January, 1901, the Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey was applied to by a member of the house of representatives from Mississippi for information in regard to the boundary line between Louisiana and Mississippi in the present disputed area, and Hodgkins, an assistant in the department, a well-known expert in such matters, made a report January 30, 1901, which, after considering the subject in all its phases, showed that the correct boundary between the two states in the locality is the deep-water sailing channel line contended for by Louisiana.\n The United States Geological Survey published in the year 1900 a bulletin devoted to a discussion of the boundaries of the states and territories, and giving a history of changes as they may have occurred. The third edition was published in \n\n[202 U.S. 1, 56]\n\u00a0\n 1904. Gannett's Boundaries, 58th Congress, 2d Session, H. R. Doc. 678.\n In the opinion of that Bureau, Louisiana was originally bounded by the deep-water channel, and is the owner of the area in dispute to-day, according to the report and the accompanying sketches.\n In 1897, Louisiana requested the United States Commission of Fish and Fisheries to make an investigation and report upon certain technical matters in connection with the oyster industry of that state, which investigation was made in February, 1898, by the United States Fish Commission steamer Fish Hawk. A map was made of the area investigated in St. Bernard parish, and that map is given in the opening statement as Diagram No. 4. Louisiana's ownership was clearly recognized.\n The General Land Office of the United States began, as early as 1842, a detailed survey of the land forming the disputed area, of which township plats appear in the record. The survey gave the location of Marsh island, Half Moon or Grand Island, an unnamed island, Petit Pass island, and Isle a Pitre, and the sections and townships comprised in these islands. They were all designated as being in the southeastern land district of Louisiana, east of the Mississippi river.\n When, as we have said, Louisiana, in the year 1852, selected these and other lands within her state limits as inuring to her under the swamp land grants, the General Land Office, on May, 6, 1852, recognized the correctness of the claim to the lands and approved and patented them to her as a state. Mississippi also applied for the land inuring to her under the provisions of those grants, and received her swamp lands, but the state never selected and never had approved to her, as is shown by the books of the state land office of Mississippi, any of the lands in the disputed area of today; but it appeared that the state did have in her land office books a record of the lands forming St. Joseph's island, which lay immediately north of the deep-water channel, and did not extend south of that channel. \n\n[202 U.S. 1, 57]\n\u00a0\n The General Land Office of the United States, in all of the maps it has caused to be made of Louisiana and Mississippi, has been consistent in its recognition of the ownership by Louisiana of the disputed area. See maps of Louisiana, 1879, 1886, 1887, 1896; and of Mississippi in 1890.\n As before stated, in 1839 an engineer and surveyor made a report and sketch of the coast of Mississippi, under the authority of that state. This showed the territory lying south of the deep-water channel in outline to be a peninsular formation. The report referred to Horn, Petit Bois, Cat, and Ship islands as belonging to Mississippi, all of which are east of the disputed territory; and the territory southwest of the deep-water channel, or South pass, was described as the Louisiana marshes. The official maps of Mississippi recognized Louisiana's ownership of the disputed territory. The state map of October 26, 1866, which was approved by Governor Humphrey and also by Governor Alcorn, did this; and other maps, as the official map of Mississippi, published under an act of the legislature of that state on March 8, 1882; Rand McNally's section map of Mississippi, compiled from the records of the office of the surveyor general of the board of immigration and agriculture, Jackson, Mississippi; and the railroad commissioners' map of Mississippi gave like recognition. The only exception seems to be a map of the railroad commission, issued in 1904, two years after this suit was instituted, wherein, on the 18-mile theory, Mississippi for the first time cartographically extended her claims into the St. Bernard, Louisiana, peninsula.\n The record contains much evidence of the exercise by Louisiana of jurisdiction over the territory in dispute, and of the general recognition of it by Mississippi as belonging to Louisiana. Apparently Louisiana had exercised complete dominion over it from 1812 with the acquiescence of Mississippi, unless the fact that the latter made a general reference to islands within 6 leagues of her shore in her Code of 1880 indicated otherwise. But the evidence fails to satisfy us that she attempted any physical possession or control until after 1900. The few in- \n\n[202 U.S. 1, 58]\n\u00a0\n stances referred to as showing that Mississippi asserted rights in the disputed area are of little weight and require no discussion.\n Our conclusion is that complainant is entitled to the relief sought.\n Decree accordingly. \n\n\n\n","150":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF MISSOURI v. STATE OF ILLINOIS(1906)\nNo. 13\nArgued: Decided: May 28, 1906\n\n\n\n Mr. Erasmus C. Lindley for the sanitary district of Chicago.\n Messrs. Herbert S. Hadley, Charles W. Bates, and Sam B. Jeffries for Missouri.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a motion for the allowance and taxation of costs in the case reported in \n200 U.S. 496\n, 50 L. ed. --, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 268. The costs asked are as follows:\n $5,650 paid to the special commissioner.\n $3,776.37 for taking down and transcribing the cestimony of defentant's witnesses, etc. \n\n[202 U.S. 598, 599]\n\u00a0\n $720 Solicitors' fees, viz., $20 for attendance at final hearing and $2.50 for each deposition taken and admitted in evidence, in accordance with Rev. Stat.  824, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901. p. 632.\n $10,146.37, total.\n The plaintiff objected to the allowance, and the clerk referred the matter to this court.\n The only question of detail concerns the last item. The main objection is to the allowance of any costs at all. The power of the court to allow costs is not disputed. Pennsylvania v. Wheeling & B. Bridge Co. 18 How. 460, 15 L. ed. 449. The former decree in this case allowed them, and, in the stipulation for the appointment of a special commissioner, the parties agreed that the costs should be 'taxed by the court on the final disposal of the case, to be paid in such manner as the court may, at that time, determine.' But it is said that it is inconsistent with the dignity of a sovereign state to ask for costs; that, in boundary cases, costs have been divided, and that the suit was not for a pecuniary interest, but only the performance of the duty of a sovereign to its citizens, for which no costs should be imposed.\n So far as the dignity of the state is concerned, that is its own affair. The United States has not been above taking costs. United States v. Sanborn, \n135 U.S. 271\n, 34 L. ed. 112, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 812. As to the supposed rule in boundary cases, it is not absolute. But, in many cases of that kind, both parties are equally interested to have the boundary settled, and, whichever state begins the suit, both equally are actors. Thus counter relief was asked by the defendants in Nebraska v. Iowa, \n143 U.S. 359\n, 36 L. ed. 186, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 396, and Missouri v. Iowa, \n160 U.S. 688\n, 40 L. ed. 583, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 433. As to the nature of this suit, the plaintiff alleged serious pecuniary damage to itself by the deposit of great quantities of filth upon the portion of the bed of the Mississippi alleged to belong to it, and, in short, framed its bill like any ordinary bill by a private person to restrain a nuisance. The chief difference was in the size of the nuisance alleged. There is no indication that the defendants desired or needed the determination of this court, as states well might when \n\n[202 U.S. 598, 600]\n\u00a0\n their jurisdiction was in doubt. So far as this point is concerned, there is no reason why the plaintiff should not suffer the usual consequence of failure to establish its case.\n The only item specially discussed is the charge of $2.50 for each witness examined before the examiner, on the footing of 'depositions' mentioned in Rev. Stat.  824. There seems to have been some difference of opinion in the lower courts as to whether testimony given before an examiner could be treated as a deposition. See Strauss v. Meyer, 22 Fed. 467; 1 Foster, Fed. Pr. 3d ed. 727,  330. In favor of so treating it are Ferguson v. Dent, 46 Fed. 88; Hake v. Brown, 44 Fed. 734; Ingham v. Pierce, 37 Fed. 647; The Sallie P. Linderman, 22 Fed. 557; Stimpson v. Brooks, 3 Blatchf. 456, Fed. Cas. No. 13,454. See also St. Matthew's Sav. Bank v. Fidelity & C. Co. 105 Fed. 161, 162, 163. The words of the statute are broad enough to embrace the testimony, unless they are taken very strictly, and the trouble to the parties in having to visit different places was similar to that caused by the taking of depositions adverted to by Judge Treat in Strauss v. Meyer. The case is quite distinct from that of testimony taken in court and reduced to writing by a reporter. We are of opinion that the item may be allowed.\n Motion for costs allowed. \n\n\n\n","151":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF MISSOURI v. STATE OF ILLINOIS(1906)\n\nArgued: Decided: February 19, 1906\n\n\n\n\n[200 U.S. 496, 497]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Sam B. Jeffries, Charles W. Bates, Herbert S. Hadley, N. T. Gentry, and W. F. Woerner for complainant.\n\n\n\n[200 U.S. 496, 510]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. H. J. Hamlin and W. H. Stead for the state of Illinois.\n Messrs. James Todd and John G. Drennan for sanitary district of Chicago.\n\n\n[200 U.S. 496, 517]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a suit brought by the state of Missouri to restrain the discharge of the sewage of Chicago through an artificial channel into the Desplaines river, in the state of Illinois. That river empties into the Illinois river, and the latter empties into the Mississippi at a point about 43 miles above the city of St. Louis. It was alleged in the bill that the result of the threatened discharge would be to send 1,500 tons of poisonous filth daily into the Mississippi, to deposit great quantities of the same upon the part of the bed of the lastnamed river belonging to the plaintiff, and so to poison the water of that river, upon which various of the plaintiff's cities, towns, and inhabitants depended, as to make it unfit for drinking, agricultural, or manufacturing purposes. It was alleged that the defendant sanitary district was acting in pursuance of a statute of the state of Illinois, and as an agency of that state. The case is stated at length in \n180 U.S. 208\n, 45 L. ed. 497, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 331, where a demurrer to the bill was overruled. A supplemental bill alleges that since the filing of the original bill the drainage canal has been opened and put into operation, and has produced and is producing all the evils which were apprehended when the injunction first was asked. The answers deny the plaintiff's case, allege that the new plan sends the water of the Illinois river into the Mississippi much purer than it was before, that many towns and cities of the plaintiff along the Missouri and Mississippi discharge their sewage into those rivers, and that if there is any trouble the plaintiff must look nearer home for the cause.\n The decision upon the demurrer discussed mainly the jurisdiction of the court, and, as leave to answer was given when the demurrer was overruled, naturally there was no very precise consideration of the principles of law to be applied if the plaintiff should prove its case. That was left to the future, \n\n[200 U.S. 496, 518]\n\u00a0\n with the general intimation that the nuisance must be made out upon determinate and satisfactory evidence, that it must not be doubtful, and that the danger must be shown to be real and immediate. The nuisance set forth in the bill was one which would be of international importance,-a visible change of a great river from a pure stream into a polluted and poisoned ditch. The only question presented was whether, as between the states of of the Union, this court was competent to deal with a situation which, if it arose between independent sovereignties, might lead to war. Whatever differences of opinion there might be upon matters of detail, the jurisdiction and authority of this court to deal with such a case as that is not open to doubt. But the evidence now is in, the actual facts have required for their establishment the most ingenious experiments, and for their interpretation the most subtle speculations, of modern science, and therefore it becomes necessary at the present stage to consider somewhat more nicely than heretofore how the evidence in it is to be approached.\n The first question to be answered was put in the well known case of the Wheeling bridge. Pennsylvania v. Wheeling & B. Bridge Co. 13 How. 518, 14 L. ed. 249. In that case, also, there was a bill brought by a state to restrain a public nuisance,-the erection of a bridge alleged to obstruct navigation,-and a supplemental bill to abate it after it was erected. The question was put most explicitly by the dissenting judges, but it was accepted by all as fundamental. The Chief Justice observed that if the bridge was a nuisance, it was an offense against the sovereignty whose laws had been violated, and he asked what sovereignty that was. 13 How. 561, 14 L. ed. 267; Daniel, J., 13 How. 599, 14 L. ed. 283. See also Kansas v. Colorado, \n185 U.S. 125\n, 46 L. ed. 838, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 552. It could not be Virginia, because that state had purported to authorize it by statute. The Chief Justice found no prohibition by the United States. 13 How. 508, 14 L. ed. 275. No third source of law was suggested by anyone. The majority accepted the Chief Justice's postulate, and found an answer in what Congress had done.\n It hardly was disputed that Congress could deal with the \n\n[200 U.S. 496, 519]\n\u00a0\n matter under its power to regulate commerce. The majority observed that although Congress had not declared in terms that a state should not obstruct the navigation of the Ohio by bridges, yet it had regulated navigation upon that river in various ways, and had sanctioned the compact between Virginia and Kentucky when Kentucky was let into the Union. By that compact the use and navigation of the Ohio, so far as the territory of either state lay thereon, was to be free and common to the citizens of the United States. The compact, by the sanction of Congress, had become a law of the Union. A state law which violated it was unconstitutional. Obstructing the navigation of the river was said to violate it, and it was added that more was not necessary to give a civil remedy for an injury done by the obstruction. 13 How. 565, 566, 14 L. ed. 268, 269. At a later stage of the case, after Congress had authorized the bridge, it was stated again in so many words that the ground of the former decision was that 'the act of the legislature of Virginia afforded no authority or justification. It was in conflict with the acts of Congress, which were the paramount law.' 18 How. 421, 429, 15 L. ed. 435, 436.\n In the case at bar, whether Congress could act or not, there is no suggestion that it has forbidden the action of Illinois. The only ground on which that state's conduct can be called in question is one which must be implied from the words of the Constitution. The Constitution extends the judicial power of the United States to controversies between two or more states, and between a state and citizens of another state, and gives this court original jurisdiction in cases in which a state shall be a party. Therefore, if one state raises a controversy with another, this court must determine whether there is any principle of law, and, if any, what, on which the plaintiff can recover. But the fact that this court must decide does not mean, of course, that it takes the place of a legislature. Some principles it must have power to declare. For instance, when a dispute arises about boundaries, this court must determine the line; and, in doing so, must be governed by rules explicitly \n\n[200 U.S. 496, 520]\n\u00a0\n or implicitly recognized. Rhode Island v. Massachusetts, 12 Pet. 657, 737, 9 L. ed. 1233, 1265. It must follow and apply those rules, even if legislation of one or both of the states seems to stand in the way. But the words of the Constitution would be a narrow ground upon which to construct and apply to the relations between states the same system of municipal law in all its details which would be applied between individuals. If we suppose a case which did not fall within the power of Congress to regulate, the result of a declaration of rights by this court would be the establishment of a rule which would be irrevocable by any power except that of this court to reverse its own decision, an amendment of the Constitution, or possibly an agreement between the States, sanctioned by the legislature of the United States.\n The difficulties in the way of establishing such a system of law might not be insuperable, but they would be great and new. Take the question of prescription in a case like the present. The reasons on which prescription for a public nuisance is denied or may be granted to an individual as against the sovereign power to which he is subject have no application to an independent state. See 1 Oppenheim, International Law. 293,  242, 243. It would be contradicting a fundamental principle of human nature to allow no effect to the lapse of time, however long (Davis v. Mills, \n194 \nU.S. 451, 457\n, 48 S. L. ed. 1067, 1071, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 692), yet the fixing of a definite time usually belongs to the legislature rather than the courts. The courts did fix a time in the rule against perpetuities, but the usual course, as in the instances of statutes of limitation, the duration of patents, the age of majority, etc., is to depend upon the lawmaking power.\n It is decided that a case such as is made by the bill may be a ground for relief. The purpose of the foregoing observations is not to lay a foundation for departing from that decision, but simply to illustrate the great and serious caution with which it is necessary to approach the question whether a case is proved. It may be imagined that a nuisance might be created by a state upon a navigable river like the Danube, which would \n\n[200 U.S. 496, 521]\n\u00a0\n amount to a casus belli for a state lower down, unless removed. If such a nuisance were created by a state upon the Mississippi, the controversy would be resolved by the more peaceful means of a suit in this court. But it does not follow that every matter which would warrant a resort to equity by one citizen against another in the same jurisdiction equally would warrant an interference by this court with the action of a state. It hardly can be that we should be justified in declaring statutes ordaining such action void in every instance where the circuit court might intervene in a private suit, upon no other ground than analogy to some selected system of municipal law, and the fact that we have jurisdiction over controversies between states.\n The nearest analogy would be found in those cases in which an easement has been declared in favor of land in one state over land in another. But there the right is recognized on the assumption of a concurrence between the two states, the one, so to speak, offering the right, the other permitting it to be accepted. Mannville Co. v. Worcester, 138 Mass. 89, 52 Am. Rep. 261. But when the state itself is concerned, and by its legislation expressly repudiates the right set up, an entirely different question is presented.\n Before this court ought to intervene, the case should be of serious magnitude, clearly and fully proved, and the principle to be applied should be one which the court is prepared deliberately to maintain against all considerations on the other side. See Kansas v. Colorado, \n185 U.S. 125\n, 46 L. ed. 838, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 552.\n As to the principle to be laid down, the caution necessary is manifest. It is a question of the first magnitude whether the destiny of the great rivers is to be the sewers of the cities along their banks or to be protected against everything which threatens their purity. To decide the whole matter at one blow by an irrevocable fiat would be at least premature. If we are to judge by what the plaintiff itself permits, the discharge of sewage into the Mississippi by cities and towns is to be expected. We believe that the practice of discharging into the river is \n\n[200 U.S. 496, 522]\n\u00a0\n general along its banks, except where the levees of Louisiana have led to a different course. The argument for the plaintiff asserts it to be proper within certain limits. These are facts to be considered. Even in cases between individuals, some consideration is given to the practical course of events. In the black country of England parties would not be expected to stand upon extreme rights. St. Helen's Smelting Co. v. Tipping, 11 H. L. Cas. 642. See Boston Ferrule Co. v. hills, 159 Mass. 147, 150, 20 L. R. A. 844, 34 N. E. 85. Where, as here, the plaintiff has sovereign powers, and deliberately permits discharges similar to those of which it complains, it not only offers a standard to which the defendant has the right to appeal, but, as some of those discharges are above the intake of St. Louis, it warrants the defendant in demanding the strictest proof that the plaintiff's own conduct does not produce the result, or at least so conduce to it, that courts should not be curious to apportion the blame.\n We have studied the plaintiff's statement of the facts in detail, and have perused the evidence, but it is unnecessary for the purposes of decision to do more than give the general result in a very simple way. At the outset we cannot but be struck by the consideration that if this suit had been brought fifty years ago it almost necessarily would have failed. There is no pretense that there is a nuisance of the simple kind that was known to the older common law. There is nothing which can be detected by the unassisted senses,-no visible increase of filth, no new smell. On the contrary, it is proved that the great volume of pure water from Lake Michigan, which is mixed with the sewage at the start, has improved the Illinois river in these respects to a noticeable extent. Formerly it was sluggish and ill smelling. Now it is a comparatively clear stream to which edible fish have returned. Its water is drunk by the fishermen, It is said without evil results. The plaintiff's case depends upon an inference of the unseen. It draws the inference from two propositions. First, that typhoid fever has increased considerably since the change, and that other expla- \n\n[200 U.S. 496, 523]\n\u00a0\n nations have been disproved; and second, that the bacillus of typhoid can and does survive the journey and reach the intake of St. Louis in the Mississippi.\n We assume the now-prevailing scientific explanation of typhoid fever to be correct. But when we go beyond that assumption, everything is involved in doubt. The data upon which an increase in the deaths from typhoid fever in St. Louis is alleged are disputed. The elimination of other causes is denied. The experts differ as to the time and distance within which a stream would purify itself. No case of an epidemic caused by infection at so remote a source is brought forward and the cases which are produced are controverted. The plaintiff obviously must be cautious upon this point, for, if this suit should succeed, many others would follow, and it not improbably would find itself a defendant to a bill by one or more of the states lower down upon the Mississippi. The distance which the sewage has to travel (357 miles) is not open to debate, but the time of transit, to be inferred from experiments with floats, is estimated as varying from eight to eighteen and a half days, with forty-eight hours more from intake to distribution, and when corrected by observations of bacteria is greatly prolonged by the defendants. The experiments of the defendant's experts lead them to the opinion that a typhoid bacillus could not survive the journey, while those on the other side maintain that it might live and keep its power for twenty-five days or more, and arrive at St. Louis. Upon the question at issue, whether the new discharge from Chicago hurts St. Louis, there is a categorical contradiction between the experts on the two sides.\n The Chicago drainage canal was opened on January 17, 1900. The deaths from typhoid fever in St. Louis, before and after that date, are stated somewhat differently in different places. We give them mainly from the plaintiff's brief: 1890, 140; 1891, 165; 1892, 441; 1893, 215; 1894, 171; 1895, 106; 1896, 106; 1897, 125; 1898, 95; 1899, 131; 1900, 154; 1901, 181; 1902, 216; 1903, 281. It is argued for the defendant that the num- \n\n[200 U.S. 496, 524]\n\u00a0\n bers for the later years have been enlarged by carrying over cases which in earlier years would have been put into a miscellaneous column ( intermittent, remittent, typho-malaria, etc., etc.), but we assume that the increase is real. Nevertheless, comparing the last four years with the earlier ones, it is obvious that the ground for a specific inference is very narrow, if we stopped at this point. The plaintiff argues that the increase must be due to Chicago, since there is nothing corresponding to it in the watersheds of the Missouri or Mississippi. On the other hand, the defendant points out that there has been no such enhanced rate of typhoid on the banks of the Illinois as would have been found if the opening of the drainage canal were the true cause.\n Both sides agree that the detection of the typhoid bacillus in the water is not to be expected. But the plaintiff relies upon proof that such bacilli are discharged into the Chicago sewage in considerable quantities; that the number of bacilli in the water of the Illinois is much increased, including the bacillus coli communis, which is admitted to be an index of contamination, and that the chemical analyses lead to the same inference. To prove that the typhoid bacillus could make the journey an experiment was tried with the bacillus prodigiosus, which seems to have been unknown, or nearly unknown, in these waters. After preliminary trials, in which these bacilli emptied into the Mississippi near the mouth of the Illinois were found near the St. Louis intake and in St. Louis in times varying from three days to a month, one hundred and seven barrels of the same, said to contain one thousand million bacilli to the cubic centimeter, were put into the drainage canal near the starting point on November 6, and on December 4 an example was found at the St. Louis intake tower. Four others were found on the three following days, two at the tower and two at the mouth of the Illinois. As this bacillus is asserted to have about the same length of life in sunlight in living waters as the bacillus typhosus, although it is a little more hardy, the experiment is thought to prove one element of the plaintiff's case, although \n\n[200 U.S. 496, 525]\n\u00a0\n the very small number found in many samples of water is thought by the other side to indicate that practically no typhoid germs would get through. It seems to be conceded that the purification of the Illinois by the large dilution from Lake Michigan (nine parts or more in ten) would increase the danger, as it now generally is believed that the bacteria of decay, the saprophytes, which flourish in stagnant pools, destroy the pathogenic germs. Of course, the addition of so much water to the Illinois also increases its speed.\n On the other hand, the defendant's evidence shows a reduction in the chemical and bacterial accompaniments of pollution in a given quantity of water, which would be natural in view of the mixture of nine parts to one from Lake Michigan. It affirms that the Illinois is better or no worse at its mouth than it was before, and makes it at least uncertain how much of the present pollution is due to Chicago and how much to sources further down, not complained of in the bill. It contends that if any bacilli should get through, they would be scattered and enfeebled and would do no harm. The defendant also sets against the experiment with the bacillus prodigiosus a no less striking experiment with typhoid germs suspended in the Illinois river in permeable sacs. According to this the duration of the life of these germs has been much exaggerated, and in that water would not be more than three or four days. It is suggested, by way of criticism that the germs may not have been of normal strength, that the conditions were less favorable than if they had floated down in a comparatively unchanging body of water, and that the germs may have escaped; but the experiment raises at least a serious doubt. Further, it hardly is denied that there is no parallelism in detail between the increase and decrease of typhoid fever in Chicago and St. Louis. The defendant's experts maintain that the water of the Missouri is worse than that of the Illinois, while it contributes a much larger portion to the intake. The evidence is very strong that it is necessary for St. Louis to take preventive measures, by filtration or otherwise, against the dangers of the \n\n[200 U.S. 496, 526]\n\u00a0\n plaintiff's own creation or from other sources than Illinois. What will protect against one will protect against another. The presence of causes of infection from the plaintiff's action makes the case weaker in principle as well as harder to prove than one in which all came from a single source.\n Some stress was laid on the proposition that Chicago is not on the natural watershed of the Mississippi, because of a rise of a few feet between the Desplaines and the Chicago rivers. We perceive no reason for distinction on this ground. The natural features relied upon are of the smallest. And if, under any circumstances, they could affect the case, it is enough to say that Illinois brought Chicago into the Mississippi watershed in pursuance, not only of its own statutes, but also of the acts of Congress of March 30, 1822 (chap. 14, 3 Stat. at L. 659), and March 2, 1827 (chap. 51, 4 Stat. at L. 234), the validity of which is not disputed. Wisconsin v. Duluth, \n96 U.S. 379\n, 24 L. ed. 668. Of course these acts do not grant the right to discharge sewage, but the case stands no differently in point of law from a suit because of the discharge from Peoria into the Illinois, or from any other or all the other cities on the banks of that stream.\n We might go more into detail, but we believe that we have said enough to explain our point of view and our opinion of the evidence as it stands. What the future may develop, of course we cannot tell. But our conclusion upon the present evidence is that the case proved falls so far below the allegations of the bill that it is not brought within the principles heretofore established in the cause.\n Bill dismissed without prejudice. \n\n\n\n","152":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF NEW JERSEY v.

[30 Stat. at L. 563, chap. 541, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3447.] The claim is set forth as follows:\n Tax-1902 $5,750 00 Interest to October 15, 1903 891 25 Costs on injunction proceedings, because of nonpayment of taxes 26 15 Tax-1903 2,500 00 Interest to October 15, 1903 87 50 ___ $9,254 90\n The Cosmopolitan Power Company is a corporation organized under the laws of the state of New Jersey on April 30, 1900, for the purpose of dealing in engines, machines, etc. By its charter it had power to do business in any state or territory of the United States. While it had its principal office in the state of New Jersey, located under the terms of its certificate of incorporation, it had no property in that state, and conducted its business in the state of Illinois.\n The capital stock of the corporation on January 1, 1902, was forty millions of dollars, of which there was ten millions \n\n[203 U.S. 483, 485]\n\u00a0\n outstanding. On May 13, 1902, its capital stock, pursuant to the laws of New Jersey, was reduced to $2,500,000. The company was adjudicated a bankrupt on April 23, 1903, upon an involuntary petition filed in the district court for the northern district of Illinois.\n On November 7, 1902, the state board of assessors of New Jersey, the company having failed to make return, levied an assessment for the license or franchise tax in question for the year 1902 in the sum of $5,750.00. On June 1, 1903, there was assessed against the company for the year beginning January 1, 1903, a similar tax on outstanding capital stock in the sum of $2,500.00, in accordance with the return of the company filed on May 1, 1903\n\n\n On February 12, 1904, the state of New Jersey filed its motion before the referee for the payment of said taxes as a preferential debt. The referee disallowed the 1903 tax altogether, and allowed the 1902 tax as a general claim against the estate for the sum of $4,949.08. This reduction was made from the assessment for the year 1902, because the state board had made the assessment upon the basis of $40,000,000 of outstanding capital stock, whereas, in fact, only $10,000,000 was then issued and outstanding, upon which basis the referee made the allowance. The district court affirmed the order of the referee. Upon appeal to the circuit court of appeals that court modified the judgment of the district court so as to allow the taxes claimed for the year 1903, as a general debt, and in other respects affirmed the district court. 70 C.

Silber and Horace Kent Tenney for appellee.\n\n\n[203 U.S. 483, 487]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n The provisions of the bankrupt law governing the payment of taxes are found in  64a, act of 1898 (30 Stat. at L. 563, chap. 541, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3447), which reads:\n'Sec. 64a. The court shall order the trustee to pay all taxes legally due and owing by the bankrupt to the United \n\n[203 U.S. 483, 488]\n\u00a0\n States, state, county, district, or municipality, in advance of the payment of dividends to creditors, and, upon filing the receipts of the proper public officers for such payment, he shall be credited with the amount thereof, and in case any question arises as to the amount or legality of any such tax, the same shall be heard and determined by the court.'\n\n The statute of the state of New Jersey (Gen. Stat. 1895,  251, 252, 257, 258, 260) by its title undertakes to provide for the imposition of state taxes upon certain corporations, and for the collection thereof. It requires the corporation to make return to the state board of assessors on or before the first Tuesday in May of each year, and to pay an annual license fee or franchise tax of a certain per cent on its capital stock issued and outstanding on January 1 of each year, up to and including $3, 000,000; a different per cent on sums in excess of $3,000,000, and not exceeding $5,000,000, and on outstanding capital stock exceeding $5,000, 000, $50 per million or any part thereof. In case the corporation shall fail to make return the state board shall ascertain and fix the amount of the annual license fee or franchise tax, and shall report to the comptroller on or before the first Monday in June the basis and amount of the tax as returned by each company to, or ascertained by, the board, which shall then become due and payable, and it shall be the duty of the state treasurer to receive the same. If the tax remains unpaid on July 1st after the same becomes due it shall thenceforth bear interest at the rate of 1 per cent per month. That the tax shall be a debt due from the company to the state, for which it may maintain an action at law for recovery thereof, after the same shall have been in arrears for the period of one month, and the tax shall be a preferred debt in cases of insolvency, and in cases of arrears for three months the state may apply for an injunction to restrain the company from exercising its corporate franchise; and that if any corporation shall be delinquent for two years its charter shall be void, unless further time to given for the payment of taxes. \n\n[203 U.S. 483, 489]\n\u00a0\n It is contended for the appellee that these provisions do not entitle the state to the payment of its claim as a preferred tax within the meaning of the bankrupt act. It is insisted, in the first place, that a proper construction of the act of 1898 does not require the payment of taxes to a state wherein the bankrupt has no property, and the state no means of collecting the tax from property within its jurisdiction. And it is urged that the taxes to be paid are those legally due and owing to the United States, state, county, district, or municipality, which does not contemplate payment to any and all states, but only to THE state, which, it is insisted, should be interpreted with the limitation stated.\n It is to be noted that there is a very significant difference in this respect, in the act of 1898, from the provisions of the bankrupt act of 1867 (14 Stat. at L. 530, chap. 176), the law in force last before, and doubtless in the view of Congress when the present law was drafted. That act of 1867 gave priority of payment to all debts due to the United States, and all taxes and assessments under the laws thereof, all debts due to the state in which the proceedings in bankruptcy were pending, and all taxes and assessments made under the laws of such state, and provided that nothing contained in the act should interfere with the assessment and collection of taxes by the authority of the United States or any state.\n The requirement of the present law is a wide departure from the act of 1867, and specifically obliges the trustee to pay all taxes legally due and owing, without distinction between the United States and the state, county, district, or municipality.\n An argument is made as to the alleged injustice of this requirement, in that it may take away from the local creditors in the state where the property of the corporation is situated practically all the assets of the corporation in favor of the state where the corporation is organized, but has no business or property. And it is urged that to permit a state, under such circumstances, to have a preference in the payment of \n\n[203 U.S. 483, 490]\n\u00a0\n taxes, would give to it an advantage which it could not otherwise obtain for want of charge or lien upon the property. But considerations of this character, however properly addressed to the legislative branch of the government, can have no place in influencing judicial determination. It is the province of the court to enforce, not to make, the laws, and, if the law works inequality, the redress, if any, must be had from Congress.\n The question is, Is the claim a tax legally due and owing to the state of New Jersey? We have been cited to many cases in the state of New Jersey, some of which, it is alleged, maintain the theory of the appellant that this is a tax, and some the contrary view.\n Without undertaking to analyze these numerous cases or to harmonize the views expressed by different judges, we think the weight of judicial decision in that state favors the view that this is a tax imposed upon the right of the corporation to continue to be a corporation, with power to exercise its corporate franchises, based upon the amount of its capital stock issued and outstanding.\n In Hancock v. Singer Mfg. Co. 62 N. J. L. 289, 42 L.R.A. 852, 41 Atl. 846, it was said:\n'The act of 1884 (Pamph. L. p. 232) is entitled 'An Act to Provide for the Imposition of State Taxes upon Certain Corporations and for the Collection Thereof.'\n\n'In this act this imposition is called a yearly license fee or tax.\n\n'In a supplement passed to the act of 1884 (Pamph. L. 1891, p. 150) it is styled 'a tax.'\n\n'In a further supplement, passed in 1892 (Pamph. L. p. 136), it is called 'an annual license fee or franchise tax.'\n\n'It is wholly immaterial what name may be given to it. The fact that it is called a 'license fee' or 'franchise tax' cannot validate it. It is levied under an act passed 'to authorize the imposition of state taxes,' and it is none the less an interdicted imposition [having reference to the charter \n\n[203 U.S. 483, 491]\n\u00a0\n then being considered], and none the less a tax because it is given a new name.\n\n'Although under our adjudications, it is not a tax on property in a sense which brings it within article 4,  7, paragraph 12, of our state constitution, it is a tax on the capital stock of the corporation. Otherwise the act would be manifestly void for want of a title expressing its object, and the state would be deprived of all its revenue under the act of 1892. The franchise of the company is the right to hold property and exercise its corporate privileges. The Supreme Court of the United States has decided that where a corporation is exempted from taxation, it is not subject to a tax on its franchise. Wilmington & W. R. Co. v. Reid, 13 Wall. 264, 20 L. ed. 568.'\n\n While we take this view of the decisions of the supreme court of New Jersey, and reach the conclusion that the claim in question is for a tax within the meaning of the law as construed by that court, the bankruptcy act is a Federal statute, the ultimate interpretation of which is in the Federal courts. It is doubtless true, as was said in the opinion of the learned judge speaking for the circuit court of appeals, in this case, that if the highest court of the state should decide that a given statute imposed no tax within the meaning of the law as interpreted by it, a Federal court, in passing upon the bankruptcy act, would not compel the state to accept a preference from the bankrupt's estate upon a different view of the law. Conceding the doctrine that the meaning of a statute is a state question, except where rights, the subject of adjudication by the Federal courts, have accrued before its construction by the state court, or the question of contract within the protection of the Federal Constitution is involved, still a state court, while entitled to great consideration, cannot conclusively decide that to be a tax within the meaning of a Federal law providing for the payment of taxes, which is not so in fact. The section (64a) itself declares that, in case of disputes as to the amount or legality of any such tax, they \n\n[203 U.S. 483, 492]\n\u00a0\n shall be heard and determined by the court. The state court may construe a statute and define its meaning, but whether its construction creates a tax within the meaning of a Federal statute, giving a preference to taxes, is a Federal question, of ultimate decision in this court.\n We are of opinion that this claim was for a tax. The language of the act, as we have said, is very broad, and includes all taxes. It is not necessary to enter upon a discussion of the different forms which taxes may take. Generally speaking, a tax is a pecuniary burden laid upon individuals or property for the purpose of supporting the government. We think this exaction is of that character. It is required to be paid by the corporation after organization in invitum. The amount is fixed by the statute, to be paid on the outstanding capital stock of the corporation each year, and capable of being enforced by action against the will of the taxpayer. As was said by Mr. Justice Field, speaking for the court in [ Meriwether v. Garrett] \n102 U.S. 472\n, 26 L. ed. 197.\n'Taxes are not debts. It was so held by this court in the case of Lane County v. Oregon, 7 Wall, 71, 19 L. ed. 101. Debts are obligations for the payment of money founded upon contract, express or implied. Taxes are imposts levied for the support of the government, or for some special purpose authorized by it. The consent of the taxpayer is not necessary to their enforcement. They operate in invitum. Nor is their nature affected by the fact that in some states-and we believe in Tennessee-an action of debt may be instituted for their recovery. The form of procedure cannot change their character.'\n\n It is urged by the appellee, and upon this ground the case was decided in the circuit court of appeals, that this is in no just sense a tax levied by the state, but is the result of a contract by which the corporation was brought into existence, the consideration being the payment of annual sums for the privileges given it by the state, for which no lien is given upon the property, but only a right of action for their recovery. \n\n[203 U.S. 483, 493]\n\u00a0\n But this imposition is in no just sense a contract. The amount to be paid, fixed by the statute, is subject to control and change at the will of the state. It is imposed upon all corporations, whether organized before or after the passage of the act. The corporation is not consulted in fixing the amount of the tax, and under the laws of New Jersey the charter of such corporations as this may be amended or repealed. Hancock v. Singer Mfg. Co. 62 N. J. L. 289-328, 42 L.R.A. 852, 41 Atl. 846.\n The form of the collection of taxes is left to the discretion of the taxing power; sometimes a lien is provided, sometimes a summary method of collection is awarded; in other cases, an action for debt is given; and, as in the present case, with the right of prohibition of the exercise of corporate franchises by injunction for failure to pay.\n We think, then, that, as denominated in the statute, this was a tax imposed by the state upon the corporation for the privilege of existence and the continued right to exercise its franchise.\n The state which created this corporation had the right to fix the terms of its existence, and to provide, if it saw fit so to do, that, for the continued existence of its franchise, the corporation should pay certain sums to the state, fixed by the amount of its yearly outstanding capital stock. New York ex rel. Metropolitan Street R. Co. v. New York State Tax Comrs. \n199 U.S. 1\n-37, 50 L. ed. 65-75, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 705, et seq.\n Coming to the specific objections to the claim for the year 1902, the claim was presented upon the basis of $40,000,000 of outstanding capital stock, when in fact there was only $10,000,000 of such stock, the assessment by the state board being upon the former sum, and made upon the failure of the corporation to report. But we do not think the finding of the state board is conclusive. The tax is to be assessed upon capital stock actually outstanding. It may well be doubted whether the board had power to tax any other stock. But be that as it may,  64a specifically provides that in case any question arises as to the amount or legality of taxes, the same shall be heard and determined by the court, with a view to ascer- \n\n[203 U.S. 483, 494]\n\u00a0\n taining the amount really due. We do not think it was the intention of Congress to conclude the bankruptcy courts by the findings of boards of this character, and that the claim should have been upon the basis of the capital stock actually outstanding.\n The amount claimed for the year 1903, it is insisted, had not accrued at the time of the adjudication in bankruptcy, which was on April 23, 1903, the return being made on May 2, 1903, and the assessment was not made until July 1, 1903; but the annual return, required to be made to the board on or before the first Tuesday in May, is upon the basis of the capital stock issued and outstanding the first of January preceding the making of the return. The bankrupt act requires the payment of all taxes legally due and owing. We think the tax thus assessed upon that basis was legally due and owing, although not collectible until after the adjudication.\n We reach the conclusion that, under the bankruptcy act, these taxes, in the amounts hereinbefore indicated, were entitled to preferential payment in favor of the state of New Jersey, and that the Circuit Court of Appeals erred in reaching a contrary conclusion.\n Its judgment will be reversed and the cause will be remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan (with whom concurred Mr. Chief Justice Fuller and Mr. Justice Peckham) dissenting:\n The Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Peckham, and myself dissent from the opinion of the court. In our judgment the 'taxes' owing by a bankrupt to a state-which  64a of the bankruptcy act [30 Stat. at L. 563, chap. 541, U. S. Comp. Stat. 2447] provides shall be paid in advance of the payment of dividends to creditors-do not embrace an 'annual license fee or franchise tax' (the words of the New Jersey statute), which, strictly, is not a property tax, but only an exaction by the state for the privilege given to a corporation \n\n[203 U.S. 483, 495]\n\u00a0\n to do certain business under its charter. We think the bankruptcy act should be so construed. It cannot be otherwise construed without doing gross injustice to those creditors of the bankrupt corporation who have business transactions with it at its place of business. Here the bankrupt corporation did no business in New Jersey. So far as appears, it did not have, nor expect to have, any connection with that state except to become incorporated under its laws. It had its seat of operations and all its tangible property in the state of Illinois. It had no property in New Jersey. Its scheme was to get a charter from New Jersey and then go to another state for purposes of its business. We do not think that Congress intended that, in the distribution of the assets of a bankrupt, preference should be given to the claims of a state which have their origin in, and are wholly based upon, a bargain with the state whereby certain privileges are granted in exchange for certain payments,-privileges which the state may grant or withhold at pleasure. In our opinion the word 'taxes' in the bankruptcy act was intended to embrace only burdens or charges imposed in invitum, and which were in their nature and in reality 'taxes,' as distinguished from governmental exactions for privileges granted. The claim of New Jersey, whatever its true amount, should not be given priority, but should be placed upon the same footing with claims of other creditors. This view is consistent with the act of Congress. \n\n\n\n","153":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF OREGON v. HITCHCOCK(1906)\nNo. 16\nArgued: Decided: April 23, 1906\n\n\n\n\n[202 U.S. 60, 61]\n\u00a0\n By leave of court the state of Oregon filed an original bill against Ethan A. Hitchcock, Secretary of the Interior, and William A. Richards, Commissioner of the General Land Office, to restrain the defendants from allotting or patenting to any Indians or other persons certain lands within the limits of the Klamath reservation, which it is alleged were, on March 12, 1860, swamp and overflowed lands, and praying a decree establishing the title of the state of Oregon to such lands, and declaring that the title is subject only to such right of temporary and terminable occupation as may exist in the Indians at present occupying the said reservation, and is not to be defeated by any allotment, patent, agreement, or other arrangement. To this bill the defendants filed a demurrer, partly on jurisdictional grounds and partly on the merits.\n For a clear understanding of the questions presented the allegations in the bill must be stated. It is alleged that the defendant Hitchcock is a citizen of the state of Missouri, the defendant Richards of the state of Wyoming; that by an act of Congress approved February 14, 1859 (11 Stat. at L. 383, chap. 33), Oregon was admitted into the Union; that by an act approved September 28, 1850 (9 Stat. at L. 519, chap. 84), Congress granted to the state of Arkansas and other states all lands within their respective limits, which, at the date of the act, were 'swamp and overflowed lands,' and by reason thereof unfit for cultivation; that by an act of March 12, 1860 (12 Stat. at L. 3, chap. 5), the provisions of the last-named act were extended to the state of Oregon; that on February 14, 1859, as well as on March 12, 1860, the United States owned in fee simple a large region and body of land lying within the boundaries of the state of Oregon, which said body of land was neither reserved nor dedicated to any public \n\n[202 U.S. 60, 62]\n\u00a0\n use, and was free from any claim of title or possession, saving and excepting a right to temporary use and occupation belonging to certain Indian tribes; that within this large body of lands were three tribes or bands of Indians,-the Klamaths, the Moadocs, and the Yahooskins,-few in number, that number being estimated by the officials of the United States in charge at from 1,200 to 1,500; that they were all in a savage state, uncivilized, without a fixed place of abode, and roaming from place to place within the region; that they had no other kind of tenure or title than that which they and their ancestors held from time immemorial and before the settlement of white men in the territory; that on October 14, 1864 (16 Stat. at L. 707), a treaty was negotiated between the United States and these tribes of Indians, by which they ceded to the United States their right, title, and claim to all these lands except a certain specified and smaller tract within the original outboundaries, which was created a reservation for their use; that said reservation was continued in the occupation of the Indians according to the aboriginal usages and customs of said Indians and of Indians generally, without any claim or pretense of permanent title or individual right to the lands, or any of them, and without any steps taken towards conferring the ultimate title upon them until after the year 1899, when the defendant Hitchcock, Secretary of the Interior, directed and caused a large portion of the lands to be surveyed and divided into numerous definite lots or tracts, for the purpose and with the intention of allotting such tracts to the individual members of the tribes, to be by them held in severalty, and the further purpose of issuing and delivering to each of them a patent declaring that the United States holds the tract allotted in trust for the Indian and his heirs for a period of twenty-five years and that at the expiration of such period it will convey the tract to him or his heirs, discharged of the trust, and free from all encumbrances; that in this the defendant Hitchcock was assuming and professing to act under the authority of the act of Congress of February 8, 1887 (24 Stat. at L. 388, chap. 119); that within the reservation made by the \n\n[202 U.S. 60, 63]\n\u00a0\n treaty of 1864 were large tracts, which had been and were on March 12, 1860, swamp and overflowed lands and unfit for cultivation, and hence, under the act of March 12, 1860, had become the property of the state, subject only to the right of occupancy on the part of the Indians; that in the year 1902, before any patents were issued, and while the surveying and allotting were in progress, the state caused an examination to be made for the purpose of ascertaining the tracts which, on March 12, 1860, were swamp and overflowed lands, and a list prepared of them, which list is attached to the bill as an exhibit; that it presented and filed that list with the surveyor general of the United States for the state of Oregon, together with evidence tending to prove that all of the tracts within the list had been and were, on March 12, 1860, swamp and overflowed lands, and rendered thereby unfit for cultivation, which evidence was found and certified by the surveyor general to be sufficient. That thereupon the state selected and claimed said tracts as granted to it by the act of Congress of March 12, 1860, and applied to the proper officers of the United States to inquire into and consider the claims of the state; that this application and the evidence were submitted to the defendant Richards, as Commissioner of the General Land Office, and on November 18, 1903, the Acting Commissioner denied and rejected the claim upon the sole ground that the lands, whether swamp and overflowed or not, were not granted to the state of Oregon by the act of Congress. From this decision an appeal was taken to the Secretary of the Interior, and the decision of the Land Office affirmed.\n Charles A. Keigwin, William B. Matthews, and Andrew M. Crawford for complainant.\n\n\n[202 U.S. 60, 66]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. A. C. Campbell, F. W. Clements, and F. L. Campbell for defendants.\n\n\n\n[202 U.S. 60, 68]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n The question of jurisdiction of course precedes any inquiry into the merits. By  2 of art. 3 of the Constitution and Rev. Stat.  687, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 565, this court has original jurisdiction of a suit brought by a state against citizens of other states. Pennsylvania v. Quicksilver Min. Co. 10 Wall. 553, 19 L. ed. 998; Wisconsin v. Pelican Ins. Co. \n127 \nU.S. 265, 287\n, 32 S. L. ed. 239, 242, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1370, and cases cited in the opinion; California v. Southern P. Co. \n157 \nU.S. 229, 258\n, 39 S. L. ed. 683, 693, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 591; Minnesota v. Hitchcock, \n185 U.S. 373\n, 46 L. ed. 954, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 650. But the contention is that the United States is the real party in interest as defendant, that it cannot be sued without its consent, and that it has given no consent. While the nominal defendants are \n\n[202 U.S. 60, 69]\n\u00a0\n citizens of a state other than Oregon, yet they have no interest whatever in the controversy, and, if a decree be rendered against them in favor of the state, it will not affect their interests, but bind and determine the rights of the United States, the real, substantial defendant. It is further said that if there is any other interest adverse to the plaintiff it belongs to the Klamath Indians, who are not made parties, and that the rule in euqity is not to determine a suit without the presence of the parties really to be affected by the decree. California v. Southern P. Co. supra.\n The question of jurisdiction in a case very similar to this was fully considered in Minnesota v. Hitchcock, \n185 U.S. 373\n, 46 L. ed. 954, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 650. There, as here, a state was plaintiff, and the suit was brought against the Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of the General Land Office to restrain them from selling school sections 16 and 36 in what was known as the 'Red Lake Indian reservation.' This suit is brought by a state against the same officers, to restrain them from allotting and patenting in severalty swamp lands within the Klamath Indian reservation. In that case we said (p. 387, L. ed. p. 962, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 655):\n'Now, the legal title to these lands is in the United States. The officers named as defendants have no interest in the lands or the proceeds thereof. The United States is proposing to sell them. This suit seeks to restrain the United States from such sale,-to devest the government of its title, and vest it in the state. The United States is, therefore, the real party affected by the judgment, and against which, in fact, it will operate, and the officers have no pecuniary interest in the matter. If whether a suit is one against a state is to be determined, not be the fact of the party named as defendant on the record, but by the result of the judgment of decree which may be entered, the same rule must apply to the United States. The question whether the United States is a party to a controversy is not determined by the merely nominal party on the record, but by the question of the effect of the judgment or decree which can be entered.' \n\n[202 U.S. 60, 70]\n\u00a0\n It is true in that case we sustained the jurisdiction of this court, but we did so by virtue of the act of March 2, 1901 (31 Stat. at L. 950, chap. 808, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1384), which was held to be a consent on the part of the United States to be sued in respect to school lands within an Indian reservation, and an acceptance by the government of full responsibility for the result of the decision, so far as the Indians, its wards, were concerned. But neither of the two facts deemed essential to the maintenance of that suit appear in this. There is no act of Congress waiving immunity of the United States, or consenting that it be sued in respect to swamp lands, either within or without an Indian reservation, and there is no act of Congress assuming full responsibility in behalf of its wards, the Indians, for the result of any suit affecting their rights in these lands. It is unnecessary to repeat all that was said in that opinion in reference to these matters. It is sufficient to refer to it for a full discussion of the question.\n\n Again, it must be noticed that the legal title to all these tracts of land is still in the government. No patents or conveyances of any kind have been executed. There has been no finding or adjudication by the Land Department that the lands referred to were swamp or overflowed on March 12, 1860. Under those circumstances it is not a province of the courts to interfere with the Land Department in its administration. So far as a grant of swamp lands is claimed, it must be held that the grant is in process of administration, and, until the legal title passes from the government, inquiry as to equitable rights comes within the cognizance of the Land Department. Courts may not anticipate its action, or take upon themselves the administration of the land grants of the United States. New Orleans v. Paine, \n147 \nU.S. 261, 266\n, 37 S. L. ed. 162, 163, 13 Sup.

HITCHCOCK(1906)\nNo. 12\nArgued: February 21, 1906Decided: April 2, 1906\n\n\n\n The state of Wisconsin seeks by this suit to enjoin the defendant, as Secretary of the Interior, from interfering, in anywise, with its use, possession, or enjoyment of certain lands, embraced within the present La Pointe or Bad River and the Flambeau Indian reservations in that state. \n\n[201 U.S. 202, 203]\n\u00a0\n The state traces its title back to the act of Congress of August 6th, 1846, authorizing the people of Wisconsin territory to form a state constitution, and providing for the admission of such state into the Union. 9 Stat. at L. 56, chap. 89.\n The defendant, Hitchcock, as Secretary of the Interior, demurred to the bill upon the ground, among others, that it did not appear that the state was entitled to the relief asked.\n The general question is whether the state has such interest, present or prospective, in the lands in dispute, as to preclude their being administered by the Secretary of the Interior for the benefit of certain Indians.\n The case, as presented by the record and by official documents of which judicial notice may be taken, is as follows:\n On the 23d day of March, 1843, by a treaty between the United States and the Chippewa Indians of 'the Mississippi and Lake Superior,' the latter ceded to the United States all the country embraced within a specified boundary, including the lands here in controversy. The second and third articles of that treaty provided: 'Art. 2. The Indians stipulate for the right of hunting on the ceded territory, with the other usual privileges of occupancy, until required to remove by the President of the United States, and that the laws of the United States shall be continued in force, in respect to their trade and intercourse with the whites, until otherwise ordered by Congress. Art. 3. It is agreed by the parties to this treaty that whenever the Indians shall be required to remove from the ceded district, all the unceded lands belonging to the Indians of Fond du Lac, Sandy Lake, and Mississippi bands shall be the common property and home of all the Indians party to this treaty.' [7 State. at L. 592] In consideration of the above cession the United States (art. 4) engaged to pay the Indians annually for twenty-five years certain sums; and this consideration for the ceded lands was paid by the United States. Revision of Indian Treaties, 217.\n By an act of Congress approved August 6th, 1846, the people of the then territory of Wisconsin were authorized to form a consti- \n\n[201 U.S. 202, 204]\n\u00a0\n tution and state government for the purpose of being admitted into the Union on an equal footing with the original states in all respects whatsoever, with certain specified boundaries. The 7th section of that act was as follows: 'That the following propositions are hereby submitted to the convention which shall assemble for the purpose of forming a constitution for the state of Wisconsin, for acceptance or rejection; and if accepted by said convention, and ratified by an article in said constitution, they shall be obligatory on the United States: First. That section numbered sixteen, in every township of the public lands in said state, and, where such section has been sold or otherwise disposed of, other lands equivalent thereto, and as contiguous as may be, shall be granted to said state for the use of schools. . . .' 9 Stat. at L. 57, chap. 89.\n The conditions prescribed by the enabling act of 1846 were duly accepted by Wisconsin, and that territory was admitted into the Union as a state by an act of Congress approved May 29th, 1848. 2 Charters and Constitutions, 2029; 9 Stat. at L. 233, chap. 50.\n By a treaty made and concluded September 30th, 1854, between the United States and the Chippewa Indians of Lake Superior and the Mississippi, and which treaty was proclaimed January 29th, 1855 (10 Stat. at L. 1109), the Chippewas of Lake Superior ceded to the United States the lands theretofore owned by them in common with the Chippewas of the Mississippi within the present boundary of Minnesota and lying east of a certain boundary. The Chippewas of the Mississippi assented to that cession and agreed that the whole amount of the consideration money for the country ceded as above should be paid to the Chippewas of Lake Superior, the latter relinquishing to the Chippewas of the Mississippi all their interest in and claims to the lands theretofore owned by them in common, lying west of the above boundary line.\n The lands described in the first article of the treaty of 1854 are within the present state of Minnesota, and constitute no part of the land embraced in the treaty of 1843\n\n\n By the second article of that treaty the United States agreed, \n\n[201 U.S. 202, 205]\n\u00a0\n among other things, to set apart and withhold from sale certain lands for the use of the La Pointe band and such other Indians as might settle with them. For the other Wisconsin bands, a tract of land was to be set apart and withheld from sale, 'lying about Lac du Flambeau, and another tract on Lac Court Oreilles, each equal in extent to three townships, the boundaries of which shall be hereafter agreed upon or fixed under the direction of the President.' The lands described in that article of the treaty of 1854 to be set apart and withheld from sale 'for the La Pointe band' and 'for the other Wisconsin bands' were part of the lands ceded to the United States by the treaty of 1843.\n The third article of the treaty was in these words: 'Article 3. The United States will define the boundaries of these reserved tracts, whenever it may be necessary, by actual survey, and the President may, from time to time, at his discretion, cause the whole to be surveyed, and may assign to each head of a family or single person over twenty-one years of age eighty acres of land for his or their separate use; and he may at his discretion, as fast as the occupants become capable of transacting their own affairs, issue patent therefor to such occupants, with such restrictions of the power of alienation as he may see fit to impose. And he may also, at his discretion, make rules and regulations respecting the disposition of the lands in case of the death of the head of a family or single person occupying the same, or in case of its abandonment by them. And he may also assign other lands in exchange for mineral lands, if any such are found in the tracts herein set apart. And he may also make such changes in the boundaries of such reserved tracts or otherwise as shall be necessary to prevent interference with any vested rights. All necessary roads, highways, and railroads, the lines of which may run through any of the reserved tracts, shall have the right of way through the same, compensation being made therefor as in other cases.'\n The bill alleges: 'That under the enabling act of Congress \n\n[201 U.S. 202, 206]\n\u00a0\n aforesaid, and under the state Constitution, and under and in view of the cession of their lands by said Chippewa Indians, contained in said treaty of 1843, all of the lands surveyed and to be surveyed as sections 16 of the various townships within the territory covered by said treaty vested in the state of Wisconsin, and said state of Wisconsin has at all times heretofore, since its admission to the Union, claimed a right to the fee of all lands in sections 16 in the several townships within said reservations, and, since the sectional survey thereof by the United States, has claimed the actual fee in said sections, and has exercised dominion and ownership over the same, and has issued sundry and divers patents to divers persons and corporations for portions thereof, sundry of which persons and corporations, grantees of the state as aforesaid, have also exercised acts of ownership thereof, and have paid taxes and made improvements thereon, and have cut and hauled timber therefrom until forbidden by orders of the defendant, Ethan Allen Hitchcock, as Secretary of the Interior of the United States, as hereinafter more particularly mentioned; that patents for all of said sections 16 within said La Pointe reservation have heretofore been issued by said state to divers parties, and patents upon about fourteen forties of said sections 16 within said Lac du Flambeau reservation have been issued by said state to divers parties, and there still remain about twenty-nine forties in said sections 16 within said Lac du Flambeau reservation, the title to which is still in and claimed by said state. That under the treaty of 1854, aforesaid, and in carrying out its provisions, the said Secretary of the Interior has proceeded, through the United States Indian Department, to allot from time to time to the various members of said tribes of La Pointe bands of Indians and to various members of the Wisconsin bands on said Lac du Flambeau reservation 80 acres per capita of lands within said reservations, and has caused patents therefor to be issued to the members of said tribes as individuals, and such members have become full citizens of the United States, and have terminated their tribal relations, and have ceased to \n\n[201 U.S. 202, 207]\n\u00a0\n occupy any material part of said reservation in common. That the lands within said reservation, exclusive of the lands in section 16, are sufficient to secure 80 acres to each individual Indian who has hitherto appeared and claimed a right to an allotment. That no allotment has hitherto been allowed to any member of said tribes of Indians of any land embraced within any of said sections 16. That beginning about the year 1899, and from thence hitherto, the defendant, Ethan Allen Hitchcock, as Secretary of the Interior, and the Commissioner of the Indian Office of the United States, and divers agents and servants under them, have set up on behalf of said La Pointe and other bands of Indians, or the members thereof, a claim of interest or title in and to sections 16 aforesaid in the reservation townships aforesaid, paramount and adverse to the title of the state of Wisconsin, and have claimed and continue to claim that said sections 16 are still held by the United States in trust for said Indians to the same extent as other lands in said reserved townships, and have forbidden purchasers of such lands holding patents from the state to enter or make improvements or cut any timber thereon, and have thereby cast a cloud upon the title of the state and its grantees to said lands, and have interfered with, and are continuing to interfere with, the use and enjoyment of the same by the owners thereof. . . . That by chap. 95 of the laws of the state of Wisconsin for the year 1903, approved April 20th, 1903, the attorney general of the state of Wisconsin was duly authorized to institute proceedings in this court under the provisions of the act of Congress passed March 2d, 1901 [31 Stat. at L. 950, chap. 808, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1384], and hereinbefore referred to, to determine the rights of said state to what are commonly known as school lands, within any reservation or Indian cession within said state, where any Indian tribe claims any right to or interest in said lands, or to the disposition thereof by the United States, and particularly to determine the title to the lands embraced within sections 16 in the several townships constituting the present Bad River or La Pointe and the Flambeau Indian reservations within said state.' \n\n[201 U.S. 202, 208]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. T. W. Spence and L. M. Sturtevant for complainant.\n\n\n\n[201 U.S. 202, 209]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. A. C. Campbell and Frank L. Campbell for defendant.\n\n\n\n[201 U.S. 202, 211]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan delivered the opinion of the court:\n The state contends that the effect of the treaty of 1843 was \n\n[201 U.S. 202, 212]\n\u00a0\n that the Chippewa Indians released to the United States all of their claim of title or interest in or to the lands therein described and each and every part thereof, and ceded the same to the United States, which thereupon became the absolute owner thereof free from any claim of said Indians; and that the state, upon its acceptance of the conditions prescribed by the enabling act of 1846, and its admission into the Union, became vested with an absolute right in and to all the sections 16 within said territory previously surveyed, as well as to the lands subsequently surveyed by the United States, with the right in the state to have the temporary possession or occupancy of the Indians terminated by the United States.\n The determination of the question suggested by this contention and the decision of this case is controlled by United States v. Thomas, \n151 U.S. 577\n, 38 L. ed. 276, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 426. That case involved the rights of the state of Wisconsin in and over certain lands in the Lac Court Oreilles reservation, as established for the benefit of the Chippewa Indians. Thomas, an Indian of the Chippewa tribe, was indicted for the murder of another Indian of the same tribe, committed within the limits of that reservation. The evidence showed that the offense was committed upon section 16, a township embraced in the reservation. The accused contended that, by the provisions of the enabling act by which Wisconsin was admitted into the Union, section 16 in every township in that state was ceded to it for school purposes, and could not be subsequently taken by the United States as part of an Indian reservation. It appeared that previous to the alleged murder, namely, in 1859, the section upon which the crime was committed had been settled, platted, and set apart by the United States as a part and parcel of said reservation, and was continuously thereafter occupied by the Indians as such, although claimed and sold by the state as and for a part of the school land ceded to it by the act of Congress. By act of Congress, approved March 3d, 1885, chap. 341, 23 Stat. at L. 362, 385, it was provided that Indians committing certain crimes, among them murder, 'against the person or property of another Indian or \n\n[201 U.S. 202, 213]\n\u00a0\n other person within the boundaries of any state of the United States, and within the limits of any Indian reservation, shall be subject to the same laws, tried in the same courts, and in the same manner, and subject to the same penalties, as are all other persons committing any of the above crimes within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States.' So the question was distinctly presented as to the relative rights of the state and the Indians in said section 16 within the Indian reservation on which the alleged murder was committed.\n This court said: 'The Indians have never been removed from the lands thus ceded [meaning by the treaty of 1842] and no Executive order has ever been made for their removal, and no change has taken place in their occupancy of the lands, except as provided by the treaty of September 30, 1854 (10 Stat. at L. 1109). By that treaty the Chippewas ceded a large portion of their territory, previously retained in Wisconsin and elsewhere, and provision was made in consideration thereof for the formation of permanent reservations for their benefit, each to embrace three full townships, and their boundaries to be established under the direction of the President. One of these included the tract comprised in the Lac Court Oreilles reservation. In the provision for these reservations nothing was said of the sixteenth section of any townships, and it is clear that it was not contemplated that any section should be left out of any one of them. The land reserved was to be, as near as possible, in a compact form, except so far as the meandering lakes were concerned. When the townships composing these reservations were surveyed, the sixteenth section was already disposed of in the sense of the enabling act of 1846. It had been included within the limits of the reservations. As it will be seen by the treaty of 1842, ratified in 1843, which was previous to the enabling act, the Indians stipulated for the right of occupancy to the lands. That right of occupancy gave them the enjoyment of the lands until they were required to surrender it by the President of the United States, which requirement was never made. Whatever right the state of Wisconsin acquired \n\n[201 U.S. 202, 214]\n\u00a0\n by the enabling act to the sixteenth section was subordinate to this right of occupancy for which the Indians stipulated. . . . The general rule established by the Land Department in reference to the school lands in the different states is that the title to them vests in the several states in which the land is situated, subject to any prior right of occupation by the Indians or others which the government had stipulated to recognize.'\n Again: 'We therefore are of opinion that, by virtue of the treaty of 1842, in the absence of any proof that the Chippewa Indians have surrendered their right of occupancy, the right still remains with them, that the title and right which the state may claim ultimately to the sixteenth section of every township for the use of schools is subordinate to this right of occupancy of the Indians, which has, so far as the court is informed, never been released to any of their lands, except as it may be inferred from the provisions of the treaty of 1854. That treaty provided for permanent reservations, which included the section in question. The treaty did not operate to defeat the prior right of occupancy to that particular section, but, by including it in the new reservations, made as a condition of the cession of large tracts of land in Wisconsin, continued it in force. The state of Wisconsin, therefore, had no such control over that section or right to it as would prevent its being set apart by the United States, with the consent of the Indians, as a part of their permanent reservation. So, by authority of their original right of occupancy, as well as by the fact that the section is included within the tract set aside as a portion of the permanent reservation in consideration of the cession of lands, the title never vested in the state, except as subordinate to that right of occupation of the Indians.' United States v. Thomas, \n151 \nU.S. 577, 582\n, 584 S., 38 L. ed. 276, 278, 279, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 426, 428, 429.\n It is true that the Thomas Case did not have reference to the particular Indian reservations involved in the present suit,-the Bad River or La Pointe and Flambeau reservations,-but only to the Lac Court Oreilles Indian reservation. But all \n\n[201 U.S. 202, 215]\n\u00a0\n three reservations, had their origin alike in the same treaties,-that of 1842, proclaimed in 1843, and that of 1854; and the effect of those treaties was considered in that case in connection with the enabling act of 1846, under which the state now claims, as it claimed in that case, absolute title to, and full control over, all the sections 16 named in that act. What the court said in the Thomas Case, as to the rights of Indians in virtue of their occupancy of the lands set apart for their use in the Lac Court Oreilles reservation, is strictly applicable to the rights of the Indians who have occupied, and, so far as appears, still occupy, the Bad River or La Pointe and Flambeau reservations. We could not sustain the claim of the state in the present suit without overruling the principles announced in the Thomas Case; and that we are not disposed to do. The principles of the Thomas Case were recognized and enforced in Minnesota v. Hitchcock, \n185 \nU.S. 373, 391\n, 46 S. L. ed. 954, 964, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 650, 657, et seq., which related to an act of Congress for the admission of Minnesota into the Union, and which act contained a provision similar to the one found in the enabling act for Wisconsin, namely, that certain sections 'in every township of public lands in said state, and where either of said sections or any part thereof has been sold or otherwise been disposed of, other lands, equivalent thereto and as contiguous as may be, shall be granted to said state for the use of schools.'\n Without repeating all that was said in previous decisions, we hold, on the authority of those decisions, that the state is not entitled to the relief asked nor to any order that would interfere, at this time, with the administration by the Interior Department, of the lands in question for the benefit of the Indians for whom the Bad River or La Pointe reservation and the Flambeau reservation were established. Consequently, the bill must be dismissed.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","155":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTRICKLEY v. HIGHLAND BOY GOLD MINING CO(1906)\nNo. 172\nArgued: Decided: February 19, 1906\n\n\n\n Messrs. Arthur Brown and Frank Hoffman for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n[200 U.S. 527, 528]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George Sutherland, Waldemar Van Cott, and E. M. Allison, Jr., for defendant in error.\n in error.\n\n\n\n\n[200 U.S. 527, 529]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a proceeding begun by the defendant in error, a mining corporation, to condemn a right of way for an a erial bucket line across a placer mining claim of the plaintiffs in error. The mining corporation owns mines high up in Bingham canyon, in West mountain mining district, Salt Lake county, Utah, and is using the line or way to carry ores, etc., for itself and others from the mines, in suspended buckets, down to the railway station, 2 miles distant, and 1,200 feet below. Before building the way it made diligent inquiry, but could not discover the owner of the placer claim \n\n[200 U.S. 527, 530]\n\u00a0\n in question, Strickley standing by without objecting or making known his rights while the company put up its structure. The trial court found the facts and made an order of condemnation. This order recites that the mining company has paid into court the value of the right of way, as found, and costs, describes the right of way by metes and bounds, and specifies that the same is to be used for the erection of certain towers to support the cables of the line, with a right to drive along the way when necessary for repairs, the mining company to move the towers as often as reasonably required by the owners of the claim for using and working the said claim. The foregoing final order was affirmed by the supreme court of the state. 28 Utah, 215, 78 Pac. 296. The case then was brought here.\n The plaintiffs in error set up in their answer to the condemnation proceedings that the right of way demanded is solely for private use, and that the taking of their land for that purpose is contrary to the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. The mining company, on the other hand, relies upon the statutes of Utah, which provide that 'the right of eminent domain may be exercised in behalf of the following public uses: . . . (6) Roads, railroads, tramways, tunnels, ditches, flumes, pipes, and dumping places to facilitate the milling, smelting, or other reduction of ores, or the working of mines.' [Utah, Rev. Stat. 1898,  3588.] In view of the decision of the state court we assume that the condemnation was authorized by the state laws, subject only to the question whether those laws, as construed, are consistent with the 14th Amendment. Some objections to this view were mentioned, but they are not open. If the statutes are constitutional as construed, we follow the construction of the state court. On the other hand, there is no ground for the suggestion that the claim by the plaintiffs in error of their rights under the 14th Amendment does not appear sufficiently on the record. The suggestion was not pressed.\n The single question, then, is the constitutionality of the \n\n[200 U.S. 527, 531]\n\u00a0\n Utah statute, and the particular facts of the case are material only as showing the length to which the statute is held to go. There is nothing to add with regard to them, unless it be the finding that the taking of the strip across the placer claim is necessary for the a erial line, and is consistent with the use of all of the claim by the plaintiffs in error for mining, except to the extent of the temporary interference over a limited space by four towers, each about 7 1\/2 feet square and removable, as stated above.\n The question, thus narrowed, is pretty nearly answered by the recent decision in Clark v. Nash, \n198 U.S. 361\n, 49 L. ed. 1085, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 676. That case established the constitutionality of the Utah statute, so far as it permitted the condemnation of land for the irrigation of other land belonging to a private person, in pursuance of the declared policy of the state. In discussing what constitutes a public use, it recognized the inadequacy of use by the general public as a universal test. While emphasizing the great caution necessary to be shown, it proved that there might be exceptional times and places in which the very foundations of public welfare could not be laid without requiring concessions from individuals to each other upon due compensation, which, under other circumstances, would be left wholly to voluntary consent. In such unusual cases there is nothing in the 14th Amendment which prevents a state from requiring such concessions. If the state Constitution restricts the legislature within narrower bounds, that is a local affair, and must be left where the state court leaves it in a case like the one at bar.\n In the opinion of the legislature and the supreme court of Utah the public welfare of that state demands that a rial lines between the mines upon its mountain sides and the railways in the valleys below should not be made impossible by the refusal of a private owner to sell the right to cross his land. The Constitution of the United States does not require us to say that they are wrong. If, as seems to be assumed in the brief for the defendant in error, the finding that the plaintiff \n\n[200 U.S. 527, 532]\n\u00a0\n is a carrier for itself and others means that the line is dedicated to carrying for whatever portion of the public may desire to use it, the foundation of the argument on the other side disappears.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","156":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSUCCESSION OF SERRALLES v. ESBRI(1906)\nNo. 65\nArgued: November 27, 1905Decided: January 2, 1906\n\n\n\nStatement by Mr. Justice Peckham:\n The appellee, plaintiff below, commenced this action, called a 'declaratory action of greater import' (Porto Rico Law Civ. Rpoc. arts. 480-482), to obtain payment of certain sums due on an indebtedness of the defendants (appellants), secured by mortgage, as stated in that instrument. She obtained judgment in her favor in the proper district court of Porto Rico, which was affirmed by the supreme court of the island, and the defendants have appealed from that judgment \n\n[200 U.S. 103, 104]\n\u00a0\n to this court. The sole question is whether the debt may be solved in American money at the rate of 60 cents thereof for each peso of indebtedness, or must $1 in American money be paid for each peso.\n The following are the facts: One Nicholas Cartagena y Mangual desired to sell the fractional part, owned by him, of a sugar plantation, known as 'Ursula,' situated in the municipal district of Juana Diaz, in the province of Porto Rico, such fractional part being 18 per cent of the value of the whole plantation, valued at 80,000 pesos. The purchaser, Juan Serralles, agreed to pay for such share 18,000 pesos. Accordingly a deed of purchase and mortgage was made between the parties on the 1st day of September, 1894. That instrument contained the statement that the sale was effected 'in consideration of the sum of 18,000 pesos, commercial money,' which shall be paid by the purchaser in instalments, viz., '2,000 pesos on the 15th day of July, of the year 1898; 2,000 pesos on the same day and month of the year 1899; an equal sum of 2,000 pesos on the 15th day of July, 1900, and 3,000 pesos on the 15th day of July, of the years of 1901 to the year 1904, both inclusive, all of which to be paid in the money current in the commerce, whatever may be the coinage of the money that as such is in circulation or is accepted in this province, at the rate of 100 centavos (cents) of the money in circulation for each peso, excluding all kinds of paper money in circulation or to be issued, even if its eirculation should be compulsory.'\n The instalments were to bear interest at the rate of 10 per cent per annum from the date of the deed, which interest was due and payable quarterly. The parties also declared 'that the price for which said sale is made is the just and true value at present of the share and interest hereby sold and conveyed,' they being 'fully aware that that is the value that shall serve as a basis in the public sale that shall be held if the obligation is not paid, and its payment should be demanded judicially.'\n A few days after the execution and delivery of this instrument \n\n[200 U.S. 103, 105]\n\u00a0\n it was discovered that Cartagena was not the owner of all of the one- eighteenth part of the plantation, because that interest was acquired during his marriage with his first wife, and was what is termed 'conjugal partnership property,' acquired for a valuable consideration during her life. When she died, her interest went to her children, and so the seller, Cartagena, owned the above-mentioned fractional part of the plantation, with those children. It therefore became necessary to make another deed and mortgage, conveying the interest of all the owners of the fractional part of the plantation including such children. This was accordingly done, and on the 6th of October, 1894, another instrument, in the nature of a deed and mortgage, was executed by the proper parties, in ratification and extension of the first instrument, and which contains substantially the same provisions as the first instrument, and the payments were to be made to the parties conveying the premises in the proportion in which they were interested in that property. These 18,000 pesos were to be paid by the purchaser, at the same times mentioned in the former instrument, 'in current commercial money, whatever the coinage may be of money which, with such character, be in circulation or accepted in this province, at the rate of 100 cents of the circulating medium for each peso, and to the exclusion of all paper money created or to be created, even though its circulation be compulsory.'\n On the 15th of September, 1900, a quarterly payment of interest became due under the terms of the mortgage, and the appellant proposed to pay it in American money then current, at an amount equivalent in value to the former provincial money, which was not then in circulation. This offer was refused. The appellee then commenced an action in a municipal court, to recover the interest due September 15, 1900, in American money, at the rate of $1 for each peso that was due. She obtained what is termed an 'executory judgment' for such payment, and that judgment (of the municipal court) was offirmed by the district court, and the appellant then paid the \n\n[200 U.S. 103, 106]\n\u00a0\n same. Upon quarterly instalments of interest due December 15, 1900, and March 15, 1901, the appellants made the same offer to pay in American money of equivalent value of the provincial money or peso, which was not then in circulation, and the offer was again refused, and this declaratory action of greater import was then commenced, to recover one American dollar for each peso of indebtedness due up to the date of the commencement of suit, and to obtain a declaration that the future payments should be made in the same manner. Before the commencement of this action, in 1901, the province had been ceded to the United States, which (prior to the cession) had occupied it by its troops in 1898. On the 12th day of April, 1900, Congress passed an act (31 Stat. at. L. 77, 80, chap. 191)  11 of which (reproduced in the margin) provided for retiring the Porto Rican coins and substituting American money therefor.\n In the pleading on the part of the plaintiff below the foregoing \n Sec. 11. 'That for the purpose of retiring the Porto Rican coins now in circulation in Porto Rico, and substituting therefor the coins of the United States, the Secretary of the Treasury is hereby authorized to redeem, on presentation in Porto Rico, all the silver coins of Porto Rico known as the peso, and all other silver and copper Porto Rican coins now in circulation in Porto Rice, not including any such coins that may be imported into Porto Rico after the first day of February, nineteen hundred, at the present established rate of sixty cents in the coins of the United States for one peso of Porto Rican coin, and for all minor and subsidiary coins the same rate of exchange shall be applied. The Porto Rican coins so purchased or redeemed shall be recoined at the expense of the United States, under the direction of the Secretary of the Treasury, into such coins of the United States now authorized by law as he may direct, and from and after three months after the date when this act shall take effect no coins shall be a legal tender, in payment of debts thereafter contracted, for any amount in Porto Rico, except those of the United States; and whatever sum may be required to carry out the provisions hereof, and to pay all expenses that may be incurred in connection therewith, is hereby appropriated, and the Secretary of the Treasury is hereby authorized to establish such regulations and employ such agencies as may be necessary to accomplish the purposes hereof: Provided, however, That all debts owing on the date when this act shall take effect shall be payable in the coins of Porto Rico now in circulation, or in the coins of the United States at the rate of exchange above named.' \n\n[200 U.S. 103, 107]\n\u00a0\n facts were averred, but no averment or contention was made that the so- called 'executory judgment' which plaintiff had theretofore obtained constituted res judicata as to the question now in issue.\n The defendants (appellants herein) put in an answer, setting up various facts unnecessary to be here adverted to.\n They also averred that under  11 of the act of Congress, above mentioned, they had the right to pay the instalments due on the mortgage, in American money at the established rate of 60 cents in the coin of the United States for one peso of Porto Rican coin.\n The trial court, in its judgment, after reciting the existence of the executory judgment in the action above-described and also all the proceedings in the case before it, decreed the payment of the interest or instalments which might then be due, or the thereafter to grow due, to the plaintiff, in United States coin at the rate of $1 thereof for each peso of indebtedness. Basing its decree wholly upon the literal language of the contract, the court said: 'It appears that Don Juan Serralles y Colon bound himself to make the payments to said Cartagena, by virtue of the said contract of sale, in money current in commerce, of whatever coinage it may be, at the rate of 100 cents of the current money for each peso; it is plain and evident that the heirs of said Serralles are bound to pay in dollars all the instalments arising from the same contract, or the interest on the same, for dollars are the money current at present in this island.'\n An appeal was taken by the defendants to the supreme court on the ground, among others, that the judgment of the district court violated articles 1281 and 1283 of the Civil Code. The articles are as follows:\n'Art. 1281. If the terms of a contract are clear and leave no doubt as to the intentions of the contracting parties, the literal sense of the stipulations shall be observed.\n\n'If the words should appear contrary to the evident intention of the contracting parties, the intention shall preyail.' \n\n[200 U.S. 103, 108]\n\u00a0\n 'Art. 1283. However general the terms of a contract may be, there should not be understood as included therein things and cases different from those with regard to which the persons interested intended to contract.'\n\n Further ground of appeal was the alleged violation of the 11th section of the act of Congress above mentioned, under which appellants claimed the right to pay in United States coin at the equivalent value of 60 cents for each peso.\n The supreme court, in due time, after argument, affirmed the judgment of the court below on the law, holding that the contract was clear, and its literal terms must be complied with. It did not, nor did the district court, hold the prior judgment to be res judicata.\n The court also denied the right claimed by the defendants under the above-mentioned act of Congress, to pay their indebtedness at the rate of 60 cents of American money for each peso of such indebtedness, on the ground that the act did not apply to such cases as the one before the court.\n Mr. James S. Harlan for appellants.\n No brief was filed for appellee.\n\n\n\n Mr. Justice Peckham, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The question arises herein whether this court has jurisdiction to hear the case, upon appeal or otherwise. The action is one to recover the interest due on an indebtedness from the appellants to the appellee on account of the purchase by the former of a certain interest in a plantation in Porto Rico, owned by the testator of appellee, which indebtedness was secured by a mortgage. This action is in its nature something like one to foreclose a mortgage. The question arising in the case is in regard to the kind of money in which the indebtedness of appellants (both that due at the time of the commencement of the \n\n[200 U.S. 103, 109]\n\u00a0\n action and that accruing thereafter) should be paid, the appellee asserting her right to be paid in American money at the rate of $1 for each peso of indebtedness, while the appellants, on the contrary, assert their right under  11 of the act of Congress of April 12, 1900, already mentioned, to pay the indebtedness in money or coins of the United States, at the rate of 60 cents in such coins for each peso of their indebtedness. This right was denied by the court below on the ground that there was a clear contract to pay as demanded by the appellee, and that the act of Congress had no application to the case. Judgment was accordingly given in favor of the appellee, that the appellants should pay to the appellee the indebtedness due or thereafter to grow due to her, at the rate of $1 in American money for each peso of their indebtedness. Appellants thus claimed a right under a statute of the United States, which was denied, and under  35 of the Foraker act (April 12, 1900) this court has jurisdiction to review the judgment. Crowley v. United States, \n194 U.S. 461\n, 48 L. ed. 1075, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 731; Rodriguez v. United States, \n198 U.S. 156\n, 49 L. ed. 994, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 617.\n The record also shows that a prior action had been commenced by appellee, in a municipal court of Porto Rico, between the same parties, to recover an instalment of interest due September 15, 1900, and that the same defense was there made in regard to the character of the money in which the debt should be paid. The municipal court in that case decided in favor of the appellee herein, and judgment to that effect having been duly entered, an appeal therefrom was taken to the district court, which affirmed the judgment, and the same was thereupon paid by the appellants herein. That judgment is not set up by the appellee as res judicata, and while it is recited in the judgments in this case both in the district and supreme courts as having been recovered, it is not held to be such by either of the courts, but in such judgments it is referred to as an 'executory judgment,' and by article 1477 of the Porto Rico 'Law of Civil Procedure' (page 299) it is provided that 'judgments rendered in executory actions shall not give rise \n\n[200 U.S. 103, 110]\n\u00a0\n to the exception of res judicata, the parties reserving their rights to institute the ordinary action on the same question.' As the courts below have treated and denominated the prior judgment in the municipal court as an 'executory judgment,' obtained in an executory action, the reason for not holding the judgment to be res judicata becomes apparent when the above article of the Code is considered.\n We come, then, to a consideration of the proper construction of the provisions in the two deeds, regarding the kind of money in which the debt is to be paid. They are set forth in the foregoing statement and are substantially alike, excepting that the first deed, that of September, 1894, in speaking of the coinage, says that the payment is to be made in money that is in circulation or is accepted in the province, at the rate of 100 centavos (cents) of the money in circulation for each peso, and in the amended deed of October 6, 1894, the translator of the original Spanish leaves out the word 'centavos,' and gives what he regards as its proper translation,-the word 'cents,'-so that the provision reads that the money is to be paid at the rate of 100 'cents' of the circulating medium for each peso. These two deeds represented the same transaction, and were drawn, of course, in the Spanish language. In the first deed the interest of the children of Cartagena was not referred to, because of the mistaken assumption that Cartagena had the whole title, and, upon discovering the mistake, the second deed was made, conveying his interest and the interest of his children, amounting to one-eighteenth of the whole value of the plantation, as conveyed by that deed to the same purchaser. The later deed was regarded by all parties as a mere rectification and ratification of the first deed, and it is quite clear that the word 'centavos,' contained in the first deed, was used in both, and that the word 'cents' is but a translation of the original Spanish word 'centavos,' which was used in this contract drawn in the Spanish language.\n This is in truth assumed to be correct by counsel in the court below, in his communication to that court in behalf of the present \n\n[200 U.S. 103, 111]\n\u00a0\n appellee (which forms part of the record herein), as he there uses the word 'cents,' and then follows it by the use of the word 'centavos.'\n It may be, therefore, stated as a fact that the original contract in the deeds provided for the payment in money current in the province at the rate of 100 centavos for each peso. There is no finding in so many words, as to the value of the peso mentioned in the contract. The Spanish word 'centavo' is said to be, in Spanish and in South American countries, a small copper or nickel coin, in value six-tenths of a cent (actual), and one cent (nominal); the one-hundredth of a peso. See Standard dictionary of the English language. The centavo being worth really six-tenths of a cent, and being the one-hundredth part of a peso, would, of course, make the peso worth 60 cents in American money.\n The 11th section of the act of Congress, already mentioned, provides for the redemption of all silver coins of Porto Rico known as the peso, and all other copper and Porto Rican coins in circulation in Porto Rico 'at the present established rate of 60 cents in the coins of the United States for one peso of Porto Rican coin, and for all minor and subsidiary coins the same rate of exchange shall be applied.' The Congress thus fixed the rate of exchange in the redemption of these coins, and it must be assumed to have been fixed at the value of the peso in American coin.\n From these facts it appears to us that there is no rational doubt that at the time when this contract was executed the peso in circulation in Porto Rico was worth not to exceed 60 cents, American money. At the time when the money was due under the contract, in September, 1900, it is admitted that all the pesos and centavos theretofore in circulation had been at that time redeemed by the United States, pursuant to the provisions of the act of Congress, and the money in circulation in Porto Rico was then and thereafter the money of the United States. This was the money current in commerce in Porto Rico and was in circulation and accepted therein as such money. It \n\n[200 U.S. 103, 112]\n\u00a0\n is now claimed by the appellee that, as the American money was the money of commerce, and was alone in circulation, she was entitled in September, 1900, under the provisions of the contract, to be paid 100 cents, or, in other words, $1 of that money for every peso of indebtedness owed by the appellants, either then due or thereafter to grow due. By calling the centavo a cent in American money, while worth but six-tenths of a cent, the claim is made that the contract really provided for the payment of 100 cents of American money for every peso of indebtedness. In other words, a centavo is made a cent, and it is said that the appellants promised to pay 100 cents per peso. This construction of the contract has been upheld by the courts below because, as it is said, the strict and plain letter of the contract calls for it, and the result is that the appellants are adjudged to pay over 60 per cent more than the value of the interest they purchased, and that much more than the value of the peso, and also that much more than the real amount of their debt. While it is true that the silver coinage of Porto Rico, known as the peso, and all other silver and copper coins which were in circulation on April 12, 1900, had been retired before September, 1900, and that the money then current in commerce in Porto Rico was American money, we do not, on that account, think that the appellee had the right to claim payment of $1 in American money for each peso of indebtedness. The centavo is not a cent. It is equal to but six- tenths of a cent, and the parties contracted, the one to pay and the other to receive, 100 centavos to the peso, not 100 cents to the peso. Although the translator seems to have assumed that the word 'cents' was the correct and accurate translation of the word 'centavos,' it must be remembered that the contract was in fact to pay centavos, and that the centavos were in fact, as we think is plainly shown in this record, worth only about six- tenths of a cent, and that while 100 centavos were worth one peso, 100 American cents were worth $1, or above 60 per cent more then the same number of centavos. It is \n\n[200 U.S. 103, 113]\n\u00a0\n entirely incredible that either party ever meant any such result as is now contended for by the appellee. Even if it were conceded that the liberal and strict construction of the contract is as decided by the courts below, yet we are clear that such literal and strict construction does not express the real intention of the parties when the contract was made.\n Articles 1281 and 1283 of the Civil Code of Porto Rico, set forth in the foregoing statement, show the law to be in Porto Rico substantially the same as it is here; that is, that where it is plain that a strict and literal construction of the contract does not convey the real meaning of the parties, such construction is not to be entertained. See cases cited in United States v. Utah, n. & C. Stage Co. \n199 U.S. 414\n, 50 L. ed. --, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 69. In that case the strict and literal construction of the contract was contended, by the officers of the government, to be its proper construction, and hence, it was argued, when the contractor might, under the provisions of his contract, be required to perform new or additional mail, messenger, or transfer service, under the authority of the Postmaster General, without additional compensation, that then such official could require such additional service as arose by reason of the establishment of what amounted to a new station, which additional service required, above the normal increase of service, an additional distance to be traveled in wagons of over 300,000 miles. This court held that the parties never meant any such thing, and the judgment of the court of claims for the recovery of compensation for the extra distance traveled was affirmed.\n On looking at this contract we are of opinion that it evidently contemplates only such change in coins as might occur while Porto Rico was under the same political power. It speaks of the payment of the debt in the money current in commerce, whatever may be the coinage of the money that, as such, is in circulation 'in this province.' The words 'in this province' evidently did not contemplate any change of government, but only a possible change of coinage under the same government. It may be assumed that in 1894 no one could have contracted \n\n[200 U.S. 103, 114]\n\u00a0\n with reference to a war between Spain and the United States, which did not break out until four years thereafter, nor would anyone have contemplated the cession of Porto Rico to the United States, and the entire substitution of American money for that which had theretofore circulated in Porto Rico, and the retirement of all the other money.\n The value of the interest sold in the plantation was agreed by both parties, at the time of the execution of the instrument of deed and mortgage, to be 18,000 pesos, and so it was plainly stated in that instrument. The transaction was a bona fide one, providing for actual conveyance of the interest in the plantation, and there was plainly no gambling in the possible changes in the value of the coin, which might take place under a foreign government, when the various payments were to be made. The parties evidently had no thought of the war, or of being transferred to a foreign government as a result thereof. Under the circumstances it is impossible to conceive of sane persons agreeing in this case upon the value of the interest purchased and sold, and then that the purchaser should further agree to pay over 60 per cent more than the value of the thing purchased if it should so happen in the future that different coinage might be in circulation under a different sovereignty, which would effect that result.\n The question may be asked, What did the parties by this use of language, if they did not mean precisely what the courts below have said they did, and where is the justification for changing the interpretation as gathered from their language? It may not, perhaps, always be clear to see and determine what parties did mean by the language they used in a contract, and at the same time it may be perfectly clear they did not mean to contract with reference to what the courts below have called the literal and specific import of the language actually used. In this case we have no such difficulty. We have just stated what, in our opinion, the meaning really was, and that it was aimed at the possible change in coinage or of the value of the new coin under the decree of the government of Spain itself. \n\n[200 U.S. 103, 115]\n\u00a0\n Why that contingency should have presented itself is not stated clearly as a fact in either of the judgments of the courts below. (It may be here remarked that the judgments of those courts also partake of the nature of findings of fact and opinions of the court thereon.) There is a recital in the judgment or decree of the supreme court of what was stated by counsel for appellants in his written communication to the court, and which is part of the record, and that statement was, in substance, that the change was contemplated by the Spanish government at that time (1894), by which the peso then in circulation was to be retired, and another coin was to be issued which would be worth 60 instead of 57 cents to the peso, and it was with that contingency in mind that the parties provided as they did in the contract in question. It is true the supreme court does not find the fact of the existence of this intention on the part of the Spanish government, but, in giving a statement of what it regarded as the distinction between the case at bar and one theretofore decided by the same court, in a manner seemingly inconsistent with this dicision here, the supreme court said:\n'This case being different from what occurred in the case of Dona Josefa Cayol y Julia, and the agricultural corporation 'Balseiro and Gergetti,' which case was recently decided by this supreme court, and in which neither of the parties had expressed their will in so clear and explicit a manner as in the present case, nor could the case offer any difficulty, since the plaintiff herself had recognized in her complaint- and it was also proven in the course of the suit-that the clause of the deed, the application of which was being considered, and on which she based her claim that the purchasers Balseiro and Georgetti should pay her the interest on that part of the price, the payment of which had been postponed, in American currency without the discont fixed by the government of the United States for the money of this country, had been established by the parties in consideration of the exchange of the Mexican money, which had already been announced by the Spanish government \n\n[200 U.S. 103, 116]\n\u00a0\n on that date when the contract was made, for which reason this supreme court had to dismiss the appeal in cassation interposed by the plaintiff Dona Josefa Cayol, from the judgment rendered by the district court of Arecibo, denying the claim made by the said Dona Josefa Cayol, the court basing its decision precisely on this same article 1283 of the Civil Code, the application of which is the question at issue in the present appeal.'\n\n True, it appears to have been proved in that case, what the record does not show to have been specifically proved here, that there was at the time this contract was entered into a contemplated exchange of money to be circulated, and the contemplated change had been announced by the Spanish government at the time when the contract was made. But this fact is not a necessity, in order to maintain our view of the proper construction of the contract, for it simply furnishes what may be termed a presumption that the use of the language as to the payments was made with reference to this particular and contemplated exchange. The wholly incredible nature of the contract, if construed in the way the lower courts have done, is none the less apparent, and we cannot agree with a construction which binds the appellants to pay more than 60 per cent than the parties agreed the interest in the plantation was worth, and just that amount more than both parties supposed was to be paid.\n In truth, a careful reading of the whole decree of the supreme court ( while also considering that the recitals in that decree of matters contained in the appellants' brief were not negatived by the court as to matters of fact, the case being decided wholly upon the asserted strict construction of the contract) rather leads one to the conclusion that the court assumed the truth of those recitals as to the contemplated change of coinage, but regarded the fact as immaterial in view of what it thought to be the plain language of the contract. Of course we do not intimate that the court below was bound to deny the truth of the recitals or else it was to be taken as admitting it. We only \n\n[200 U.S. 103, 117]\n\u00a0\n refer to it in passing, in connection with the language of the whole decree, and the reasons given for the judgment, as some ground for the belief that the court in fact assumed the truth of the recitals, but thought them wholly immaterial. The court also pays no heed to the evidence which was received upon the trial of the case, showing the manner in which settlements of existing debts had been made upon instruments like the one in question, with or without the particular clause as to payments, the evidence being that the debts were paid at the rate of exchange provided for in the act of Congress. This, of course, must have been upon the ground that the words of the contract, as construed by the court, governed.\n In San Juan v. St. John's Gas Co. \n195 U.S. 510\n, 49 L. ed. 299, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 108, the contention was that the money due the gas company for lighting the street lamps was payable in Porto Rican money, but this court said that the contract was for payment in current foreign money, exclusive of Spanish goid; and it was conceded that if the foreign current money was required by the contract, money of the United States, current at the time the contract was made, was within the contemplation of the parties. Such money was also current in the island when performance was due. The case does not cover the one at bar.\n Nor is the debt payable at the rate of 100 cents for each peso, on the theory that the money in circulation at the time and place for the performance of the contract was the money in contemplation of the parties thereto in the absence of a contract for the payment in some other money. See \n195 U.S. 510\n, 49 L. ed. 299, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 108, cases cited, page 520, L. ed. page 304, Sup. Ct. Rep. 108.\n There was, as we have seen, no contract to pay in American money at the rate contended for by appellee. In providing for the withdrawal of all coins in circulation in Porto Rico, Congress provided at the same time for fixing the equivalent between those coins and American coins for the payment of all existing debts. This was simply fixing the value of those coins relatively to their value in American coin and with reference to the payment of debts then existing. All money then unpaid \n\n[200 U.S. 103, 118]\n\u00a0\n on this mortgage obligation was an existing debt within the act, and hence might be paid in American money at the rate of exchange therein specified. The withdrawal of the coins of Porto Rico in circulation at the time of the passage of the act of Congress, and provided for therein, did not take legal effect, so far as concerned debts then existing, except upon the condition that those debts might be solved in the coins of the United States, at the rate of exchange stated in the act. This did not impair or change the obligation of any contract, and was but an exercise of power to fix the value of the coins which were to be withdrawn, and to state the rate of exchange at which existing debts might be paid in American money; and as there was no contract to pay at any other rate, the act was valid and applied to this case.\n We are of opinion that the appellants are entitled to pay the balance remaining unpaid of the debt secured by the mortgage in American money, at the rate of exchange prescribed by Congress.\n The judgment of the court below is reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","157":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTAYLOR v. BURNS(1906)\nNo. 28\nArgued: Decided: November 12, 1906\n\n\n\n On March 26, 1901, Thomas Burns, the owner of three mining claims, as party of the first part, and Charles M. Taylor, as party of the second part, made the following agreement:\n'The said party of the first part, in consideration of the sum of $1, lawful money of the United States of America in hand paid, the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, and for the further consideration of money and labor heretofore expended and of labor to be hereafter expended in and upon the Magnet mining claim, the Comet mining claim, and the Victor mining claim, situate in the California mining district, in the Chiricahua mountains, Cochise county, Arizona territory, sells to the said party of the second part the said mining claims upon the terms and consideration following, to wit:\n\n'The said party of the second part shall pay to the party of the first part, whenever he shall negotiate, sell, or place said mines to any assignee of the said party of the second part, forty-five thousand dollars ($45,000), and in addition thereto \n\n[203 U.S. 120, 121]\n\u00a0\n one-eighth (1\/8) of whatever price the said party of the second part may be able to sell, place, or negotiate the said mines, for a consideration in excess of said $45,000; that is to say, the party of the second part is authorized to sell and negotiate the said mines for any price above the sum of $45,000, and may retain out of the said purchase price seven eighths (7\/8) of said selling price above such sum of $45,000.\n\n'The said parties hereto hereby mutually agree to aid each other in the negotiation and sale of said mining claims to the end that the same may be sold and the consideration realized as quickly as possible. And the said party of the first part hereby agrees to execute any deed or deeds or conveyances that may be hereafter necessary to convey a good title to said mining claims. This contract is to take the place of and supersede any and all other contract or contracts heretofore made by said parties hereto with reference to said mining claims.'\n\n On November 9, 1901, Burns deeded a one fourth interest in the mining claims to John A. Duncan, and on March 9, 1903, Burns and Duncan conveyed the entire property to S. R. Kauffman as trustee. On February 27, 1903, Thomas Burns executed and filed for record a revocation of all authority given by the agreement to Taylor, and notified him by letter of such revocation. On April 6, 1903, Taylor filed his bill of complaint in the district court for the county of Cochise, territory of Arizona, against Burns, Duncan, and Kauffman, alleging that he was the owner of the mining claims, that defendants claimed to have some interest in them, and praying to have his title thereto quieted. The defendants answered, and also filed a cross bill, alleging in substance that plaintiff had no title whatever, and praying that their title be quieted as against him. A trial in the district court resulted in a decree in favor of the defendants, which was affirmed by the supreme court of the territory (76 Pac. 623), and thereupon the case was brought here on appeal. \n\n[203 U.S. 120, 122]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Eugene S. Ives for appellant.\n\n\n\n[203 U.S. 120, 123]\n\u00a0\n Mr. William Herring, and Sarah Herring Sorin, for appellee.\n\n\n[203 U.S. 120, 124]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case turns upon the scope and effect of the agreement of March 26, 1901. It is claimed by plaintiff that it is a con- \n\n[203 U.S. 120, 125]\n\u00a0\n veyance, passing title; by defendants, that it is simply a power of attorney, subject to revocation. Its meaning is to be determined by a consideration of all its terms, and not by any particular phrase. The first paragraph recites a consideration, and states that for the consideration the first party 'sells' the claims to the party of the second part. If this were all it would suggest a purpose to pass title, but the paragraph closes with a refer ence to further stipulations, its language being 'sells to the said party of the second part the said mining claims upon the terms and consideration following, to wit.' The next paragraph authorizes the party of the second part to 'sell and negotiate' the mines for any sum above $45,000, and to retain out of this purchase price seven eighths of the excess of $45,000, while in the last paragraph the party of the first part 'agrees to execute any deed or deeds or conveyances that may be hereafter necessary to convey a good title to said mining claims.'\n Nowhere in the instrument does the party of the second part assume any obligations, except the general one in the third paragraph, by which both parties mutually agree to aid each other in the negotiation and sale of the mining claims. The instrument does not in terms grant or convey. The nearest approach to a word of conveyance is 'sells.' This is more apt in describing the passing of the title of personal than of real property. Not that this is decisive, for not infrequently it is held to manifest an intent to convey the title to the property named, whether real or personal. But when the purpose of the transaction is stated the word will ordinarily have no more effect upon the title than is necessary to accomplish the purpose. The purpose here named was the giving of authority to make a sale to some third party at not less than a named price, which price would belong to Burns, less the commission on the sale. For this it was not necessary to pass title with the authority. And it is not ordinarily to be expected that an owner will part with title before receipt of purchase price, or security therefor. \n\n[203 U.S. 120, 126]\n\u00a0\n Appellant contends that by this instrument he became owner, while Burns was only an equitable mortgagee. But no time is fixed for the sale, and therefore no time for the maturity of the supposed debt, nor is any liability cast upon Taylor for the payment of any portion thereof. Indeed, its amount is uncertain, whether $45,000, or $45,000 plus one eighth of a price which should or could be realized on a sale. If it were true that title passed, then Taylor could immediately convey to a third party, who, by payment of $45,000, would acquire the property. We need not inquire whether there was a breach of contract for which Taylor could recover damages. The question here is the effect of the contract upon the title. While it may be conceded that the meaning and scope of the instrument are not perfectly clear, yet it seems more reasonable to hold that it was simply a grant of authority to Taylor to 'sell and negotiate' the mines, and not also a transfer to him of the title to the property.\n As such an instrument it was subject to revocation. It was not a power of attorney coupled with an interest. By the phrase 'coupled with an interest,' is not meant an interest in the exercise of the power, but an interest in the property on which the power is to operate. Hunt v. Rousmanier, 8 Wheat. 174, 5 L. ed. 589. Now, as we construe this contract, Taylor was to receive, in case he made a sale, seven eighths of the price in excess of $45,000,-that is, he was to be paid for making the sale. It was an interest in the exercise of the power, and not an interest in the property upon which the power was to operate.\n We see no error in the ruling of the Supreme Court of the territory of Arizona, and its judgment is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","158":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTERRITORY OF NEW MEXICO EX REL.

J. McLean & Company against the Denver & Rio Grande Railroad Company. \n\n[203 U.S. 38, 47]\n\u00a0\n From the allegations of the writ it appears that the relators, the appellants here, had delivered to the railroad company at Santa Fe, New Mexico, a bale of hides consigned to Denver, Colorado, a point on the line of the defendant's railroad. The railroad company refused to receive and ship the hides for the reason that they did not bear the evidence of inspection required by the act of the legislature of New Mexico, approved March 19, 1901, which act, to be more fully noticed hereafter, made it an offense for any railroad company to receive hides for shipment beyond the limits of the territory which had not been inspected within the requirements of the law.\n An objection is made to the jurisdiction of this court upon the ground that the case is not appealable under the act of Congress of March 3, 1885. 23 Stat. at L. 443, chap. 355 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 572).\n Section 1 of the act provides, in substance, that no appeal or writ of error shall be allowed from any judgment or decree of the supreme court of a territory unless the matter in dispute, exclusive of costs, exceeds the sum of $5,000. Section 2 of the act makes exception to the application of  1 as to the sum in dispute, in cases wherein is involved the validity of a treaty or statute of or authority exercised under the United States, and in all such cases an appeal or writ of error will lie without regard to the sum or value in dispute.\n Confessedly, $5,000 is not involved; and in order to be appealable to this court the case must involve the validity of an authority exercised under the United States, and also be a controversy in which some sum or value is involved. This court, in the case of United States v. Lynch, \n137 U.S. 280\n-285, 34 L. ed. 700-702, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 114-116, laid down the test of the right to appeal under the statute in the following terms:\n'The validity of a statute, or the validity of an authority, is drawn in question when the existence or constitutionality or legality of such statute or authority is denied, and the denial forms the subject of direct inquiry.'\n\n The right to legislate in the territories is conferred, under \n\n[203 U.S. 38, 48]\n\u00a0\n constitutional authority, by the Congress of the United States, and the passage of a territorial law is the exertion of an authority exercised under the United States. While this act was passed in pursuance of the authority given by the United States to the territorial legislature, it is contended by the relators below, appellants here, that it violates the Constitution of the United States, and is therefore invalid, although it is an attempted exercise of power conferred by Congress upon the territory. The objection of the relator to the law raises a controversy as to the right of the legislature to pass it under the broad power of legislation conferred by Congress upon the territory. In other words, the validity of an authority exercised under the United States in the passage and enforcement of this law is directly challenged, and the case does involve the validity of an authority exercised under the power derived from the United States. It is not a case merely involving the construction of a legislative act of the territory, as was the fact in Snow v. United States, \n118 U.S. 346\n, 30 L. ed. 207, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1059. The power to pass the act at all, in view of the requirements of the Constitution of the United States, is the subject-matter of controversy, and brings the case in this aspect within the 2d section of the act.\n Is there any sum or value in dispute in this case? While the act does not prescribe the amount, some sum or value must be in dispute. Albright v. New Mexico, \n200 U.S. 9\n, 50 L. ed. 346, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 210. The matter in dispute is the right to have the goods which were tendered for shipment transported to their destination. As a common carrier, the railroad was bound to receive and transport the goods. Its refusal so to do was based upon the statute in question because of the noninspection of the goods tendered. The relators claimed the right to have their goods transported because the statute was null and void, being an unconstitutional enactment. The controversy, therefore, relates to the right of the appellants to have their goods transported by the railroad company to the place of destination. We think this was a valuable right, measurable \n\n[203 U.S. 38, 49]\n\u00a0\n in money. At common law, a cause of action arose from the refusal of a common carrier to transport goods duly tendered for carriage. Ordinarily, the measure of damages in such case is the difference between the value of the goods at the point of tender and their value at their proposed destination, less the cost of carriage. We are of the opinion that this controversy involves a money value within the meaning of the statute, and the motion to dismiss the appeal will be overruled.\n Passing to the merits of the controversy, Congress has conferred legislative power upon the territory to an extent not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States. U. S. Rev. Stat.  1851. It is contended that the act under consideration contravenes that part of article 1,  10, of the Constitution of the United States, which reads: 'No state shall, without the consent of the Congress, lay any imposts or duties on imports or exports, except what may be absolutely necessary for executing its inspection laws.' And also that part of the 8th section of article 1 of the Constitution of the United States, which gives to Congress the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the states, and with the Indian tribes.\n As to the objection predicated on  10 of article 1, that section can have no application to the present case, as that provision directly applies only to articles imported or exported to foreign countries. Patapsco Guano Co. v. Board of Agriculture, \n171 U.S. 345\n-350, 43 L. ed. 191-193, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 862, and cases cited. Moreover, that paragraph of the Constitution expressly reserves the right of the states to pass inspection laws, and if this law is of that character it does not run counter to this requirement of the Constitution.\n The question principally argued is as to the effect of this law upon interstate commerce, and it is urged that it is in violation of the Constitution, because it undertakes to regulate interstate commerce, and lays upon it a tax not within the power of the local legislature to exact. It has been too frequently decided by this court to require the restatement \n\n[203 U.S. 38, 50]\n\u00a0\n of the decisions, that the exclusive power to regulate interstate commerce is vested by the Constitution in Congress, and that other laws which undertake to regulate such commerce or impose burdens upon it are invalid. This doctrine has been reaffirmed and announced in cases decided as recently as the last term of this court. Houston & T. C. R. Co. v. Mayes, \n201 U.S. 321\n, 50 L. ed. 772, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 491; McNeill v. Southern R. Co. \n202 U.S. 543\n, 50 L. ed. 1142, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 722. While this is true, it is equally well settled that a state or a territory, for the same reasons, in the exercise of the police power, may make rules and regulations not conflicting with the legislation of Congress upon the same subject, and not amounting to regulations of interstate commerce. It will only be necessary to refer to a few of the many cases decided in this court holding valid enactments of legislatures having for their object the protection, welfare, and safety of the people, although such laws may have an effect upon interstate commerce. Missouri, K. & T. R. Co. v. Haber, \n169 U.S. 613\n-635, 42 L. ed. 878-885, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 488; Chicago, M. & St. P. R. Co. v. Solan, \n169 U.S. 133\n, 42 L. ed. 688, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 289; Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Hughes, \n191 U.S. 477\n, 48 L. ed. 268, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 132. The principle decided in these cases is that a state or territory has the right to legislate for the safety and welfare of its people, and that this right is not taken from it because of the exclusive right of Congress to regulate interstate commerce, except in cases where the attempted exercise of authority by the legislature is in conflict with an act of Congress, or is an attempt to regulate interstate commerce. In Patapsco Guano Co. v. Board of Agriculture, supra, it was directly recognized that the state might pass inspection laws for the protection of its people against fraudulent practices and for the suppression of frauds, although such legislation had an effect upon interstate commerce. The same principle was recognized in Neilson v. Garza, 2 Woods, 287, Fed. Cas. No. 10,091,-a case decided by Mr. Justice Bradley on the circuit and quoted from at length with approval by Mr. Chief Justice Fuller in the Patapsco Case.\n Applying the principles recognized in these cases to the \n\n[203 U.S. 38, 51]\n\u00a0\n case at bar, does the act in question do violence to the exclusive right of Congress to regulate interstate commerce? We take judicial notice of the fact that, in the territory of New Mexico, and in other similar parts of the West, cattle are required to be branded in order to identify their ownership, and that they run at large in great stretches of country with no other means of determining their separate ownership than by the brands or marks upon them. In view of these considerations, and for the purpose of protecting the owners of cattle against fraud and criminal seizures of their property, the territory of New Mexico has made provision, by means of a system of laws enacted for the purpose, for the protection of the ownership of cattle and the prevention of fraudulent appropriations of this kind of property. The legislation upon the subject in the territory is thus summarized in the opinion, in this case, of the supreme court of New Mexico (78 Pac. 74):\n'The first act relating to inspection of hides was passed in 1884, and provided that all butchers should keep a record of all animals slaughtered, and keep the hides and horns of such animals for thirty days after slaughter, free to the inspection of all persons (Comp. Laws,  84); and provided a penalty for failure to keep the record and the hides and horns ( 86), and a penalty for refusal of inspection of the record or hides ( 87). In 1891 all persons were required to keep hides for thirty days for the inspection of any sheriff, deputy sheriff, or any constable, or any board or inspector, or any officer authorized to inspect hides ( 89), and provided a penalty ( 90). In 1889, amended in 1895 (Laws 1895, chap. 29,  4, p. 70), a cattle sanitary board was created ( 183), with power to adopt and enforce quarantine regulations and regulations for the inspection of cattle for sale and slaughter ( 184), and pay inspectors not to exceed $2.50 per day and their expenses ( 190). In 1891 the cattle sanitary board was authorized and required to make regulations concerning inspection of cattle for shipment, and hides and slaughterhouses ( 208), and there was pro- \n\n[203 U.S. 38, 52]\n\u00a0\n vided the details of arrangement for inspection of cattle ( 212), and the duties of cattle inspectors were enlarged by providing: 'Every slaughterhouse in this territory shall be carefully inspected by some one of the inspectors aforesaid, and all hides found in such slaughterhouses shall be carefully compared with the records of such slaughterhouses, and a report in writing setting forth the number of cattle killed at any such slaughterhouse since the last inspection, . . . the names of the persons from whom each of said cattle was bought, the brands and marks upon each hide, and any information that may be obtained touching the violation by the owner of any such slaughterhouse, or any other person, of the provisions of an act entitled 'An Act for the Protection of Stock, and for Other Purposes,' approved April 1, 1884. For the purpose of making the inspection authorized by this act, any inspector employed by the said sanitary board shall have the right to enter, in the day or nightime, any slaughterhouse or other place where cattle are killed in this territory, and to carefully examine the same, and all books and records required by law to be kept therein and to compare the hides found therein with such records' ( 213). In 1893 it was provided that the cattle sanitary board might fix fees for the inspection of cattle and hides ( 221) (repealed in 1899 [Laws 1899 chap. 53, p. 107]) and that such fees shall be paid to the secretary of the board and placed to the credit of the cattle sanitary board ( 222), and shall be used, together with funds realized from taxes levied and assessed, or to be levied and assessed, upon cattle only, to defray the expenses of the board ( 220). Chapter 44, p. 94, of the Laws of 1899, makes no changes in the law material to the consideration of this case. Section 2, chap. 53, p. 107, of the Laws of 1899, provides a fee of 3 cents for inspection of cattle.'\n\n In pari materia with this legislation the act of 1901, now under consideration, was passed. Sections 3 and 4 of that act are as follows:\n'Sec. 3. Hereafter it shall be unlawful for any person, firm, \n\n[203 U.S. 38, 53]\n\u00a0\n or corporation to offer, or any railroad company or other common carrier to receive, for the purpose of shipment or transportation beyond the limits of this territory, any hides that have not been inspected and tagged by a duly authorized inspector of the cattle sanitary board of New Mexico, for the district in which such hides originate. For each hide thus inspected there shall be paid by the owner or holder thereof a fee or charge of 10 cents, and such fee or charge shall be a lien upon the hides thus inspected, until the same shall have been paid. Each inspector of hides shall keep a complete record of all inspections made by him, and shall at once forward to the secretary of the cattle sanitary board, on blanks furnished him for that purpose, a complete report of each inspection, giving the names of the purchaser and shipper of the hides, as well as all the brands thereon, which said report shall be preserved by the secretary as a part of the records of his office.\n\n'Sec 4. Any person, firm, or corporation, common carrier, railroad company, or agent thereof, violating any provision of this act, or refusing to permit the inspection of any hides as herein provided, shall, upon conviction thereof, be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be fined in any sum not exceeding $1,000 for each and every violation of the provisions of this act.'\n\n The purpose of these provisions is apparent, and is to pervent the criminal or fraudulent appropriation of cattle by requiring the inspection of hides and registration by a record which preserves the name of the shipper and purchaser of the hides, as will as the brands thereon, and by which is afforded some evidence, at least, tending to identify the ownership of the cattle. It evident that the provision as to the shipment of the hides beyond the limits of the territory is essential to this purpose, for if the hides can be surreptitiously or criminally obtained and shipped beyond such limits, without inspection or registration, a very convenient door is open to the perpetration of fraud and the prevention of discovery. \n\n[203 U.S. 38, 54]\n\u00a0\n It is argued that this act lays a special burden upon interstate commerce, because, under the law, hides not offered for transportation are not required to be inspected after thirty days in slaughterhouses and not at all outside of slaughterhouses. But legislation is not void because it meets the exigencies of a particular situation. Other statutory provisions apply to property remaining in the territory, where possibly it may be found and identified. When shipped beyond the limits of the territory the means of reaching it are beyond local control, and it is the purpose of  3 and 4 of the act of 1901 to preserve within the territory a record of the brands identifying the property and naming the purchaser or shipper. Certainly we cannot judicially say that there can be no valid reason for making the inspection in question apply only to hides offered for transportation beyond the territory, and that for that reason the tax is an arbitrary discrimination against interstate traffic.\n It is urged further that this is a mere revenue law and in no just sense an inspection law, and, therefore, not within the police power conferred upon the territory. It is true that inspection laws ordinarily have for their object the improvement of quality, and to protect the community against fraud and imposition in the character of the article received for sale or to be exported, but in the Patapsco Case, supra, it was directly recognized that inspection laws such as the one under consideration might be passed in the exercise of the police power, and such was the view of Mr. Justice Bradley in Neilson v. Garza, supra, decided on the circuit. We see no reason why an inspection law which has for its purpose the protection of the community against fraud and the promotion of the welfare of the people cannot be passed in the exercise of the police power, when the legislation tends to subserve the purpose in view. In the territory of New Mexico, and other parts of the country similarly situated, it is highly essential to protect large numbers of people against criminal aggression upon this class of property. The exercise of the police power \n\n[203 U.S. 38, 55]\n\u00a0\n may and should have reference to the peculiar situation and needs of the community. The law under consideration, designed to prevent the clandestine removal of property in which a large number of the people of the territory are interested, seems to us an obviously rightful exercise of this power. It is true it affects interstate commerce, but we do not think such was its primary purpose, and while it may have an effect to levy a tax upon this class of property, the main purpose evidently was to protect the people against fraud and wrong.\n It is further urged that this law is invalid because it imposes an unreasonable fee for the inspection, which goes into the treasury of the sanitary board, and the allegations of the writ tend to show that an inspector might make a considerable sum in excess of day's wages in the work of inspecting hides under the provisions of this act. The law being otherwise valid, the amount of the inspection fee is not a judicial question; it rests with the legislature to fix the amount, and it can only present a valid objection when it is shown that it is so unreasonable and disproportionate to the services rendered as to attack the good faith of the law. Patapsco Guano Co. v. Board of Agriculture, \n171 U.S. 345\n-350, 43 L. ed. 191-193, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 862.\n We are of the opinion that the allegations of the relator as to the cost of inspection, compared with the fees authorized to be charged, and the profit which might accrue to the inspector, in view of other and necessary incidental expense connected with the inspection and registration, do not bring the case within that class which holds that, under the guise of inspection, other and different purposes are to be subserved, thus rendering the legislation invalid.\n Upon the whole case, we are of the opinion that, in the absence of congressional legislation covering the subject, and making a different provision, the act in controversy is a valid exercise of the police power of the territory, and not in violation of the Constitution giving exclusive power to Congress in the regulation of interstate commerce.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","159":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTERRITORY OF NEW MEXICO v. ATCHISON, T & S F RY. CO(1906)\nNo. 182\nArgued: January 26, 1906Decided: March 12, 1906\n\n\n\n Messrs. Frank W. Clancy and A. H. Harllee for appellant.\n Messrs. Robert Dunlap, H. L. Waldo, R. E. Twitchell, and Gardiner Lathrop for appellees.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n The territory of New Mexico commenced three separate actions against appellees, respectively, in the district court of Grant county, New Mexico, to recover taxes alleged to be due on a levy to pay certain judgments against the county, including \n\n[201 U.S. 41, 42]\n\u00a0\n a particular item of $276.21, arising from the increase of the valuation of the property of the railroad companies. The aggregate amount claimed was $8,646.49, with interest at the rate of 25 per cent per annum. The cases were consolidated and submitted to the district court on an agreed statement of facts with exhibits attached, a jury being waived, and resulted in a judgment, October 9, 1902, for $5,156.71 with interest at 6 per cent per annum. This included the $276.21 with interest. Appellees sued out writs of error from the supreme court of the territory. No cross writ of error was brought and no cross errors were assigned. In the supreme court the item of $276.21 with interest was not contested. February 26, 1903, the supreme court announced its conclusion that the judgment be reversed, but as the item of $276.21 was not contested, rendered judgment for that amount, thereby rejecting the sum of $4,880.50 of the judgment below, that sum with interest at 6 per cent amounting to less than $5,000 on that date. 11 N. M. 669, 72 Pac. 14. From the judgment so rendered the territory prosecuted an appeal to this court, under the act of Congress in that behalf, January 17, 1905, and prayed in its assignment of errors that the judgment of the supreme court be reversed and set aside, and the cause be 'remanded to said supreme court, with directions to affirm the judgment of the district court of Grant county.' The appeal was heard in this court on January 26, 1906, and on that day appellant filed an additional assignment of errors to the effect that the supreme court of New Mexico erred in failing to hold that appellant was entitled to interest at the rate of 25 per cent per annum from October 9, 1902. But the judgment of the district court gave interest at 6 per cent, and, as before stated, the territory did not complain of that judgment as rendered.\n By the act of March 3, 1885 (23 Stat. at L. 443, chap. 355, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 572), no appeal or writ of error could be allowed from any judgment or decree of the territorial supreme courts, with certain exceptions not material here, 'unless the matter in dispute, exclusive of costs, \n\n[201 U.S. 41, 43]\n\u00a0\n shall exceed the sum of five thousand dollars.' The matter in dispute here was that part of the judgment of the district court which was disallowed by the supreme court, and that was less than five thousand dollars.\n Appeal dismissed. \n\n\n\n","160":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTEXAS & P R. CO. v. MUGG & DRYDEN(1906)\nNo. 233\nArgued: Decided: May 14, 1906\n\n\n\n The railroad company, plaintiff in error in this record, appealed to the court of civil appeals of the second supreme judicial district of the state of Texas from a judgment which had been rendered in favor of Mugg & Dryden, defendants in error herein. The appellate court certified to the supreme court of Texas the question of the liability of the railroad company, upon a statement of facts which correctly set forth the controversy, and which was as follows:\n'The cause originated in the justice court, from which it was appealed to the county court of Tarrant county, where a trial was had on the following statement of appellees' cause of action, to wit: 'Statement of plaintiffs' cause of action. Damages in the sum of $140.18, as follows: By reason of defendant making and quoting to plaintiffs a rate of $1.25 per ton on two cars of coal and $1.50 per ton on one car of coal, in January and February, 1903, respectively, from Coal Hill, Arkansas, to Weatherford, Texas, on which rates so made and \n\n[202 U.S. 242, 243]\n\u00a0\n quoted plaintiff relied in contracting said coal shipped and sold at prices based on said rates; whereas defendant assessed and collected of plaintiff freight at the rate of $2.75 per ton on said two cars, and $2.85 on said one car, which said freight rate plaintiff was forced to pay and did pay under protest in order to obtain said coal and deliver the same in compliance with sales previously made. That plaintiffs' loss and damage in the sum aforesaid were occasioned by defendant's negligence in making and quoting to plaintiff the said rates, on which rate quoted defendant knew plaintiffs relied and based their sales of said three cars of coal shipped and sold thereafter, and then forcing plaintiffs to pay a greater rate, amounting in the aggregate to the sum of $140.18, on said three cars of coal, thereby causing plaintiffs loss and damage in the said sum.'\n\n'To this pleading the appellant answered by general demurrer and general denial, and especially denied that it ever entered into any contract for the shipment of coal for appellees from Coal Hill, Arkansas, to Weatherford, Texas, at the rate alleged in appellees' statement; and further, that if it ever quoted any such rate to appellees, such quotation was a violation of the interstate commerce act, and was a lower rate than the interstate rate in effect at the time shipment was made, which had been duly published, printed, and posted in its depot and stations, as required by the terms of the act; and further, that it collected from appellees the exact rate prescribed for such commodity under such act, and that such contract, if any was made, was in violation of law, and void. Upon a trial without a jury judgment was rendered for the appellees for the amount sued for and all costs of suit.\n\n'It is agreed by the parties that the rate charged and collected on the shipments of coal in controversy from Coal Hill, Arkansas, to Weatherford, Texas, as shown in appellees' statement of cause of action, was the regular rate in effect at the time the shipments were made, as shown by the printed and published schedules of the Texas & Pacific Railway Company \n\n[202 U.S. 242, 244]\n\u00a0\n on file with the Interstate Commerce Commission, and posted in the stations of said railway company, as required by the interstate commerce act. There is no assignment challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to support the material allegations of appellees' pleadings.'\n\n The supreme court of Texas having answered that the railroad company was liable 'for damages occasioned by the misrepresentation of the rate of freight as shown by the statement of facts' (98 Tex. 352, 83 S. W. 800), the court of civil appeals affirmed the judgment against the railroad company. Thereupon this writ of error was prosecuted.\n Messrs. John F. Dillon, Winslow S. Pierce, David D. Duncan, and Thomas J. Freeman for plaintiff in error.\n No counsel for defendants in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice White:\n\n Mr. Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case is within the principle of and is ruled by the decision in Gulf, C. & S. F. R. Co. v. Hefley, \n158 U.S. 98\n, 39 L. ed. 910, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 802. Upon the authority of that case the supreme court of Alabama denied the liability of a railroad company in a case of similar character to that under review. Southern R. Co. v. Harrison, 119 Ala. 539, 43 L. R. A. 385, 72 Am. St. Rep. 936, 24 So. 552. The opinion of Chief Justice Brickell so aptly reviewed and declared the effect of the decision in the Hefley Case that we adopt the same in disposing of the present controversy. The Alabama court said:\n'In Gulf, C. & S. F. R. Co. v. Hefley, supra, the plaintiff sued to recover damages for the refusal by the carrier to deliver goods consigned to him, after tender of payment of the stipulated charges named in the bill of lading. The goods, a lot of furniture, had been received by the carrier at St. Louis, Missouri, for transportation to Cameron, Texas, at a stipulated rate, specified in the bill of lading, of 69 cents per \n\n[202 U.S. 242, 245]\n\u00a0\n 100 pounds, the charges amounting to $82.80, whereas the published schedule rate in force at the time was 84 cents, and the charges should have been $100.80; and the plaintiff, as in this case, was ignorant of the fact that the rate obtained was less than the schedule rate. It was held, in an opinion by Brewer, J., that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover. It is true that the only question discussed in the opinion was whether or not the interstate act superseded the Texas statute, which prohibited a common carrier from charging or collecting from the owner or consignee of freight a greater sum than that specified in the bill of lading, and this question was decided in the affirmative. . . . But this was not the only effect of the decision, and it is by its effect on the rights of the parties to such a contract, by whatever process of reasoning the decision may be reached, that the state courts are bound. The clear effect of the decision was to declare that one who has obtained from a common carrier transportation of goods from one state to another at a rate, specified in the bill of lading, less than the published schedule rates filed with and approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission, and in force at the time, whether or not he knew that the rate obtained was less than the schedule rate, is not entitled to recover the goods, or damages for their detention, upon the tender of payment of the amount of charges named in the bill of lading, or of any sum less than the schedule charges; in other words, that, whatever may be the rate agreed upon, the carrier's lien on the goods is, by force of the act of Congress, for the amount fixed by the published schedule of rates and charges, and this lien can be discharged, and the consignee can become entitled to the goods, only by the payment, or tender of payment, of such amount. Such is now the supreme law, and by it this and the courts of all other states are bound.'\n\n The judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals for the Second Supreme Judicial District of Texas is reversed and the case remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","161":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTRAVELERS' INS.

Spoon. The supreme court granted the mandamus. Its judgment was reversed by the court of appeals.\n The question in the case is whether the rule of the Patent Office which denies an appeal from a ruling of a primary examiner, upon motion to dissolve an interference, is contrary to the Revised Statutes, and therefore void. Rule 124 provides that 'from a decision of a primary examiner affirming the patentability of the claim or the applicant's right to make the same, no appeal can be taken.'\n Plaintiffs in error attack the rule as inconsistent with the sections of the Revised Statutes which provide for interferences. These sections are inserted in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[203 U.S. 476, 479]\n\u00a0\n The facts are as follows: Lowry was granted a patent for a bale of fibrous material January 29, 1897. An interference was declared between his patent and application of one William Spoon, to which interference Lowry was made a party. He \n\n[203 U.S. 476, 480]\n\u00a0\n moved to dissolve the interference upon the ground, among others, that Spoon's press was inoperative. The primary examiner granted the motion and Spoon appealed to the board of examiners in chief, who confirmed the decision. Upon petition of Spoon the Commissioner of Patents remanded the case to the primary examiner for further consideration, and the latter officer, upon the filing of additional affidavits, decided that Spoon's application disclosed an operative device. From this decision an appeal was taken to the board of examiners in chief, which was dismissed by that board for want of jurisdiction. Thereupon Lowry petitioned the Commissioner to direct the board to issue an appeal. The petition was denied, the Acting Commissioner remarking:\n'The rule prohibiting an appeal from a decision upon a motion holding that a party has the right to make the claim of the issue is in accordance with the practice which has prevailed in this office for many years, and has the support of all decisions of the courts which have been rendered on the subject. There seems to be no reason for regarding it as inconsistent with the statute. It seems very clear that the decision in this case is not a final adverse decision, since it is not a ruling that Lowry is not entitled to his patent. That is a matter which may be determined in the further proceedings, and therefore it is clear that the decision relates to a mere interlocutory matter.\n\n'The petition is denied.'\n\n Lowry filed another petition, appealing to the Commissioner 'in person,' to direct the board of examiners in chief to entertain his appeal. The petition was considered and denied. In passing on the petition the Commissioner said:\n'Under the express provisions of rule 124 there is no appeal to the examiners in chief from such decision rendered on an interlocutory motion. It is believed that there is nothing in that rule inconsistent with law, and that therefore it has the force of law. The right of appeal in interferences given in general terms in the statute is a very different thing from the \n\n[203 U.S. 476, 481]\n\u00a0\n right of appeal on all motions in the interference. To permit appeals on motions would multiply litigation and extend the proceedings in interferences beyond all reasonable limits. It would work great hardship to parties. The appellate tribunals of this office are no more required to give cases piecemeal consideration than are the appellate courts. The whole case should be ready for appeal when the appeal provided for by the statute is taken.\n\n ... * *\n'It is to be particularly noted that there has been no decision as to the rival claims of the parties to this interference. It has not been decided which party is entitled to the patent. If it should at any time be decided that Spoon is entitled to the patent, Lowry will have the right of appeal, but until such final decision is rendered the statute gives him no right of appeal.\n\n'It would seem upon general principles of law that Lowry could then present for determination by his appeal any question which, in his opinion, vitally affects the question which party is entitled to the patent. The only ground upon which he can reasonably claim the right of appeal on this motion is that the question vitally affects his claimed right to a patent, and if it does that, he can raise it at final hearing and contest it before the various appellate tribunals, including the court of appeals.\n\n'The refusal to permit the present appeal on motion is therefore not a denial of an opportunity to have the matter reviewed by the several appellate tribunals mentioned in the statute.'\n\n And further: 'No good reason is seen for changing the provisions in Rule 124 here in controversy, which was adopted and approved by a long line of Commissioners of Patents, among whom have been some of the ablest patent lawyers in the country, and which rule has been acquiesced in by patent attorneys practising before the office for the last quarter of a century.' \n\n[203 U.S. 476, 482]\n\u00a0\n There is quite a sharp controversy between the parties as to the effect of the ruling of the Commissioner. Plaintiffs in error are apparently convinced that the ruling of the primary examiner involves a fundamental right which, if not decided on Lowry's appeal, will be forever foreclosed to him for review. A different view is expressed by defendant in error. However this may be, we think the question in the case is in quite narrow compass. The statutes involved are not difficult of interpretation. The determining sections are 482, 483, 4904, and 4909 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 272, 3389, 3390). Plaintiffs in error put especial stress upon  482 and 4909. Section 482 provides for the appointment of examiners in chief, 'whose duty it shall be, on the written petition of the appellant, to revise and determine upon the validity of the adverse decisions of examiners . . . in interference cases.' Section 4909 provides that 'every party to an interference may appeal from the decision of the primary examiner or of the examiner in charge of interferences in such case, to the board of examiners in chief.' The contention is that this section gives the right of appeal unreservedly and any limitation of it by a rule is void. Such might not be the result, even if there was no qualification of those sections in other sections. As said by the Commissioner: 'The right of appeal in interferences given in general terms in the statute is a very different thing from the right of appeal on all motions in the interference.' It certainly could not have been the intention to destroy all distinctions in procedure. But we are not left to inference. The statute is explicit. It limits the declaration of interferences to the question of priority of invention. Section 4904 provides that in case of conflict of an application for a patent with a pending application or with an unexpired patent (as in the case at bar), the Commissioner shall give notice thereof, 'and shall direct the primary examiner to proceed to determine the question of priority of invention.' ( Italics ours.) And it is provided that the Commissioner shall issue a patent to the party adjudged the prior inventor, unless the adverse party appeals from the decision of the primary ex- \n\n[203 U.S. 476, 483]\n\u00a0\n aminer or examiners in chief, as the case may be. The history of the sections and the rules are gone into at length by the court of appeals in its opinion. We need not repeat the discussion. It answers the detailed reasoning of plaintiffs in error. We concur with the views expressed, that the statutes provide only for appeals upon the question of priority of invention. Appeals on other questions are left to the regulation of the Patent Office under the grant of power contained in  483.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice Peckham and Mr. Justice Day dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Rev.

TAFT(1906)\nNo. 300\nArgued: Decided: December 10, 1906\n\n\n\n\n[203 U.S. 461, 462]\n\u00a0\n Relator was, on May 12, 1902, a clerk in the classified civil service of the United States, and employed in the War Department. On that day an article purporting to be signed by her, and making very serious reflections on the President of the United States, appeared in a newspaper published at Washington. Some days thereafter the Secretary of War directed that relator be called upon to state whether she was the author of the publication, and, if so, it was ordered that her attention should be invited to  8 of civil service rule II., and that she be allowed three days in which to submit any answer or statement she might wish to make.\n To this relator answered, admitting that she was the author of the article, but insisting that she had not been notified of any charge calling for answer under the rule.\n Thereupon the Secretary entered an order dismissing her from the service, and filed a memorandum assigning as reason therefor the publication of the article.\n Relator then filed her petition for mandamus in the supreme court of the District, to compel the Secretary to restore her. The petition recited  3 and 8 of civil service rule II., and assigned as grounds of relief that the procedure was not in conformity with the executive regulations set out, in that no reasons for removal had been furnished relator, and also in that the real reason of her removal was because of her political opinions and the expression of them.\n The Secretary answered the petition, setting out the facts in detail, denying that relator was removed on account of her political opinions, and averring that the action was taken because of the publication of the article, containing derogatory and disrespectful statements of and concerning the President of the United States in relation to his conduct as Commander in Chief, and which he decided 'was prejudicial to order and the efficiency of said War Department, and such offense as rendered the further connection of the petitioner with said service incompatible with the best interests of the same.' And while insisting that all acts done or caused to be done by \n\n[203 U.S. 461, 463]\n\u00a0\n him were in conformity with the civil service rules, the Secretary submitted that the petitioner showed by her petition 'no vested right, title or interest in or to the employment formerly exercised by her in the office of the Adjutant General of the United States Army, and that the relation of such petitioner, as an employee, to the executive civil service, in respect of appointment, promotion, and removal, is a matter wholly within the competence and cognizance of the political department, and the action of the head of an executive department in respect thereof is not subject to be reviewed, reversed, set aside, or controlled by a court of law, nor can his action in that behalf be commanded, directed, or compelled by the writ of mandamus, as the petitioner in her said petition has prayed.'\n Relator filed a demurrer to the answer, which was overruled, whereupon she elected to stand by the demurrer, and judgment was entered denying the writ. The judgment was affirmed by the court of appeals (24 App. D. C. 95), and this writ of error then sued out.\n Mr. Noble E. Dawson for plaintiff in error.\n Solicitor General Hoyt for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Chief Justice Fuller:\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case comes before us on a motion to dismiss the writ of error for want of jurisdiction. The right to such a writ is given in  233 of the Code of the District of Columbia (31 Stat. at L. 1189, 1227, chap. 854 ), which reads:\n'Any final judgment or decree of the court of appeals may be re- examined and affirmed, reversed, or modified by the Supreme Court of the United States, upon writ of error or appeal, in all cases in which the matter in dispute, exclusive of costs, shall exceed the sum of five thousand dollars, in the same manner and under the same regulations as existed in \n\n[203 U.S. 461, 464]\n\u00a0\n cases of writs of error on judgments, or appeals from decrees rendered in the supreme court of the District of Columbia, on February ninth, eighteen hundred and ninety-three, and also in cases, without regard to the sum or value of the matter in dispute, wherein is involved the validity of any patent or copyright, or in which is drawn in question the validity of a treaty or statute of, or an authority exercised under, the United States.'\n\n If this writ of error can be maintained, it is on the ground that the validity of an authority exercised under the United States was drawn in question.\n The relator did not, however, question the authority of the President or his representatives to dismiss her, if the required formalities had been complied with. What she claimed was that there were certain rules and regulations of the civil service which were not observed in the matter of her dismissal, and that, therefore, such dismissal was illegal.\n But this contention did not draw in question the validity of an authority exercised under the United States, but the construction and application of regulations of the exercise of such authority.\n As Mr. Justice Gray said, in South Carolina v. Seymour (United States ex rel. South Carolina v. Seymour) \n153 U.S. 353\n, 38 L. ed. 742, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 871, referring to an identical provision of the laws of the District prior to the Code: 'In order to come within this clause, the validity, and not the construction only, of a treaty or statute of the United States, or of an authority exercised under the United States must be directly drawn in question.'\n And, prior to that case, we had disposed of the same question in United States v. Lynch, \n137 U.S. 280\n, 34 L. ed. 700, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 114. That was a petition for a writ of mandamus against the Fourth Auditor and the Second Comptroller of the Treasury, to compel them to audit the account of petitioner, who was an officer in the Navy. It was insisted that by the disallowance of petitioner's claim for mileage these officers exercised a discretion which they did not possess; that this was an invalid exercise of an authority under the United States; and that hence the validity \n\n[203 U.S. 461, 465]\n\u00a0\n of the authority was drawn in question. We held otherwise, and said:\n'The validity of a statute is not drawn in question every time rights claimed under such statute are controverted, not is the validity of an authority, every time an act done by such authority is disputed. . . .\n\n'What the relator sought was an order coercing these officers to proceed in a particular way, and this order the supreme court of the District declined to grant. If we were to reverse that judgment upon the ground urged, it would not be for want of power in the Auditor to audit the account, and in the Comptroller to revise and pass upon it, but because those officers had disallowed what they ought to have allowed and erroneously construed what needed no construction. This would not in any degree involve the validity of their authority.'\n\n United States ex rel. Steinmetz v. Allen, \n192 U.S. 543\n, 48 L. ed. 555, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 416, is not to the contrary, for there the validity of a rule constituting the authority of certain officers in the Patent Office was drawn in question.\n Writ of error dismissed. \n\n\n\n","164":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S EX REL. DRURY v. LEWIS(1906)\nNo. 126\nArgued: December 12, 1905Decided: January 2, 1906\n\n\n\n Assistant to the Attorney General Purdy for appellants.\n No counsel for appellee.\n\n Statement by Mr. Chief Justice Fuller: \n\n[200 U.S. 1, 2]\n\u00a0\n Ralph W. Drury and John Dowd were indicted in the court of oyer and terminer for the county of Allegheny, Pennsylvania, on two counts,-the first charging them with murder, and the second with manslaughter, in the homicide of one William H. Crowley, September 10, 1903. They were admitted to bail in the sum of $5,000 each, and having been subsequently surrendered, obtained a writ of habeas corpus from the circuit court of the United States for the western district of Pennsylvania. The case on the hearing was thus stated by Acheson, J., holding the circuit court:\n'On September 10th, 1903, Ralph W. Drury was a commissioned officer of the United States Army, of the rank of second lieutenant, and had under his command a detachment of twenty enlisted men, of whom John Dowd was one, stationed at Allegheny arsenal, in the city of Pittsburg, in Allegheny county, Pennsylvania, this arsenal being a subpost of Ft. Niagara, New York. From time to time before September 10th, 1903, some copper down spouts and eve troughs had been stripped from some of the buildings on the arsenal grounds and the material stolen, and other depredations, such as the breaking of window lights, had been committed on the arsenal property. Lieut. Col. Robertson, the commanding officer at Ft. Niagara, on the occasion of an inspection of Allegheny arsenal, in July, 1903, had directed Lieut. Drury to use his best endeavors to stop the depredations, and to that end ordered him to establish a patrol of the guards day and night upon the arsenal grounds, and to apprehend and arrest any person or persons committing depredations on the arsenal property. Shortly before 10 o'clock on the morning of September 10th, 1903, having received word that some persons were stealing copper from one of the buildings on the arsenal grounds, Lieut. Drury took John Dowd, then on guard duty, and another private soldier (each of the latter being armed with a rifle and ammunition), and, passing out of \n\n[200 U.S. 1, 3]\n\u00a0\n the arsenal grounds through the gate on Butler street, the three proceeded by way of Butler street and Almond alley towards the Allegheny Valley Railroad. Drury informed the two men of the reported stealing of copper, and instructed them to continue down Almond alley and arrest any person coming from the arsenal. Drury himself left Almond alley at the corner of Willow street, and went by Willow street to Fortieth street (which runs along, but outside of, the arsenal wall), and proceeded down Fortieth street to its foot, where were congregated three or four half-grown boys or young men, among whom was William H. Crowley, aged about nineteen or twenty years. These persons fled in different directions when they saw Lieut. Drury approaching. Crowley ran from the foot of Fortieth street away from the arsenal property in the direction of Forty-first street, keeping on or near the Allegheny Valley Railroad. When he was about 100 yards from the arsenal wall, Crowley was shot by Dowd, who aimed and fired his rifle at Crowley. At the time of the shooting, Drury, Dowd, and Crowley were all off the ground belonging to the United States. Each one of the three then stood either upon a street of the city, on the Allegheny Valley Railroad, or on private property. The rifle ball struck Crowley's left thigh, inflicting a mortal wound, from which he died on the evening of the same day,-September 10th, 1903\n\n\n\n'Thus far the facts are not open to dispute under the testimony. But as to the circumstances attending the shooting of Crowley, the evidence is conflicting, and leads to opposite conclusions of fact as one or other version of the affair given by the witnesses is accepted. Dowd testifies, and the petitioners have produced other evidence tending to show, that as Crowley fled, he was called on several times by Dowd, who followed him, to halt, with warning that, unless he halted, Dowd would fire; that Crowley did not halt, but continued his flight, and, to prevent his escape behind or through a lumber pile, Dowd fired, and that Drury did not order Dowd to fire, and was not connected with the shooting save by the fact that he ordered the \n\n[200 U.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n arrest of any person coming from the arsenal. On the other hand, two witnesses who were present (Mrs. Long and Miss Terwillerger) testify that before the shot was fired Crowley stopped, turned around, and facing the pursuing soldier (Dowd), threw up his hand, said, 'Don't shoot, I will come back,' or 'I will give up,' and just then Lieut. Drury said 'Fire' and Dowd fired the shot that killed Crowley. The testimony of at least one other witness tends to corroborate the account of the transaction given by the two named women, as above recited. It is not for me to say whether or not the witnesses who have testified thus on the part of the commonwealth are mistaken.\n\n'In view of all the evidence herein, should this court interfere to prevent the trial of the petitioners upon the indictment in the state court,-take the petitioners out of the custody of the authorities of the state, and discharge them finally, without trial by any civil court in the regular administration of justice? This is the question which confronts me.' 129 Fed. 823.\n\n The court entered an order discharging the writ, and remanding petitioners to the custody of the warden of the jail of Allegheny county, and from that order this appeal was allowed and prosecuted.\n\n\n[200 U.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n In Baker v. Grice, \n169 \nU.S. 284, 290\n, 42 S. L. ed. 748, 750, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 323, an appeal from the final order of the circuit court of the United States for the northern district of Texas, in habeas corpus, it was said:\n'The court below had jurisdiction to issue the writ, and to decide the questions which were argued before it. Ex parte Royall, \n117 U.S. 241\n, 29 L. ed. 868, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 734; Whitten v. Tomlinson, \n160 U.S. 231\n, 40 L. ed. 406, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 297. In the latter case most of the prior authorities are mentioned. From these cases it clearly appears, as the settled and proper procedure, that while circuit courts of the United States have jurisdiction, under the circumstances set forth in the foregoing statement, to issue the writ of habeas corpus, yet those courts ought not to exercise that jurisdiction by the discharge of a prisoner unless in cases of peculiar urgency; and that instead of discharging, they will leave the prisoner to be dealt with by the courts of the state; that after a final determination of the case by the state court, the Federal courts will even then generally leave the petitioner to his remedy by writ of error from \n\n[200 U.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n this court. The reason for this course is apparent. It is an exceedingly delicate jurisdiction given to the Federal courts by which a person under an indictment in a state court, and subject to its laws, may, by the decision of a single judge of the Federal court, upon a writ of habeas corpus, be taken out of the custody of the officers of the state, and finally discharged therefrom, and thus a trial by the state courts of an indictment found under the laws of a state be finally prevented. Cases have occurred of so exceptional a nature that this course has been pursued. Such are the cases Re Loney (Thomas v. Loney) \n134 U.S. 372\n, 33 L. ed. 949, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 584, and Re Neagle (Cunningham v. Neagle) \n135 U.S. 1\n, 34 L. ed. 55, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 658; but the reasons for the interference of the Federal court in each of those cases were extraordinary, and presented what this court regarded as such exceptional facts as to justify the interference of the Federal tribunal. Unless this case be of such an exceptional nature, we ought not to encourage the interference of the Federal court below with the regular course of justice in the state court.'\n\n The rule thus declared is well settled, and, in our judgment, it was properly applied in this case. Crowley was a citizen of Pennsylvania, not in the service of the United States, and was killed in or near a street of the city of Pittsburg, and not on property belonging to the United States or over which the United States had jurisdiction.\n The homicide occurred within the territorial jurisdiction of the court of oyer and terminer, which, as Judge Acheson observed, was the only civil court which could have jurisdiction to try petitioners for the alleged unlawful killing, and the indictment presented a case cognizable by that court.\n The general jurisdiction, in time of peace, of the civil courts of a state over persons in the military service of the United States, who are accused of a capital crime or of any offence against the person of a citizen, committed within the state, is, of course, not denied.\n But it is contended on behalf of the government that the state court was absolutely without jurisdiction to try petitioners for the killing of Crowley, because the homicide was committed \n\n[200 U.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n by them 'while in the lawful performance of a duty and obligation imposed upon them by the Constitution and laws of the United States.' The argument is that Crowley had been guilty of the crime of larceny, and could have been indicted and prosecuted on the charge of felony in the district court of the United States, under  5439 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3675), or under  5391 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3651), the United States having jurisdiction over the Allegheny arsenal property, and the Pennsylvania laws making what Crowley is alleged to have done a felony. Hence that it was the duty of petitioners to arrest Crowley, and to surrender him to the Federal authorities for prosecution. And it is insisted that the fact is 'established that Crowley met his death while attempting to escape arrest.' But there was a conflict of evidence as to whether Crowley had or had not surrendered; and it is conceded that if he had, it could not reasonably be claimed that the fatal shot was fired in the performance of a duty imposed by the Federal law, and the state court had jurisdiction.\n The circuit court was not called on to determine the guilt or innocence of the accused. That was for the state court if it had jurisdiction, and this the state court had, even though it was petitioner's duty to pursue and arrest Crowley (assuming that he had stolen pieces of copper), if the question of Crowley being a fleeing felon was open to dispute on the evidence; that is, if that were the gist of the case, it was for the state court to pass upon it, and its doing so could not be collaterally attacked. The assertion that Crowley was resisting arrest, and in flight when shot, was matter of defense, and Ex parte Crouch, \n112 U.S. 178\n, 28 L. ed. 690, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 96, is in point.\n We have repeatedly held that the acts of Congress in relation to habeas corpus do not imperatively require the circuit courts to wrest petitioners from the custody of state officers in advance of trial in the state courts, and that those courts may decline to discharge, in the proper exercise of discretion. We think that discretion was properly exercised in this case.\n Final order affirmed. \n\n\n\n","165":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. AMERICAN SUGAR REFINING CO(1906)\nNo. 269\nArgued: April 27, 1906Decided: May 28, 1906\n\n\n\n\n[202 U.S. 563, 564]\n\u00a0\n The question in the case is whether certain sugars which were imported between the 12th of June and the 28th of September, 1903, were chargeable with full duties under the tariff act of July 24, 1897 [30 Stat. at L. 151, chap. 11, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1626], or were entitled to 20 per cent reduction of duties prescribed by that act, under the treaty between the United States and Cuba of the date December 11, 1902, and an act of Congress of December 17, 1903 [33 Stat. at L. 3, chap. 1, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1905, p. 393]. The answer to the question depends upon when the treaty went into effect; whether upon the 10th of April, 1903, or the 27th of December, 1903. The appellant contends for the former and the appellee for the latter date. Duties were assessed under the act of 1897 without reduction. Protests were filed and an appeal taken to the board of appraisers, who sustained the collector. The decision of the board was reversed by the circuit court. The treaty provided (33 Stat. at L. 2136, 2142) among other things as follows:\n'The President of the United States of America . . . and the President of the Republic of Cuba . . . have, in consideration of and in compensation for the respective concessions and engagements made by each to the other, as hereinafter recited, agreed, and do hereby agree, upon the following articles for the regulation and government of their reciprocal trade, namely:\n\n ... * *\n Article 2.\n'During the term of this convention all articles of merchandise not included in the foregoing article 1, and being the product of the soil or industry of the Republic of Cuba, imported into the United States, shall be admitted at a reduction of 20 per centum of the rates of duty thereon, as provided by the tariff act of the United States, approved July 24th, 1897, or \n\n[202 U.S. 563, 565]\n\u00a0\n as may be provided by any tariff law of the United States subsequently enacted.'\n\n Article 11 was as follows:\n'The present convention shall be ratified by the appropriate authorities of the respective countries, and the ratifications shall be exchanged at Washington, District of Columbia, United States of America, as soon as may be before the thirty-first day of January, 1903, and the convention shall go into effect on the tenth day after the exchange of ratifications, and shall continue in force for the term of five (5) years from date of going into effect, and from year to year thereafter until the expiration of one year from the day when either of the contracting parties shall give notice to the other of its intention to terminate the same.'\n\n By supplemental treaty signed January 26, 1903 (33 Stat. at L. 2145), it was provided that 'the respective ratifications of the said convention shall be exchanged as soon as possible, and within two months from January 31, 1903.'\n March 19, 1903, the Senate added the following amendment at the end of article 11: 'This convention shall not take effect until the same shall have been approved by the Congress.'\n On March 31, 1903, ratifications were exchanged. At this date Congress was not in session, but was convened in special session November 9, 1903, and passed on December 17, 1903 (33 Stat. at L. 3, chap. 1, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1905, p. 393) an act entitled: 'An Act to Carry into Effect a Convention between the United States and the Republic of Cuba, Signed on the 11th Day of December in the Year 1902.' Section 1 provides as follows:\n'That whenever the President of the United States shall receive satisfactory evidence that the Republic of Cuba has made provision to give full effect to the articles of the convention between the United States and the Republic of Cuba, signed on the eleventh day of December, in the year nineteen hundred and two, he is hereby authorized to issue his proclamation declaring that he has received such evidence, and thereupon, on the tenth day after exchange of ratifications of such convention be- \n\n[202 U.S. 563, 566]\n\u00a0\n tween the United States and the Republic of Cuba, and so long as the said convention shall remain in force, all articles of merchandise being the product of the soil or industry of the Republic of Cuba, which are now imported into the United States free of duty, shall continue to be so admitted free of duty, and all other articles of merchandise being the product of the soil or industry of the Republic of Cuba imported into the United States shall be admitted at a reduction of twenty per centum of the rates of duty thereon, as provided by the tariff act of the United States approved July twenty-four, eighteen hundred and ninety-seven, or as may be provided by any tariff law of the United States subsequently enacted. The rates of duty herein granted by the United States to the Republic of Cuba are, and shall continue, during the term of said convention, preferential in respect to all like imports from other countries: Provided, That, while said convention is in force, no sugar imported from the Republic of Cuba, and being the product of the soil or industry of the Republic of Cuba, shall be admitted into the United States at a reduction of duty greater than twenty per centum of the rates of duty thereon, as provided by the tariff act of the United States approved July twenty-fourth, eighteen hundred and ninety-seven, and no sugar the product of any other foreign country shall be admitted by treaty or convention into the United States while this convention is in force at a lower rate of duty than that provided by the tariff act of the United States approved July twenty- fourth, eighteen hundred and ninety-seven: And provided further, That nothing herein contained shall be held or construed as an admission on the part of the House of Representatives that customs duties can be changed otherwise than by an act of Congress originating in said House.'\n\n The same day (December 17, 1903) the President issued his proclamation (33 Stat. at L. 2136), which, after setting forth the treaty and the act of Congress, and reciting the above facts, together with the fact that ratifications of said convention had been exchanged on March 31, 1903, declared: \n\n[202 U.S. 563, 567]\n\u00a0\n And whereas satisfactory evidence has been received by the President of the United States that the Republic of Cuba has made provision to give full effect to the articles of said convention;\n'Now, therefore, be it known that I, Theodore Roosevelt, President of the United States of America, in conformity with the said act of Congress, do hereby declare and proclaim the said convention, as amended by the Senate of the United States, to be in effect on the tenth day from the date of this, my proclamation.'\n\n Solicitor General Hoyt, Attorney General Moody, and Mr. William R. Harr for appellant.\n\n\n[202 U.S. 563, 571]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John G. Johnson, John E. Parsons, and H. B. Closson for appellee.\n Messrs. Edward S. Hatch and J. Stuart Tompkins for importers having interests similar to those of appellee.\n\n\n\n\n[202 U.S. 563, 576]\n\u00a0\n\n After stating the case as above, Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n The treaty as drafted and presented to the Senate provided for an exchange of ratifications at Washington as soon as might be before the 31st day of January, 1903, and should 'go into effect on the tenth day after the exchange of ratifications.' A supplemental convention became necessary, and an exchange of ratifications was provided to be 'as soon as possible and within two months from January 31, 1903.' But subsequent to that date, to wit, March 19, 1903, the Senate added the amendment: 'This convention shall not take effect until the same shall have been approved by the Congress.' Between the treaty, therefore, and the amendment, there was an emphatic difference. The date at which the instrument should go into effect was changed. It cannot be said that the treaty provision related to time and the amendment to sanction merely, and adopted the time of the treaty. To do this would be to interpret the words of the treaty one way and the same words in the amendment another way. We start, then, with the proposition that not the treaty, but the act of Congress, was to fix the date that the treaty should take effect. What date Congress fixed is the question to be considered. It was certainly competent for Congress ( with the consent of Cuba) \n\n[202 U.S. 563, 577]\n\u00a0\n to have given the treaty retrospective, immediate, or prospective operation. Which did Congress do? And in reply we are to remember there is a presumption against retrospective operation, and we have said that words in a statute ought not to have such operation 'unless they are so clear, strong, and imperative that no other meaning can be annexed to them, or unless the intention of the legislature cannot be otherwise satisfied.' United States v. Burr, \n159 U.S. 78\n, 40 L. ed. 82, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1002. On the other hand, it must be admitted that there are words in the act of Congress which, if not of themselves, yet, in connection with events, may be said to look to a retrospective operation. It is not, however, an unusual judicial problem to have to seek the meaning of a law expressed in words not doubtful of themselves, but made so by circumstances or the objects to which they come to be applied.\n Both the treaty and the act of Congress concern tariff duties, and 'the usual course in tariff legislation,' we have said, 'has been, inasmuch as some time is necessary to enable importers and business men to act understandingly, to fix a future date at which the statutes are to become operative.' United States v. Burr, supra. And these remarks have application here. The treaty, it may be admitted, was intended as a beneficial concession to Cuba. But conditions in the United States were also to be considered, and we cannot assume that this would have been overlooked by Congress when legislating. It is true, as urged by appellant, that the act of December 17 deals entirely with importations from Cuba, but it is those which would have the most disturbing effect, and on account of which business in like products would have to be accommodated. These, as well as the considerations urged by the appellant, must be kept in mind in seeking the meaning of Congress, and we repeat that, under the Senate amendment, it is the meaning of Congress not the meaning of the convention independent of that of Congress, we are to ascertain. It was open to Cuba to reject the amendment; it was open to Cuba to reject the legislation. If she chose to accept both they became her contracts. \n\n[202 U.S. 563, 578]\n\u00a0\n Turning to the act of December 17 we find it expressed in the simple future tense, and this must be given weight. United States v. Goldenberg, \n168 \nU.S. 95, 102\n, 42 S. L. ed. 394, 398, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 3. So far as the text of the act itself is concerned all of its parts accord; all of its provisions are prospective but one. That pertained to the then present, the date of the act. It provided that all products which were imported free should continue to be admitted free. The provision is 'all articles . . . which are now imported . . . free of duty shall continue to be so admitted . . .' This accords with and reinforces the prospective provisions, and was apparently used with deliberate and provident intention, making the act provide for the present and future, excluding the past, certainly not expressing it. Passing from the text of the act, an element of confusion appears. Ratifications had been exchanged between the United States and Cuba on March 31, 1903. The text of the act provides 'that whenever the President . . . shall receive satisfactory evidence that the Republic of Cuba has made provision to give full effect to the article of the convention . . . he is hereby authorized to issue his proclamation declaring that he has received such evidence, and thereupon, on the tenth day after exchange of ratifications of such convention, . . . and so long as the said convention shall remain in force, all articles of merchandise being the product . . . of the Republic of Cuba, which are now imported . . . free of duty shall continue to be so admitted free of duty, and all other articles . . . shall be admitted at a reduction of 20 per cent of the rates of duty thereon as provided by the tariff act of the United States approved July 24, 1897 . . .' The words of the act, therefore, refer manifestly to an event to occur, which seemingly had already occurred, and, upon such event, it is contended, the treaty, by its own terms and by the act of Congress took effect; to wit, 'the exchange of ratifications' of the convention. To this the government replies that Congress, not being in session at the time, was ignorant that ratifications had been exchanged, and framed its legislation with the view that some further provision by Cuba was neces- \n\n[202 U.S. 563, 579]\n\u00a0\n sary. If we may not accept the explanation of Congress's ignorance, it is not unreasonable to suppose that Congress considered it was still open to Cuba to accept or reject the treaty, and to make sure of her acceptance before the treaty should go into effect in the United States. This view satisfies completely the text of the act. We cannot suppose that, if Congress intended to give retrospective operation to the act, it would have used the words that expressed the contrary. The day at which the treaty should operate was important, and would necessarily be ever present in mind, and it was of easy expression. Future time and past time are directly opposite, and by no inadvertance or intention can we believe or suppose that Congress, having in mind and purpose the distinction between the past and the future, should use language that expressed the one while it meant to provide for the other.\n There is another important fact. The treaty was a reciprocal arrangement and intended to go into effect coincidently in the United States and Cuba. The two nations provided for this. On the day the President approved the act of Congress, he issued his proclamation declaring that the treaty should go into effect on the 27th day of December. On the 17th of December the President of Cuba also issued his proclamation, stating that Congress had approved the treaty in accordance with the requirements of article 11, and declaring that the treaty should take effect in Cuba on the day named in the proclamation of the President of the United States,-December 27, 1903. This coincident operation is of the very essence of the convention. It would indeed be anomalous if a treaty which provided the reciprocal concessions should be in operation in one nation eight months before it was in operation in the other. And this is not adequately answered as appellee answers it, by saying that the President of Cuba and the President of the United States were both mistaken as to the date of the operation of the treaty, and their mistake could not affect the rights of importers. Certainly not if a mistake could be conceded. But the action of the Presidents is proof against \n\n[202 U.S. 563, 580]\n\u00a0\n the existence of mistakes. It shows the understanding of the Executives of the two countries, and affords confirmation of the view that Congress contemplated action subsequent to its legislation to put the treaty into effect.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court is reversed and the case remanded, with directions to affirm the order of the Board of General Appraisers. \n\n\n\n","166":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. CHEROKEE NATION(1906)\nNo. 346\nArgued: Decided: April 30, 1906\n\n\n\n\n[202 U.S. 101, 102]\n\u00a0\n Section 68 of the act of Congress of July 1, 1902, entitled 'An Act to Provide for the Allotment of the Lands of the Cherokee Nation, for the Disposition of Town Sites Therein [Described], and for Other Purposes' (32 Stat. at L. 726, chap. 1375), reads as follows:\n'Jurisdiction is hereby conferred upon the court of claims to examine, consider, and adjudicate, with a right of appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States by any party in interest feeling aggrieved at the decision of the court of claims, any claim which the Cherokee tribe, or any band thereof, arising under treaty stipulations, may have against the United States, upon which suit shall be instituted within two years after the approval of this act; and also to examine, consider, and adjudicate any claim which the United States may have against said tribe, or any band thereof. The institution, prosecution, or defense, as the case may be, on the part of the tribe or any band, of any such suit, shall be through attorneys employed and to be compensated in the manner prescribed in sections twenty-one hundred and three to twenty-one hundred and six, both inclusive, of the Revised Statutes of the United States, the tribe acting through its principal chief in the employment of such attorneys, and the band acting through a committee recognized by the Secretary of the Interior. The court of claims shall have full authority, by proper orders and \n\n[202 U.S. 101, 103]\n\u00a0\n process, to make parties to any such suit all persons whose presence in the litigation it may deem necessary or proper to the final determination of the matter in controversy, and any such suit shall, on motion of either party, be advanced on the docket of either of said courts and be determined at the earliest practicable time.'\n\n February 20, 1903, the Cherokee Nation filed a petition in the court of claims asking judgment on an account rendered by Slade & Bender, pursuant to the treaty of March 3, 1893 (27 Stat. at L. 640, chap. 209), with interest.\n March 3, 1903, an act was approved entitled 'An Act Making Appropriations for the Current and Contingent Expenses of the Indian Department and for Fulfilling Treaty Stipulations with Various Indian Tribes for the Fiscal Year Ending June Thirtieth, Nineteen Hundred and Four, and for Other Purposes' (32 Stat. at L. 996, chap. 994), containing the following provisions:\n'Section sixty-eight of the act of Congress entitled 'An Act to Provide for the Allotment of the Lands of the Cherokee Nation, for the Disposition of Town Sites Therein, and for Other Purposes,' approved July 1st, nineteen hundred and two, shall be so construed as to give the Eastern Cherokees, so called, including those in the Cherokee Nation and those who remained east of the Mississippi river, acting together or as two bodies, as they may be advised, the status of a band or bands, as the case may be, for all the purposes of said section: Provided, That the prosecution of such suit on the part of the Eastern Cherokees shall be through attorneys employed by their proper authorities, their compensation for expenses and services rendered in relation to such claim to be fixed by the court of claims upon the termination of such suit; and said section shall be further so construed as to require that both the Cherokee Nation and said Eastern Cherokees, so called, shall be made parties to any suit which may be instituted against the United States under said section upon the claim mentioned in House of Representatives' Executive Document Numbered Three Hundred and Nine of the second session of the \n\n[202 U.S. 101, 104]\n\u00a0\n Fifty-seventh Congress; and if said claim shall be sustained in whole or in part, the court claims, subject to the right of appeal named in said section, shall be authorized to render a judgment in favor of the rightful claimant, and also to determine, as between the different claimants, to whom the judgment so rendered equitably belongs, either wholly or in part, and shall be required to determine whether, for the purpose of participating in said claim, the Cherokee Indians who remained east of the Mississippi river constitute a part of the Cherokee Nation or of the Eastern Cherokees, so called, as the case may be.'\n\n The claim mentioned in said H. R. Ex. Doc. No. 309, 57th Cong., 2d sess., is therein referred to as 'the award rendered under the Cherokee agreement of December 19, 1891, ratified by act of Congress approved March 3, 1893.'\n March 14, 1903, a petition was filed on behalf of all the Eastern Cherokees, both west and east of the Mississippi river, alleging in substance that there was due to the Eastern Cherokees, upon the account of Slade & Bender, the sum of $1,111,284.70, with interest from June 12, 1838, as an award against the United States or, if the court should not hold said account as an award, the sum of $1,761,447.27, with interest at 5 per cent from the same date, together with interest on the income annually accruing, at the rate of 5 per cent per annum until paid, by virtue of the treaties of 1828 (7 Stat. at L. 313) and the treaty of 1835-1836, commonly known as the 'treaty of New Echota.' [7 Stat. at L. 478.] But at the trial of the case no contention was made for this larger amount.\n March 20, 1903, a petition was filed on behalf of certain Eastern Cherokees, living east of the Mississippi, amended September 3, 1903, when petitioners took the title of the Eastern and Emigrant Cherokees, asserting their claim to a pro rata share of--\n'That portion of the removal and subsistence fund improperly taken by the United States from the five-million fund on account of removal of Eastern Cherokees, as found \n\n[202 U.S. 101, 105]\n\u00a0\n by the expert accountants, Messrs. Slade & Bender, April 28, 1894, the said five-million fund being an interest-bearing fund in the hands of the United States, as trustee, and representing the money paid by the government to the Eastern Cherokees for the sale of their lands in North Carolina, Georgia, and Tennessee, or east of the Mississippi river, as set forth in article 1st of the treaty of New Echota, in north Georgia, on March 14, 1835, and articles 2 and 3 of the supplemental treaty proclaimed May 23, 1836 [7 Stat. at L. 488], this sum so misapplied amounting, in accordance with said accounting, to $1,111,284.70, with interest at 5 per cent per annum from the date of said wrongful taking, June 12, 1838, to date.'\n\n The three petitions were consolidated and heard as one case, and although in effect the proceedings were in equity, findings of fact and conclusions of law were filed.\n Among the facts found were these:\n\n\n XVIII.\n\n\n By  14 of the act of Congress entitled 'An Act Making Appropriations for the Current and Contingent Expenses of the Indian Department, and for Fulfilling Treaty Stipulations with Various Indian Tribes for the Year Ending June 30, 1890, and for Other Purposes,' approved March 2, 1889 (25 Stat. at L. 1005, chap. 412), the President was authorized to appoint three commissioners to negotiate with the Indian tribes owning or claiming lands lying west of the 96th degree of longitude in the Indian territory for the cession to the United States of all their title, claim, or interest of every kind or character in and to said lands, and he did appoint David H. Jerome, Alfred M. Wilson, and Warren G. Sayre such commissioners.\n By virtue of the authority contained in an act of the Cherokee national council, approved November 16, 1891, Elias C. Boudinot, Joseph A. Scales, Roach Young, William Triplett, Thomas Smith, Joseph Smallwood, and George Downing were duly appointed commissioners--\n'To meet and enter into negotiations with the above-named \n\n[202 U.S. 101, 106]\n\u00a0\n commission, appointed by the President of the United States, for the cession of the lands of the Cherokee Nation west of the 96th degree of west longitude, and for the final adjustment of all questions of interest between the United States and the Cherokee Nation which are now unsettled.'\n\n By said act of Congress it was made the duty of said commissioners appointed by the President to report all agreements resulting from such negotiations to the President, to be by him reported to the Congress at its next session, and by the act of the Cherokee council it was made the duty of the commissioners, on the part of the Cherokee Nation, to report all their proceedings in full to the national council for its approval and ratification. Ex. Doc. 56, 52d Cong., 1st sess., 17.\n At the outset of the negotiations between said commissioners for the purchase and sale of said lands, which were known as the 'Cherokee Outlet,' the commissioners on the part of the Cherokee Nation renewed their claims and contentions with respect to the balances alleged to be due to them under various treaties, and particularly their contention that the so called treaty fund had been improperly charged with the expense of the removal of the Eastern Cherokees to the Indian territory, and demanded as 'a condition precedent to any agreement for the sale of the land' that some adjustment of such contentions should be made.\n On the 19th of December, 1891, after prolonged negotiations, the commissioners above named entered into articles of agreement, by article 1 of which it was agreed that--\n'The Cherokee Nation, by act duly passed, shall cede and relinquish all its title, claim, and interest of every kind and character in and to that part of the Indian territory bounded on the west by the one hundredth ( 100 ) degree of west longitude, on the north by the state of Kansas, on the east by the ninety-sixth (96 ) degree west longitude, and on the south by the Creek Nation, the territory of Oklahoma, and the Cheyenne and Arapahoe reservation created or defined by Executive order, dated August 10, 1860, the tract of land \n\n[202 U.S. 101, 107]\n\u00a0\n embraced within the above boundaries containing eight million, one hundred and forty-four thousand, six hundred and eighty-two and ninety-one one- hundredths (8,144,682.91) acres, more or less.'\n\n By article 2 that--\n'For and in consideration of the above cession and relinquishment the United States agrees:'\n\n First. That it will remove from the limits of the Cherokee Nation as trespassers certain described persons.\n Second. That a certain article of the antecedent treaty of July, 1866 [ 14 Stat. at L. 799], should be abrogated and held for naught.\n Third. That the judicial tribunals of the Cherokee Nation should have exclusive jurisdiction in certain cases.\n Fourth. That--\n'The United States shall, without delay, render to the Cherokee Nation, through any agent appointed by authority of the national council, a complete account of moneys due the Cherokee Nation under any of the treaties ratified in the years 1817, 1819, 1825,* 1828, 1835-1836, 1846, 1866, and 1868 [7 Stat. at L. 156, 195, 228, 311, 478; 9 Stat. at L. 871; 14 Stat. at L. 799; and 16 Stat. at L. 727], and any laws passed by the Congress of the United States for the purpose of carrying said treaties, or any of them, into effect; and upon such accounting, should the Cherokee Nation, by its national council, conclude and determine that such accounting is incorrect or unjust, then the Cherokee Nation shall have the right, within twelve months, to enter suit against the United States in the court of claims, with the right of appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States by either party, for any alleged or declared amount of money promised but withheld by the United States from the Cherokee Nation, under any of said treaties or laws, which may be claimed to be omitted from, or improperly or unjustly or illegally adjusted in, said accounting; and the Congress of the United States shall, at its next session after such case shall be finally decided and certified to Congress according to law, appropriate a sufficient sum of money to pay such judgment to the Cherokee Nation, should judgment be ren-\n\n * No such treaty appears to have been made in this year. The treaty intended was doubtless the one made October 24, 1804 (7 Stat. at L. 228), and not proclaimed until May 17, 1824.-Ed. \n\n[202 U.S. 101, 108]\n\u00a0\n dered in her favor; or, if it shall be found upon such accounting that any sum of money has been so withheld, the amount shall be duly appropriated by Congress, payable to the Cherokee Nation, upon the order of its national council, such appropriation to be made by Congress, if then in session, and if not, then at the session immediately following such accounting.'\n Fifth. That certain citizens of the Cherokee Nation should have the right to select lands as homesteads under certain conditions; and\n Sixth. In addition to all of the foregoing enumerated considerations for the cession and relinquishment of title to the described lands, the United States shall pay to the Cherokee Nation, at such times and in such manner as the Cherokee national council shall determine, the sum of $8,595, 736.12 in excess of the sum of $728,389.46, the aggregate of amounts heretofore appropriated by Congress and charged against the lands of the Cherokees west of the Arkansas river.\n Said articles of agreement were accepted, ratified, and confirmed on the part of the Cherokee Nation by an act of the national council approved January 4, 1892, and were also accepted, ratified, and confirmed on the part of the United States by act of Congress of March 3, 1893 (27 Stat. at L. 640, chap. 209).\n Prior to the acceptance and ratification of said agreement on the part of the United States, as aforesaid, the commissioners on behalf of the United States, as required by the law under which they were appointed, had reported to the President the making of the articles of agreement aforesaid, and by way of explanation said:\n'As to the conditions of the agreement, besides the relinquishment of title upon the one part and the payment of a price in money on the other, it is necessary to state that the settlement of the matters contained in such conditions were made a condition precedent to any agreement for the sale of the land.\n\n'The accounting provided for in the fourth subdivision of article 2 of the agreement is inserted and agreed to, because \n\n[202 U.S. 101, 109]\n\u00a0\n the Cherokees are compelled to accept the construction of the treaties made by the executive and administrative branches of the government.\n\n'Whatever that construction is, the Indian must abide by. There is no appeal except to Congress. Without going specifically into details, the Cherokees claim that upon a just accounting upon a proper construction of the treaties named, a large sum of money, principal and interest, will be found due them. They also desire to include lands as well as money, but they were induced to eliminate 'lands' from the provision. With that eliminated, the provision was agreed to, as set out. The government has made the accounting, has kept the books, has construed the treaties. If that has been done properly, no harm can come from restating the account. If it has not been done properly, no possible reason can exist why the error should not be corrected.' Sen. Ex. Doc. 56, 52d Cong., 1st sess., pp. 11, 12.\n\n Gen. Thomas J. Morgan, Commissioner of Indian Affairs, in his report to the Secretary of the Interior on February 6, 1892, made the following explanation and comment on the 4th section of article 2, to wit:\n'The 4th section of article 2 provides for an accounting between the United States and the Cherokee Nation. The work necessary to render this account will be very heavy, and much time will be necessary to properly prepare the same. On this provision of the agreement the commissioners say:\n\n\"The government has made the accounting, has kept the books, has construed the treaties. If this has been done properly, no harm can come from restating the account. If it has not been done properly, no possible reason can exist why the error should not be corrected. It creates no new obligations against the government, but only provides for legal discharge of the old ones.'\n\n'This seems to me to be a reasonable view to take of this provision, and I do not see that any valid objection could be advanced against it. \n\n[202 U.S. 101, 110]\n\u00a0\n 'In your reference of the matter to this office you said:\n\n\"Particular attention is called to  4 of article 2 of the agreement, with request for a full report as to what may be the state of the account between the United States and the Cherokees, if practicable, within a reasonable time; if not, your general conclusions.'\n\n'In reply to this indorsement I have the honor to say that if this section is construed to require the United States to state an account of moneys stipulated to be paid to the Cherokee Nation under the treaties therein specified and under the various appropriation acts to carry the same into effect, this account could be prepared by this office within a reasonable time, say about two months. If, on the other hand, it be construed to require a detailed statement of all the moneys received and disbursements made by the United States of the Cherokee funds under said treaties and acts of Congress, which seems to me to be the intention of the parties negotiating the agreement, it would require the services of an expert accountant, with assistants, probably twelve months or more to review and copy the Cherokee accounts and records running back nearly a century. In order to prepare a statement of this kind it would require an appropriation by Congress of the sum of at least $5,000 to pay for the services of an expert accountant, and in the draft of a bill for the ratification of the agreement herewith inclosed, I have provided for the appropriation of that sum, or so much thereof as may be necessary for that purpose.'

No. 56, 52d Cong., 1st sess., p. 8.\n\n This report of the Commissioner was, on or about February 8, 1892, referred by the Secretary of the Interior to the Assistant Attorney General for the Interior Department 'for his consideration and report upon the legality of the contract, the sufficiency of the proposed bill, and his views upon the questions of law relating to the subject,' and on or about February 25, 1892, said officer reported thereon, as appears \n\n[202 U.S. 101, 111]\n\u00a0\n in said Senate Executive Document 56, Fifty-second Congress, first session, saying, among other things:\n'The report and agreement were referred to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, who, under date of February 6, 1892, reported favorably on the agreement, and transmitted with his report the draft of a bill to be submitted to Congress to ratify and carry out the provisions thereof. . . . The agreement contains two articles. The first relates to the cession and the second to the consideration therefor. . . .\n\n'The considerations for said cession, as contained in article 2, are set forth under six subdivisions. . . .\n\n'The fourth and next provision of article 2 of the agreement requires the United States to render to the Cherokee Nation a complete accounting of all money agreed to be paid to the Indians, or which they may be entitled to under any treaty or act of Congress since 1817. And, if said accounting is satisfactory, Congress shall make the necessary appropriation to pay the same. But if the accounting is not satisfactory, then the Cherokees to have the right to institute suit in the court of claims against the United States for the claimed amount, and Congress is to make the necessary appropriation to pay the judgment, if any, recovered.\n\n'I see nothing in the stipulations herein to comment upon. It seems right and promotive of good feeling that there should be a full and final settlement of all claims and accounts of these Indians against the United States, and I think the terms of agreement are sufficiently clear to secure such accounting.\n\n'The Commissioner of Indian Affairs asks for a special appropriation of $5,000 to enable him to make the accounting.'\n\n All of these reports were before the Congress when it accepted and ratified said articles of agreement by act of March 3, 1893 (27 Stat. at L. 641, chap. 209), in the following language, to wit:\n'Which said agreement is fully set forth in the message of the President of the United States, communicating the same to Congress, known as Executive Document No. 56 of the first session of the Fifty-second Congress, the lands referred \n\n[202 U.S. 101, 112]\n\u00a0\n to being commonly known and called the 'Cherokee Outlet;' and said agreement is hereby ratified by the Congress of the United States, subject, however, to the Constitution and laws of the United States and the acts of Congress that have been or may be passed regulating trade and intercourse with the Indians, and subject also to certain amendments thereto, as follows: . . . [Amendments not important here.] . . .\n\n'And the provisions of said agreements so amended shall be fully performed and carried out on the part of the United States; Provided that the money hereby appropriated shall be immediately available, and the remaining sum of eight million, three hundred thousand dollars, or so much thereof as is required to carry out the provisions of said agreement as amended and according to this act, to be payable in five equal annual instalments, commencing on the fourth day of March, eighteen hundred and ninety-five, and ending on the fourth day of March, eighteen hundred and ninety-nine, said deferred payments to bear interest at the rate of four per centum per annum, to be paid annually, and the amount required for the payment of interest as aforesaid is hereby appropriated; . . .\n\n'The acceptance by the Cherokee Nation of Indians of any of the money appropriated as herein set forth shall be considered and taken and shall operate as a ratification by said Cherokee Nation of Indians of said agreement, as it is hereby proposed to be amended, and as a full and complete relinquishment and extinguishment of all their title, claim, and interest in and to said lands; . . .\n\n'And said lands, except the portion to be allotted as provided in said agreement, shall, upon the payment of the sum of two hundred and niney-five thousand, seven hundred and thirty-six dollars, herein appropriated, to be immediately paid, become, and be taken to be, and treated as, a part of the public domain.' \n\n[202 U.S. 101, 113]\n\u00a0\n XIX.\n\n By said act of March 3, 1893, ratifying said agreement for the purchase of the 'Cherokee Outlet,' the Congress also provided as follows:\n'The sum of five thousand dollars, or so much thereof as may be necessary, the same to be immediately available, is hereby appropriated, out of any money in the treasury not otherwise appropriated, to enable the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, to employ such expert person or persons to properly render a complete account to the Cherokee Nation of moneys due said nation, as required in the fourth subdivision of article 2 of said agreement.'\n\n Thereafter James A. Slade and Joseph T. Bender were employed as experts under the provisions of said section of said act, and they made and rendered an account pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 4 of article 2 of the articles of agreement of December 19, 1891, as ratified and affirmed by said act of March 3, 1893. Said account was, by the Secretary of the Interior, referred to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs for examination and report, and the same having been examined and approved by said Commissioner, was by the latter returned to the Secretary of the Interior, who transmitted the same to the Cherokee Nation by delivering a copy thereof to R. F. Wyley, its properly constituted agent for receiving the same, and said account so made, rendered, and transmitted, was accepted by the Cherokee Nation by an act of its national council approved December 1, 1894, and no suit was thereafter brought by the Cherokee Nation against the United States, charging that said account was in anywise incorrect or unjust, but, on the contrary, the principal chief of the Cherokee Nation, as required by the act of its national council above referred to, did notify the Secretary of the Interior of the acceptance by said nation of said account as so stated by Messrs. Slade and Bender, and did request said Secretary of the Interior to notify the Congress of the United States of \n\n[202 U.S. 101, 114]\n\u00a0\n such acceptance, and on the 7th of January, 1895, the Secretary of the Interior reported the entire matter to the Congress in the following words:\n'Sir: I have the honor to herewith transmit, in compliance with the provisions of the third subdivision of article 2 of the agreement made December 19, 1891, with the Cherokee Indians, ratified by the act of Congress approved March 3, 1893 (27 Stat. at L. 643, chap. 209), a certified copy of 'a complete account of moneys due the Cherokee Nation under any of the treaties made in the years 1817, 1819, 1825, 1833, 1835, 1836, 1846, 1866, and 1868 [7 Stat. at L. 156, 195, 228, 414, 478; 9 Stat. at L. 871; 14 Stat. at L. 799; and 16 Stat. at L. 727], and any laws passed by the Congress of the United States for the purpose of carrying said treaties, or any of them, into effect,' prepared in accordance with the provisions of the said act of March 3, 1893, together with a certified copy of an act of Cherokee national council, accepting such accounting.\n\n'The Speaker of the House of Representatives.' House Ex. Doc. No. 182, 53d Cong., 3d sess.\n\n\n\n XX.\n\n\n The report and accounting made by said James A. Slade and Joseph T. Bender, referred to in the foregoing finding, is in the words and figures which appear in House Executive Document 182, Fifty-third Congress, third session. The conclusion thereof is as follows:\n'The foregoing statement covers, it is believed, every point at issue which can be raised under the treaties described in the articles of agreement [a number of demands made by the Cherokee Nation were disallowed ], and the result of the finding is submitted in the following schedule:\n\n Under the treaty of 1819: Value of three tracts of land containing 1,700 acres, at $1.25 per acre, to be added to the principal of the \"school\" fund $2,125 00 (With interest from February 27, 1819, to date of payment.) \n\n[202 U.S. 101, 115]\n\u00a0\n Under treaty of 1835: Amount paid for removal of Eastern Cherokees to the Indian territory, improperly charged to treaty fund 1,111,284 70 (With interest from June 12, 1838, to date of payment.)

Under act of Congress, March 3,1893 Interest on $15,000 of Choctaw funds applied in 1863 to relief of indigent Cherokees, said interest being improperly charged to Cherokee national fund 20,406 25\n\n\n\n\nXXI.\n\n\n In arriving at the item of $1,111,284.70, the accountants, among other tabulations, made the following statement of the account:\n'Figuring upon the basis stated in the 9th article of the treaty of 1846, and following the Auditor's and Comptroller's figures in the accounting of December 3, 1849, and eliminating from the charges made against the total fund of $6,647,067 the excess of payments over the amounts appropriated by the United States for that purpose, the true statement of the account is as follows:\n\n For improvements $1,540,572 27 For ferries 159,572 12 For spoliations 264,894 09 For removal and subsistence, being the amount actually provided and expended for these purposes, and consisting of the following items: ( $335,105 91 ) 1,382,172 91 (1,047,067 00 ) For debts and claims upon the Cherokee Nation 101,348 31 For the additional quantity of land ceded to the nation 500,000 00 \n\n[202 U.S. 101, 116]\n\u00a0\n For amount invested as the general fund of the nation 500,880 00 For subsistence furnished after expiration of one year, under agreement that it should be charged to treaty fund 172,316 47 ___ 4,621,756 17 For lands and possessions 5,000,000 00 For spoliations 264,894 09 Balance of $600,000 applicable to removal $335,105 91 Appropriation of June 12, 1838 1,047,067 00 ___ 6,647,067 00 From which deduct charges as above 4,621,756 17 ___ Balance to be distributed per capita 2,025,310 83 Deduct amount actually distributed as already explained 914,026 13 ___ Balance due 1,111,284 70\n The sum of $914,026.13 actually distributed to the Eastern Cherokees in 1852, out of the above balance of $2,025,310.83, was appropriated as follows: Amount found due by Treasury officials, under article 9, 1846, in the report of the Auditor and Comptroller of December 3, 1849 $627,603 95 Erroneous charge corrected by act of February 27, 1851 (9 Stat. at L. 570, chap. 12) 96,999 42 Erroneous charge account subsistence, corrected by Congress, September 30, 1850, (9 Stat. at L. 544, chap. 91) 189,151 25 ___ 914,026 13\n This amount of $914,026.13 was distributed solely to 14,098 Eastern Cherokees in the West and 2,133 Eastern Cherokees who remained East. Interest on the above sum of $914,026.13 at 5 per cent from June 12, 1838, was also appropriated by Congress and distributed per capita to said Eastern Cherokees in the same payment. The balance to be distributed per capita according to the above report and which was not distributed, to wit , $1,111,284.70, is the sum of which the Eastern Cherokees complain they were deprived in the settlement of 1852; that while they received only $56. 31 per capita, excluding interest, \n\n[202 U.S. 101, 117]\n\u00a0\n they should have received the further sum of $1,111,284.70, or a total of $ 2,025,310.83, as appears in the above account rendered as the true balance under article 9, making them a total per capita of $124.78.\n The settlement made with the Old Settlers was as set forth in Finding XVII.\n\n\n XXII.\n\n\n Neither the whole nor any portion of the various sums with interest found and stated by the concluding schedule of the so-called Slade-Bender report to be due to the Cherokee Nation under the treaties and acts of Congress therein referred to have been paid to the Cherokee Nation, or to any officer, agent, or other person acting in its behalf.\n With the exception of the provision contained in the act of March 2, 1895 [28 Stat. at L. 764, chap. 177, U. S. Comp.

Said communication of the Attorney General was, on December 2, 1895, by the Congress referred to the Committee on Indian Affairs and ordered to be printed, and the same appears in Senate Executive Document No. 16, Fifty- fourth Congress, first session.\n May 18, 1905, the court 'adjudged, ordered, and decreed \n\n[202 U.S. 101, 118]\n\u00a0\n that the plaintiff, the Cherokee Nation, do have and recover of and from the United States as follows:\n\n Item 1.

Belt, James K. Jones, Matthew C. Butler, John Vaile, and Scarritt & Cox for the Eastern Cherokees.\n\n Statement by Mr. Chief Justice Fuller:\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n Of the four items of the amounts allowed, only one, that for $1,111, 284.70, need be considered here.\n\n\n (1)\n The correctness of the account is conceded, and the question is whether the United States were properly held liable therefor. The court of claims ruled that the account rendered by Slade and Bender under the agreement between the United States and the Cherokee Nation, ratified by Congress, was neither an award nor an account stated, but that the United States were nevertheless liable in the circumstances for the balance found.\n The case is thus put by Chief Justice Nott:\n'But while the account was neither an award nor an account stated, it must be conceded that the scope of the accounting was intended to be as broad, as the causes of action secured by the agreement to the Cherokee Nation 'the right within twelve months to enter suit against the United States in the court of claims for any alleged or declared amount of money promised but withheld by the United States from the \n\n[202 U.S. 101, 121]\n\u00a0\n Cherokee Nation, under any of said treaties or laws, which may be claimed to be omitted from or improperly or unjustly or illegally adjusted in said accounting.' That is to say, the court, or the accountants, were to go behind statutory and treaty bars and receipts in full and were to consider 'any alleged or declared amount of money promised but withheld' 'under any of said treaties or laws.' This meant that there were to be no technical defenses set up, no pleas of res judicata, no releases or relinquishments, compromises or settlements; or it meant nothing. . . .\n\n'Interpreted in the light of the long, sore controversy which had existed between the parties, it is plain that the Cherokees believed the agreement to mean (and the United States allowed them so to believe) that all of their claims and rights and equities were to be reopened and re- examined de novo; and that upon the faith of that belief they made a cession of the Outlet. In the opinion of the court this case is simply one to recover purchase money upon a contract of sale. Ordinarily, in such a case, the cession would not be made, the deed would not be delivered, until the purchase money is paid or secured or, at least, the amount be ascertained and liquidated. In this case both parties wanted to expedite the transaction. It was important for the United States that the cession of the territory should be made immediately; it was desirable for the Cherokee Nation that the purchase money should be paid soon. But, nevertheless, the Cherokee Nation had the right to immediate payment, and the agreement intended to secure to them the next thing to it,-the right to an early payment. The accounting was merely a means to an end. The end was the immediate payment, as near as might be, of the whole consideration to be given for the cession of the Outlet. When the cession was made the purchase money was due; the only thing remaining, which was the object of the accounting, was to ascertain the exact amount. This is not the case of a party prosecuting an unliquidated debt, but a case of sale \n\n[202 U.S. 101, 122]\n\u00a0\n and delivery and nonpayment of the purchase money for the thing sold and delivered. The United States were willing to pay; the Cherokee Nation wanted the payment made at the earliest possible day; both parties agreed upon a method by which it should be paid as nearly immediately as was possible. The United States were to render their account 'without delay;' if the Cherokee Nation accepted it, the amount was to be appropriated by Congress; such 'appropriation to be made by Congress, if then in session, and if not, then at the session immediately following such accounting.' If the Cherokee Nation did not accept the accounting, or regarded it as incorrect or unjust, and carried it into the courts and recovered a judgment, Congress was to appropriate 'at its next session after such case shall be finally decided.' Nothing was left to the ordinary uncertainties and procrastinations of legislation, and no agreement could have made the obligation to pay promptly more unequivocal and specific. Time was of the essence of the contract, so far as the words of the parties could make it.\n\n'The court does not intend to imply that when the account of Slade and Bender came into the hands of the Secretary of the Interior he was bound to transmit it to the Cherokee Nation. On the contrary, the Cherokee Nation had not agreed to be bound by the report of the accountants and could not claim that the United States should be. The accountants were but the instrumentality of the United States in making out an account. When it was placed in the Interior Department it was as much within the discretion of the Secretary to accept and adopt it or to remand it for alterations and corrections as a thing could be. He was the representative of the United States under whom the agreement had been made, and he was the authority under which the account had been made out, and when he transmitted it to the Cherokee Nation his transmission was the transmission of the United States. When the account was thus received by the Cherokee Nation (May 21, 1894), the 'twelve months' of the agreement, within which \n\n[202 U.S. 101, 123]\n\u00a0\n the nation must consider it and enter suit against the other party in the court of claims, began to run, and with the nation's acceptance of the account (December 1, 1894) the session of Congress at which an appropriation should be made became fixed and certain. The Secretary did not recall the account; the United States never rendered another, and the utmost authority which Congress could have exercised, if any, was, at the same session, or certainly within the prescribed 'twelve months,' to have directed the Secretary to withdraw the account and notify the Cherokee Nation that another would be rendered. The action of the Secretary of the Interior, combined with the inaction of Congress to direct anything to the contrary, makes this provision of the agreement final and conclusive. The Cherokee Nation has parted with the land, has lost the time within which it might have appealed to the courts, and has lost the right to bring the items which it regards as incorrectly or unjustly disallowed to judicial arbitrament, and the United States are placed in the position of having broken and evaded the letter and spirit of their agreement.'\n\n Weldon, J., concurred with the Chief Justice in a separate opinion. Peelle, J., concurred in the judgment, but rested his conclusion on the ground that the United States were liable 'to pay the expense of removal' of the Eastern Cherokees from their eastern home to the Indian territory, under the treaties of 1835-1836 and 1846 (7 Stat. at L. 478; 9 Stat. at L. 871) and therefore to pay this conceded balance. The various treaties from 1817, down, the legislation, accountings, and proceedings, were duly considered in arriving at the result reached. Wright, J., dissented.\n We agree that the United States were liable, and think the liability might well be rested on both grounds,-that is, that failing one, it could be sustained on the other; but we do not deem it necessary to set forth in our own language what has already been so well stated by Chief Justice Nott and Judges Weldon and Peelle.\n\n 2. \nRecovery of the item of $1,111,284.70 was adjudged \n\n[202 U.S. 101, 124]\n\u00a0\n with interest thereon at the rate of 5 per cent from June 12, 1838, to date of payment,' and it is contended that the court of claims erred in this allowance of interest.\n Under the 11th article of the treaty of 1846 the Cherokees agreed to submit to the Senate of the United States, as umpire, the question whether interest should be allowed on the sums found due them. The Senate of the United States, as umpire, on September 5, 1850, found that interest should be allowed, in the following resolution: 'Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that interest at the rate of 5 per cent per annum should be allowed upon the sums found due to the Eastern and Western Cherokees, respectively, from the 12th day of June, 1838, until paid.'\n The Cherokees who had emigrated prior to 1835, with accessions to that date, were known as the 'Old Settlers,' or 'Western Cherokees,' and in the case of the United States v. Old Settlers, \n148 U.S. 427\n, 37 L. ed. 509, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 650, this court said in respect of the claim for interest:\n'By the second resolution adopted by the Senate, as umpire, September 5, 1850, it was decided that interest should be allowed at the rate of 5 per centum per annum upon the sum found due the Western Cherokees, from June 12, 1838, until paid. As before stated, our conclusion is that the sum then found due was less than should have been found by the amount of $ 212,376.94.\n\n'Under  1091 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 747 ), no interest can 'be allowed on any claim up to the time of the rendition of judgment thereon by the court of claims, unless upon a contract expressly stipulating for the payment of interest;' and in Tillson v. United States, \n100 U.S. 43\n, 25 L. ed. 543, it was held that a recovery of interest was not authorized under a private act referring to the court of claims a claim founded upon a contract with the United States, which did not expressly authorize such recovery. But in this case, the demand of interest formed a subject of difference while the negotiations were being carried on, the determination of which was provided for \n\n[202 U.S. 101, 125]\n\u00a0\n in the treaty itself; that determination was arrived at as prescribed, was accepted as valid and binding by the United States, and was carried into effect by the payment of $532,896.90, found due, and of $354,583.25 for interest, 9 Stat. at L. 556, chap. 91.\n\n'In view of the terms of the jurisdictional act and the conclusion reached in reference to the amount due, it appears to us that the decision of the Senate in respect of interest is controlling, and that, therefore, interest must be allowed from June 12, 1838, upon the balance we have heretofore indicated, but not upon the item of 4,179.26, which stands upon different ground.'\n\n The Congress of the United States on numerous occasions had recognized the force of the decision of the Senate, and made appropriations accordingly, appropriating the funds due as interest.\n On September 30, 1850, Congress appropriated to the Eastern Cherokees, in reimbursing an amount improperly charged the treaty fund for subsistence, the sum of $189,422.76, with the provision:\n'That interest be paid on the same at the rate of five per cent per annum, according to a resolution of the Senate of fifth September, eighteen hundred and fifty.' 9 Stat. at L. 556, chap. 91.\n\n On February 27, 1851, Congress, in appropriating the amount of the per capita then conceded to be due the Eastern Cherokees, to wit, $724,603. 37, provided as follows:\n'And interest on the above sum, at the rate of five per centum per annum, from twelfth day of June, eighteen hundred and thirty-eight, until paid, shall be paid to them out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated.' 9 Stat. at L. 572, chap. 12.\n\n Congress, on September 30, 1850, in appropriating the amount of the per capita, then conceded to be due the Old Settlers, provided:\n'That interest be allowed and paid upon the above sums \n\n[202 U.S. 101, 126]\n\u00a0\n due respectively to the Cherokees and 'Old Settlers,' in pursuance of the above-mentioned award of the Senate under the reference contained in the said 11th article of the treaty of sixth August, eighteen hundred and forty-six.' 9 Stat. at L. 556, chap. 91.\n\n The question of interest was a 'subject of difference while the negotiations were being carried on, the determination of which was provided for in the treaty itself' in 1846, and in the 'agreement itself' in 1891, and is the same in principle as in the case of the Old Settlers.\n\n 3. \nWas the recovery given proper destination by the decree?\n We refer to the same item, as there is really no controversy over the other three items, and the criticism as to the payment of item three is not material. If no proper agent of the Cherokee Nation to receive the $ 432.28 can be found, it may be received by the United States as trustee.\n The jurisdictional act of March 3, 1903, provided that 'both the Cherokee Nation and said Eastern Cherokees, so-called, shall be made parties to any suit which may be instituted against the United States under said section upon the claim mentioned;' and authorized the court 'to render a judgment in favor of the rightful claimant and also to determine, as between the different claimants, to whom the judgment so rendered equitably belongs, either wholly or in part.'\n In the petition filed by the Cherokee Nation in this case it is declared that the Cherokee Nation is 'a body politic,' and 'is, as such, the 'Cherokee tribe' mentioned in  68 of the act of Congress aforesaid [ July 1, 1902, 32 Stat. at L. 726, chap. 1375], and authorized thereby to bring this proceeding.' But the language of the section is that jurisdiction is conferred to adjudicate 'any claim which the Cherokee tribe or any band thereof, arising under treaty stipulations, may have against the United States,' and even if it were conceded that the Cherokee Nation could be treated as a body politic, not as a body corporate, but in the sense of a governmental community, we should say 'the Cherokee tribe or any band \n\n[202 U.S. 101, 127]\n\u00a0\n thereof' means the Cherokee people as a people, or any band thereof, and not the Cherokee Nation as a body politic.\n It should be observed that the term 'Cherokee Nation' has been used as representing the people themselves; the government of the Cherokees; and the government as trustee for all of its people, or for some of them, as their rights might appear.\n In the treaty of July 2, 1791, the 'Cherokee Nation' was described as 'all the individuals composing the whole Cherokee Nation of Indians.' [7 Stat. at L. 39.] In the treaty of 1835 these Indians are referred to as the 'Cherokees' and as 'the Cherokee Nation.' In the treaty of 1846 as 'the Cherokee Nation,' 'the Cherokee people,' and 'the Cherokees.'\n Under the first article of the treaty of 1846 the lands of the Cherokee Nation belonged to the whole Cherokee people. The lands sold east of the Mississippi river belonged to the Cherokee people as then existing as communal property. The Western Cherokees, so-called, that is to say, the Old Settlers, were paid for their interest in those lands as communal owners. \n148 U.S. 427\n, 37 L. ed. 509, 13 Sup.Ct.Rep. 650. They were paid individually, a community within a community.\n Mr. Chief Justice Nott treats of this matter thus:\n'While the United States have always, or nearly always, treated the members of an Indian tribe as communal owners, they have never required that all the communal owners shall join in the conveyance or cession of the land. From the necessities of the case, the negotiations have been with representatives of the owners. The chiefs and head men have ordinarily been the persons who carried on the negotiations and who signed the treaty. But they have not formed a body politic or a body corporate, and they have not assumed to hold the title or be entitled to the purchase money. They have simply acted as representatives of the owners, making the cession on their behalf, but allowing them to receive the consideration per capita. In the present case the Cherokee Nation takes the place, so far as communal ownership is in- \n\n[202 U.S. 101, 128]\n\u00a0\n volved, of the chiefs and head men of the uncivilized tribes. This, too, is consonant with the usage of nations. The claims of individuals against a foreign power are always presented, not by them individually, but by their government. The claims are pressed as international, but the money received is received in trust, to be paid over to the persons entitled to it.\n\n'As to those Cherokees who remained in Georgia and North Carolina, in Alabama and Tennessee, they owe no allegiance to the Cherokee Nation, and the nation owes no political protection to them. But they, as communal owners of the lands east of the Mississippi, at the time of the treaty of 1835, were equally interested, with the communal owners who were carried to the West, in the $5,000,000 fund which was the consideration of the cession, so far as it was to be distributed per capita. The Cherokee Nation was not bound to prosecute their claims against the United States for the unpaid balance of the $5,000,000 fund, but their rights were inextricably interwoven with the rights and equities of the Cherokees who were citizens of the nation, and the nation properly made no distinction when parting with the Outlet, but demanded justice from the Cherokee point of view for all Cherokees who had been wronged by the nonfulfilment of the treaty of New Echota. As to these Eastern nonresident Cherokee aliens the nation acted simply as an attorney collecting a debt. In its hands the moneys would be an implied trust for the benefit of the equitable owners.\n\n'After a careful consideration of the circumstances and conditions of these cases, the court is of the opinion that the moneys awarded should be paid directly to the equitable owners.'\n\n And after referring to the present status of the Cherokee Nation as about to terminate, the Chief Justice says:\n'In this condition of affairs the court must regard the Cherokee Nation as in a condition somewhat analogous to that of a trustee or receiver who has become insolvent; that is to say, as a person who should not be intrusted with the \n\n[202 U.S. 101, 129]\n\u00a0\n receipt and distribution of the moneys belonging to other persons.'\n\n The court of claims decreed that after deducting counsel fees, costs, and expenses, the sum of $1,111,284.70, with interest, should be paid to the Secretary of the Interior, to be by him received and held for the uses and purposes of paying costs and expenses, as stated, and then distributing the remainder 'directly to the Eastern and Western Cherokees, who were parties either to the treaty of New Echota, as proclaimed May 23, 1836, or the treaty of Washington of August 6, 1846, as individuals, whether east or west of the Mississippi river, or to the legal representatives of such individuals.'\n The eighth finding of fact was as follows:\n'The Cherokee Indians who removed west of the Mississippi prior to May 23, 1836, were called 'Western Cherokees.' After the removal, under the treaty of 1835-1836, of the Cherokees who had remained in the Cherokee country east of the Mississippi to the lands west of the Mississippi, the term 'Western Cherokees' was no longer distinctive, and the Cherokees who had theretofore been known as such were thereafter popularly known as 'Old Settlers.'\n\n'The Cherokees who were domiciled east of the Mississippi river at the time of the making of the treaty of 1835-1836, according to the census just then completed, were thereafter known as 'Eastern Cherokees', the great body of whom subsequently, in 1838, moved to the lands west of the Mississippi.'\n\n So far as the 'Old Settlers' are concerned, they have been fully paid and cannot be allowed to participate in this distribution. There had been a settlement with these Cherokees, which was reopened in the Old Settlers Case and they were allowed to assert any and all claims on their part against the United States. Judgment was thereafter rendered as to a portion of these claims in their favor (\n148 U.S. 427\n, 37 L. ed. 509, 13 Sup.Ct.Rep. 650), which judgment was thereafter paid in full by the United States, so that these Old Settlers have no standing in this action. And, \n\n[202 U.S. 101, 130]\n\u00a0\n indeed, they never had nor asserted any interest whatever in the claim herein involved and are not claimants. In the settlement of 1851, the cost of removal, with which they were charged, did not diminish the five- milliondollar treaty fund, but came entirely from the $600,000 added to that fund by the third supplemental article of the treaty of New Echota, and the payment that was made to them pursuant to the 4th article of the treaty of 1846 was not a third of the residuum of the treaty fund, but a sum equal to one third. It was the Eastern Cherokees only who were interested in that residuum, and so article 9 of that treaty provided for payment to the Eastern Cherokees of that balance, and for a fair and just settlement of all moneys due to the Cherokees, and payment of the same per capita to the Eastern Cherokees. The Cherokee Nation, as such, had no interest in the claim, but officially represented the Eastern Cherokees.\n The act of February 27, 1851, appropriating the amount due on the accounting under article 9 of the treaty of 1846, provided that it should be in full satisfaction of all claims and demands of the Cherokee Nation and that a receipt in full should be given. The receipts as given were signed by the individual Eastern Cherokees.\n We concur with the court of claims in the wisdom of rendering judgment in favor of the Cherokee Nation, subject to the limitation that the amount thereof should be paid to the Secretary of the Interior, to be distributed directly to the parties entitled to it, but we think that the terms of the second subdivision of the fourth paragraph of the decree, in directing that the distribution be made to 'the Eastern and Western Cherokees,' are perhaps liable to misconstruction, although limited to those 'who were parties either to the treaty of New Echota, as proclaimed May 23, 1836, or the treaty of Washington of August 6, 1846, as individuals, whether east or west of the Mississippi river.' This should be modified so as to direct the distribution to be made to the Eastern Cherokees as individuals, whether east or west of the Mississ- \n\n[202 U.S. 101, 131]\n\u00a0\n ippi, parties to the treaties of 1835-1836 and 1846, and exclusive of the Old Settlers.\n In view of the language of the jurisdictional acts of 1902 and 1903 in respect of the Cherokee Nation, we are not disposed to interfere with the court of claims in the allowance of fees and costs.\n It is true that, in the replication of the Cherokee Nation to the petition of the Eastern Cherokees this paragraph occurs:\n'It denies that the Cherokee Nation, in securing the accounting under the agreement of December 19, 1891, did so on behalf of the Eastern Cherokees referred to, and for their exclusive use and benefit; and further denies that if it had collected or hereafter shall collect such moneys, the same would have been or will be in its hands an implied trust for the benefit of the Eastern Cherokees, exclusively or otherwise.'\n\n It is also true that by the acts of June 7, 1897, June 28, 1898 [30 Stat. at L. 62, 495, chaps. 3, 517], and July 1, 1902, the Cherokee Nation was practically incapacitated from acting as trustee, and by  63 of the Cherokee allotment act (32 Stat. at L. 725, chap. 1375) it was provided that 'the tribal government of the Cherokee Nation shall not continue longer than March fourth, nineteen hundred and six.' But by joint resolution of March 2, 1906, Congress provided as follows:\n'That the tribal existence and present tribal governments of the Choctaw, Chickasaw, Cherokee, Creek, and Seminole tribes or nations of Indians in the Indian territory are hereby continued in full force and effect for all purposes under existing laws until all property of such tribes, or the proceeds thereof, shall be distributed among the individual members of said tribes, unless hereafter otherwise provided by law.'\n\n Nevertheless, taking the entire record together, the various treaties and acts of Congress, and of the Cherokee councils, and the language of the jurisdictional acts of 1902 and 1903, we leave the decree as it is in respect to counsel fees and costs.\n\n 4. \nThe Eastern and Emigrant Cherokees, in respect to whom it is stated in their petition 'that they number about 4,500 \n\n[202 U.S. 101, 132]\n\u00a0\n persons, more or less, all Eastern Emigrant Cherokees, residing for the most part in Cherokee, Graham, Swain, Clay, and Macon counties, North Carolina, some in north Georgia, northern Alabama, and eastern Tennessee, together with about 1,500 emigrants, portions of their various families, gone West, nearly all of whom have been recognized as citizens, and who compose a large portion of those persons heretofore known as the Eastern band of Cherokee Indians of North Carolina, and others of the same class, whose names, or those of whose ancestors, may be found on the rolls of 1835 and 1838,' asked that one-fourth part of the whole sum recovered be set apart for them as their distributive share. But we think they are only entitled to receive the per capita payment with the Eastern Cherokees, and should obtain that payment accordingly.\n The result is, that with the modification of the second subdivision of the fourth paragraph of the decree, relating to the $1,111,284.70 with interest, above indicated, the decree of the Court of Claims is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","167":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. CORNELL STEAMBOAT CO(1906)\nNo. 239\nArgued: April 20, 1906Decided: May 14, 1906\n\n\n\n This was a petition under what is known as the Tucker act, defining the jurisdiction of the court of claims, to recover salvage upon the duties on 1,883 bags of sugar, cargo of the lighter Bangor.\n The facts agreed upon and found by the court are substantially as follows:\n The steamboat company, a New York corporation, and owner of the steam tug R. G. Townsend, at great risk and peril to the tug, saved a certain lot of 1,883 bags of sugar on board of a lighter called the Bangor, in the waters of the port \n\n[202 U.S. 184, 185]\n\u00a0\n of New York, which was in danger of being destroyed by fire. The sugar had been imported from a foreign country, was subject to duty under the laws of the United States, and at the time of the fire had not been delivered to the consignees, and was still in the possession and control of the customs officers. The duties on this sugar, amounting to $6,000, had been paid to the government.\n Petitioner filed a libel in the district court against the cargo to recover salvage compensation for services rendered in saving the sugar. The case resulted in a decree awarding the petitioner salvage, amounting to 10 per cent of the value of the property saved, viz., $1,274.03. 108 Fed. 277. In fixing this sum, the district court considered the invoice value of the sugar only, excluding salvage upon the duties saved to the United States by the salving services.\n Upon these facts the district court awarded the petitioner 10 per cent upon the amount of the duties saved to the United States, namely, $ 600, with clerk's fees, $3.60. 130 Fed. 480. The circuit court of appeals affirmed this judgment (137 Fed. 455), whereupon the United States applied for this writ of certiorari.\n Assistant Attorney General McReynolds for petitioner.\n\n\n[202 U.S. 184, 187]\n\u00a0\n Mr. R. D. Benedict and Messrs. Benedict & Benedict for respondent.\n\n\n\n[202 U.S. 184, 189]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Brown delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is practically a libel in personam for the salvage of government property, viz., of $6,000 duties collected by the government upon a cargo of sugar saved from loss by fire while on board a lighter, in the harbor of New York.\n The claim is prosecuted under what is known as the Tucker act (24 Stat. at L. 505, chap. 359, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 752, 753), the 1st section of which declares that 'the court of claims shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine . . . all claims founded upon the Constitution of the United States, or any law of Congress, . . . or upon any contract, express or implied, with the government of the United States, or for damages, liquidated or unliquidated, in cases not sounding in tort, in respect of which claims the party would be entitled to redress against the United States, either in a court of law, equity, or admiralty, if the United States were suable.'\n By the 2d section concurrent jurisdiction with the court of claims was vested in the district courts as to all claims not exceeding $1,000.\n It is at least doubtful whether an ordinary claim for salvage can be said to arise upon contract, inasmuch as such services are rendered voluntarily, frequently in the absence of the owner of the property, and usually without a definite agreement for compensation. The Liffey, 6 Asp. Mar. L. Cas. 255; \n\n[202 U.S. 184, 190]\n\u00a0\n Five Steel Barges, L. R. 15 Prob. Div. 142. A claim for salvage may undoubtedly be founded upon an express contract, but where the services are rendered, as in this case, without request of an officer of the government, and particularly where they are incidental to services rendered in the saving of private property, we do not think the claim can be said to arise upon any contract, express or implied, with the government of the United States. But the claim may properly be said to be one for unliquidated damages in a case 'not sounding in tort,' in respect of which the party would be entitled to redress in a court of admiralty, if the United States were suable.\n The Tucker act also resolves any doubt which might arise as to the responsibility of government property for salvage service, since it was the very object of the act to give a direct recourse against the government. Indeed, that question was settled by this court in 1869, in the case of The Davis (United States v. Douglas) 10 Wall. 15, 19 L. ed. 875, in which personal property of the United States, in transit from one port to another, was held liable to a lien for salvage services rendered in saving the property, following the rule laid down in England in The Marquis of Huntly, 3 Hagg. Adm. 247, and The Lord Nelson, Edw. Adm. 79. The same rule was adopted by Mr. Justice Story in United States v. Wilder, 3 Sumn. 308, Fed. Cas. No. 16,694, although both in England and in this country vessels belonging to the United States, or to a foreign sovereign, and engaged in the public service, are exempt from seizure. The Exchange v. M'Faddon, 7 Cranch, 116, 3 L. ed. 287; The Charkieh, L. R. 4 Adm. & Eccl. 59; The Constitution, L. R. 4 Prob. Div. 39; The Parlement Belge, 4 Asp. Mar. L. Cas. 234, L. R. 5 Prob. Div. 197.\n The fact, however, that the property saved is not within the physical possession of the court, but is of an intangible nature, like freight or customs dues, does not prevent the maintenance of a libel in personam against the owner. Indeed, general admiralty rule No. 19 provides that 'in all suits for salvage the suit may be in rem . . . or in personam against the party at whose request, and for whose benefit, the salvage services have been performed.' In the case of freight the \n\n[202 U.S. 184, 191]\n\u00a0\n practice is to require its payment into court. The Leo Lush. 444.\n At the basis of the claim in this case lies the proposition that, although the duties had been actually paid before the services had been rendered, the Secretary of the Treasury was authorized to refund duties upon so much of the sugar as would have been lost by the fire had not the cargo been rescued by the salvors. The obligation to refund such duties is contained in the following sections of the Revised Statutes:\n'Sec. 2984 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1958). The Secretary of the Treasury is hereby authorized, upon production of satisfactory proof to him of the actual [industry] [injury] or destruction, in whole or in part, of any merchandise, by accidental fire or other casualty, while the same remained in the custody of the officers of the customs in any public or private warehouse under bond, . . . or while in the custody of the officers of the customs, and not in bond, or while within the limits of any port of entry, and before the same have been landed under the supervision of the officers of the customs, to abate or refund, as the case may be, out of any moneys in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, the amount of impost duties paid or accruing thereupon, and likewise to cancel any warehouse bond or bonds, or enter satisfaction thereon in whole or in part as the case may be.'\n\n Provision for such abatements or refunds is made in:\n'Sec. 3689 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2460). There are appropriated, out of any moneys in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, for the purposes hereinafter specified, such sums as may be necessary for the same, respectively; and such appropriation shall be deemed permanent annual appropriations. . . . For refunding duties paid or accruing on goods, wares, or merchandise injured or destroyed by accidental fire or other casualty while in the custody of the officers of customs, in any public or private warehouse, . . . or after their arrival within the limits of any port of entry, of the United States, and before the same have been landed under the supervision of the officers of the customs.' \n\n[202 U.S. 184, 192]\n\u00a0\n It was held by both courts below, and we think properly, that, if the government were liable to refund these duties in case the property had been destroyed by fire, it was under the same obligation to pay salvage on such duties as it would have been had property of the government of the same value been directly saved by the exertions of the salvors.\n\n It is true that the language of  2984 is permissive, and merely 'authorizes' the Secretary of the Treasury to abate or refund duties collected upon merchandise injured or destroyed by accidental fire or other casualty, and does not in terms require that this shall be done. We do not find it necessary, however, to go deeply into the learning expended upon the distinction between permissive and mandatory clauses, or to determine whether, in a particular case, mandamus would or would not lie against the Secretary for refusing to refund or abate duties in that connection. D. M. Ferry & Co. v. United States, 29 C. C. A. 345, 54 U. S. App. 705, 85 Fed. 550. Under the circumstances of this case, as set forth in the petition and agreed findings of fact, we are entitled to assume that the Secretary of the Treasury would have refunded these duties in case of the accidental loss of this sugar by fire, since the authority to do so is found in  2984, and the money is appropriated for such refunding by  3689. In a particular case we can imagine that doubts might arise as to the propriety of such refunding, but, where a plain case in made in the findings of fact, and is not disputed, it would be an imputation upon the good faith of the Secretary to assume that he would refuse to return the duties, notwithstanding the language of the statute may be construed as permissive merely. We think the petitioner is entitled to build his case upon this assumption. Rock Island County v. United States, 4 Wall. 435, 18 L. ed. 419; Galena v. Amy (Galena v. United States) 5 Wall. 705, 18 L. ed. 560; French v. Edwards, 13 Wall. 506, 20 L. ed. 702.\n It is insisted, however, that the government is under no greater liability to pay this claim than it would have been if the duties had not been paid, and that the law is well settled that when property is saved at sea and brought into port, it is \n\n[202 U.S. 184, 193]\n\u00a0\n subject to duty like other property, that the government owes nothing to the salvors, and, by parity of reasoning, that no insurer of goods saved, nor a creditor who has advanced money thereon, nor a seaman whose wages are preserved, can be made liable for salvage. The obvious reason for this is that the claim for salvage is founded upon the possession of the property saved at the time of the salvage service, and that the person incidentally benefited cannot be made liable under general admiralty rule 19, unless he has requested the salvage, or the service has been performed directly for his benefit. Interpreting this rule in the case of The Sabine ( The Mayflower v. The Sabine) \n101 U.S. 384\n, 25 L. ed. 982, it was held that a libel would not lie in rem against the vessel and in personam against the consignee of the cargo. But the mere possession of property may be in itself not only the origin of a right, but the creation of a liability,-as, for instance, in cases of money had and received or property lawfully acquired, but unlawfully detained. Had the duties upon these goods not been collected, the government could not have been held liable, since the services would not have been performed for its benefit, although, as a remote consequence therefrom, if might have been advantaged.\n The case of Five Steel Barges, L. R. 15 Prob. Div. 142, is authority for the proposition that the remedy in personam is not confined to the legal owner of the property saved, but extends to one who has a direct pecuniary interest in such property. This was an action against five barges, two of which belonged to the government, with whom the defendants were under contract to build and deliver the barges. An action in rem was brought against the three barges, and an action in personam against the defendants, who had contracted with the government and given it possession of the two barges. The court sustained the action in personam thinking it 'perfectly clear . . . that an action in personam lies against the owners of a vessel which has been saved, even though the property has been transferred to others and the lien lost.' Continuing, the president of the court, Sir James Hannen, observed: 'I think it exists in cases \n\n[202 U.S. 184, 194]\n\u00a0\n where the defendant has an interest in the property saved, which interest has been saved by the fact that the property is brought into a position of security. The jurisdiction which the court exercises in salvage cases is of a peculiarly equitable character. The right to salvage may arise out of an actual contract, but it does not necessarily do so. It is a legal liability arising out of the fact that property has been saved; that the owner of the property, who has had the benefit of it, shall make remuneration to those who have conferred the benefit upon him, notwithstanding that he has not entered into any contract on the subject. I think that proposition equally applies to the man who has had a benefit arising out of the saving of the property.' This last sentence is particularly applicable to this case.\n In the subsequent case of The Port Victor, 9 Asp. Mar. L. Cas. 163, the same court decided that where government stores were being carried at the risk of charterers, these charterers were liable to pay salvage in a personam action, apart from the liability of the stores in rem. The case was decided largely upon the authority of Five Steel Barges and Duncan v. Dundee, p. & L. Shipping Co. 5 Sc. Sess. Cas. 4th Series, 742, and was affirmed by the court of appeals in an opinion by Lord Alverstone (9 Asp. Mar. L. Cas. 182), in which great deference was shown to the decision of Sir James Hannen. See also Carver, Carriage by Sea,  324a.\n Although courts of admiralty have no general equity jurisdiction, and cannot afford equitable relief in a direct proceeding for that purpose, they may apply equitable principles to subjects within their jurisdiction, and, in the distribution of proceeds in their possession or under their control, may give effect to equitable claims. 2 Parsons, Shipping, 344. Bearing in mind that the duties in this case had been actually collected, were in the hands of the government, and had been saved to it by the exertion of the salvors, who had been awarded salvage for saving the sugars upon which the duties had been \n\n[202 U.S. 184, 195]\n\u00a0\n collected, a strong case is presented for the allowance of salvage, which should not be lost sight of in determining the principles applicable to the situation.\n The case is clearly not one arising under the revenue laws as they are defined in Nichols v.

Hatfield for heirs of John Forbes, appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a petition to establish title by a grant of about 1,850,000 acres of land in Florida, brought in the district court under the act of June 22, 1860, chap. 188,  11 (12 Stat. at L. 85, 87), extended by act of June 10, 1872, chap. 421 (17 Stat. at L. 378), for three years from the last date. The petitioners had a decree in the district court, and the United States appealed to this court under the above mentioned  11.\n As the jurisdiction of this court is denied, we will dispose of that question before going further into the facts. The ground of the denial is that by  6 of the act of March 3, 1891, chap. 517 [26 Stat. at L. 828, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 550], the circuit court of appeals shall exercise appellate jurisdiction to review final decisions in the district courts, etc., in all cases other than those provided for in the preceding section, 'unless otherwise provided by law.' There is no doubt that this enactment was intended to supersede previous general provisions, and to establish in what cases and to what courts appeals might be taken from the district courts. The Paquete Habana, \n175 \nU.S. 677, 686\n, 44 S. L. ed. 320, 323, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 290. But the statute recognizes, in addition to the exceptions which it enumerates, others \n\n[203 U.S. 408, 421]\n\u00a0\n where it is 'otherwise provided by law.' These words must be taken to refer to existing provisions, and not to be merely a futile permission to future legislatures to make a change. They do not save every existing provision, of course, or the act would fail of its purpose. But they save some. There is no case to which they can apply more clearly than one in which, by reason of its interest, the United States has manifested its will to submit to no judgment not sanctioned by its highest court. The language of  11 is not the usual permission to appeal, such as existed in the act of March 3, 1851, chap. 41,  9, 10 (9 Stat. at L. 632, 633), referred to in Gwin v. United States, \n184 U.S. 669\n, 46 L. ed. 741, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 526. See also act of August 31, 1852, chap. 108,  12 (10 Stat. at L. 99). It bears the unusual form of a positive requirement. 'If the decree be against the United States, an appeal shall be entered to the Supreme Court of the United States.' This is a provision based on a specific policy with regard to a certain class of claims. It is not a matter of general principle, but a special trust. See also act of May 23, 1828, chap. 70,  9 (4 Stat. at L. 284, 286); May 26, 1824, chap. 173,  9 ( 4 Stat. at L. 55). It stands on the same ground of peculiar importance that is the foundation of the express grant of certain direct appeals in  5 of the act of 1891. Therefore, without considering whether the case at bar falls within the other exceptions, we are of opinion that the jurisdiction of this court given by  11 of the act of 1860 remains unchanged.\n The petition was filed on March 3, 1875, by the heirs of John Forbes. It alleged a grant to John Forbes by the Captain General of Cuba, on January 10, 1818; that is, a grant made in time to escape the 8th article of the treaty with Spain, of February 22, 1819 [8 Stat. at L. 258], declaring all such grants made after January 24, 1818, void. On the other hand, it invoked the earlier part of the same article, by which all grants made by the King of Spain or by his lawful authorities, in the territories ceded to the United States, before January 24, were to be confirmed to the same extent as if the territories had not been sold. On December 14, 1878, an amendment was allowed, \n\n[203 U.S. 408, 422]\n\u00a0\n by which the grant was alleged to have been made to John Forbes & Company, a partnership consisting of Forbes, James Innerarity, and John Innerarity, and the Innerarity heirs were joined as parties. The rights of the United States, especially under the statute of limitations, were saved, and one question argued is whether this amendment could be allowed, when the time for bringing suit under the act of 1860 had expired. We shall not find it necessary to discuss this question, and shall assume, for the purposes of decision, that the amendment properly was allowed. United States v. Morant, \n123 \nU.S. 335, 343\n, 31 S. L. ed. 171, 173, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 189. We shall assume that the proceeding is to establish the claim and appropriate the land to it, rather than to determine in detail the present holders of the claim. See Butler v. Goreley, \n146 U.S. 308\n-310, 36 L. ed. 984, 985, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 84, 147 Mass. 8, 12, 16 N. E. 734; Pam-to-pee v. United States, \n187 \nU.S. 371, 379\n, 380 S., 47 L. ed. 221, 225, 226, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 142.\n It is unnecessary to trace all the vicissitudes of the case or to explain the delays. It is enough for our purposes to say that the parties reached an issue on May 29, 1903. A master was appointed and testimony was taken. At the hearing before him the United States put in the registro, or instrument of grant, which was in fact the original instrument, although the document of title under Spanish law is a copy delivered to the grantee, while the registro is retained by the government. It appeared upon inspection that this instrument had been altered in the date to January 10, from February 20, 1818, the true date making the grant void under the treaty. Thereupon the petitioners asked leave to amend by adding an allegation that the grant was made on February 20, 1818, but had been altered so that it purported to have been made on January 10. The result of this amendment was that, whereas the ground of recovery previously had been the treaty, now it was that the act of 1860 had given a right to recover in a case which the treaty put an end to in so many words. It abandoned the old ground, and that no longer could be relied upon if the amendment was allowed. The amendment, \n\n[203 U.S. 408, 423]\n\u00a0\n although filed, was not formally allowed before the hearing, and after the hearing the United States filed a suggestion that it had been treated as followed, and that an order should be made nunc pro tunc that the amendment had been allowed. Thereupon the order suggested was made, and an additional answer was filed, setting up the treaty and the limitation in the statutes. We do not perceive that the United States, by its course, lost its right to maintain that the amendment set up a new cause of action, which was barred by the limitation fixed by the statutes on the matter, and it urges that defense. Union P. R. Co. v. Wyler, \n158 \nU.S. 285, 298\n, 39 S. L. ed. 983, 991, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 877.\n It has been decided that a decree upon a bill to have a patent declared void as forfeited under an act of Congress was a bar to a subsequent bill for the same purpose upon the different ground that the land was excepted from the grant as an Indian reservation. United States v. California & O. Land Co. \n192 U.S. 355\n, 48 L. ed. 476, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 266. In that case it was intimated that in general a judgment is a bar to a second attempt to reach the same result by a different medium concludendi. But while such a decision might be persuasive on the question whether the cause of action is the same or different for the purposes of amendment, it has been decided that an amendment could not be allowed in a Missouri district, changing the ground of recovery from the common law to the common law as modified by a Kansas statute, which did away with the defense that the negligence complained of was that of a fellow servant, in actions against railroads. Union P. R. Co. v. Wyler, \n158 U.S. 285\n, 39 L. ed. 983, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 877. In the present case the change is a change in the allegations of fact, and was most material, because it necessarily was followed by a direct facing about with regard to the law. We shall not dispose of the case on this ground, but we think it proper to say that the difficulties in the way of upholding this amendment under the last- mentioned decision have not been removed from our minds.\n The fundamental questions in the case are whether the petitioners are within the act of 1860, and, if they are, whether \n\n[203 U.S. 408, 424]\n\u00a0\n they are not met by an exception to which we shortly shall refer. The former we shall not decide. The statute by  1 gave a petition to any persons 'who claim any lands lying within the states of Florida, Louisiana, or Missouri, by virtue of grant. ... emanating from any foreign government, bearing date prior to the cession to the United States of the territory out of which said states were formed, or during the period when any such government claimed sovereignty or had the actual possession of the district or territory in which the lands so claimed are situated.' And somewhat similar language is used in  11, allowing a proceeding in the district court. There, however, the words apply only in case of a complete grant or concession and separation from the mass of the public domain prior to the cession to the United States, 'or where such title was created and perfected during the period while the foreign governments from which it emanated claimed sovereignty over, or had the actual possession of, such territory.'\n The petitioners rely upon the words of the act and upon United States v. Morant, \n123 U.S. 335\n, 31 L. ed. 171, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 189. That case involved lands in Florida, lying, like the present, east of the river Perdido, of which the grant was made before January 24, 1818, but the survey was not completed until afterwards. The court, while intimating that such a grant well might have been held to be saved by the treaty, pointed out that the treaty was not signed until February 22, 1819, or possession taken until July 1822, and held that the case was within the act.\n On the other hand, there must be, and it has been intimated that there are, some limits to the generality of the words of the statute. Certain large grants were expressly excepted from recognition by the King of Spain on his ratification of the treaty. The act was not intended to bring them to life. There is a strong argument that it no more was intended to validate all other grants expressly annulled, but rather that what was aimed at was the so-called disputed territory lying west of the river Perdido, of which a short and clear account \n\n[203 U.S. 408, 425]\n\u00a0\n is to be found in United States v. Lynde, 11 Wall. 632, 20 L. ed. 230. In the light of that history and in view of the alternative ground of decision kept open in United States v. Morant, if there are no other possible distinctions between that case and this, we also shall leave it open whether the intimation in that case is right, or whether the same justice was more accurate when he said, even with regard to grants of land in the disputed territory, that the intention of the act was to validate them, 'subject, of course, to the express exceptions of the treaty of 1819 and the supplementary declaration of the King of Spain finally annexed thereto.' United States v. Lynde, 11 Wall. 632, 646, 647, 20 L. ed. 230, 234, 235. See McMicken v. United States, \n97 \nU.S. 204, 208\n, 209 S., 24 L. ed. 947, 948, 949; United States v. Clamorgan, \n101 \nU.S. 822, 825\n, 826 S., 25 L. ed. 836 ('which passed by the Louisiana purchase,' in 25 L. ed. 836).\n However it may be as to the question upon which we have touched, we are of opinion that this case 'comes within the purview of the 3d section of this act' (of 1860) in the words of  11, in which event the petition is not allowed to be maintained. The 3d section provides for a division of the claims into three classes, numbers one and two containing claims which ought to be confirmed, number three containing those which ought to be rejected, 'Provided, that in no case shall such commissioners embrace in said classes number one and number two any claim which has been heretofore presented for confirmation before any board of commissioners, or other public officers acting under authority of Congress, and rejected as being fraudulent, or procured or maintained by fraudulent or improper means.' We are of opinion that this proviso excludes the petitioners, for the reasons which we proceed to state.\n Before the act of 1860 was passed, an act of May 23, 1828, chap. 70,  6 (4 Stat. at L. 284, 285), authorized the presentation of certain land claims in Florida to a judge of the superior court of West Florida, subject to the restrictions of the act of May 26, 1824, chap. 173 (4 Stat. at L. 52). This claim was presented by the Inneraritys for themselves and the Forbes heirs, and after a \n\n[203 U.S. 408, 426]\n\u00a0\n trial the prayer for confirmation of the title was 'refused and rejected' for the reasons set forth in an opinion which is in the record before us. The general ground was the unwarranted alteration of the registro, which we have mentioned above. The judge was careful not to implicate the public officer, remarking that it would be unjust, when he was not a party and had no opportunity of defense. He also stated that it was not intended to implicate the parties in interest. But he pointed out that the inducement for an alteration of the registro a year or two after it was made, when the time became essential in consequence of the treaty, was obvious, and as plainly intimated that he considered the alteration fraudulent, as he could without saying so in words. He simply avoided finding by whom the alteration was made. He quoted the Curia Filipica for the invalidity of a public instrument which does not authenticate alterations by a salyado, and he concluded that the claimants had no legal grant prior to January 24, 1818. He relied upon the absence of a salvado, no doubt, but only as one of the grounds for deciding that the alterations were made without authority of law, and as leading to the further consequence that the instrument was void.\n The United States set up this adjudication as a bar under the above- mentioned  3. The petitioners make several replies. In the first place they contend that if a decision by a judge had been embraced within the proviso of  3, he would not have been referred to in a slight, subordinate, and alternative way, under the general head of 'other public officers acting under authority of Congress,' after the specific mention of 'any board of commissioners.' The reason seems plain enough, however. The whole scheme of the earlier acts was that the claims should be presented to a board of commissioners. Act of May 8, 1822, chap. 129 (3 Stat. at L. 709); March 3, 1823, chap. 29 (3 Stat. at L. 754); February 8, 1827, chap. 9 (4 Stat. at L. 202). The right to present a claim to a judge came in only by way of a late supplement in a limited number of cases. Act of May 23, 1828, chap. 70,  6 (4 Stat. at L. 284, 285). The judges referred \n\n[203 U.S. 408, 427]\n\u00a0\n to were judges of a territorial court established by the acts of March 30, 1822, chap. 13,  6 (3 Stat. at L. 654), and March 3, 1823, chap. 28,  7 ( 3 Stat. at L. 750). They were not district judges, and there was a certain ambiguity in their standing which was under discussion when the act of 1828 was passed, and has been discussed since. American Ins. Co. v. 356 Bales of Cotton, 1 Pet. 511, 7 L. ed. 243; McAllister v. United States, \n141 U.S. 174\n, 35 L. ed. 693, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 949. It was most natural to use cautious words, but there was no other public officer which the act of 1860 is likely to have had in mind. No further argument seems necessary to justify the conclusion that these judges were embraced within the actual, as well as the literal, meaning of the words used.\n In the next place, it is said the claim was not found to be fraudulent or maintained by fraudulent or improper means. With regard to this we think that we have said enough already. The claim was found to be based upon an alteration, the motive for which was pointed out, and to be maintained by a reliance upon the unlawful alteration. The main contention is that the judge had no jurisdiction to reject the claim on that ground, because, the moment that he decided the true date of the grant to be after January 24, he fell within a proviso of the act of May 23, 1828, chap. 70  6 (4 Stat. at L. 285), which excluded him from taking cognizance of any claims annulled by the treaty. United States v. Baca, \n184 U.S. 653\n, 46 L. ed. 733, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 541. It appears to us that this argument rests on too narrow a view of the statutes and of what was done. The claim as presented was within the judge's jurisdiction. He had authority to inquire whether it was so in fact. The document produced by the petitioner showed a claim which he could decide upon the merits, for the copy did not disclose the alteration. When the registro was put in it appeared that the date had been altered. He still had authority to decide whether the alteration was valid. He decided that it was unlawfully and fraudulently made. It would be an extraordinary refinement to say that he had authority to decide that it was made unlawfully, but not to decide why it was unlawful. The illegality did not \n\n[203 U.S. 408, 428]\n\u00a0\n follow from the mere fact of alteration. Had there been a salvado it might have been valid. He could not come to his conclusion without some definite ground.\n Moreover, while it is true that the limitation in  6 of the act of 1828 in form provides that the act shall not be taken to authorize the judge to take cognizance of any claim annulled by the treaty, etc., in substance it is addressed to maintaining the invalidity of the excluded claims. The jurisdiction of the judge was no different from what it would have been if the proviso had declared that nothing in the act should be taken to validate or to authorize the recognition of any claim which the treaty declared void. We are of opinion that the judge had authority to find the claim to be fraudulent and maintained by improper means.\n The decree 'rejected' the claim upon the grounds which we have stated, and an opinion was expressed that the grant was not merely annulled by the treaty, but void under Spanish law. But the objection remains to be answered that even if 'reject' was a proper term for the decree in such a case, and even if the jurisdiction to reject included authority to find that the claim had been saved from the treaty by fraud, still there was no jurisdiction to pass upon its validity apart from the treaty, and that, therefore, the claim now may be set up since the act of 1860 has brought it to life. The provise in  3 of the act of 1860, it may be said, refers to claims rejected on their merits, when all the merits as admitted by that act were open. We are of opinion that there is no reason for thus artificially narrowing words that on their face include all cases. They include as well any claim which previously had been rejected as fraudulent or maintained by improper means, when the fraud addressed itself to avoiding the treaty, as when it related to some other fact material to the validity of the claim at the time when it was created. The fraud went to the merits of the case. For, by the meaning of the act of 1828, as just explained, the date of the grant was as material to the validity of the claim as the authority of the Captain General \n\n[203 U.S. 408, 429]\n\u00a0\n of Cuba to convey on behalf of the King. Therefore it is our opinion that the claim is barred by the decree, even if it could escape from the other objections upon which we have found it unnecessary to pass.\n Decree reversed. \n\n\n\n","169":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. DETROIT TIMBER & LUMBER CO.(1906)\nNo. 106\nArgued: December 7, 1905Decided: February 19, 1906\n\n\n\n\n[200 U.S. 321, 322]\n\u00a0\n These are cross appeals from a decree of the circuit court of appeals for the eighth circuit, affirming in part and erversing in part a decree of the circuit court for the western district of Arkansas.\n The bill was filed on April 5, 1902, by the United States against the Detroit Tamber & Lumber Company, the Martin- \n\n[200 U.S. 321, 323]\n\u00a0\n Alexander Lumber Company, and a number of individual defendants. The object of the bill was to set aside patents to 44 tracts of land, issued to the individual defendants, and all conveyances, contracts, and leases from them purporting to convey title to or a right to cut and remove timber from the lands, and also for an accounting of the timber cut and removed from the lands by the two companies, and judgment therefor.\n The charge was that the lands were entered under the timber act of June 3, 1878 (20 Stat. at L. 89, chap. 151), and in fraud of its provisions, in that the purchase money was advanced by the Martin- Alexander Company under contracts with the entrymen that after the entries they should convey to it all the standing timber thereon. The Martin- Alexander Company denied that there were any such contracts, and the Detroit Company in addition pleaded that it was a bona fide purchaser from the former company. It appeared from the testimony that for some time prior to January 14, 1901, the Martin-Alexander Company owned and operated a sawmill plant in the vicinity of these lands; that most, if not all, of the entrymen were its employees; that it furnished all the money for the purchase prices of these lands, as well as for the expenses connected with the entries, and that after the entries the entrymen, with three exceptions, executed conveyances to it of all the standing timber. Fifty- eight and one half per cent of the stock of the Martin-Alexander Company belonged to E. B. Martin, while A. V. Alexander controlled the remainder, which was owned by himself, his wife, and J. O. Means.\n On January 14, 1901, the Detroit Company purchased the entire property of the Martin-Alexander Company for $60,000 cash and an assumption of its obligations, amounting to $17,456.79. Prior to May 9, 1901, patents were issued for all the lands, thirteen having been issued before January 14, 1901. After the purchase from the Martin-Alexander Company the Detroit Company obtained deeds of the lands from the patentees of twenty-seven of the tracts. \n\n[200 U.S. 321, 324]\n\u00a0\n The circuit court found that the transactions between the entrymen and the Martin-Alexander Company were not in conflict with the statute, that there were no agreements between them and it prior to the entries in respect to conveyances of the standing timber, and that there was only the mere expectation on the part of the company that it would be able to purchase the timber. Thereupon it dismissed the bill. 124 Fed. 393. The court of appeals, reviewing the testimony, held that there were contracts between the parties making the entries and the Martin-Alexander Company prior to the entries, and that therefore those entries were in fraud of the act, but it also found that the purchase by the Detroit Company was in good faith, and that therefore that company was entitled to protection in its purchase. It ordered the bill dismissed as to the 27 tracts for which patents had been issued and conveyances made to the Detroit Company. As to the seventeen which had not been conveyed, it ordered a decree canceling the patents, but dismissing the bill so far as respects any relief claimed against the Detroit Company. 67 C. C.

Read, Thomas C. McRae, U. M. Rose, and George B. Rose for the lumber companies.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Brewer:\n\n\n[200 U.S. 321, 328]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n The able and elaborate opinions of both the circuit court and the court of appeals relieve us from much labor. There are two questions of fact: First, whether the parties making the entries had, prior to acquiring title from the government, made any agreement with the Martin- Alexander Company for a conveyance of an interest in the properties, or were seeking to acquire title solely for their own benefit. Second, whether \n\n[200 U.S. 321, 329]\n\u00a0\n the Detroit Company was a purchaser in good faith from the Martin- Alexander Company. With reference to the first question, the circuit court was of the opinion that there were no agreements between the parties. The court of appeals was of a different opinion, and held that the entries were made in pursuance of such agreements. This is a case in equity, and while in such a case questions of fact are always open to consideration by an appellate court, great respect is paid to the conclusions of the trial court in respect to them. Certainly, if the circuit court and the court of appeals had agreed, we should be very loath to disturb their conclusion. Differing as they do in the present case, we have examined this question, and agree with the court of appeals. The entire management of these entries was in the hands of an agent of the Martin-Alexander Company. It furnished the moneys, both for the purchase prices and all expenses; and it is not easy to believe that it did all this on a mere expectation that, after the entries had been made, it could purchase the timber. It is a much more reasonable conclusion that it had an understanding with the parties making the entries respecting purchases and prices. It is quite likely that the entrymen were not conscious of wronging the government, and thought that if it received the full price demanded, that was enough. The testimony of one witness suggests at least that they may have been advised that there was no contract unless it was in writing, and that hence they could conscientiously take the oath required in connection with an entry. So, without casting any imputation of intentional perjury on those parties, we agree with the court of appeals that the testimony points strongly to the fact that the entries were in pursuance of an understanding or agreement with the Martin-Alexander Company that, as it was advancing all the money, the entrymen should convey to it the standing timber at a fixed price.\n With reference to the second question of fact, the circuit court made no finding, having disposed of the case by its conclusion in respect to the first. The court of appeals found \n\n[200 U.S. 321, 330]\n\u00a0\n that the Detroit Company was a purchaser in good faith from the Martin- Alexander Company. Here, too, we have examined the testimony, and are satisfied that the conclusion of the court of appeals was correct. A brief statement of the salient facts may be not unimportant. The headquarters of the Detroit Company were in St. Louis, of the Martin-Alexander Company in southwest Arkansas. They dealt at arm's length. On December 20, 1900, Alexander, of the Martin-Alexander Company, applied to U. L. Clark, presidernt of the Detroit Company, at St. Louis, to purchase Martin's interest in the Martin-Alexander Company. Clark declined, stating that the Detroit Company would make no purchase of a fractional interest in the property. Thereupon it was arranged that he should make an examination with a view to the purchase of the entire property. The Detroit Company's inspector was sent to Arkansas to examine the lands. Clark himself went down in the January following, and, after receiving the report of the inspector, terms of sale were, on January 14, agreed upon; $60,000 cash and the assumption of the Martin-Alexander Company's debts. The $60,000, by agreement between the stock-holders of the Martin-Alexander Company, were divided, $34,850 to Martin, $24,850 to Mrs. Alexander, $150 to A. V. Alexander, and $150 to J. O. Means. Martin and Means were paid at once; the debts were also promptly paid. Alexander desired to take stock in the Detroit Lumber Company in lieu of the money coming to his wife and himself. Clark was not then authorized to make such arrangement, but subsequently the stock of the Detroit Lumber Company was increased and the Alexanders were paid in full in that stock. The entire property of the Martin- Alexander Company, included in which were the sawmill, tram and logging roads, these timber contracts and other like contracts, and also all stock on hand, was, at the time of the purchase,-January 14,-turned over to the Detroit Lumber Company, which thereafter continued the business. The Martin-Alexander Company had no deeds of the lands in controversy, but simply contracts for the timber \n\n[200 U.S. 321, 331]\n\u00a0\n thereon, and, in order to be relieved from the necessity of keeping accounts with respect to the different tracts, the Detroit Company proceeded to obtain deeds from twenty-seven of the patentees, paying on an average $25 apiece therefor, which was a fair price for the lands after the timber had been cut off. It had no knowledge or intimation that there was anything wrong in the titles until the last of September or the first of October, 1901,-more than four months after the government had issued its patents for all the lands,-when it received a notice to that effect from a government inspector.\n Now we remark that there is no intimation in the testimony that the purchase price was not paid by the Detroit Company in cash and stock as agreed upon, no suggestion that the price was an unreasonable one. There was nothing strange or unnatural in the contract between the companies; on the contrary, it was one which might well be entered into by parties situated as these were. But it is contended by the government that if the Detroit Company had examined with care the books of the Martin-Alexander Company, and the papers which it turned over as evidences of its titles, it would have perceived that the timber contracts were made shortly after the issue of the final receiver's receipts, that the parties making the contracts were all or nearly all employees of the Martin-Alexander Company, to whom moneys had been advanced, and with each of whom an account was being kept; that it was its duty to critically examine these matters in order to be sure that the titles which it was acquiring were good. In their brief, counsel for the government say:\n'We claim that the law as laid down in Hawley v. Diller, \n178 U.S. 476\n, 44 L. ed. 1157, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 986, that one who takes title before the issuance of patent cannot claim to be a bona fide purchaser, made it the duty of the Detroit Company to make the most searching inquiry, at least as to all of the timber contracts except the thirteen for which patents to the land had issued.'\n\n We do not understand the law to be as stated, or that one who enters into an ordinary and reasonable contract for the \n\n[200 U.S. 321, 332]\n\u00a0\n purchase of property from another is bound to presume that the vendor is a wrongdoer, and that, therefore, he must make a searching inquiry as to the validity of his claim to the property. The rule of law in respect to purchases of land or timber is the same as that which obtains in other commercial transactions, and such a rule as is claimed by counsel would shake the foundations of commercial business. No one is bound to assume that the party with whom he deals is a wrongdoer, and if he presents property, the title to which is apparently valid, and there are no circumstances disclosed which cast suspicion upon the title, he may rightfully deal with him, and, paying full value for the same, acquire the rights of a purchaser in good faith. Jones v. Simpson, \n116 U.S. 609\n-615, 29 L. ed. 742-744, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 538. He is not bound to make a searching examination of all the account books of the vendor nor to hunt for something to cast a suspicion upon the integrity of the title.\n It is further said that the written contract of sale from the Martin- Alexander Company to the Detroit Company was not executed till March 1, 1901, and that on the 14th of January, 1901, Martin resigned his position as president of the Martin-Alexander Company, and Clark, the president of the Detroit Company, was elected president of the former company; that, as the chief executive of that company, he was charged with knowledge of all that the company knew, and that therefore, before the written contract was entered into, he and the Detroit Company had constructive notice of the wrongful character of these timber contracts. But that is a mere evasive technicality. The bill charges and the answer admits the sale on January 14, and the facts, as disclosed by the testimony, are that Martin desired to leave at once on receipt of his money, and return to his home in Illinois; that Clark was put in his place as president to enable the Martin-Alexander Company to close up its outstanding affairs. The real contract between the parties was entered into before Clark became president, and all that was afterwards done was simply to put in writing the terms of the contract which had been \n\n[200 U.S. 321, 333]\n\u00a0\n agreed upon. Equity looks at the substance, and not at the mere form in which a transaction takes place. The rule in respect to constructive notice was thus stated in Wilson v. Wall, 6 Wall. 83, 91, 18 L. ed. 727, 730:\n'A chancellor will not be astute to charge a constructive trust upon one who has acted honestly and paid a full and fair consideration without notice or knowledge. On this point we need only refer to Sugden on Vendors, p. 622, where he says: 'In Ware v. Egmont, 4 De G. M. & G. 460, the Lord Chancellor Cranworth expressed his entire concurrence in what, on many occasions of late years, had fallen from judges of great eminence on the subject of constructive notice, namely, that it was highly inexpedient for courts of equity to extend the doctrine. When a person has not actual notice, he ought not to be treated as if he had notice, unless the circumstances are such as enable the court to say, not only that he might have acquired, but also that he ought to have acquired it, but for his gross negligence in the conduct of the business in question. The question, then, when it is sought to affect a purchaser with constructive notice, is not whether he had the neans of obtaining, and might, by prudent caution, have obtained the knowledge in question, but whether not obtaining was an act of gross or culpable negligence.\"\n\n And, again, in Townsend v. Little, \n109 \nU.S. 504, 511\n, 27 S. L. ed. 1012, 1014, 3 Sup. Ct. Rep. 357:\n'Constructive notice is defined to be in its nature no more than evidence of notice, the presumption of which is so violent that the court will not even allow of its being controverted. Plumb v. Fluitt, 2 Anstr. 432; Kennedy v. Green, 3 Myl. & K. 699. . . . As said by Strong, J., in Meehan v. Williams, 48 Pa. 238, what makes inquiry a duty is such a visible state of things as is inconsistent with a perfect right in him who proposes to sell. See also Holmes v. Stout, 4 N. J. Eq. 492; M'Mechan v. Griffing, 3 Pick. 149, 15 Am. Dec. 198; Hanrick v. Thompson, 9 Ala. 409.'\n\n In the light of these authorities we see nothing which casts any imputation on the conduct of the Detroit Company, or \n\n[200 U.S. 321, 334]\n\u00a0\n that tends to show that it was not a purchaser in absolute good faith.\n Now, what is the law conrolling under these circumstances? Much reliance is placed by the government on Hawley v. Diller, \n178 U.S. 476\n, 44 L. ed. 1157, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 986, which, affirming prior cases, holds that an entryman under the timber act acquires only an equity, and that a purchaser from him cannot be regarded as a bona fide purchaser within the meaning of the act. But the Detroit Company purchased 27 tracts after the issue of the patents therefor. And in making these purchases it dealt not with the Martin-Alexander Company, but directly with the patentees. While the amounts paid were small, yet, as counsel for the government admit in their brief that 'the land without the timber is of no value,' there can be no suggestion of inadequacy of price. As, also, it had no knowledge or suspicion of wrong in the titles, it is, as to these tracts, strictly and technically, within the language of the act, a bona fide purchaser. If it be contended that, by virtue of the contracts for the sale of timber, it had acquired some interest in the lands prior to the issue of patents, it is sufficient to say that, by the doctrine of relation, the patents, when issued, became operative as of the dates of the entries. It is true that this doctrine is but a fiction of law, but it is a fiction resorted to whenever justice requires. It is that principle by which an act done at one time is considered to have been done at some antecedent time. It is a doctrine of frequent application, designed to promote justice. Thus, a sheriff's deed takes effect, not of its date, but of the time when the lien of the judgment attached. The ordinary railroad land grants have been grants in proesenti, and under them the title has been adjudged to pass, not at the completion of the road, but at the date of the grant. Leavenworth, L. & G. R. Co. v. United States, \n92 U.S. 733\n, 23 L. ed. 634; St. Paul, M. & M. R. Co. v. Phelps, \n137 U.S. 528\n, 34 L. ed. 767, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 168; St. Paul & P. R. Co. v. Northern P. R. Co. \n139 U.S. 1\n, 35 L. ed. 77, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 389; United States v. Southern P. R. Co. \n146 U.S. 570\n, 36 L. ed. 1091, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 152. A patent from the United States operates to transfer the title, not merely from the date of the \n\n[200 U.S. 321, 335]\n\u00a0\n patent, but from the inception of the equitable right upon which it is based. Shepley v. Cowan, \n91 U.S. 330\n, 23 L. ed. 424. Indeed, this is generally true in case of the merging of an equitable right into a legal title. Although the patents in this case were not issued until after the sales of the timber, yet, when issued, they became operative as of the date of the original entries. This doctrine has frequently been recognized by this and other courts. Landes v. Brant, 10 How. 348, 13 L. ed. 449; French v. Spencer, 21 How. 228, 16 L. ed. 97; Stark v. Starr, 6 Wall. 402, 18 L. ed. 925; Lynch v. Bernal, 9 Wall. 315, 19 L. ed. 714; Gibson v. Chouteau, 13 Wall. 92, 20 L. ed. 534; Simmons v. Wagner, \n101 U.S. 260\n, 25 L. ed. 910; Jackson ex dem. De Forest v. Ramsay, 3 Cow. 75, 15 Am. Dec. 242; Welch v. Dutton, 79 Ill. 465; Ormiston v. Trumbo, 77 Mo. App. 310. In the first of these cases it was said (p. 372, L. ed. p. 459):\n'To protect purchasers, the rule applies, 'that where there are divers acts concurrent to make a conveyance, esate, or other thing, the original act shall be preferred; and to this the other acts shall have relation,'-as stated in Viner's Abr. title Relating, 290. . . . Cruise on Real Property, vol. 5, pp. 510, 511, lays down the doctrine with great distinctness. He says: 'There is no rule better founded in law, reason, and convenience than this: that all the several parts and ceremonies necessary to complete a conveyance shall be taken together as one act, and operate from the substantial part by relation'. . . . Applying the doctrine of relation, and taking all the several parts and ceremonies necessary to complete the title together, 'as one act,' then the confirmation of 1811 and the patent of 1845 must be taken to relate to the first act,-that of filing the claim in 1805.'\n\n In Simmons v. Wagner, p. 261, L. ed. p. 911:\n'Where the right to a patent has once become vested in a purchaser of public lands, it is equivalent, so far as the government is concerned, to a patent actually issued. The execution and delivery of the patent after the right to it has become complete are the mere ministerial acts of \n\n[200 U.S. 321, 336]\n\u00a0\n the officers charged with that duty. Barney v. Dolph, \n97 U.S. 652\n, 24 L. ed. 1063.'\n\n See also United States v. Freyberg, 32 Fed. 195, a case in the circuit court for the eastern district of Wisconsin, in which it was held by Judge Dyer that an action brought by the government to recover for timber cut from land which had been entered as a homestead, but the full equitable title of which had not then passed to the entryman, either by the required occupation of the premises or by a commuting of the homestead to a pre-emption entry-an action maintainable at the time it was commenced- was defeated by the issue of the final receiver's receipt and the consequent perfection of a full equitable title.\n Counsel for the government deny the application of this principle in the present case on the ground, first, that it gives vitality and validity to a wrongful acquisition of title from the government. They say that equity is never founded on a wrong, and that because the original entries were wrongful the doctrine of relation will not be applied. But this is a clear misunderstatnding of the purpose and scope of the doctrine of relation. If the original entries were rightful, there is no need of its application, for the patents would pass perfect titles. The equity is founded on the rightful conduct of the purchaser, and not on the wrongful conduct of the entrymen. It upholds the purchaser in his honest purchase notwithstanding the wrongful character of the entries. This is akin to the ordinary rule in respect to a bona find purchaser. Equity sustains the title in spite of the fact that his grantor may have wrongfully obtained it, and upholds it because of his rightful conduct.\n Counsel also say that the question is settled by the decision in Hawley v. Diller, supra, relying upon the second paragraph in the headnotes:\n'An entryman under this act acquires only an equity, and a purchaser from him cannot be regarded as a bona fide purchaser within the meaning of the act of Congress unless he become \n\n[200 U.S. 321, 337]\n\u00a0\n such after the government, by issuing a patent, has parted with the legal title.'\n\n There are two or three answers to this contention. In the first place, the headnote is not the work of the court, nor does it state its decision,- though a different rule, it is true, is prescribed by statute in some states. It is simply the work of the reporter, gives his understanding of the decision, and is prepared for the convenience of the profession in the examination of the reports. In the second place, if the patent referred to in that headnote is a patent issued upon a wrongful entry, no such fact appeared in the case, because no patent was issued upon the entry charged to have been wrongful, but after that entry had been canceled, a patent was issued to Diller on a new entry. If it refers to some other patent than one issued upon a wrongful entry, it has no pertinency, for the doctrine of relation never carries a patent back to the date of any other entry than that upon which it is issued. And finally, the headnote is a misinterpretation of the scope of the decision.\n With reference to the other tracts and the denial of any relief, by accounting or otherwise, against the Detroit Company, it is contended that as prior to the issue of a patent, the Land Department could have set aside the entries on account of the fraudulent contracts, the courts will now grant the same relief; and further, that inasmuch as the patents are by this decree canceled and the title restored to the government, the Detroit Company must be regarded as a wrongdoer in respect to the timber which it took from the lands prior to the decree, and an accounting should have been ordered. But this ignores the fact that the Detroit Company acted in good faith, and purchased the timber from those having an apparently perfect equitable title thereto. It becomes necessary to inquire what is the significance of a final receiver's receipt and the effect of a cancelation by the Land Department of such a receipt. The receipt is an acknowledgment by the government that it has received full pay for the land, that it holds the legal title in trust for the entryman, and will in due course issue to \n\n[200 U.S. 321, 338]\n\u00a0\n him a patent. He is the equitable owner of the land. It becomes subject to state taxation, and under the control of state laws in respect to conveyances, inheritances, etc. Carroll v. Safford, 3 How. 441, 11 L. ed. 671; Witherspoon v. Duncan, 4 Wall. 210, 18 L. ed. 339; Simmons v. Wagner, supra; Winona & St. P. Land Co. v. Minnesota, \n159 U.S. 526\n, 40 L. ed. 247, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 83; Cornelius v. Kessel, \n128 U.S. 456\n, 32 L. ed. 482, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 122; Hastings & D. R. Co. v. Whitney, \n132 U.S. 357\n, 33 L. ed. 363, 10 Sup. Ct.

Rep. 877.\n Indeed, in some of the opinions of this court, emphasizing the value of a receiver's receipt, there are expressions which seem to underestimate the significance of a patent. Wisconsin C. R. Co. v. Price County, \n133 \nU.S. 496, 510\n, 33 S. L. ed. 687, 694, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 341; Deseret Salt Co. v. Tarpey, \n142 \nU.S. 241, 251\n, 35 S. L. ed. 999, 1002, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 158. For it must be remembered that the latter is the instrument which passes the legal title, and that until it is issued the legal title remains with the government, and is subject to investigation and determination by the Land Department. Barden v. Northern P. R. Co. \n154 \nU.S. 288, 326\n, 38 S. L. ed. 992, 1001, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1030; Michigan Land & Lumber Co. v. Rust, \n168 \nU.S. 589, 592\n, 42 S. L. ed. 591, 592, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 208; Guaranty Sav. Bank v. Bladow, \n176 U.S. 448\n, 44 L. ed. 540, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 425. But while, until the issue of the patent the land is under the control of the Land Department, which, upon proper investigation and for sufficient reasons, may set aside the certificate of entry, yet this power of the Land Department cannot arbitrarily be exercised without notice to the entryman, and if improperly exercised the rights of the entryman may be enforced in the courts after the patent has issued to other parties. Guaranty Sav. Bank v. Bladow, supra. It is true, as against the government, and while the title remains in the government, he may not be able to enforce his equity, because no action can be maintained against the government except upon contract, express or implied. United States v. Jones, \n131 U.S. 1\n, 33 L. ed. 90, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 669. But while he may not sue on his equity, he may protect that equity when sued by the government. It is sometimes said that a legal title with an equity is paramount to an equity alone; but this is not strictly true unless the equities are equal, for sometimes a superior equity \n\n[200 U.S. 321, 339]\n\u00a0\n may be adjudged paramount to a legal title and an inferior equity. Garland v. Wynn, 20 How. 8, 15 L. ed. 801; Lytle v. Arkansas, 22 How. 193, 16 L. ed. 306; Lindsey v. Hawes, 2 Black, 554, 17 L. ed. 265; Wirth v. Branson, \n98 U.S. 118\n, 25 L. ed. 86; 2 Pom. Eq. Jur.  678, and following. But we need not stop to inquire what rights the Detroit Company will have after a patent has issued. It is enough now to hold that it can defend its equities against the suit of the government.\n It is a mistake to suppose that for the determination of equities and equitable rights we must look only to the statutes of Congress. The principles of equity exist independently of, and anterior to, all congressional legislation, and the statutes are either annunciations of those principles or limitations upon their application in particular cases. In passing upon transactions between the government and its vendees we must bear in mind the general principles of equity, and determine rights upon those principles, except as they are limited by special statutory provisions. And clearly, upon those principles, a party purchasing an equitable right is entitled to be protected in his purchase so far as it can be done without trespassing upon the rights of other parties. The statute provides that if an entry is wrongfully made, it may, prior to patent, be set aside by the Land Department, the entryman forfeiting the money which he has paid. In other words, by the action of the Department the equitable title is canceled and restored to the government. It then has both the full title to the land and the money which had been paid for it. And this is the penalty which is imposed for the wrongful entry. Certainly, when the government retains the full price which it has placed upon the land and also recovers the land itself, it is abundantly compensated for any wrong which has been attempted by the entryman. And a party who deals with such entryman-relying upon the evidences of his entry, which are in all respects in form good and sufficient, and are an acknowledgment by the government officials of a rightful entry-is justly entitled to the consideration of a court of equity. In this case, finding \n\n[200 U.S. 321, 340]\n\u00a0\n the entryman holding apparently valid equitable titles to the lands, it entered into contracts with them for the purchase of the timber. It cut and removed the timber-all in good faith. It is equitable that, having thus acted in good faith, it should not be held to account for the timber which it has already paid for and cut and removed in reliance upon these contracts. The government has every dollar which it would have received in case of a perfectly valid entry, and has also recovered the land. Surely it is not just for it to ask further payment, and from a party who dealt in good faith with the entrymen, relying upon the titles which it had created. If the Detroit Company has taken some timber from the land, it has once paid for it and ought not to be compelled to pay a second time, and to the government, which has already received full pay for the land, timber and all. It is inequitable to give to the government not merely the land and the price which it charged for the land, but also the value of the timber obtained by the Detroit Company. It is doubling the penalty which the statute imposes, or, if not doubling, at least, largely increasing it.\n We think the decision of the Court of Appeals was right, and it is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice Harlan and Mr. Justice McKenna dissent. \n\n\n\n","170":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. DIECKERHOFF(1906)\nNo. 228\nArgued: April 17, 1906Decided: May 14, 1906\n\n\n\n\n[202 U.S. 302, 303]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorney General McReynolds for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[202 U.S. 302, 304]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. W. Wickham Smith and John K. Maxwell for respondents.\n\n\n\n[202 U.S. 302, 305]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n An action was brought in the circuit court to recover upon a certain redelivery bond, purporting to be executed under cover of  2899, U. S. Rev. Stat., U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1921. The respondents, principals on the bond, were partners, as Dieckerhoff, Raffloer, & Company. Achelis and Boker executed the bond as sureties. On January 13, 1897, Dieckerhoff, Raffloer, & Company imported by the steamship Bovic certain merchandise, which was entered in the New York custom house and consisted of seven packages. These were described in two invoices and are numbered 417 to 421, 983, 984. Package No. 418 was designated by the collector to be sent to the public stores for examination and appraisal; the others were turned over to the importer under  2899, Rev. Stat. The estimated value of the entire importation-$1,522-was indorsed on the bond. Within ten days after the examination and appraisal of package No. 418, the collector ordered respondents to return package No. 420. This package \n\n[202 U.S. 302, 306]\n\u00a0\n was not returned. Thereupon suit was instituted upon the bond. A demurrer to the complaint was overruled, and an answer was filed denying breach of the bond, and also that the United States had sustained any actual damages. At the trial a customs clerk testified as to the value of package No. 420, estimated from the invoice, that it was $184.56; that the indorsement on the bond was: 'Vessel, Bovic; where from, Liverpool; amount, $1,522.' It was conceded that the collector had called for the return of the package, that the same was not returned, and respondents offered no evidence. Counsel for the United States conceded that there was no proof in the case that the United States had suffered actual damage, and that they could make no such proof. Over the respondents' request for a verdict in their favor, the circuit court directed a verdict in favor of the government for $ 369.12, being twice the estimated value of the unreturned package. The circuit court of appeals reversed this judgment.\n The sections of the Revised Statutes pertinent to be considered are:\n'Sec. 2899, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1921. No merchandise liable to be inspected or appraised shall be delivered from the custody of the officers of the customs until the same has been inspected or appraised, or until the packages sent to be inspected or appraised shall be found correctly and fairly invoiced and put up, and so reported to the collector. The collector may, however, at the request of the owner, importer, consignee, or agent, take bonds, with approved security, in double the estimated value of such merchandise, conditioned that it shall be delivered to the order of the collector, at any time within ten days after the package sent to the publicstores has been appraised and reported to the collector. If, in the meantime, any package shall be opened, without the consent of the collector or surveyor, given in writing, and then in the presence of one of the inspectors of the customs, or if the package is not delivered to the order of the collector, according to the condition of the bond, the bond shall, in either case, be forfeited.' \n\n[202 U.S. 302, 307]\n\u00a0\n 'Sec. 2901, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1921. The collector shall designate on the invoice at least one package of every invoice, and one package at least of every ten packages of merchandise, and a greater number should he or either of the appraisers deem it necessary, imported into such port, to be opened, examined, and appraised, and shall order the package so designated to the public stores for examination; and if any package be found by the appraisers to contain any article not specified in the invoice, and they or a majority of them shall be of opinion that such article was omitted in the invoice with fraudulent intent on the part of the shipper, owner, or agent, the contents of the entire package in which the article may be shall be liable to seizure and forfeiture on conviction thereof before any court of competent jurisdiction; but if the appraisers shall be of opinion that no such fraudulent intent existed, then the value of such article shall be added to the entry, and the duties thereon paid accordingly, and the same shall be delivered to the importer, agent, or consignee. Such forfeiture may, however, be remitted by the Secretary of the Treasury on the production of evidence satisfactory to him that no fraud was intended.'\n\n'Sec. 2939, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1938. The collector of the port of New York shall not, under any circumstances, direct to be sent for examination and appraisement less than one package of every invoice, and one package, at least, out of every ten packages of merchandise, and a greater number should he, or the appraiser, or any assistant appraiser, deem it necessary. When the Secretary of the Treasury, however, from the character and description of the merchandise, may be of the opinion that the examination of a less proportion of packages will amply protect the revenue, he may, by special regulation, direct a less number of packages to be examined.'\n\n The bond was in the sum of $50,000, and conditioned as follows:\n'The condition of this obligation is such that if each and every package or packages of each and every importation made by the said principals at any time within six months from and \n\n[202 U.S. 302, 308]\n\u00a0\n after the date of these presents and delivered from the costody of the officers of the customs in pursuance of  2899, Revised Statutes of the United States, shall, within ten days after the package or packages designated by the collector and sent to the public store to be opened and examined, have been appraised and reported to him, be returned to the order of the collector without having been opened except with the consent of the collector or surveyor, given in writing, and then in the presence of one of the officers of the customs; or if the above-bounden obligors shall, in lieu of such return, pay to the proper collecting officer of said port double the estimated value of the package or packages of merchandise not so returned, then this obligation is to be void, otherwise to remain in full force and virtue.\n\n'And the above-bounden obligors do, for themselves, their heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns, jointly and severally covenant and agree with the United States that the collector of customs aforesaid shall indorse on this bond the estimated value of each importation as made, and the date thereof, and that the penalty of this bond shall be held to be double the value of each importation as made and indorsed as aforesaid; and that the value of the importation, where there is no violation of the conditions of this bond, shall not in any way affect the liability in those cases where there shall be a violation thereof.'\n\n Upon the facts stated the question is, How much, if anything, can the government recover upon this bond? That there is difficulty in the solution of the question is found in the different suggestions put forward; that the actual damages sustained by the government may be recovered, which is the contention of the respondents, and was the view of a majority of the circuit court of appeals; second, the actual value of the unreturned package, which was the view sustained by one judge of the circuit court of appeals; third, twice the value of the package not returned, which was the view of the circuit court; fourth, double the value of the consign- \n\n[202 U.S. 302, 309]\n\u00a0\n ment, which seems to be the present contention of the government.\n It may be admitted that the bond does not follow in strict terms the provisions of  2899, which seems to require, or at least to authorize, a bond in double the estimated value of the merchandise imported, with a condition that it shall be delivered to the order of the collector at any time within ten days after the package sent to the public stores has been appraised and reported to the collector. The statute further provides that if, in the meantime, any package should be opened, without the consent of the collector or surveyor, given in writing, and then in the presence of one of the inspectors of the customs, or if the package is not delivered to the order of the collector, according to the condition of the bond, in either case it shall be forfeited. The bond given, while it was for a period of six months, in the sum of $50,000, provided that the collector of customs should indorse on the bond the estimated value of each importation and the date thereof, and that the penalty of the bond should be double the value of each importation as so made and indorsed, which, in this case, would make the penalty $3,044. This bond contains the condition that if the obligors, in lieu of the return of the package, pay to the proper collecting officer double the value of the package or packages not so returned, then the obligation is to be void.\n While the statute does not provide in express terms for a bond thus conditioned, it seems to be well settled that, although not strictly in conformity with the statute, if it does not run counter to the statute, and is neither malum prohibitum nor malum in se, it is a valid bond, although not in terms directly required by the statute. Moses v. United States, \n166 \nU.S. 517, 586\n, 41 S. L. ed. 1119, 1124, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 682. Indeed, the learned counsel for respondents concedes that such a bond can be taken, and in his brief says: 'Respondents make no point as to the conformity of the bond to the statute, or the right of the United States or the collector to enforce it in its form as made. For the purposes of this argument we \n\n[202 U.S. 302, 310]\n\u00a0\n concede that it was a voluntary bond, enforceable according to its terms, and that there has been a breach.'\n But we think this something more than a mere voluntary bond. The statute authorizes, it is true, a more stringent undertaking, for literally it authorizes a bond in double the value of the merchandise, conditioned that it shall be delivered to the order of the collector at any time within ten days after the package sent to the public stores has been appraised and reported to the collector. And further provides that if, in the meantime, any package shall be opened, except in the presence of the collector in the manner provided, or if the package is not delivered to the order of the collector, according to the condition of the bond, it shall, in either case, be forfeited. With this ample authority to take a more enlarged undertaking, we think it was within the power of the collector to take the bond in suit, which, taken together, provides for the return of any required package in an unopened condition or the payment of double its value as a condition of being discharged from the full penalty of the bond. There is nothing in this bond which runs counter to the statute, and it is within the authority conferred to take a bond which should be forfeited if the package was not returned in the manner required. Certainly the makers of the bond cannot complain that they have been permitted, by its terms, to discharge the obligation to return a package by paying double its value, when a bond in double the value of the merchandise, to be forfeited for the nonreturn of a package unopened, might have been required.\n The real question in the case, then, is, What, if anything, can be recovered under the circumstances shown, on the obligation incurred in this bond? It is the contention of the respondents that the United States can recover only for actual damages which it has shown that it sustained, and that it was not the purpose of the statute or the obligation of the bond given to enlarge the liability beyond such damages as the government shall be able to allege and prove. But we think the purpose of the statute and the purpose of the requirement in the bond \n\n[202 U.S. 302, 311]\n\u00a0\n provided for therein, and the one given in this case, was to secure the performance of the duty imposed of returning the package or packages, where an importer availed himself of the privilege of withdrawing merchandise from the custody of the governmental officials before it has been examined and appraised. It is the right of the government to examine merchandise imported from foreign countries and ascertain its value for the purpose of fixing the amount of duties collectible thereon. It has the right to hold this merchandise until this purpose can be effected. Obviously, in a country where the business of importing goods has become so vast, as is now the case in United States, it would be impracticable to store all goods and hold them until examination. The law has, therefore, provided for the detention usually of one package in ten of an importation, and given the privilege to the importer of removing the rest of the goods, but to be held intact, subject to the right of the government, if an examination of the packages ordered for inspection shall suggest such course, to require that other packages be returned intact for examination, and if this statutory duty is not performed, we think it was the intention of the law to provide specific damages to be recovered upon the nonperformance of the duty imposed, and to secure a prompt and faithful discharge of which the statute provides for the giving of a bond.\n In carrying out this purpose we hold the law permitted the taking of such a bond as was given in this case, providing that, if the party did not return the package required, he should pay double the amount of the value thereof. We think such undertaking, for this manner of discharging this duty, or paying the value stipulated, was intended to and does relieve the government from the necessity of showing any actual damage or loss. It is suggested that the government may prove the damages sustained possibly by the testimony of informers or of those who packed the merchandise before shipment, and in other ways. But in our opinion it was the purpose of this statute, and the bond executed in the case, to dispense with \n\n[202 U.S. 302, 312]\n\u00a0\n the necessity of resort to this method of showing damages, and to fix double the value of the package ordered to be returned, as a definite sum to be paid for the nonfulfilment of the statutory duty. In such cases the recovery is for the stipulated sum, and is not limited to the damages actually proven. Clark v. Barnard, \n108 \nU.S. 436, 457\n, 27 S. L. ed. 780, 787, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 878.\n It is strongly urged that this in many cases may work serious hardship, and that, in all the years in which this statute or its equivalent has been in force, no action is shown to have been brought upon this theory. But the contract is definite in its terms, and it was the privilege of the importer to leave the goods in the custody of the government or take them out upon giving the obligation which is the subjectmatter of this suit. It may be that in some cases such a rule would permit the government to recover a large percentage of the value of the goods imported, and it is suggested the package not returned may represent the larger part of the value of the entire invoice; but we do not think these considerations should overcome the purposes of the statute and the terms of the obligation incurred in the giving of this bond.\n The purpose of the statute was to enforce the collection of the revenues, and to require that goods shall be as represented, and, if removed from governmental control before the facts about them are ascertained, to require them to be returned unopened, except as provided by statute, or a specific penalty be paid for failure so to do.\n It is further contended that  961, U. S. Rev. Stat., U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 699, protects against enforcement of a penalty of this kind. This section provides: 'In all suits brought to recover the forfeiture annexed to any articles of agreement, covenant, bond, or other specialty, where the forfeiture, breach, or nonperformance appears by the default or confession of the defendant, or upon demurrer, the court shall render judgment for the plaintiff to recover so much as is due according to equity. And when the sum for which judgment should be rendered is uncertain, it shall, if either of the parties request it, be assessed by a jury.' \n\n[202 U.S. 302, 313]\n\u00a0\n But if we are correct in holding that it was the intention of Congress to provide a specific penalty for failing to return the merchandise as required, it is not within the province of courts of equity to mitigate the harshness of penalties or forfeitures in such cases, for such relief would run directly counter to the statutory requirements. Story, Eq. Jur.  1326. We think the circuit court was right in rendering judgment for double the value of the unreturned package.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals will be reversed and the judgment of the Circuit Court affirmed and the case remanded to the Circuit Court.\n Mr. Justice Brewer took no part in the decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","171":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. GEORGE RIGGS & CO(1906)\nNo. 167\nArgued: October 23, 1906Decided: November 12, 1906\n\n\n\n Assistant Attorney General McReynolds and Solicitor General Hoyt for petitioner. \n\n[203 U.S. 136, 137]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. W. Wickham Smith and John K. Maxwell for respondents.\n\n\n\n[203 U.S. 136, 138]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case comes here on a certiorari granted to bring up a decision of the circuit court of appeals affirming the decision of the circuit court and reversing that of a board of United States general appraisers. The respondents imported 'cotton cloth in which other than the ordinary warp and filling threads have been introduced in the process of weaving to form a figure,' to quote the words of paragraph 313 of the tariff act of July 24, 1897 (chap. 11, 30 Stat. at L. 175, 178, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 1656, 1659). The collector and board of general appraisers decided that this cloth was liable to a duty of 2 cents per square yard, under that paragraph and also, the different items being valued at over 11, 12, and 12 1\/2 cents per square yard, to the ad valorem tax imposed by paragraphs 306 and 307 upon similar plain cloth above those values. The circuit court of appeals, while admitting its belief that Congress intended to place an extra duty on figured cloth, felt bound to decide, upon the language of paragraph 313, that the tax placed by it upon figured cloth was to be added only to specific taxes imposed on less valuable cloths by paragraphs 306 and 307.\n To explain: By paragraph 306 cotton cloth not bleached, etc., exceeding 100 and not exceeding 150 threads to the square inch, etc., and not exceeding 4 square yards to the pound, pays 1 1\/2 cents per square yard, with an increasing rate as the number of yards to the pound increases. But a proviso substitutes for the foregoing a different set of duties on all cotton cloth with the same count of threads, not bleached, etc., if valued above a certain sum; for instance, if over 9 cents per square yard, 30 per centum ad valorem; if over 11, 35, etc. Paragraph 307 is similar in form for cloths with between 150 and 200 threads.\n By paragraph 313 figured cloth 'shall pay, in addition to the duty herein provided for other cotton cloth of the same \n\n[203 U.S. 136, 139]\n\u00a0\n description, or condition, weight, and count of threads to the square inch, one cent per square yard if valued at not more than seven cents per square yard, and two cents per square yard if valued at more than seven cents per square yard.' In the judgment appealed from it is assumed that the cloth in question, as figured cloth, is liable to this duty, and that, in deciding what such cloth shall pay, the collector must start from this paragraph. This paragraph must decide to what other duty the one here levied shall be added. If it stopped with the words 'other cotton cloth of the same description, or condition,' no doubt the tax might be added to an ad valorem tax when that would be required by paragraph 306 or 307. Those words might be taken to indicate cloth of similar value in cases within the provisos as well as goods of similar weight taxed under the first part of paragraphs 306 and 307. But, as general words, they would include weight as readily as value; and the mention of weight and count shows that they are used in a narrower sense; for instance, to indicate quality, as bleached or otherwise. Hence the criteria for the duty to which that under 313 is to be added all point to a specific duty alone; and these criteria therefore must determine for figured cloths the duty to which they are liable under paragraphs 306 and 307. You must not alter words in the interest of the imagined intent, and the importers are entitled to the benefit of even a doubt.\n In spite of this reasoning, no one, we take it, has any serious doubt that paragraph 313 was not intended to affect or cut down duties already imposed in clear though general terms. The provisos of the earlier paragraphs are made applicable to 'all cotton cloths' of the sorts described, in so many words. The qualified reading is due to scruples that hardly would occur except to the professional mind. As against those scruples, it is to be observed, in the first place, that the clauses to which we have referred and their neighbors, to go no further into the general scheme of the tariff act, consistently raise the amount of the tax on cotton cloth \n\n[203 U.S. 136, 140]\n\u00a0\n as the cloth becomes more expensive, and that it would reverse the tendency and go counter to the intent expressed everywhere else, if, in this instance, the more valuable goods were withdrawn from the general tax imposed upon their class. It is said that, in some cases, the construction contended for even would make the duty on figured cotton of a high price less than that on cheap cloth.\n In the next place, if the language of paragraph 313 is not broad enough to apply to both classes of duty previously imposed, the easier contention would seem to be that the additional duty created by it was put only upon the first class, that of the cheaper goods taxed by weight, rather than that it cut down what already had been made clear. Such a notion would be disposed of by the fact that paragraph 313 applies to all cotton cloth and to all values, higher as well as lower than seven cents, and by other considerations not necessary to state. But, if anything had to yield it would be paragraph 313.\n The artificial doubt is raised by assuming that the collector must start with the first part of paragraph 313 and find out what his assessment are to be from that alone. That is a mistake. He has before him the whole act. He has been told in the earlier paragraphs in unmistakable language that all cotton cloth with this number of threads and above a certain value must pay 30 or 35 cents ad valorem. Then comes this paragraph, which on its face purports to make an addition to some tax which it assumes to have been imposed by the earlier ones. It is intended to hit all cotton cloths and all values, and it is intended to be added to a tax already imposed. But this would not be the case if the presence of a figure in the cloth changed the rate established by the preceding scheme.\n The truth is, as pointed out in the argument for the government, that the element of value is woven through the whole tissue of the act. The collector does not know what duty to assess, even under 313, without a valuation. It can- \n\n[203 U.S. 136, 141]\n\u00a0\n not be found out what 'the duty herein provided' is, or whether it is specific or ad valorem, without making a valuation under the previous paragraphs, just as if 313 did not exist. Paragraphs 306 and 307 tell the collector to make it on all cotton and to assess a duty on all cotton above a certain value after the valuation is made. Paragraph 313 assumes the duty imposed by 306 and 307 to have been assessed. As against these plain directions, coupled with the manifest intent of the act, the failure to mention value along with weight raises no serious doubt in our minds.\n Decree reversed. \n\n\n\n","172":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. MILLIKEN IMPRINTING CO(1906)\nNo. 227\nArgued: Decided: April 30, 1906\n\n\n\n\n[202 U.S. 168, 169]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Louis A. Pradt and Solicitor General Hoyt for appellant.\n\n\n\n[202 U.S. 168, 170]\n\u00a0\n Messrs.

The court of claims granted the prayer and made a decree for damages (40 Ct. Cl. 81), whereupon the United States appealed to this court.\n The contract is an elaborate and formal instrument, dated June 19, 1899, under the seal of the petitioner, and executed on behalf of the United States by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. It is unnecessary to state its terms. Members of a partnership subsequently incorporated as the petitioner had a contract of like sort expiring July 1, 1899. On or about April 25, 1899, they received from the Commissioner of Internal Revenue the following communication, bearing that date:\n To contractors for imprinting stamps:\n In awarding contracts for imprinting stamps on checks, drafts, and other instruments for the year commencing July 1st, 1899, it has been determined to add the following provisions to contracts in addition to those now contained in the existing contracts for imprinting stamps.\n Each contractor will be required to pay salaries aggregat- \n\n[202 U.S. 168, 172]\n\u00a0\n ing thirty-four hundred dollars ($3,400) per annum for one government stamp agent and two counters, payable monthly.\n As compensation in full for imprinting stamps, the contractor shall charge all persons requiring the same the sum of 80 cents per thousand stamps imprinted, when imprinted upon sheets containing five or more stamps, and $1 per thousand stamps when imprinted upon sheets containing less than five stamps to the sheet. In order to secure absolute uniformity in price these charges shall be rigidly adhered to, and any evasion or attempted evasion of the express terms hereof shall be deemed a violation of the terms of the contract.\n No application for contract to imprint stamps for period named will be considered from any person, firm, or corporation not now engaged in imprinting stamps under contract with the government.\n Each application for contract must be accompanied by the guaranty of at least two responsible persons, that in case contract is entered into and accepted, bond will be furnished in the sum of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) for the faithful performance thereof.\n The Commissioner reserves the right to reject any or all applications and to cancel any contract wherever and whenever it shall appear to the interests of the public and the government to do so.\n Applications will be received at the office of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Washington, District of Columbia, until 12 m., May 25, 1890, such applications to be carefully sealed and marked 'Applications for contract for imprinting internal revenue stamps,' and addressed to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.\n G. W. Wilson,\n Commissioner.\n On May 25, 1899, the firm wrote to the Commissioner stating that they then had the privilege to imprint stamps, etc., \n\n[202 U.S. 168, 173]\n\u00a0\n and 'would most respectfully make application to you for a contract to continue the same for the period of one year, commencing July 1, 1899, and in accordance with your official communication, dated April 25, 1899, we to pay salaries aggregating $3,400 for one government stamp agent and two counters, and to receive as compensation for imprinting stamps the sum of 80 cents per thousand when imprinted upon sheets containing five or more stamps, and $1 per thousand when imprinted upon sheets containing less than five stamps per sheet.' They added that they attached a guaranty to furnish the required bond, and referred to letters accompanying the original application. This letter now is denominated an acceptance of what is called the offer of April 25, above set forth. The alleged mistake is the omission, from the formal contract, of the paragraph in that communication, to the effect that no application will be considered from any person not now engaged in printing stamps under contract with the government, and the following one, limiting the time for applying to May 25. After May 25 an application was accepted from the American Imprinting Company, a corporation not engaged in imprinting stamps under contract with the government on April 25. The damages awarded were the profits which would have been made by the petitioner had it not lost the customers who went to the corporation last named.\n The government objects at the outset that the court of claims has no jurisdiction in equity, and that, although the petitioner's demand is for money under a contract as it should have been drawn, yet, in this suit, that demand is incident to the reformation asked, which certainly is true. Reformation is not an incident to an action at law, but can be granted only in equity. When relief is granted also on the contract as reformed, it means only that the court of equity sees fit to go on and finish the whole case. But we are of opinion that the court was warranted in taking jurisdiction under a fairly liberal interpretation of the act of March 3, 1887, chap. 359,  1, \n\n[202 U.S. 168, 174]\n\u00a0\n 24 Stat. at L. 505, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 752. That section gives the court of claims jurisdiction of 'all claims founded . . . upon any contract, expressed or implied, with the government of the United States, or for damages, liquidated or unliquidated, in cases not sounding in tort, in respect of which claims the party would be entitled to redress against the United States either in a court of law, equity, or admiralty if the United States were suable.' A claim for money upon a contract, which would be like a right of action at common law but for the need of helf from equity to establish the contract, weems to us to fall within these words, in their obvious, literal sense. District of Columbia v. Barnes, \n197 \nU.S. 146, 150\n, 152 S., 49 L. ed. 699-701, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 401; South Boston Iron Works v. United States, 34 Ct. Cl. 174, 200.\n We come, then, to the merits. It is unnecessary to consider whether the court of claims ought to have made the findings of fact required in an ordinary case. We leave that question where we find it. District of Columbia v. Barnes, \n197 \nU.S. 146, 150\n, 49 S. L. ed. 699, 700, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 401; Harvey v. United States, \n105 \nU.S. 671, 691\n, 26 S. L. ed. 1206, 1213. For we are of opinion that the United States was entitled to a ruling as matter of law that there was no evidence which would warrant a decree for the petitioner; and therefore it would be a useless form to send the case back for findings to be made.\n The petitioner's case depends on the assumption that the communication of April 25 was an offer, and that the letter of May 25 was an acceptance. But obviously this is a mistake. The former is a notice, not an offer. Its very first words, 'In awarding contracts,' contemplate the necessity of further action on the Commissioner's part. The clause which it is said should have been inserted speaks of an 'application for contract,' the right to reject applications is reserved in terms, and directions are given for sending them and as to the time within which they will be received. In like manner the letter of May 25 purports to 'make application to you for a contract,' and refers to recommendations, thus showing that it was understood that the Commissioner might refuse what was asked. No preliminary agreement was made \n\n[202 U.S. 168, 175]\n\u00a0\n and there was no new contract until the instrument sought to be reformed was signed. It is true that Milliken, the president of the petitioner, in the court below, says that he was informed by the Commissioner that his application was accepted and his contract would be renewed. But he goes on to say that he then called on the chief of the stamp division, was informed by him that it had been decided that the application of any person who had a contract would be granted, and received blank copies of the contract to be executed, so that the acceptance was contemporaneous with the delivery of the instrument informing the petitioner of the terms. There is no room for the application of Harvey v. United States, \n105 U.S. 671\n, 26 L. ed. 1206, and similar cases, upon which the petitioner relies. The only effect of the testimony is to confirm, by the conduct and language of the parties, the interpretation of the previous communications, which does not need that confirmation to be plain. It should not pass unmentioned that the communications were between the Commissioner and the firm, and therefore not even with the same person that brings the present suit.\n In strictness it is not necessary to go further. For the parol testimony which we shall mention amounts to nothing, except upon the footing that there was a preliminary written agreement. But it is proper to add that it is doubtful, at least, whether the two letters bear the interpretation which the petitioner now puts upon them. It is plain that not all the paragraphs of the notice to contractors after the first were provisions to be added to future contracts. That which follows the one in question was, on the face of it, simply information as to what the applicants must do. The last paragraph, fixing the time within which applications would be received, also obviously was a self-protecting notice only, and although the petitioner does set it up as properly a term of the agreement, the averment is only by way of make-weight to what mainly is relied upon, and we hardly think that it needs discussion. The communication was a general form to instruct \n\n[202 U.S. 168, 176]\n\u00a0\n and direct applicants for contracts. The most natural meaning of the clause principally in question was simply to give notice that applications from persons not already engaged in imprinting stamps would not be considered, and thereby to limit the applications sent in. It is not natural to read it as intended to contract the government out of its right to employ new persons in case a need to do so should arise.\n The petitioner's letter also, in its most natural interpretation, would confine the changes in the contract to the requirements concerning salaries and the rate of compensation. It is true that it contains the general words, 'and in accordance with your official communication dated April 25, 1899,' but it goes on to show what it regards as the elements of that communication material to the contract by the following words. It mentions salaries and the rate of compensation, nothing else. The words quoted are not an independent clause, but they qualify the next phrase, 'we to pay salaries' etc. On these two letters, even if they had made a contract, which they did not, the government hardly could have been held to the disputed terms. It may be mentioned further that Milliken testified that when he wrote that letter he did not consider the clause in question to relate directly to the subject-matter of the contract, and although at a later date he stated that he disired to modify his testimony, the only intelligible modification, if it be called one, is that his testimony related to the time when he wrote the letter, not to the time when he received the contract to be signed.\n After what we have said, but a few words need be added with regard to the parol evidence offered. Milliken says that when he received the blanks he said to the chief of the stamp division that he presumed the only changes from the former contract were those contained in the letter of April 25, was answered, 'That is all,' and thereupon afterwards executed the contract without reading it. If this were undisputed and had come from anyone authorized to bind the government, still, whatever effect, if any, it might have upon an undisclosed \n\n[202 U.S. 168, 177]\n\u00a0\n insertion, it would afford no ground for complaint at an omission, especially an omission of the paragraph we have discussed. The answer was true in letter and spirit, and in no degree warranted the inference that the blanks contained the disputed clause. The petitioner executed those blanks without any ground whatever for assuming that they contained anything which they did not, even if Milliken had been right in what he says he supposed to be the import of the notice of April 25.\n Finally, there is not a particle of evidence that the contract was not drawn just as the United States, through its representative, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, intended that it should be, and for this reason again reformation must be denied. It is true that Milliken testifies that the Secretary of the Treasury admitted to him that the contract with the American Imprinting Company was in violation of the contract with the petitioner. But it is left doubtful, at least, whether the Secretary knew anything about what contract was intended to be made. The act of March 3, 1899, chap. 424, 30 Stat. at L. 1090, 1091, authorized the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, to procure certain stamps by contract, to be awarded under such terms, restrictions, and regulations as might be prescribed by the former with the approval of the latter. But that is not sufficient to warrant an assumption that the Secretary gave directions or had knowledge as to the intended form of the contract. Moreover, so far as appears, the Secretary did not suggest or admit that there was any mistake in the form of the instrument. It would seem that Milliken exhibited to him the notice of April 25 as containing the government's agreement, and that the Secretary fell in with Milliken's interpretation of the paper, but refused to do anything until the Commissioner of Internal Revenue returned. For all the reasons which we have stated, we are of opinion that the United States is entitled to a decree as matter of law.\n Decree reversed. \n\n\n\n","173":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. NEW YORK & CUBA MAIL S S CO(1906)\nNo. 116\nArgued: Decided: February 19, 1906\n\n\n\n\n[200 U.S. 488, 489]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorney General Robb for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. John G. Carlisle and William Edmond Curtis for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[200 U.S. 488, 490]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n The defendant in error filed a petition in the district court to recover the amount paid by it for documentary stamps used on manifests of cargoes on certain vessels bound to foreign ports, as required by an act of Congress approved June 13, 1898 [30 Stat. at L. 448, chap. 448, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2286], entitled 'An Act to Provide Ways and Means to Meet War Expenditures, and for Other Purposes.'\n The United States demurred to the petition on the ground \n\n[200 U.S. 488, 491]\n\u00a0\n that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a claim against it. The demurrer was overruled and judgment entered for the sum of $240, the amount of claim. 125 Fed. 320.\n It appears from the opinion of the district court that the constitutionality of the tax was alone submitted for decision, and the court, upon the authority of Fairbank v. United States, \n181 U.S. 283\n, 45 L. ed. 862, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 648, held that the tax was unconstitutional.\n In the Fairbank Case it was held that a stamp tax on bills of lading imposed by the act of June 13 was a tax on exports, and therefore void. In the case at bar the district court observed 'that the essential character of the stamp tax on manifests was that of a tax on exports, in the same sense in which a stamp tax on a bill of lading was a tax on exports.' The United States now concedes the correctness of this ruling, but urges, nevertheless, that the judgment for defendant in error was erroneous because, as is contended, the stamps were purchased and affixed voluntarily and without protest. For this, Chesebrough v. United States, \n192 U.S. 253\n, 48 L. ed. 432, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 262, is adduced as controlling. In that case recovery was sought for the price of stamps affixed to a deed in compliance with Schedule A of the act of June 13, 1898. The unconstitutionality of the act was asserted by Chesebrough, but was not discussed by the court. The decision was based on the ground that the payment of the taxes was voluntary. Chesebrough contended that  7 of the act, which made it a misdemeanor to omit to fix stamps to the instruments enumerated, constituted such coercion as made the payment involuntary; and, besides, that his vendee was unwilling to accept the deed without the stamps required by the act, and that he 'under compulsion of said law,' in order to receive the consideration for his conveyance, to enable his deed to be recorded and received in evidence, and to give a title free from doubt, purchased stamps from the United States collector of internal revenue, and placed them upon the deed.\n What is the duress alleged in the case at bar? The averment of the petition is--\n'That said act being in force, under compulsion and through \n\n[200 U.S. 488, 492]\n\u00a0\n fear of criminal prosecution, and in order to obtain clearance papers, which could not have been procured without the delivery to the collector of the port of New York, of outward foreign manifests of cargo, stamped as aforesaid, and without which clearance papers the vessels hereinafter named would have been prevented from sailing, or would have become liable for the penalty imposed by  4197 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2840), said James E. Ward & Company, for and on behalf of your petitioner and as such general agents, as aforesaid, purchased and affixed to the said outward foreign manifests of cargo and canceled internal revenue documentary stamps of the United States of the face value of two hundred and forty dollars ($240), as appears more fully by the exhibit hereto annexed and made a part of this petition, and marked 'Exhibit A,' which contains the name of the vessel, the date of delivery to said collector of the outward foreign manifests of cargo, the alleged tax on which is sought to be recovered, and the face value of the documentary internal revenue stamp affixed thereto.'\n\n It is alleged that the stamps were purchased from Walter H. Stiner, a dealer in internal revenue stamps on various days subsequent to January 1, 1900, and that Stiner purchased them from the collector of internal revenue, and the proceeds thereof were duly paid over to the United States.\n In this case, as in the Chesebrough Case, the collector was not informed at the time of the purchase of the particular purpose for which the stamps were to be used, and no intimation was given him, written or oral, that defendant in error claimed that the law regarding such stamps was unconstitutional, and that it was making the purchase under duress. And, expressing the principle to be applied, the court said, in the Chesebrough Case, 'even a protest or notice will not avail if the payment be made voluntarily, with full knowledge of all the circumstances, and without any coercion by the actual or threatened exercise of power possessed, or supposed to be possessed, by the party exacting or receiving the payment, over the person or property \n\n[200 U.S. 488, 493]\n\u00a0\n of the party making the payment, from which the latter has no other means of immediate relief than such payment.'\n Applying that principle to the allegation that Chesebrough's vendee was unwilling to accept an unstamped coveyance, it was said 'if that constituted duress as between Chesebrough and his building company, it was a matter with which the collector had nothing to do. On the face of the petition the purchase was purely voluntary and made under mutual mistake of law, if the law were unconstitutional.'\n It is, however, insisted that these observations are not apposite to the case at bar. The coercion, it is contended, that Chesebough alleged, was between him and some third party. In the case at bar the coercion was exerted 'between the petitioner [defendant in error] and the very authorities who demanded and compelled the payment of the tax,' through  4197 of the Revised Statutes of the United States. This section requires the master or person in charge of any vessel bound for a foreign port to deliver to the collector of the district a manifest, and upon its delivery the collector shall grant a clearance for such vessel and her cargo. It is provided:\n'If any vessel bound to a foreign port departs on her voyage to such foreign port without delivering such manifest and obtaining a clearance, as hereby required, the master or other person having the charge or command of such vessel shall be liable to a penalty of five hundred dollars for every such offense.' U. S. Rev. Stat.  4197\n\n\n\n We do not think this section makes a difference in the cases. The destination of the stamps cannot affect the payment of the tax which they represent. It may be more or less of an inducement to submit to the tax, but who can determine the degree? The loss of a purchaser, as in the Chesebrough Case, may be of much more concern than the payment of the penalty for violating the provisions of  4197. Besides, whatever element of coercion there was came from the United States, and it was not as immediate in the case of the manifests as in the case of the deed. The applicable principle is expressed in \n\n[200 U.S. 488, 494]\n\u00a0\n the extract from the Chesebrough Case, which we have given above. It is stated in Union P. R. Co. v. Dodge County, \n98 U.S. 541\n, 25 L. ed. 196, and quoted from that case in Little v. Bowers, 134 U. S. at page 554, 33 L. ed. at page 1019, and 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. at page 621, as follows: 'Where a party pays an illegal demand, with a full knowledge of all the facts which render such demand illegal, without an immediate and urgent necessity therefor, or unless to release his person or property from detention, or to prevent an immediate seizure of his person or property, such payment must be deemed voluntary, and cannot be recovered back.'\n There was no such imminence in the duress charged by defendant in error. It purchased the stamps of a dealer at various times. No information was given to the collector of internal revenue of the particular purpose, nor claim that the law was unconstitutional. There was no claim of the collector of the port from whom the clearances were asked that defendant in error was acting under the restraint of the law, and yielding only to enable his ships to depart to their destinations. All determining conditions, therefore, are the same as in the Chesebrough Case.\n\n 2. \nIt is, however, contended that even though the stamps were purchased without any duress or coercion, that under the act of Congress of May 12, 1900 [31 Stat. at L. 177, chap. 393, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2276], entitled 'An Act Authorizing the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to Redeem or Make Allowance for Internal Revenue Stamps,' the Commissioner must make allowance for the stamps used by the petitioner, and the Commissioner having declined to do so, the defendant in error has a right of action under the Tucker act. The provision of the act of May 12, relied on, is as follows:\n'That the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, subject to regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, may, upon receipt of satisfactory evidence of the facts, make allowance for or redeem such of the stamps, issued under authority of law, to denote the payment of any internal revenue tax, as may have been spoiled, destroyed, or rendered useless or unfit for the purpose intended, or for which the owner may have no \n\n[200 U.S. 488, 495]\n\u00a0\n use, or which, through mistake, may have been improperly or unnecessarily used, or where the rates or duties represented thereby have been excessive in amount, paid in error, or in any manner wrongfully collected.'\n\n The argument is that by this provision 'the question of duress or compulsion is taken entirely out of the case,' because in most of the instances enumerated 'it is inconceivable that there should be any protest or duress.' And it is further alleged that the act of 1900 was not considered in the Chesebrough Case. It certainly does not follow that, because in some instances, protest or duress cannot exist, that they cannot exist in other cases, not that the statute intended to destroy the difference between voluntary and involuntary payment of taxes. In the Chesebrough Case,  3220 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2086) was considered. It authorized the Commissioner of Internal Revenue 'to remit, refund, and pay back all taxes . . . that appear to be unjustly assessed or excessive in amount, or in any manner wrongfully collected.' The words in italics are identical with those in the act of May 12, which are relied on by defendant in error. Commenting on  3220, the court said, in the Chesebrough Case: It is argued that the provision of  3220, for the repayment of judgments against the collector, rendered protest or notice unnecessary for his protection; but it was clearly demanded for the protection of the government in conducting the extensive business of dealing in stamps, which were sold and delivered in quantities, and without it there would not be the slightest vestige of involuntary payment in transactions like that under consideration. And we find no right of recovery, expressly or by necessary implication, conferred by statute, in such circumstances.'\n We, therefore, think that this case is governed by the Chesebrough Case, and on its authority judgment is reversed and case remanded with directions to sustain the demurrer. \n\n\n\n","174":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. R F DOWNING & CO(1906)\nNo. 104\nArgued: March 2, 1906Decided: April 2, 1906\n\n\n\n Assistant Attorney General McReynolds and Solicitor General Hoyt for petitioner.\n\n\n[201 U.S. 354, 355]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. J. Stuart Tompkins and Comstock & Washburn for respondents.\n\n\n\n[201 U.S. 354, 356]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case involves the rate of duty under the tariff act of 1897 (30 Stat. at L. 156, 205, chap. 11, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 1633, 1693) upon certain sticks of carbon used for electric lighting. The collector of customs of the port of New York held them to be dutiable at 90 cents per one hundred sticks, under paragraph 98 of the act of 1897, which provides as follows:\n'Gas retorts, three dollars each; lava tips for burners, ten cents per gross and fifteen per centum ad valorem; carbons for electric lighting, ninety cents per hundred; filter tubes, \n\n[201 U.S. 354, 357]\n\u00a0\n forty-five per centum ad valorem; porous carbon pots for electric batteries without metallic connections, twenty per centum ad valorem.'\n\n On protest and review by the board of appraisers the decision of the collector was affirmed. The board of appraisers, however, held that the sticks were not within the terms of paragraph 98, basing the ruling on United States v. Reisinger, 36 C. C. A. 626, 94 Fed. 1002, nor within paragraph 97, under the rule in United States v. Gabriel, 99 Fed. 716. And held further, that while the articles in question were not enumerated in the act of 1897, they were 'similar in material, texture, and use to carbons for electric lighting,' and dutiable under paragraph 98 by virtue of the similitude clause ( 7) of the act of 1897. The circuit court for the southern district of New York held that the articles were dutiable under paragraph 97, and reversed the ruling of the board of appraisers upon the authority of United States v. Reisinger, supra, and the circuit court of appeals affirmed the circuit court.\n It appears from the evidence that the carbon sticks are from 12 1\/2 to 20 inches in length, and to render them ready for use 1\/2 inch must be cut off from the shorter ones and their ends burnished or smoothed, the process costing about 1-10 of 1 per cent. The longer sticks must be cut in two, and sharpened at both ends, and it is stipulated that those steps for their completion being done the only use for the sticks 'is as carbons for electric lighting.' They are undoubtedly 'carbons' and their use is 'for electric lighting.' In a general sense they come within the description of paragraph 98. It is contended, however, that they are not covered by that paragraph, because they must undergo a process of manufacture, though slight that process need be. The contention virtually is that the articles imported are not 'carbons,' either in the trade or popular sense, and do not become such until fit for use in lamps. In other words, it is the finished stick that constitutes the entity contemplated and made dutiable at 90 per cent under paragraph 98, \n\n[201 U.S. 354, 358]\n\u00a0\n and that the articles imported are accurately described and enumerated only in paragraph 97, as articles composed of carbon, not specially provided for. Paragraph 97 is as follows:\n'Articles and wares composed wholly or in chief value of earthy or mineral substances, or carbon, not specially provided for in this act, if not decorated in any manner, thirty-five per centum ad valorem; if decorated, forty-five per centum ad valorem.'\n\n There is much to justify the contention of respondents as to paragraph 98. The act of 1897 recognizes in many places the difference between finished and unfinished articles of manufacture, but it also recognizes in many places use as determining the duty. The words 'electric lighting' are very general, and it is the effect of the stipulation of the parties that the imported articles have no useful purpose except for electric lighting, though something further may be required for exact adaptation. However, we may put our decision on another ground, which will be best developed in considering the contention of respondents under paragraph 97.\n The contention encounters a serious difficulty. As was decided in Dingelstedt v. United States, 33 C. C. A. 395, 62 U. S. App. 306, 91 Fed. 112, the paragraph covers articles which are susceptible of decoration, and not, as contended by respondents, articles decorated or not decorated, irrespective of their capability of being decorated. If the articles in question do not fall within paragraph 98, because not finshed, and do not fall within paragraph 97, because not susceptible of decoration, where do they fall? They would seen necessarily to fall under that part of  6, which provides that 'on all articles manufactured, in whole or in part, not provided for,' and subject to a duty of 20 per cent ad valorem. But there is a circumstance to be considered that arrests this effect. Section 7 provides 'that each and every imported article, not enumerated in this act, which is similar, either in material, quality, texture, or the use to which it may be applied, to any article enumerated in this act as chargeable with duty, shall pay the same rate of duty which \n\n[201 U.S. 354, 359]\n\u00a0\n is levied on the enumerated article which it most resembles in any of the particulars before mentioned.'\n The imported merchandise are undoubtedly manufactured articles and do not miss by a great deal being identical with 'carbons for electric lighting' in the most restricted sense of that description. They have, therefore, similarity in all the particulars mentioned in  7 to such carbons.\n The judgments of the Circuit Court of Appeals and of the Circuit Court are reversed, and the case remanded to the Circuit Court with directions to sustain the decision of the board of general appraisers. \n\n\n\n","175":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v.

Luckett for appellee.\n\n\n\n[201 U.S. 390, 392]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n The appellee brought suit in the court of claims to recover upon an alleged claim for compensation at the rate of $1,100 per annum, from November 1, 1897, to July 1, 1902, and averred that he was a clerk in the office of the United States \n\n[201 U.S. 390, 393]\n\u00a0\n surveyor general in Bois e, Idaho, in the classified civil service, from which employment, on said first-mentioned date, he was suspended without fault of his own or just cause. He stated his readiness to discharge the duties of the office, and set forth in detail what he claimed amounted to a wrongful suspension therefrom by the United States surveyor general of the state of Idaho. The finding of facts is quite voluminous, and it is unnecessary to set it all out in detail. The facts pertinent to the dicision of this case may be summarized as follows: Several years prior to May 6, 1896, claimant was employed as a clerk, stenographer, and typewriter in the office of the surveyor general of the United States for the state of Idaho, at a salary of $1,100 per annum. On that date the President of the United States made and promulgated an order relating to the civil service, which provided, among other things:\n'Rule III.\n\n'1. All that part of the executive civil service of the United States which has been, or may hereafter be, classified under the civil service act, shall be arranged as follows: The Departmental Service . . . .\n\n'2. The Departmental Service shall include officers and employees as follows:\n\n ... ...\n'(b) All executive officers and employees outside of the District of Columbia not covered in (a), of whatever designation, whether compensated by fixed salary or otherwise--\n\n'Who are serving in a clerical capacity, or whose duties are in whole or in part of a clerical nature.'\n\n On June 9, 1896, the Secretary of the Interior issued the following order:\n Civil Service Classification of Officers and Employees.\n Department of the Interior,\n Washington, June 9, 1896\n\n\n By direction of the President of the United States, and in accordance with the third clause of  6 of the act entitled \n\n[201 U.S. 390, 394]\n\u00a0\n 'An Act to Regulate and Improve the Civil Service of the United States,' approved January 16, 1883 [22 Stat. at L. 406, chap. 27, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1222]:\n It is ordered, That the officers and employees in or under this Department included within the provisions of the civil service law and rules be, and they are hereby, arranged in the following classes:\n Class E, all persons receiving an annual salary of $1,000 or more, or a compensation at the rate of $1,000 or more, but less than $1,200 per annum . . .\n On September 22, 1896, the Acting Secretary of the Interior communicated to the Civil Service Commission the names of the incumbents, with their legal residences and the dates of appointment, added to the classified departmental service by the extension of May 6, 1896, also inclosing a similar list of such positions and employees in the offices of the surveyor general, which contained the name of the appellee, with his title, 'stenographer and typewriter,' date of appointment, salary, residence, and class. The appellee was verbally informed by the surveyor general of his selection, and, after executing the prescribed oath, entered upon his duties. At the time of his employment the custom was to allow the surveyor general to select the clerical force of his office. Appellee was continuously employed as such stenographer and typewriter until November 1, 1897, on which date he was suspended from service by the surveyor general. No charges in writing or orally were preferred against him, the surveyor general basing the suspension on the ground that appellee's services were not needed on account of lack of work to be done. On November 15, 1897, the surveyor general reported to the Commissioner of the General Land Office an accumulation of mineral work, the employment of certain clerks by himself, with the request for additional clerical force. On November 22, 1897, the Commissioner of the General Land Office advised the surveyor general that the ground taken that certain persons were dismissed because there was no further occasion for their services, and the appointment of other persons in their places, could not \n\n[201 U.S. 390, 395]\n\u00a0\n be sustained. On February 24, 1898, the Commissioner of the General Land Office, in reply to a letter from the surveyor general under date of February 21, 1898, in which he had asked authority to employ two additional draftsmen and four transcribing clerks, to be paid from the funds reported as available, said: 'No authority can be given you to employ the additional force desired, except as provided under the civil service rules. I am constrained to say that but for your summary action in dispensing with so many of your employees, in violation of the law governing such matters, the difficulties in despatching the work of your office would not have prevailed to such an extent.' On May 14, 1898, the Commissioner advised the Civil Service Commission as follows: 'Referring to my request of the 20th ult., for a certificate of a list of eligibles for appointment as stenographer and typewriter, at $900, in the office of the surveyor general of Idaho, I have been informed that an examination was recently held by your Commission in said state for persons possessing the required qualifications, and it is urgently requested that as soon as possible this office may be furnished with a certificate from those citizens of Idaho who are eligible for the place desired to be filled under my call of the 20th ult., as the surveyor general reports that his work is much impeded and embarrassed for the lack of a competent stenographer.' On June 15, 1898, the president of the Civil Service Commission addressed a communication to the Secretary of the Interior, in which he said: 'In this connection the Commission invites your attention to the fact that although Surveyor General Perrault suspended the above- named employees (Lellman and Wickersham) and three others (D. J. Cohen, Joseph P. Chinn, and Alice S. Howey) over seven months ago, on the alleged ground of lack of work (which has been effectually disproved), these persons still remain, separated from the service, while others occupy the positions to which they are properly entitled.' Since November 1, 1897, claimant has not been permitted to perform the duties of stenographer and typewriter in said office, although after \n\n[201 U.S. 390, 396]\n\u00a0\n said date he stood ready and willing to discharge the duties thereof, and he has received no compensation from the United States since October 31, 1897. On November 5, 1897, he protested against his suspension, and on December 28, 1897, he demanded his salary. On January 1, 1899, he assumed office as district clerk of Ada county, Idaho, and served for one year. On April 9, 1898, the Commissioner of the General Land Office directed the reinstatement of the clerks whose places had not been permanently filled, among others naming the appellee, and directed the surveyor general to prefer formal charges against such persons as he had reported for inefficiency, etc., and to hand a copy of the charges and a copy of the order to each of the clerks and give them three days within which to make a response. In pursuance of this instruction the surveyor general, on April 16, 1898, preferred charges against the appellee, and one the same day reinstated him. On May 10, 1898, the Commissioner of the General Land Office advised the surveyor general that the appellee would be reinstated in the service of the bureau, as his continuance in the surveyor general's office would not be harmonious and in the best interests of the public service. On the same day he was offered a position in Washington at $1,000 per annum, without transportation, which he declined. He was offered the alternative of accepting a position in the General Land Office in Washington at a reduced salary, or to await the occurrence of a vacancy elsewhere; but he has not since been offered a position elsewhere in the service. On August 8, 1898, the Commissioner of the General Land Office made appellee's suspension permanent. The court of claims rendered a judgment in favor of the appellee for the amount of his compensation from the 1st of November 1897, from which date, it was found, he was wrongfully suspended, until May 10, 1898, when his services in the office of the surveyor general were discontinued and he was offered a position in the bureau at Washington, which he declined.\n It is the contention of the government that Wickersham was not an official appointee of the President or the head of \n\n[201 U.S. 390, 397]\n\u00a0\n a department, but was merely an appointee of the surveyor general, without definite employment, and subject to removal at the will of that officer. The employment of the appellee is alleged to be no different than the ordinary engagement of master and servant, and it is urged that the attempted suspension by the surveyor general was tantamount to dismissal by an employer of one who was engaged without definite term and subject to dismissal at any time.\n The provisions of the act of Congress of January 16, 1883 to regulate and improve the civil service of the United States (1 Rev. Stat. Supp. 392 ), are broad and comprehensive. By  6 of the act the power is conferred upon the President of the United States to require the heads of executive departments to classify for the purposes of the act and the examination therein provided for, and to include in one or more of said classes, so far as practicable, subordinate places, clerks, and officers in the public service pertaining to their respective departments, not before classified for examination. The order of the President of May 6, 1896, Rule III., provides that the departmental service classified under the act should include officers and employees, among others, 'All executive officers and employees outside the District of Columbia . . . of whatever designation, whether compensated by fixed salary or otherwise, who are serving in a clerical capacity, or whose duties are, in whole or in part, of a clerical nature.' In accordance with the statute, and under the provisions of this order, the Secretary of the Interior, on June 9, 1896, made an order classifying the officers and employees of his department, Class E including persons receiving $1,000 or more salary, or compensation at the rate of $1,000 or more, but less than $1,200 per annum. On September 26, 1896, under the extension order referred to and the action of the Secretary of the Interior, the Acting Secretary of the Interior filed a list of positions and employees with the Civil Service Commission, which among others, in the list of employees in the offices of surveyors general, contained the name of the appellee as a stenographer \n\n[201 U.S. 390, 398]\n\u00a0\n and typewriter, the date of his appointment, salary, and residence, as stated in the findings of fact. By the action recited on the part of the President and the head of the Department of the Interior, Wickersham was brought within the protection of the law and the President's order afforded to persons duly entered in the classified civil service. While he may not technically have been an officer of the United States with a fixed term and compensation, he certainly was within the subordinate places provided for in the statute, and within the 'employees outside the District of Columbia,' covered by the President's order of May 6, 1896. That order expressly included officers and employees, whether compensated by a fixed salary or otherwise, serving in a clerical capacity or whose duties were in whole or in part of a clerical nature. The Secretary of the Interior certified the name of the claimant to the Civil Service Commission as an employee in the office of the surveyor general within the terms of the statute and the Executive order. He was, therefore, entitled to the protection of the President's order of July 27, 1897 (14 Am. Rep. Civ. Serv. Comm. 133): 'No removal shall be made from any position subject to competitive examination except for just cause and upon written charges filed with the head of the department or other appointing officer, and of which the accused shall have full notice and an opportunity to make defense.' If the contention of the government be correct, and the attempted suspension by the surveyor general was equivalent to a dismissal from office, such action would run counter to the requirements of the Presidential order just quoted. The action of the surveyor general was not upon written charges, and no notice or opportunity to make defense was given to the accused, as provided in that order. The appellee being entitled to the protection of this order, and to have notice of the charges preferred, and an opportunity to make defense, the attempted removal, if such it was, was without legal effect; nor can we find any authority, statutory or otherwise, authorizing the suspension in the manner undertaken in this case. The at- \n\n[201 U.S. 390, 399]\n\u00a0\n tempted suspension was held to be without authority by the Commissioner of the General Land Office, and the surveyor general was directed to reinstate the claimant and to proceed by regular charges against him. In the meantime the record shows that the claimant was ready and willing to discharge the duties of his position, and had received no compensation therefor during the time of his wrongful suspension. Whether he could have been summarily removed or suspended by the President or other competent authority is not the question now before the court, but the question is whether the employee, during his wrongful suspension by a subordinate officer, is entitled to the compensation provided by law. We see no reason, in such an attitude of the case, where the wrongful suspension is clearly established, and the ability of the incumbent to discharge the duties of his office affirmatively found, for withholding from him the compensation given by law to an incumbent of the place. If this be not so, then a regular and duly qualified employee in the public service, protected by the statute and the orders of the President made in pursuance thereof, can be deprived of the benefit and emolument of his position by a wrongful and illegal suspension from his duties. We do not think such a contention can be sustained either by reason or authority. Where an officer is wrongfully suspended by one having no authority to make such an order, he ought to be and is entitled to the compensation provided by law during such suspension. Throop, Pub. Off.  407; Emmitt v. New York, 128 N. Y. 117, 28 N. E. 19. This was the view entertained by the court of claims in deciding Lellmann v. United States, 37 Ct. Cl. 128, on the authority of which the case at bar was decided by that court. We think the ruling was correct.\n The case comes to this: The appellee, by his appointment, practically made by the Secretary of the Interior in entering his name in the classified list and designating him for the service required, was entitled to the privileges and emoluments of his position until he was legally disqualified by his own action or that of some duly authorized public authority. The at- \n\n[201 U.S. 390, 400]\n\u00a0\n tempted suspension without authority of law, he remaining ready and willing to discharge the duties of the place, could not, during the period of such wrongful suspension, have the effect to deprive him of the compensation legally belonging to one entitled to hold the position.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","176":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU. S. v. BITTER ROOT DEVELOPMENT CO.(1906)\nNo. 223\nArgued: Decided: February 19, 1906\n\n\n\n The appellant filed this bill of complaint in the circuit court of the United States for the district of Montana, on the equity side of the court, for the purpose of recovering from the defendants the value of certain timber, alleged to have been wrongfully cut and taken by the defendants and converted to their own use from the public lands belonging to the complainant in the state of Montana. The defendants, those of them who appeared, demurred to the bill on the ground, among others, that a court of equity had no jurisdiction over the \n\n[200 U.S. 451, 452]\n\u00a0\n cause of action set up in the bill, for the reason that complainant had a plain, full, and adequate remedy at law therefor. The circuit court sustained the demurrer and granted leave to the complainant to amend; but the complainant elected to stand by the bill, and the same was thereupon finally dismissed. The case was taken to the United States circuit court of appeals for the ninth circuit, where the judgment of the circuit court was affirmed (66 C. C. A. 652, 133 Fed. 274) and the complainant was appealed here.\n (It appears from the return of the marshal that, after diligent search, no service of process could be made on the defendants Bitter Root Development Company, Anaconda Mining Company, and Anaconda Copper Company [ corporations], as they could not be found.\n The bill alleged that on the 1st day of April, 1888, the complainant was, and at the time of the filing of the bill continued to be, the owner in fee and in the possession of certain lands in the state of Montana, described in the bill. Description of the lands from which the timber was cut and carried off was given at great length, and a large number of sections of land were included therein.\n'2. Your orator further shows that on the day and year last aforesaid, on these vast tracts of land, there were then growing and standing great forests of pine, fir, and other kinds of trees of various dimensions, fit to manufacture into lumber for mining, commercial, and all other purposes for which lumber is used; that said forests were of great value; to wit, of the value of two million dollars ($2,000,000) and upwards, the exact value thereof being to your orator unknown; that these forests and the land upon which they were growing and standing were the absolute property of the complainant, the United States of America, and was a portion of its public domain.\n\n'3. Your orator further shows that on this, the day of filing its bill of complaint in this court, the lands above described have, for the most part, been stripped of the pine and other trees and timber that were standing and growing upon them as aforesaid, and, except very small portions thereof, were so denuded without license, authority, or permission of the United States \n\n[200 U.S. 451, 453]\n\u00a0\n or anyone authorized to represent the complainant; and this was done in violation of its laws, both civil and criminal, and thereby and in consequense of said spoliation the complainant has lost millions of dollars' worth of its property under circumstances named in the succeeding paragraphs of this bill of complaint.\n\n'4. Your orator further shows that one Marcus Daly, who is now dead, but who was, on the date and year aforesaid, a citizen of the state of Montana, and a resident thereof, well knowing of the location of these lands, their accessibility, and the great value of the timber then growing thereon, did, on or about the 1st day of January, 1890, determine that he would convert and appropriate to his own use all of the merchantable and marketable timber growing and standing thereon, without buying said timber or obtaining any right or authority, except as hereinafter stated, from your orator, the United States of America. That in order to more effectually carry out these designs and purposes, to conceal his identity, to enrich himself individually, to escape personal liability, and to better deceive the public and the lawful officers and agents of the complainant, he determined that he would organize a corporation under the laws of the state of Montana; and for that purpose the said Daly called to his aid and assistance certain other persons, namely, John R. Toole, William Toole, William W. Dixon, James W. Hamilton, Moses Kirkpatrick, William Scallon, Malcom B. Bromley, Michael Donohue, William L. Hoag, Daniel J. Hennessy, and Joseph V. Long, and by conspiracy and confederation with said parties, and in pursuance of such fraudulent purpose, as aforesaid, they organized, on or about the 12th day of August, 1890, the Bitter Root Development Company, the defendant. In its articles of incorporation, which were duly filed with the secretary of state of Montana, said John R. Toole, William Toole, and James W. Hamilton were named as incorporators, and James W. Hamilton, William Toole, Daniel J. Hennessy, John R. Toole, and William W. Dixon were named as trustees to manage the affairs of the com- \n\n[200 U.S. 451, 454]\n\u00a0\n pany for the first three months of its existence, and the town of Hamilton, in said state, was named as the principal office of said corporation. The capital stock of said corporation was fixed at the sum of three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000.00), divided into one hundred thousand shares, of the par value of three dollars ($3.00) per share.\n\n'5. Your orator further shows that said incorporators and trustees had but a nomiual interest in said incorporation, but certain of them were agents, and others, attorneys of said Marcus Daly, and, as such, conspired with him as to the manner and means by which his said purpose to denude said lands of your orator could be best carried out. In pursuance of such conspiracy it was necessary that a certain number should subscribe for stock in said corporation, which was done, but all of said shares were in fact subscribed for the use of and controlled by said Marcus Daly. Your orator charges that not only in the formation of said corporation and other corporations, to be hereinafter named, said John R. Toole, William Toole, William W. Dixon, James W. Hamilton, Moses Kirkpatrick, William Scallon, Malcolm B. Bromley, Michael Donohue, William L. Hoag, Daniel J. Hennessy, and Joseph V. Long aided and assisted said Marcus Daly, but in many other ways up to the time of his death they engaged with him in the work of spoliation, which, in pursuance of such conspiracy, had been planned and was later carried out as hereinafter particularly described; and said parties other than Daly participated in the profits thereof, but just how and to what extent is to your orator unknown; and your orator shows that such of the above as are not made defendants herein are either dead, outside of the jurisdiction of this court, or have no estate.\n\n'6. Your orator further shows that at once on the organization of this corporation, and under the corporate name thereof, said parties heretofore named commenced the work of cutting and carrying away from said lands the trees and timber then growing and standing thereon, using at first in their operations several portable sawmills, but later, on or about the year 1892, \n\n[200 U.S. 451, 455]\n\u00a0\n a large lumber and sawmill was erected at the town of Hamilton, on Bitter Root river, in close proximity to a portion of the lands above described and the timber growing thereon. The work of cutting, hauling, transporting to the river, and driving the timber to said mill, and manufacturing the same into lumber, was prosecuted with great and unremitting industry for several years thereafter, to the great profit and advantage of the said conspirators, and to the great loss of your orator.\n\n'7. Your orator further shows that not only at the time of the organization of said corporation, but at all times while it was doing business, its officers, directors, trustees, and stockholders acted for and in behalf of said Marcus Daly, as his agents, and had knowledge of its principal operations, and well knew that the logs that were being brought to its mills and converted into lumber were taken, without right or authority, from the public domain of your orator, and that they had no legal right or title to the same, except as to a small fraction thereof, as hereinafter stated.\n\n'8. Your orator further shows that in pursuance of such fraudulent conspiracy, for the purpose of carrying out the same, and in order to conceal such action, said Marcus Daly, aided by the other parties, and as aforesaid, under the name of the Bitter Root Development Company, did, at certain times during the several years of said depredations, apply to and obtain from the lawful agents of your orator licenses to cut upon certain small portions of the tracts above described, and, under cover of such permits, said conspirators not only cut, carried away, and manufactured the timber growing upon the lands included in such licenses, but, well knowing that such permits gave them no right or authority to enter upon other lands of your orator, they wilfully and fraudulently entered upon large tracts of lands adjacent thereto, and cut, carried away, drove, and manufactured the timber growing thereon, and afterwards sold the lumber and timber to persons and corporations to your orator unknown, and known only to Marcus Daly, his agents and the officers of said Bitter Root Development Company, and appro- \n\n[200 U.S. 451, 456]\n\u00a0\n priated the proceeds of such sales to their own use; but just when such sales were made, just how much the proceeds, to whom beside said Marcus Daly such proceeds were paid, in what proportion, in what way, and at what particular time, it is impossible for your orator to say, as all books of account, of every kind and character, were then and are now in their possession, under their control, or with their assigns.\n\n'9. Your orator further shows that in pursuance of said conspiracy, and in the execution thereof, in order to more effectually conceal the same from your orator, its officers and agents, the said Marcus Daly and the other parties before mentioned engaged the services of a large number of men, falsely representing that they had authority from your orator to cut the growing timber on tracts of land not included in any license, and made contracts with such men, by the terms of which the said conspirators were to pay a certain amount for logs delivered at the river bank by the parties so employed, by reason of which representations and contracts a large number of men were induced to cut down trees and haul them as logs to the river bank, and transport said logs to the company's mill at Hamilton, and thereby innocently aided the conspirators in their unlawful acts, and enable them to successfully prosecute the same.\n\n'10. Your orator further shows that in pursuance of said conspiracy, and in the execution thereof, the said Daly and his associates, acting through and under the corporate name of the defendant Bitter Root Development Company, entered into other contracts or agreements with other parties, namely, Kendall Brothers, Harper Brothers, G. L. Shook, William Toole, Andrew Kennedy, D. V. Bean, John Ailport, and divers other persons, to your orator unknown, by the terms of which they were to be paid specified prices per thousand feet board measure for logs delivered at the sawmill at Hamilton, both parties to said agreements well knowing at the time that the timber belonged to your orator, and was to be unlawfully cut and removed. Said contractors, so called, acting for and in \n\n[200 U.S. 451, 457]\n\u00a0\n behalf of said Marcus Daly and his said confederates under the name of the Bitter Root Development Company, during the year 1891 and for several years next thereafter, wilfully trespassed upon the hereinbefore-described lands of the complainant, cutting millions of feet of logs, and hauling them to the Bitter Root river, and thence to the mill of the defendant Bitter Root Development Company, at Hamilton, where they were converted into lumber and sold to the general public, and the proceeds thereof appropriated in large part by said Marcus Daly, and the balance by his associates in said conspiracy, but just how much, and in what proportion, your orator, for the reasons above stated, is unable to say.\n\n'11. Your orator further shows that the said Marcus Daly and his associates, in further execution of said conspiracy, organized other corporations for the purpose of concealing their illegal acts and complicating and confusing the situation, so as to make detection and proof of the same difficult, if not impossible. One of these schemes was as follows: On or about the 14th day of January, 1891, they organized a corporation known as the Anaconda Mining Company, with an organized capital stock of $12,500,000, divided into 500,000 shares of the par value of $25 per share; that within less than one year thereafter, namely, on the 5th day of December, 1891, a stockholders' meeting was held in the city of Butte, Montana, and at said meeting the capital stock of said corporation was increased to twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000.00) and the shares thereof increased to one million (1,000,000) shares; that at said stockholders' meeting it appeared that no one of the incorporators or the trustees that were named at the time of its incorporation a few months before had any substantial interest therein; and later, namely, on the 31st day of December, another meeting of said stockholders was held, at which time it was voted to extend the term of existence of said corporation for forty years from the date of its original incorporation, and at that meeting it appeared that Marcus Daly, either in his own person or as trustee or as a proxy, controlled nearly seven \n\n[200 U.S. 451, 458]\n\u00a0\n hundred thousand (700,000) shares of the million shares of the capital stock of said company, and in less than six months thereafter the capital stock was reduced from twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000.00) to one million dollars ($1,000,000.00), and the shares from one million to forty thousand (40,000).\n\n'12. Your orator further shows that in furtherance of the conspiracy aforesaid the said Marcus Daly, on the 27th day of April, 1894, through his agents, procured to be conveyed unto himself all of the property of said Bitter Root Development Company, receiving a deed from said Bitter Root Development Company, executed by William Toole as its president and Joseph Kerrigan as its secretary, which said deed was duly recorded on page 302 of book 16 in the proper office for the recording of deeds in the county of Ravalli, state of Montana. In said deed appear these words: 'The Bitter Root Development Company, for and in consideration of one dollar, transfers all of its property of every kind and description, real and personal, timber lands, timber cutting privileges and rights, timber, logs, mills, water rights, and water ditches, flumes, pipe lines, and rights of way-in fact, everything belonging to the Bitter Root Development Company- to Marcus Daly.'\n\n'Your orator further says that four days after so receiving this deed, namely, on the 1st day of May, 1894, said Marcus Daly deeded this same property to the other of his corporations, the above-named Anaconda Mining Company, for the express consideration of one million, four hundred and forty-two thousand, three hundred and seventy-nine dollars and forty-six cents ($1,442,379.46), which said deed was duly recorded in said book 16, on page 280. Your orator expressly charges that said Marcus Daly did in fact receive the consideration named in said deed, the whole thereof being directly the result of the spoliation of the lands of your orator, as aforesaid, and that the moneys so received by him belonged in fact to your orator; but your orator charges on information that said Marcus Daly did not receive all of the same in cash, but a portion of same \n\n[200 U.S. 451, 459]\n\u00a0\n was taken in stock in said Anaconda Mining Company, but just how much he received in cash and how much was carried over and appeared in stock of said company, your orator is unable to state.\n\n'13. Your orator further shows that in furtherance of the conspiracy aforesaid, said defendants, Moses Kirkpatrick, William Scallon, and Malcolm B. Bromley, acting for and in behalf of said Marcus Daly, on the 6th day of June, 1895, pursuant to and in conformity with the statutes of Montana relating to corporations for industrial and productive purposes, organized the Anaconda Copper Company, with an authorized capital stock of thirty million dollars ($30,000,000.00), divided into three hundred thousand (300,000) shares of the par value of one hundred dollars ($100.00) each, with an authorized term of existence of forty years, and the following-named persons were named as trustees for the first three months of its existence; to wit, Moses Kirkpatrick, William Scallon, Malcolm B. Bromley, Michael Donohue, William L. Hoag, Daniel J. Hennessey, and Joseph V. Long, with its principal office at Butte, Silverbow county, Montana.\n\n'14. Your orator further shows that nine days thereafter the same persons, named as incorporators of the corporation last named, organized under the same law the defendant corporation the Anaconda Copper Mining Company, with an authorized capital stock of thirty million dollars ($30, 000,000.00), divided into one million two hundred thousand shares (1,200, 000) of the par value of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) each, with the same seven trustees to manage the affairs of said corporation for the first three months of its existence, with its principal office at Anaconda, in said state.\n\n'15. Your orator shows that in the execution of said conspiracy, and for the purpose of complicating the situation, said Marcus Daly, through his agents, did again, and within one year and twenty-nine days after having transferred his property to the Anaconda Mining Company, convey the identical property that was named in said deeds to the above-named \n\n[200 U.S. 451, 460]\n\u00a0\n Anaconda Copper Mining Company for and in consideration of the sum of one dollar, the Anaconda Mining Company executing a deed through and by its president, W. W. Dixon, and its secretary, F. E. Sergeant, and said deed is recorded in the same book of records, on page 441.\n\n'16. Your orator further shows and charges that these several conveyances were made in the main in furtherance of said conspiracy, and in pursuance of a purpose to so complicate the situation as to make detection difficult, if not impossible. That the conveyance by the Bitter Root Development Company to said Marcus Daly, for one dollar, of all of its property, was fraudulent, and that said Marcus Daly did, under the name of the Anaconda Mining Company, carry on the same work of spoliation of your orator's trees, timber, and lands, and that later, and from the time of the conveyance of all its corporate property to the Anaconda Copper Mining Company, he carried on the work under that name until the date of his death. That he continued to use the same means, the same mill at Hamilton, and the officers, directors, and stockholders of each of said corporations knew of the illegal work that had been done, and, so knowing, continued the same. And your orator expressly charges that all of the corporate assets of every kind and character of the Bitter Root Development Company either appeared in the stock of the other corporations or was appropriated by Marcus Daly and his assistants to their own use and benefit; but just how much was carried over in the said corporations, and how much was divided previous to the last deed named herein, and how much of the property of your orator was converted by said last-named company between the date of its organization and the death of said Marcus Daly hereinafter described, and how much thereof was appropriated by said company, and how much by Daly and his associates, it is impossible for your orator, with the means at hand, to state.\n\n'17. Your orator further shows that by reason of such spoliation, eontinued and carried on during the period of about \n\n[200 U.S. 451, 461]\n\u00a0\n ten years, it has lost property of great value, to wit, of the value of $2, 000,000 and upwards; and that Marcus Daly and the other defendants named herein occasioned this loss by wilfully trespassing upon said lands of your orator, and without its consent, or the consent of any of its authorized officers, and in violation of its laws, both civil and criminal, appropriated and converted to their own use the trees and timber growing thereon. That said defendants, or some of them, have had at all times and now have possession of the sawmill at Hamilton, wherein the logs were converted into lumber, and they have received all the proceeds of said sales, and divided the same among them; but by reason of the frauds practised by said defendants, as aforesaid, and their acts performed for the express purpose of concealing from your orator the facts of the case by means of the formation and the dissolving and the reforming of corporations, and by reason of said defendants having possession of all books of account, it is impossible for your orator to set forth to a greater extent the details of this conspiracy, or to show just when or by whom the particular acts of spoliation were performed, or just when and to whom the logs, when manufactured into lumber, were sold, or just when and by whom the proceeds thereof were obtained, and when the same were divided.\n\n'18. Your orator further shows that at the time that these trespasses were committed the territory on which the same took place was but sparsely settled, and was thousands of miles away from the seat of government, and it was impossible, with the means that your orator had at hand, to properly patrol and protect its domain from the wilful trespasses of the defendants, and that the government of the United States used such care in the protection thereof as it had the means to do. That the agents employed by your orator were misled by the defendants' assertion of ownership, as aforesaid; that the frauds and trespasses of the defendants, which have resulted in the denuding of these lands of your orator, and in depriving your orator of property of the value of several millions of dollars, \n\n[200 U.S. 451, 462]\n\u00a0\n were not discovered in their entirety until a comparatively short time ago.\n\n'19. Your orator further shows that it has commmenced several actions at law in this honorable court to recover the value of the timber heretofore taken by the defendants, or some of them, from the lands above particularly described, and that the same are now pending in this court; but that, by reason of the frauds and conspiracies above set forth and the complications which have resulted therefrom, no plain, adequate, and complete remedy can be given your orator by said actions at law, and your orator is only relievable in a court of equity, where matters of this kind are properly cognizable and relievable.\n\n'20. Your orator further shows that Marcus Daly died in the city of New York on the 12th day of November, A. D. 1900; that at the time of his death he was a resident of the county of Deerlodge, state and district of Montana, and left an estate worth about $12,000,000, consisting of real and personal property located in said county and state and elsewhere, and your orator expressly charges that a large portion of said estate was the result of the proceeds of his illegal acts in his lifetime in trespassing upon the lands of your orator, as hereinbefore charged, and converting the proceeds of the sale of the timber growing thereon to his own use and benefit; that in his lifetime he made and published his last will and testament, whereby he appointed the defendant Margaret P. Daly executrix thereof; that on the 14th day of February, A. D. 1901, at the city of Anaconda, said last will and testament was duly proved and duly admitted to probate in the district court of the county of Deerlodge, district of Montana; that thereupon, on the 15th day of February, A. D. 1901, letters of administration were duly issued thereon to the said defendant Margaret P. Daly by the said court; that the said defendant Margaret P. Daly duly qualified and entered upon the discharge of her duties as executrix, and that the said letters testamentary have not been revoked, and are now in full force and effect. \n\n[200 U.S. 451, 463]\n\u00a0\n\n'21. Your orator further shows that the said Margaret P. Daly, under and by virtue of the terms of said will, and as the wife of said Marcus Daly, is now the owner of a large portion of his estate.\n\n\n'In consideration whereof, and forasmuch as your orator is, for the reasons stated, remediless in the premises at and by the strict rule of the common law, and is only relievable in a court of equity, where matters of this kind are properly cognizable and relievable, to the end that your orator may have that relief which it can only obtain in a court of equity; and that each one of the defendants above named may answer the premises, but not upon oath or affirmation, the benefit whereof is expressly waived by your orator, your orator prays the court as follows:\n\n'First. That the defendant Margaret P. Daly, both in her own person and as executrix of the last will and testament of her husband, Marcus Daly, deceased, and each of the defendants above named, be decreed to hold in trust for the use and benefit of your orator so much of their estate, both real and personal, as shall have come to them, or either of them, directly from the proceeds of the conversion of the timber of your orator, as aforesaid.\n\n'Second. That the complainant have and recover from Margaret P. Daly, both personally and as executrix, and from each of the other defendants above named, the profits, gains, and advantages which the said defendants or either of them have received or made, or which have arisen or accrued to them, or either of them, by reason of the wilful trespasses upon the public domain of your orator, hereinbefore particularly described, and by reason of the fraudulent conversion of the trees and timber growing thereon, the logs had therefrom, and the lumber manufactured from the same.\n\n'Third. That each of the defendants may make a full and true discovery and disclosure of and concerning the transactions and matters aforesaid, and that an accounting may be taken by and under the direction and decree of this honorable court \n\n[200 U.S. 451, 464]\n\u00a0\n of all the dealings and transactions between your orator and the defendants. That on such accounting the defendants and each of them be required to produce all licenses, permits, and all other documents of every kind and character which they, or any of them, may have received from your orator, by which they, or any of them, claim or claimed the right to enter upon any of said lands of your orator, and cut and remove the trees and timber then growing thereon.\n\n'Fourth. That the defendants and each of them account for the number of logs received by them and manufactured into lumber at the sawmill at Mamilton, in said district, or at any other mill or mills owned or used by them in the manufacture of said logs into lumber, and also the gains, profits, and advantages which the said defendants, or either of them, or the estate of said Marcus Daly, have received or made, or which have arisen or accrued to them, or either of them, from trespassing upon the lands of the complainant, above described and set forth, and in converting to their own use and benefit the trees and timber growing thereon.\n\n'Fifth. That the said defendants and each of them discover and set forth full, true, and particular accounts of all and every sum or sums of money received by them, or either of them, or by any person or persons by their, or either of their, order, or for their, or either of their, use, for or in respect of the said sale or sales of logs cut from said lands of said complainant, or the lumber obtained from said logs, and when and from whom each and every of such sums were, respectively, received, and how the same, respectively, have been applied or disposed of, and to show when and where the proceeds of said sales were invested by each of said defendants, and in what form of real or personal estate they now exist. 'Sixth. That the defendants, and each of them, may set forth a list or schedule and description of all books of account of every kind and character, and of all deeds, documents, letters, papers, or writings of every kind whatsoever relating to the matters aforesaid, or any of them, wherein or whereupon \n\n[200 U.S. 451, 465]\n\u00a0\n there is any note, memorandum, or writing relating in any manner thereto, which are now or ever were in their or either of their possession or power, and more particularly described, which now are in their or either of their possession or power, and may deposit the same with the clerk of this court or with the standing master in chancery thereof for the purposes of inspection and examination by your orator, and for all other legitimate and usual purposes, in order that your orator may ascertain therefrom and thereby the particular facts and circumstances, which is absolutely necessary in order to enable your orator to obtain possession and knowledge of the details of this conspiracy; and that when such accounting shall be made, and it shall be ascertained that said defendants have received and taken into their possession money or other forms of property directly resulting from their participation in the conspiracy aforesaid, and in the spoliation of the lands of your orator, as aforesaid, that this court shall decree that they pay the amount thereof, with interest from the date they so received the same, to your orator, with costs of this suit, and that your orator may have such other and further relief in the premises as the nature and the circumstances of this case may require, and as may be agreeable to equity and good conscience.\n\n'May it please the court to grant to your orator a writ of subpoena to be directed to the said Margaret P. Daly, Margaret P. Daly, as executrix of the last will and testament of Marcus Daly, deceased, Bitter Root Development Company, Anaconda Mining Company, Anaconda Copper Company, Anaconda Copper Mining Company, John R. Toole, William W. Dixon, William Scallon, Daniel J. Hennessy, thereby commanding them, and each of them, at a certain time, and under a certain penalty to be fixed, personally to appear before this honorable court, and then and there full, true, direct, and perfect answer to make to all and singular the premises, and to stand to, perform, and abide by such order, direction, and decree as may be made against them in the premises, as shall be meet and agreeable to equity, and your orator will ever pray.' \n\n[200 U.S. 451, 466]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Marsden C. Burch, Fred A. Maynard, and Solicitor General Hoyt for appellant.\n\n\n\n\n[200 U.S. 451, 468]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. L. O. Evans, A. J. Campbell, A. J. \n\n[200 U.S. 451, 469]\n\u00a0\n Shores, C. F. Kelley, and John F. Forbis for appellees.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Peckham:\n\n\n[200 U.S. 451, 471]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Peckham, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n Although there is a liberal use in the bill in this case of averments in regard to fraud, conspiracy, and violation of trust, of which the pleader avers the defendants have been guilty \n\n[200 U.S. 451, 472]\n\u00a0\n in various ways, yet, upon a careful examination of the pleading itself, and the actual facts therein stated, we concur in the view of the courts below, that the action is really nothing but an action of trespass or trover to recover damages sustained by the complainant by reason of the wrongful cutting, carrying away, and conversion of the property of the complainant, consisting of the timber on the land mentioned in the bill; and for the wrong thus done we think it clear that the complainant has a plain, adequate, and complete remedy at law, and consequently the court has no jurisdiction of this bill in equity.\n It is not necessary to cite many authorities for the proposition that where the main cause of action is of a legal nature, equity has no jurisdiction, provided the complainant has full and adequate remedy at law for the wrongs complained of. Buzard v. Houston, \n119 U.S. 347\n, 30 L. ed. 451, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 249; Scott v. Neely, \n140 \nU.S. 106, 110\n, 35 S. L. ed. 358, 360, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 712. A mere charge of fraud does not give equity jurisdiction. Buzard v. Houston supra; Ambler v. Choteau, \n107 U.S. 586\n, 27 L. ed. 322, 1 Sup. Ct. Rep. 556; Safford v. Ensign Mfg. Co. 56 C. C. A. 630, 120 Fed. 480, and cases cited in opinion. Tyler v. Savage, \n143 U.S. 79\n, 36 L. ed. 82, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 340, bears no resemblance to the case at bar. As the court there said, there were in the case discovery, account, fraud, misrepresentation, and concealment. There was no demurrer for multifariousness, and no objection in the court below for want of equity, and the case was not one of a plain defect in equity jurisdiction. The suit was clearly one for equitable relief.\n The principal ground upon which it is claimed that the remedy at law is inadequate is really nothing more than a difficulty in proving the case against the defendants. The bill shows that whatever was done in the way of cutting the timber and carrying it away was done by the defendants as tort feasors, and the various devices alleged to have been resorted to by the deceased, Daly, by way of organizing different corporations, in order to, as alleged, cover up his tracks, and to render it more difficult for the complainant to make proof of his action, does not in the least tend to give a court of equity jurisdiction on that account. It is simply a question of evidence to show \n\n[200 U.S. 451, 473]\n\u00a0\n who did the wrong and upon that point the fact could be ascertained as readily at law as in equity.\n The complainant is entitled in an action at law to an inspection of the books and records of these various corporations, and it has the same power to obtain the facts therefrom in that action as it would have in this suit in equity.\n The complainant contends that where property has been stolen or obtained by fraud, equity recognizes the law to be that the property always belongs to the true owner, and therefore its proceeds must also belong to him, and may be reclaimed in a suit in equity against the voluntary assignee or one holding in bad faith. The cases of Newton v. Porter, 69 N. Y. 133, 25 Am. Rep. 152, and American Sugar Ref. Co. v. Fancher, 145 N. Y. 552, 27 L. R. A. 757, 40 N. E. 206, are cited to sustain the contention. These cases it will be seen, upon examination, show that the plaintiff had no remedy at law, and he was able to fully identify the particular property into which the original property belonging to him had been converted, and which was in the hands of a voluntary assignee. It was a question of following the proceeds, and accurately and certainly identifying them, which the court held was necessary to order to permit of such following. The defendants were also insolvent. The case of Angle v. Chicago, St. P. M. & O. R. Co. \n151 U.S. 1\n, 38 L. ed. 55, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 240, did not involve any question like the one herein. In that case the land had been granted to the Portage company by the state for the purposes named, and it was conceded by the demurrer that the officials of the Portage company had been bribed by the Omaha company to betray their trust, and the legislature had been induced by false allegations to revoke the grant to the Portage company and to bestow it upon the Omaha company. The plaintiff had obtained a judgment against the Portage company in an action at law, and the execution had been returned nulla bona, and the bill in equity was filed in the circuit court of the United States by the administratrix of the judgment creditor against the Omaha company to reach the land formerly owned by the Portage company, and then in the hands of the Omaha \n\n[200 U.S. 451, 474]\n\u00a0\n company by reason of its own wrongdoing. Thus there was the illegal and wrongful act of the Omaha company, by which the land once vesting in the Portage company had been taken away and that same land regranted to the Omaha company, and it was to reach that particular land which the Omaha company had obtained by its wrongful act that the bill was filed. Mr. Justice Brewer, delivering the opinion of this court, said:\n'And when the Omaha company, by its wrongdoings, secured the full legal title to those lands, equity will hold that the party who has been deprived of payment for his work from the Portage company, by reason of their having been taken away from it, shall be able to pursue those lands into the hands of the wrongdoer, and hold them for the payment of that claim which, but for the wrongdoings of the Omaha company, would have been paid by the Portage company, partially, at least, out of their proceeds. While no express trust is affirmed as to the lands, yet it is familiar doctrine that a party who acquires title to property wrongfully may be adjudged a trustee ex maleficio in respect to that property.\n\n These lands were identified, and were found in the hands of the actual wrongdoer, who had acquired them by reason of such wrong.\n Now, there is no pretense in this case that any specific piece of property was in fact either the same timber or the proceeds of the timber wrongfully cut and disposed of by the defendants, or any of them. Nor was it averred that any particular timber had been taken from the land described in the bill. On the contrary, it is alleged in the bill that the complainant was unable to show just when or by whom the cutting had been performed, or the logs manufactured into lumber had been sold, or just when and by whom the proceeds thereof were obtained, and when the same were divided. There is a general allegation in the bill of complaint that the deceased, Daly, left an estate worth $12,000,000, located in the state of Montana and elsewhere, and that a large portion of that estate was the \n\n[200 U.S. 451, 475]\n\u00a0\n result of the proceeds of Daly's illegal acts in his lifetime, in trespassing upon the lands of the complainant, and converting the proceeds of the sale of the timber growing thereon to his own use and benefit. It is also averred that he made his will, appointing Margaret P. Daly, defendant, executrix; and the will was duly admitted to probate, and letters of administration were duly issued to the defendant Margaret P. Daly, on the 15th day of February A. D. 1901, and she duly qualified and entered upon the discharge of her duties as such executrix; that Margaret P. Daly, under and by virtue of the terms of the will, and as the wife of Marcus Daly, is the owner of a large portion of his estate. It is plain that such allegations fall far short of even a pretense of identifying specific, definite property as the proceeds of certain other property wrongfully or fraudulently taken by defendants from the lands described in the bill. Such allegations are totally inadequate for that purpose.\n Under the law providing for the examination of defendants, and under  724 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 583), providing for the production of books and writings in actions at law, under the same circumstances that defendants might be compelled to produce them under the ordinary rules of proceeding in chancery, there is nothing in these allegations which shows any necessity for a discovery in equity, such as would render the remedy more adequate therein than in an action at law.\n Nor was there anything in the cases cited by complainant as showing a right to proceed in equity because one of the defendants is the executrix of a deceased person, who, it is alleged, was one of the parties guilty of the wrongdoing set forth in the bill. Upon the question of liability she is entitled to a trial at law and by jury, as well as the other defendants. In Green v. Creighton (Kendall v. Creighton) 23 How. 90, 16 L. ed. 419, it was said that a single creditor has been allowed to sue an administratrix for his demand in equity, and obtain decree for payment out of the personal estate, without taking a general account of the testator's debts. In that case the facts were complicated; \n\n[200 U.S. 451, 476]\n\u00a0\n the original debtor and his surety were dead, and had died insolvent, and a portion of the assets of the estate of the latter could be traced to the possession of his administratrix, and the authority of a court of equity was required to call for a discovery of the nature and amount of the assets in hand. It was said that the debtor, Tunstall, had died insolvent, and Whiting, his surety, had also died insolvent. A portion of the assets belonging to the estate of the latter was in the hands of the surety of this administrator. A discovery of the nature and amount of the assets in hand was necessary if they were subject to the application, and it was held that the circuit court was authorized to entertain the suit, and the decree dismissing the bill was reversed. Certainly there is nothing in that case which in the least degree aids the proposition that because there is an administratrix named as a party, equity has jurisdiction, even though no discovery of assets is sought, and the bill shows that the estate represented by the administratrix is largely solvent, and the demand is for unliquidated damages against others besides the administratrix, and no debt is admitted, the alleged cause of action having arisen against the deceased, among others, for a tort.\n In Kennedy v. Creswell, \n101 U.S. 641\n, 25 L. ed. 1075, it was held that the creditor of a deceased person had a right to go into a court of equity for a discovery of assets and the payment of his debt, and that when there he would not be turned back to a court of law to establish the validity of his claim. The basis of getting into a court of equity being a discovery of assets, the object of the bill was obtained, as the court held, by the admission of the executor that he had sufficient assets, and that if so, the jurisdiction of the court remainded to give a decree for the payment of the debt. Here is no such case. Daly is alleged to have been the principal wrongdoer, out of several defendants, in cutting and converting the timber on these lands owned by the government. He died, leaving an estate of over $12,000,000, as averred in the bill of complaint, and the claim of the complainant is only for $2,000,000. Thus, by com- \n\n[200 U.S. 451, 477]\n\u00a0\n plainant's own averment, the estate is largely solvent. There is no endeavor to discover assets and no ground for jurisdiction in equity simply because one of the defendants is an executrix. The proposition of the complainant would confer jurisdiction in equity in every case of a legal cause of action for unliquidated damages for a tort where one of the wrongdoers had died and an administratrix had been appointed, and the existence of assets was alleged by complainant, largely in excess of the complainant's demand, and the other defendants remained parties. This has never been so held in any case to which our attention has been called, and we are unable to find any principle of equity jurisdiction upon which to permit the maintenance of this suit on the special ground here asserted.\n But it is averred there was a fiduciary relationship existing on account of the permits or licenses to cut timber, which, it is alleged, were given the defendant Bitter Root Development Company, and that in such permits there was set forth an obligation on the part of that company and others acting for it, to make, under oath, monthly returns of the amounts and kinds of timber cut, with a description of the particular tract or tracts from which it was cut, how much was disposed of, and to whom, and that a failure to do so was a failure in a fiduciary capacity on the part of the defendant company, and therefore there is jujurisdiction in equity. The government contends that by reason of the duty of the Bitter Root Development Company to keep true and accurate accounts and to monthly submit statements to the officers of the government, and by reason of its failure so to do, the proceeds of the lumber retained by it became in its hands a trust fund belonging to the complainant; that there was a breach of this trust; its extent is in the defendants's knowledge; and in such cases choice of remedy is with the party aggrieved, and he may proceed in equity for an accounting and pursue the fund. It is doubtful, to say the least, whether an obligation to report as to timber cut on the permitted lands constitutes any fiduciary relationship between the licensees and the government, \n\n[200 U.S. 451, 478]\n\u00a0\n with regard to an alleged wrongful cutting of timber on other and separate lands. It is not, in truth, alleged that the returns called for by the permit were not made. Safford v. Ensign Mft. Co. 56 C. C. A. 630, 120 Fed. 480. However that may be, there is no such obligation (to render monthly accounts) set forth in the bill as being part of the permit or license referred to therein. The bill simply avers that Daly did, at certain times, during the several years of said depredations, apply to and obtain from the lawful agents of the government licenses to cut upon certain small portions of the tracts above described, and under cover of such permits the conspirators not only cut, carried away, and manufactured timber growing on the said lands included in such licenses, but, well knowing that such permits gave them no right or authority to enter upon other lands, they wilfully and fraudulently entered upon large tracts of land adjacent thereto and cut the timber therefrom. There is no mention of an obligation to render monthly accounts. The fact that the defendants had permission to cut timber on certain tracts of land described did not make their cutting of timber on other tracts the act of trustees ex maleficio. When they went outside of the tracts for which license was given, they committed a trespass for which they were liable at law. And, again, as the contents of the permits are not set forth, we cannot take judicial notice of such contents in any particular case. Different conditions may be contained in different permits, and they are the subject of the discretion of the department giving the permits.\n It also argued that a court of equity has jurisdiction in such a case as this on the ground of an accounting. We do not think that this is any such case as gives a court of equity jurisdiction because of an accounting being necessary. There are no accounts between the parties. The cause of action is one arising in tort, and cannot be converted into one for an account. The case made is a plain trespass, for which the defendants are liable in damages. Or it might be termed an \n\n[200 U.S. 451, 479]\n\u00a0\n action in trover, as stated. Whatever books, if any, defendants may have kept, showing the amount and location of the timber cut and its value, can be perfectly well obtained by an inspection of these books in an action at law. No discovery is alleged to be necessary in aid of any action at law, although the bill shows that several such actions have in fact been commenced. The facts averred do not show jurisdiction for the general purpose of discovery.\n Nor do we see that there is any jurisdiction on the ground of prevention of a multiplicity of suits. Those persons who were guilty of the wrong must be made parties in either court, in order to bind them. Such alleged multiplicity is not avoided in one court more than in the other. It is not a case where a few defendants may be made parties as representatives of a class holding under or claiming the same title of right, and so that a judgment against the representative defendants may bind all others of the class. There is no class and there can be no representatives.\n We fail to see any fact alleged in this bill which constitutes a proper foundation for the jurisdiction of a court of equity. The government counsel, however, assert that since the filing of this bill new and material facts have been discovered by the government, which, in the judgment of counsel, would furnish foundation for a bill in equity, even though this bill is defective. In order to permit of the filing of such a bill, if counsel should be so advised, and so as not to run against a plea of res judicata, the judgment of dismissal is affirmed, without prejudice, etc.\n Mr. Justice White and Mr. Justice McKenna took no part in the decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","177":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU. S. v. CLARK(1906)\nNo. 359\nArgued: Decided: March 5, 1906\n\n\n\n Messrs. Marsden C. Burch, Fred A. Maynard, and Solicitor General Hoyt for appellant.\n Messrs.\n\n\n[200 U.S. 601, 604]\n\u00a0\n Walter M. Bickford and George F. Shelton for appellee.\n\n\n[200 U.S. 601, 606]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a bill for the cancelation of eighty patents for timber lands im Montana, now owned by the defendant, on the ground that the patentees did not purchase the same in good faith for their own exclusive use and benefit, but for speculation, and under agreement by which their title should inure to the benefit of another, and that the defendant knew the facts in a general way, if not in detail. Act of June 3, 1878, chap. 151,  2, 20 Stat. at L. 89 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1545), extended to all public-land states by act of August 4, 1892, chap. 375,  2, 27 Stat. at L. 348. The defendant pleaded that he was a bona fide purchaser, excepted as such from the invalidation of the patents by the act, and denied the material allegations of the bill. Voluminous evidence was taken, and at the hearing the bill was dismissed by the circuit court. 125 Fed. 774. That court found that Clark had no actual knowledge of the alleged frauds or of facts sufficient to put him on inquiry (125 \n\n[200 U.S. 601, 607]\n\u00a0\n Fed. 776, 777), and, considering the requirement of clear proof, according to the statement of this court in the Maxwell Land-Grant Case (United States v. Maxwell Land-Grant Co.) \n121 \nU.S. 325, 381\n, 30 S. L. ed. 949, 959, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1015, further was of opinion that the original frauds alleged were not made out. The circuit court of appeals, in view of the pendency of indictments, did not discuss the alleged original frauds, but, assuming for the purposes of decision that they had been committed, confirmed the findings of the circuit court with regard to Clark. One judge dissented on the ground that Clark knew enough to be put upon inquiry. 138 Fed. 294. The United States then appealed to this court.\n The bill proceeds upon the footing that Clark has the legal title to the lands in question. The entrymen conveyed to one Cobban, the alleged partner in their frauds, and Cobban conveyed to Clark, all by warranty deeds. It is true that they conveyed before the patents issued, shortly after obtaining the receiver's receipt, but it is assumed that the legal title, when created, followed the deeds. We make the same assumption. Landes v. Brant, 10 How. 348, 13 L. ed. 449; Bush v. Person, 18 How. 82, 15 L. ed. 273; Myers v. Croft, 13 Wall. 291, 20 L. ed. 562; United States v. Detroit Timber & Lumber Co. \n200 U.S. 321\n, 50 L. ed. --, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 282. See further, Ayer v. Philadelphia & B. Face Brick Co. 159 Mass. 84, 34 N. E. 177. But the position is that Clark is privy to the original frauds, and that, even if he is not, inasmuch as he did not purchase on the faith of the patents, he has no better title than the entrymen would have had if the title had remained in them. No distinction is attempted on the ground that the deeds, as well as the bargain, preceded the patents.\n We may assume for the purposes of decision, as did the circuit court of appeals, that the original frauds are made out, although there is a great amount of testimony to good faith. But the point of law just stated has been disposed of by the United States v. Detroit Timber & Lumber Co., supra. The United States is attempting to upset a legal title. In order to do that it must charge Clark with notice of the original frauds. The fact that Clark, while he had a merely equitable or per- \n\n[200 U.S. 601, 608]\n\u00a0\n sonal claim against the government, held it subject to any defect which it might have, whether he knew it or not, as generally is the case with regard to assigned contracts not negotiable, was not equivalent to actual notice of the defect. It is recognized in the act of March 3, 1891, chap. 561,  7, 26 Stat. at L. 1098, (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1521), that there may be a bona fide purchaser before a patent issues. The title when conveyed related back to the date of the original entries. Therefore actual notice must be proved.\n But so far as actual knowledge or notice on the part of Clark is concerned, both of the courts below found in explicit terms that the proof failed. We perceive no sufficient reason for departing from the rule that, except in a very clear case, where both courts have concurred, we do not disturb their findings of fact. United States v. Stinson, \n197 \nU.S. 200, 207\n, 49 S. L. ed. 724, 726, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 426; The Germanic (Oceanic Steam Nav. Co. v. Aitken) \n196 \nU.S. 589, 595\n, 49 S. L. ed. 610, 613, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 317. If ever this rule is to be applied, it should be when those findings are against a charge of fraud, and when the effort is to overthrow a patent of the United States. The requirement that the proof should be clear in such a case has been repeated in a series of decisions, from the Maxwell Land-Grant Case (United States v. Maxwell Land-Grant Co.) \n121 U.S. 325\n, 30 L. ed. 949, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1015, to United States v. Stinson, \n197 \nU.S. 200, 204\n, 49 S. L. ed. 724, 725, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 426. There is nothing sufficient to show that Clark had actual knowledge of the arrangement by which Cobban got the lands. The allegation that Cobban was Clark's agent in the purchase chase wholly breaks down. Clark was at a distance. He dealt as a purchaser with Cobban, and paid him the market price, and a substantial profit even on the government's calculation. So far as any inference was to be drawn from the nearness of the respective dates of the receiver's receipts, the deeds of the entrymen to Cobban, and the deeds of Cobban to Clark, it was as open to the officers of the government as to Clark, if indeed, he knew anything about those dates; yet they seem to have suspected nothing, and he was advised by reputable counsel that the titles were good, and bought only on his advice. Clark, his agents and advisers, testify that they did not know or suspect anything wrong.\n With regard to constructive notice in addition to the facts \n\n[200 U.S. 601, 609]\n\u00a0\n just mentioned, the government relies on an argument that Cobban began negotiations with Clark before he had acquired title to the lands, not, however, identifying those lands. Assuming this to be true, it requires Clark to have kept that fact in mind when the conveyances were made to him, and noticing the date of the conveyances to Cobban, and of the receiver's receipts, to infer that the negotiations were begun upon a scheme to get the lands from the government by fraud. It requires an actual and not necessary inference from knowledge with which Clark may have been chargeable, but which he probably, or at least possibly, did not actually possess. It is argued further that Clark's inspector must have gone upon the land about the time of the entries in order to do the necessary work of estimating the timber. If, for the purposes of argument, we assume that knowledge of a timber inspector of facts affecting the title, with which he had nothing to do, was chargeable to Clark, still the knowledge is a mere guess. There was nothing present or required to be present on the face of the earth to indicate when the entry took place. We cannot infer fraud merely from more or less familiar relations between some of Clark's agents and Cobban. When suspicion is suggested, it is easily entertained. But bearing in mind, as was said in United States v. Detroit Timber & Lumber Co., that Clark was not bound to hunt for grounds of doubt, and recurring to the canons of proof laid down by the decisions, and to the findings of the courts below, we are of opinion that the decree dismissing the bill must be affirmed.\n Decree affirmed.\n Justice McKenna concurs on the law on the authority of United States v. Detroit Timber & Lumber Co., and concurs on the facts.\n Justices Harlan and Brown dissent. \n\n\n\n","178":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. v.

Shepherd, Robert Pritchard, and Clift & Cooke for defendants.\n\n\n[203 U.S. 563, 571]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is an information charging a contempt of this court, and is to the following effect. On February 11, 1906, one Johnson, a colored man, was convicted of rape upon a white woman, in a criminal court of Hamilton county, in the state of Tennessee, and was sentenced to death. On March 3 he presented a petition for a writ of habeas corpus to the United States circuit court, setting up, among other things, that all negroes had been excluded, illegally, from the grand and petit juries; that his counsel had been deterred from pleading that fact or challenging the array on that ground, and also from asking for a change of venue to secure an impartial trial, or for a continuance to allow the excitement to subside, by the fear and danger of mob violence; and that a motion for a new trial and an appeal were prevented by the same fear. For these and other reasons it was alleged that he was deprived of various constitutional rights, and was about to be deprived of his life without due process of law.\n On March 10, after a hearing upon evidence, the petition was denied, and it was ordered that the petitioner be remanded to the custody of the sheriff of Hamilton county, to be detained by him in his custody for a period of ten days, in which to enable the petitioner to prosecute an appeal, and, in default of the prosecution of the appeal within that time, to be then further proceeded with by the state court under its sentence. On March 17 an appeal to this court was allowed by Mr. Justice Harlan. On the following Monday, March 19, a similar order was made by this court, and it was ordered further 'that all proceedings against the appellant be stayed, and the custody of said appellant be retained pending this appeal.'\n The sheriff of Hamilton county was notified by telegraph of the order, receiving the news before 6 o'clock on the same day. The evening papers of Chattanooga published a full account of what this court had done. And it is alleged that \n\n[203 U.S. 563, 572]\n\u00a0\n the sheriff and his deputies were informed, and had reason to believe, that an attempt would be made that night by a mob to murder the prisoner. Nevertheless, if the allegations be true, the sheriff, early in the evening, withdrew the customary guard from the jail, and left only the night jailer in charge. Subsequently, it is alleged, the sheriff and the other defendants, with many others unknown, conspired to break into the jail for the purpose of lynching and murdering Johnson, with intent to show contempt for the order of this court, and for the purpose of preventing it from hearing the appeal and Johnson from exercising his rights. In furtherance of this conspiracy a mob, including the defendants, except the sheriff, Shipp, and the night jailer, Gibson, broke into the jail, took Johnson out and hanged him, the sheriff and Gibson pretending to do their duty, but really sympathizing with and abetting the mob. The final acts as well as the conspiracy are alleged as a contempt.\n The defendants have appeared and answered, and certain preliminary questions of law have been argued which it is convenient and just to have settled at the outset before any further steps are taken. The first question, naturally, is that of the jurisdiction of this court. The jurisdiction to punish for a contempt is not denied as a general, abstract proposition, as, of course, it could not be with success. Ex parte Robinson, 19 Wall. 505, 510, 22 L. ed. 205, 207; Ex parte Terry, \n128 \nU.S. 289, 302\n, 303 S., 32 L. ed. 405, 408, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 77. But it is argued that the circuit court had no jurisdiction in the habeas corpus case, unless Johnson was in custody in violation of the Constitution (Rev. Stat .  753, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 592), and that the appellate jurisdiction of this court was dependent on the act of March 3, 1891, chap. 517,  5, 26 Stat. at L. 827, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 549 (Re Lennon, \n150 U.S. 393\n, 37 L. ed. 1120, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 123), and by that act did not exist unless the case involved 'the construction or application of the Constitution of the United States.' If the case did not involve the application of the Constitution otherwise than by way of pretense, it is said that this court was without jurisdiction, and that its order might be contemned with impunity. And it is urged \n\n[203 U.S. 563, 573]\n\u00a0\n that an inspection of the evidence before the circuit court, if not the face of the petition, shows that the ground alleged for the writ was only a pretense.\n We regard this argument as unsound. It has been held, it is true, that orders made by a court having no jurisdiction to make them may be disregarded without liability to process for contempt. Re Sawyer, \n124 U.S. 200\n, 31 L. ed. 402, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 482; Ex parte Fisk, \n113 U.S. 713\n, 28 L. ed. 1117, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 724; Ex parte Rowland, \n104 U.S. 604\n, 26 L. ed. 861. But even if the circuit court had no jurisdiction to entertain Johnson's petition, and if this court had no jurisdiction of the appeal, this court, and this court alone, could decide that such was the law. It and it alone necessarily had jurisdiction to decide whether the case was properly before it. On that question, at least, it was its duty to permit argument, and to take the time required for such consideration as it might need. See Mansfield, C. & L. M. R. Co. v. Swan, \n111 \nU.S. 379, 387\n, 28 S. L. ed. 462, 465, 4 Sup. Ct. Rep. 510. Until its judgment declining jurisdiction should be announced, it had authority, from the necessity of the case, to make orders to preserve the existing conditions and the subject of the petition, just as the state court was bound to refrain from further proceedings until the same time. Rev. Stat.  766; act of March 3, 1893, chap. 226, 27 Stat. at L. 751, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 597. The fact that the petitioner was entitled to argue his case shows what needs no proof, that the law contemplates the possibility of a decision either way, and therefore must provide for it. Of course, the provision of Rev. Stat.  766, that, until final judgment on the appeal, further proceedings in the state court against the prisoner shall be deemed void, applies to every case. There is no implied exception if the final judgment shall happen to be that the writ should not have issued or that the appeal should be dismissed.\n It is proper that we should add that we are unable to agree with the premises upon which the conclusion just denied is based. We cannot regard the grounds upon which the petition for habeas corpus was presented as frivolous or a mere pretense. The murder of the petitioner has made it impossible to decide \n\n[203 U.S. 563, 574]\n\u00a0\n that case, and what we have said makes it unnecessary to pass upon it as a preliminary to deciding the question before us. Therefore we shall say no more than that it does not appear to us clear that the subject-matter of the petition was beyond the jurisdiction of the circuit court, and that, in our opinion, the facts that might have been found would have required the gravest and most anxious consideration before the petition could have been denied.\n Another general question is to be answered at this time. The defendants severally have denied under oath in their answer that they had anything to do with the murder. It is urged that the sworn answers are conclusive; that if they are false parties may be prosecuted for perjury, but that in this proceeding they are to be tried, if they so elect, simply by their oaths. It has been suggested that the court is a party and therefore leaves the fact to be decided by the defendant. But this is a mere afterthought, to explain something not understood. The court is not a party. There is nothing that affects the judges in their own persons. Their concern is only that the law should be obeyed and enforced, and their interest is no other than that they represent in every case. On this occasion we shall not go into the history of the notion. It may be that it was an intrusion or perversion of the canon law, as is suggested by the propounding of interrogatories and the very phrase, 'purgation by oath' ( juramentum purgatorium). If so, it is a fragment of a system of proof which does not prevail in theory or as a whole; and the reason why it has not disappeared perhaps may be found in the rarity with which contempts occur. It may be that even now, if the sole question were the intent of an ambiguous act, the proposition would apply. But in this case it is a question of personal presence and overt acts. If the presence and the acts should be proved there would be little room for the disavowal of intent. And when the acts alleged consist in taking part in a murder it cannot be admitted that a general denial and affidavit should dispose of the case. The outward facts \n\n[203 U.S. 563, 575]\n\u00a0\n are matters known to many and they will be ascertained by testimony in the usual way. The question was left open in Re Savin, \n131 U.S. 267\n, 33 L. ed. 150, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 699, with a visible leaning toward the conclusion to which we come, and that conclusion has been adopted by state courts in decisions entitled to respect. Huntington v. McMahon, 48 Conn. 174, 200, 201; State v. Matthews, 37 N. H. 450, 455; Bates's Case, 55 N. H. 325, 327; Re Snyder, 103 N. Y. 178, 181, 8 N. E. 479; Crow v. State, 24 Tex. 12, 14; State ex rel. Mason v. Harper's Ferry Bridge Co. 16 W. Va. 864, 873. See Wartman v. Wartman, Taney, 362, 370, Fed. Cas. No. 17, 210; Cartwright's Case, 114 Mass. 230; Eilenbecker v. District Court, \n134 U.S. 31\n, 33 L. ed. 801, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 424. Whether or not Rev. Stat.  725, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 583, applies to this court, it embodies the law so far as it goes. We see no reason for emasculating the power given by that section, and making it so nearly futile as it would be if it were construed to mean that all contemners willing to run the slight risk of a conviction for perjury can escape.\n The question was touched, in argument, whether the acts charged constitute a contempt. We are of opinion that they do, and that their character does not depend upon a nice inquiry whether, after the order made by this court, the sheriff was to be regarded as bailee of the United States or still held the prisoner in the name of the state alone. Either way, the order suspended further proceedings by the state against the prisoner, and required that he should be forthcoming to abide the further order of this court. It may be found that what created the mob and led to the crime was the unwillingness of its members to submit to the delay required for the trial of the appeal. From that to the intent to prevent that delay and the hearing of the appeal is a short step. If that step is taken the contempt is proved.\n These preliminaries being settled the trial of the case will proceed.\n Mr. Justice Moody took no part in the decision. \n\n\n\n","179":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nVALENTINA v. MERCER(1906)\nNo. 404\nArgued: February 27, 1906Decided: March 12, 1906\n\n\n\n The appellant has appealed from an order of the United States circuit for the district of New Jersey, refusing her application for a writ of habeas corpus.\n In her application for the writ, appellant stated that she had been indicted in the Bergen county court of oyer and terminer, in the state of New Jersey, in April, 1904, for the murder of one Rosa Salza, and that she had been convicted on the trial of such indictment by a jury, and sentenced to be hanged on the 19th day of May, 1904. She averred that she had been convicted without authority of law, and that her conviction was null and void, because the question of her guilt or innocence of murder was not entertained by the court or submitted to the jury, as the law of New Jersey expressly requires in all cases where parties are indicted for murder, but, on the contrary, she averred that evidence was taken in said court in said proceedings on her trial merely to determine the degree of her guilt; that her counsel, assigned by the court to represent \n\n[201 U.S. 131, 132]\n\u00a0\n her in said proceedings, had so stated in a petition in her behalf, made to the court of pardons of the state of New Jersey. She further said that it was stated by her counsel, in that same petition, that she had pleaded guilty when she was arraigned, but that, under the direction of the court, a plea of not guilty was entered so that evidence might be taken for the purpose of determining the degree of guilt. The averment she denied. The petitioner claimed that the proceedings were wholly unwarranted by the law of New Jersey; and that the court and her counsel proceeded under the impression that  68 of the act for the punishment of crimes, approved March 27, 1874, which provided that 'if a person indicted for murder should be convicted by confession in open court, the court should proceed by examining witnesses to determine the degree of the crime,' was then in existence, whereas she said the act had been repealed in 1893, and the present law passed, which provides, 'if, upon arraignment, such plea of guilty shall be offered, it shall be disregarded and a plea of not guilty entered, and a jury impaneled shall try the case in manner aforesaid.' The petitioner urged in her petition that by the proceedings adopted upon her trial she was deprived of all benefit of the presumption of innocence and of reasonable doubt to which she was entitled by law, and that the questions of self-defense and manslaughter, fairly raised by her testimony, were excluded from the consideration of the jury, and the question submitted to them was limited by the court simply as to whether she was guilty of murder in the first degree or not, and the benefit of reasonable doubt was confined to that point.\n A writ of error was sued out by the petitioner and her case was brought before the court of errors and appeals, the highest court of the state of New Jersey, for the purpose of review, and, after a hearing, that court refused a new trial. The case is reported in 71 N. J. L. 552, 60 Atl. 177.\n It appears from the record herein that upon the trial proof was given that the petitioner stabbed the deceased with a knife a great many times in the neck and breast, killing her instantly. \n\n[201 U.S. 131, 133]\n\u00a0\n Counsel who had been assigned to defend the petitioner called her as a witness, and she admitted that she stabbed the deceased and killed her. She said that the deceased had a child in her arms at the time, and that the petitioner said to her that she did not want to raise any trouble, and told her to put the child away, but that the deceased had the knife in her hand, right behind her dress, and that when petitioner saw that she had the knife and that the deceased was going to stab her, petitioner took the knife and grabbed the deceased by the hair, and before deceased stabbed her she took the knife away from her and stabbed the deceased.\n Upon opening for the defense her counsel said as follows:\n'This defendant, when arraigned in open court, made confession of the commission of this crime, and you, gentlemen of the jury, from the evidence that has been produced on the part of the state, and that which shall be offered on the part of the defense, will simply have to determine what the degree of guilt shall be; your verdict will be either that she is guilty of the taking of the life of this woman, Mrs. Salza, with malice aforethought, premeditated, which would mean a verdict of murder in the first degree, or your verdict will be murder in the second degree; so that I find myself in a very peculiar position. It is one of those cases around which-the circumstances being such-that we stand, as it were, with only the defendant to testify. After you have heard her testimony, and possibly one or two witnesses in connection therewith, the case will then be given to you for you to determine whether this woman shall forfeit her life for the act which she committed on March 10th, last, or whether she shall suffer the penalty which the law will inflict by reason of a verdict of murder in the second degree.'\n\n After that the evidence was given on the part of the defense, and the defendant was called as a witness, and admitted the killing.\n Mr. James M. Trimble for appellant.\n\n\n[201 U.S. 131, 136]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Robert H. McCarter for appellee.\n\n\n\n[201 U.S. 131, 138]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Peckham, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n In this case, as in that of Felts v. Murphy, decided this day [\n201 U.S. 123\n, 50 L. ed. --, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 366]. the question arises on an appeal from an order of the circuit court of the United States for the district of New Jersey, refusing appellant's petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Our power to interfere in cases of this nature is limited entirely to the question of jurisdiction. If the state court had jurisdiction to try the case, and had jurisdiction over the person of the accused, and never lost such jurisdiction, the Federal circuit court was right in denying the application of petitioner for a writ, and its order must be affirmed. A writ of this nature cannot perform the function of a writ of error. We again cite the authorities referred to in the Felts Case: Ex parte Bigelow, \n113 U.S. 328\n, 25 L. ed. 1005, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 542; Re Lennon, \n166 \nU.S. 548, 552\n, 41 S. L. ed. 1110, 1112, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 658; Re Eckart, \n166 U.S. 481\n, 41 L. ed. 1085, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 638.\n The contention of the counsel for the petitioner is that the proceedings upon the trial, which resulted in appellant's sentence to death, did not amount to a trial at common law, or a proceeding authorized by any statute. That it was a mere inquiry to determine the degree of murder of which defendant was guilty, and hence she has never had a trial by due process of law, and the action of the state court was without jurisdiction. A perusal of the charge of the court to the jury shows that the whole case was presented to the jury upon the evidence that was produced in court. Upon all the evidence given the court stated to the jury that there was no evidence to show that the defendant killed the deceased in her necessary self-defense, and the court instructed the jury that it would not be justified in acquitting the defendant on the ground of self-defense. The court further said that there was no question \n\n[201 U.S. 131, 139]\n\u00a0\n of manslaughter in the case, and that, not only as a necessary conclusion from the evidence, but upon the admitted facts in the case, the defendant was guilty of the crime of murder, and the only question left for the consideration of the jury was whether it was murder in the first degree or second degree. The court gave an extended explanation as to what constituted murder in the first degree and what constituted murder in the second degree, and stated that the defendant was guilty of murder in the second degree, unless the evidence satisfied the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intended to take the life of deceased, and that the intent was carried into execution deliberately, wilfully, and with premeditation. Finally, the court submitted to the jury the case, and instructed it to consider all the evidence according to the recollection of the jury, and giving to the evidence such weight as it possessed on the mind of the jury. The court stated it was the duty of the jury to determine whether the defendant intended to kill the deceased, and carried out that purpose wilfully, deliberately, and with premeditation. If she did, she was guilty of murder in the first degree, and it was the duty of the jury to say so. If not, then, on the admitted facts, she was guilty of murder in the second degree, and it was the duty of the jury to say that by its verdict. The jury found the petitioner guilty of murder in the first degree.\n The charge of the court was the subject of review by the court of last resort of the state of New Jersey, and it was held by that court to be without error. Upon the record in this case there can, in our judgment, be no possible doubt that the petitioner has had a valid trial by a court having jurisdiction of the subject-matter and of the person of the accused, and that there was no loss of jurisdiction over either at any time during the trial. What effect was to be given by the court to the admission of counsel (above set forth) was a question of law for the court to decide, and the charge of the court did not oust it of jurisdiction to proceed in the trial of the case. \n\n[201 U.S. 131, 140]\n\u00a0\n This is to us so plain a proposition that it is unnecessary to enlarge upon it.\n Having no power to review on this writ any other question than that of the jurisdiction of the court in the trial and sentence pronounced upon the verdict of guilty, and concluding that there was the necessary jurisdiction the order of the Circuit Court refusing the writ of habeas corpus is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","180":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nW J MCCAHAN SUGAR REFINING CO. v. THE WILDCROFT(1906)\nNo. 127\nArgued: Decided: April 2, 1906\n\n\n\n Messrs. Horace L. Cheyney and John F. Lewis for petitioner.[ W J McCahan Sugar Refining Co v. the Wildcroft \n201 U.S. 378\n (1906) ]\n\n\n[201 U.S. 378, 380]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. J. Parker Kirlin and Charles R. Hickox for respondent.\n\n\n\n[201 U.S. 378, 384]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n The original action was begun by the filing of a libel in the district court of the United States for the eastern district of Pennsylvania, to recover damages alleged to have been sustained by the petitioner, with respect to a cargo of sugar of which it was the consignec, shipped upon the steamship Wildcroft from ports in Cuba to Philadelphia. The evidence showed that in the month of April, 1901, the Wildcroft, having discharged a cargo of coal at the port of Havana, proceeded to Cardenas and Matanzas, where she took on the load of sugar, to be delivered to the petitioner in Philadelphia. This sugar was stored in bags in holds Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the ship. On the voyage a severe storm was encountered and some damage was done by salt water finding its way into hold No. 3 because of the tearing away of the tarpaulins over the hatches and the washing off of the starboard ventilator cover. At the \n\n[201 U.S. 378, 385]\n\u00a0\n hearing in the district court the claim for damage, because of injury alleged to have been caused to the sugar in holds Nos. 1 and 2, was held to be waived by the libellant, who disclaimed damage on that account. And the district judge added, we think correctly, as to the surface damage in hold No. 3, 'This damage was concededly caused by a peril of the seas.' There is nothing in the testimony to show that the injury to the cargo of sugar in holds Nos. 3 and 4 of the vessel by means of fresh water was occasioned until the ship arrived at Philadelphia.\n A more distinct understanding of the construction of the vessel and the manner in which fresh water could be communicated to hold No. 3, and from thence into hold No. 4, may be had by a perusal of the full finding of the facts made in the case in the district court (124 Fed. 631, 126 Fed. 229), approved by the circuit court of appeals (65 C. C. A. 145, 130 Fed. 521), which findings fully explain the situation and the method by which the injury was inflicted. It is enough for us to say that both courts unite in the conclusion that the cargo was injured on Monday, April 29, after the ship arrived at the dock in Philadelphia, when, because of the letting in of fresh water for the purpose of filling the engine-room tank, which was accomplished by opening a valve on the ship's side which admits water from the river, and because of an open cock to a valve in the connection from the tank-filling pipe to the service or feed donkey, connecting with the distribution box, water was permitted to flow from the tank-filling pipe through this open cock to the distribution chest and down a pipe and through a valve, which must have also been held open in some way so that water flowed into this suction pipe leading into No. 3 hold, and flowing thence into No. 4 hold, damaged the cargo of sugar therein contained. It is evident from the testimony that if these cocks, and more particularly the one marked 'D,' had been properly closed, the water could not have found its way into the holds and inflicted the damage. Of these findings the circuit court of \n\n[201 U.S. 378, 386]\n\u00a0\n appeals, adopting the conclusions of the court below, said: 'All of the testimony in this respect is uncontradicted, and no facts are shown from which any other conclusion can be drawn, than that the water which came into the bottom of these holds, to the depth of several feet, doing the damage in question, came in after the early morning of the 29th of April, and before the close of that day, while the cargo was being discharged at the wharf in Philadelphia. It is not disputed that the water was fresh water, such as was the water in the Delaware river, in which she was lying. In connection with these facts, it was shown by the testimony that the sea cock for filling the engine-room tank was open at 10 o'clock that morning, and kept open for a period of three hours, and that if two certain cocks, fully described in the evidence and pointed out by the learned judge of the court below, were left open by accident or design, there would be a free flow of water from the open sea cock into the bilges of hold No. 3. Directly after the filling of the tank and the closing of the sea cock, water to a considerable depth was reported in holds No. 3 and No. 4. This sea cock had not been open from the time the cargo was put on board in Cuba until, as just stated, on the morning of the 29th of April, at Philadelphia. We think the court below was fully justified in its finding, that the damage here in question was due to 'the water that flowed into the hold through the pipe line on April 29th, in the manner just described,' and that 'it is impossible that the damage could have occurred in any other way.\"\n In order to have the benefit of the exemptions provided in the Harter act (27 Stat. at L. 445, chap. 105, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2946) against errors of management or navigation, by reason of the 3d section, which was relied upon in the case it was incumbent upon the shipowner to prove that the vessel was seaworthy at the time of beginning the voyage, or that due diligence had been used to make her so. International Nav. Co. v. Farr & B. Mfg. Co. \n181 U.S. 218\n, 45 L. ed. 830, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 591; The Southwark (Martin v. The Southwark) 191 \n\n[201 U.S. 378, 387]\n\u00a0\n U. S. 1, 48 L. ed. 65, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1. It, therefore, became incumbent upon the shipowner to show that a due and proper inspection had been had and the vessel ascertained to be in all respects seaworthy and fit to carry the cargo which she had undertaken to transport, or that due diligence to that end had been used. As we understand the findings of both the district court and the court of appeals, the testimony in this regard introduced by the shipowner was sufficient in the judgment of those courts, to establish that the vessel was seaworthy in the respects involved, and that an inspection had been had, and the valves and connections, the negligent use of which was productive of this injury, found in due order at the beginning of the voyage. This finding of two courts will ordinarily not be disturbed, and is usually accepted by this court as conclusive The Carib Prince (Wupperman v. The Carib Prince) \n170 \nU.S. 655, 658\n, 42 S. L. ed. 1181, 1185, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 753. The only testimony directly upon the subject at the hearing was that of the master and the engineer, taken upon deposition in England, upon interrogatories filed. The charge in the libel was very broad and general, and the interrogatories were not as specific as they might have been, and no cross interrogatories were filed. While the testimony is not as specific as it might be, we still think it was sufficient to show that an inspection was had, and everything found in order at the beginning as well as during the voyage, and from the record we reach the conclusion, sustained by the findings of the courts below, that the ship was seaworthy in all respects at the beginning of the voyage, and it was a careless and recent opening of the valve or valves, shortly before the fresh water was let in, which resulted in the damage complained of. We are very clear that this is not a case where the findings of the court below can be disturbed, as was our conclusion in the case of The Southwark, supra, relied upon by the petitioner, where it was shown that the damage inflicted was the result of unseaworthiness in respect to a condition which a proper inspection of the vessel at the beginning of the voyage would have discovered and remedied. We, therefore, reach the conclusion that the decree of the \n\n[201 U.S. 378, 388]\n\u00a0\n circuit court of appeals should be affirmed, and but for its construction of the rule of evidence in cases of this kind this opinion might well end here. But we are unable to agree with the views expressed in the opinion of the learned circuit court of appeals to the effect that where a shipowner seeks the protection of the immunity afforded by the Harter act under  3, reliance may be had upon the presumption of law that the vessel was seaworthy at the beginning of the voyage, and that it is only in cases of conflicting proof that the burden is imposed upon the shipowner of establishing by testimony the seaworthiness of the vessel, or due diligence in that behalf, in order to have the benefit of the act. We think this construction of the law is opposed to the terms and policy of the act, and contrary to the decisions of this court heretofore announced, from which we see no occasion to depart. The relief afforded by the 3d section of the Harter act to the owner of a vessel transporting property is purely statutory. In the case at bar there could be no question as to the liability of the vessel owner from the established facts of the case, but for the immunity afforded by that act. To permit a cargo of sugar to be injured by the introduction of fresh water in the manner shown, but for the provisions of this act, would have made a case of clear liability against the owner; and where the statute has given immunity against such loss by reason of error in navigation or management, it does so upon the distinct condition that the woner shall show that the vessel was in all respects seaworthy and properly manned, equipped, and supplied for the voyage; or, if this cannot be established, that he has used due diligence to obtain this end. The discharge of this duty is not left to any presumption in the absence of proof. It is the condition precedent, compliance with which is required of the vessel owner in order to give him the benefit of the immunity afforded by the act. The reason for requiring this proof by the owner is apparent. He is bound to furnish a seaworthy and properly equipped ship for the purpose of the voyage. Whether he has done so is a matter \n\n[201 U.S. 378, 389]\n\u00a0\n peculiarly within his own knowledge. The inspection which he can give, but which the shipper cannot give, for lack of opportunity, will establish whether this duty has been complied with. The whole matter is in the control of the owner. The law says, in substance, that when the owner can show that he has discharged this duty he shall be relieved from errors of navigation and management on the voyage, over which he has not such direct control. It is not a case where there is either the necessity or propriety of resorting to presumptions. It is only when he has discharged the burden which the law imposes upon him, and shown that he has furnished a vessel, fit and seaworthy, or has used due diligence to that end, that the law relieves him of the liability which he would otherwise incur. This construction of the statute has been more than once announced in the decisions of this court; recently in International Nav. Co. v. Farr & B. Mfg. Co. \n181 \nU.S. 218, 226\n, 45 S. L. ed. 830, 833, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 591, in which this court, speaking through Mr. Chief Justice Fuller, said: 'We repeat, that even if the loss occur through fault or error in management, the exemption cannot be availed of unless the vessel was seaworthy when she sailed, or due diligence to make her so had been exercised, and it is for the owner to establish the existence of one or the other of these conditions.' This case was quoted and followed in the still later case of The Southwark, supra, in which it was reiterated that the burden was upon the vessel owner to show by reasonable and proper tests that the vessel was seaworthy and in a fit condition to receive and transport the cargo undertaken to be carried, and that if, by failure to adopt such tests and furnish the required proof, the question of the ship's seaworthiness was left in doubt, that doubt must be resolved in favor of the shipper, because the vessel owner had not sustained the burden cast upon him by the law to establish that he had used due diligence to furnish a seaworthy vessel.\n While we, therefore, accept the decision of the learned circuit court of appeals as to the facts in this case, we do not \n\n[201 U.S. 378, 390]\n\u00a0\n wish to be regarded as sanctioning any relaxation of the rule above stated, already laid down in the prior decisions of this court.\n Decree affirmed.\n Mr. Justice Brown concurs in the result. \n\n\n\n","181":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWARNER v. GRAYSON(1906)\nNo. 89\nArgued: Decided: January 8, 1906\n\n\n\n\n[200 U.S. 257, 258]\n\u00a0\n These are appeals from a decree of the court of appeals of the District of Columbia, affirming a decree of the supreme court of the District. The bill in the original case was filed by Grayson and others against Wood, Talbott, Duke, and others, for the appointment of a receiver for certain property situated in Washington, known as the Victoria flats; also praying an injunction to restrain the sale of the property by the trustees of the first mortgage; to have an adjudication of the right of an easement alleged to be appurtenant to the property, and for the sale of the Victoria flats and certain property adjacent thereto, for the marshaling of encumbrances, and for general relief. The facts necessary to an adjudication of the case, as we view it, being principally those found in the court of appeals, are as follows: Mrs. Alice S. Hill was the owner of lots 1 and 2 in block 45 of Hill's subdivision, University park, city of Washington. A diagram of these lots is herewith given:\n (See opposite page.)\n These lots fronted 150 feet (75 feet each) on Fourteenth street, and 190 feet on Welling place (now Douglas street). On January 13, 1897, Mrs. Hill conveyed these lots to Nicholas T. Haller. Haller intended to erect an apartment house, which was subsequently placed thereon, and became known as the Victoria flats. To enable him to build this structure, Haller negotiated a loan of $75,000, and, on January 22, 1897, executed a deed of trust of that date to B. H. Warner and Louis D. Wine, as trustees, hereinafter called the Warner trust, describing in the deed the north 120 feet of the two lots, and running westwardly to the depth of 124 feet, as shown on the plat. At the same time Haller executed a deed of trust to McReynolds and Meriweather, as trustees, hereinafter known as the McReynolds trust, upon the remaining portion of said lots 1 and 2, to \n\n[200 U.S. 257, 259]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsecure his notes to the amount of $12,315. There were no improvements on the lots 1 and 2 at the time of making these deeds of trust. Thereafter Haller erected the apartment house on the portions of lots 1 and 2 described in the deed of trust to Warner. In the erection of the building Haller had become indebted to mechanics and materialmen in the sum of $30, 087.65, and in the further sum of $10,350 for borrowed money. To avoid mechanics' liens on the property, and to secure the borrowed money, a second deed of trust was placed on the property by the same description contained in the Warner deed, Grayson and Heald being the trustees named therein, hereinafter \n\n[200 U.S. 257, 260]\n\u00a0\n known as the Grayson trust, and bears date December 20, 1897. These deeds of trust were duly recorded. When the Grayson trust was executed and delivered, the building had been erected by Haller, the mortgagor. The building contained, upon the south and west sides, in connection with which an easement is said to arise, a large number of doors, windows, and porches, the porches encroaching over the line of the property deeded in the McReynolds trust 4 feet and 9 inches; and it is averred in the bill, and not denied in the answers, that the areaways encroach 5 feet. There are thirty-six windows in the west wall, nineteen in the south wall, twenty-two doors in the west wall, five doors in the south wall, four cellar windows each in the west and south walls. It was stipulated in the case when it went back for final decree in the supreme court as follows:\n'The areaways on the west, and south sides mentioned by the witness, William J. McClure, consist of excavations from the surface of the ground downwards, projecting into the cement walk, and protected by wooden platforms, on grade with and forming part of the said walk, and provided with interstices or openings admitting light to the windows below.\n\n'On the south side of the building there is one doorway or entrance, and on the west side, four doorways or entrances opening out upon the said cement walk, and not otherwise accessible from the exterior of said building.\n\n'On the said west wall, projecting out upon the said cement walk, there are three garbage chutes for collection of garbage from the building, and two openings into the cellar, through which the coal supply of the building is received, the said garbage chutes and coal cellars being accessible from the exterior only by means of the said cement walk.'\n\n In both deeds of trust, in addition to the conveyance of the parcels of ground described, there is the following language:\n'Together with all and singular the improvements, ways, easements, rights, privileges, and appurtenances to the same belonging, or in any wise appertaining, and all the estate, \n\n[200 U.S. 257, 261]\n\u00a0\n right, title, interest, and claim, either at law or in equity, or otherwise, however, of the parties of the first part, of, in, to, or out of the said land and premises, to have and to hold the said land, premises, and appurtenances unto and to the only use of the parties of the second part, the survivor of them, his heirs and assigns.'\n\n A default having been made in the payment of interest due upon the notes secured by the deeds of trust, it was arranged that Warner and Wine were to collect the rents from the building, and afterwards Woods collected the rents of the building for a while. There is considerable testimony in the record tending to show an alleged combination on the part of Wood and Talbot, who had acquired the interest of Haller, to scale down the second, or Grayson and Heald, trust, and to prevent the property being sold advantageously, all of which we deem unnecessary to consider in determining the rights of the parties, and shall not undertake to state the details concerning the same. It appears that Haller originally intended to place the building so as to leave ample space on the west and south, between the building and the lines of the lot as covered by the trust deeds, but being notified that a space of 40 feet must be left on the east of the property and 20 feet on the north side, because of restrictions in the title of the property, the building was placed practically on the lines of the premises on the west and south, as described in the deeds of trust. The porches and areaways thus necessarily encroached on the adjoining property, as hereinbefore stated. In the view we take of the case, it is important to state how Wood and Talbot acquired their interest in the property. In March, 1898, Wood obtained from Haller, in exchange for an equity of Wood's in another property, an undivided one- half interest in the flats property, and Haller conveyed the premises as described in the deed of trust to Warner, together with a 10-foot strip of ground on the south and west sides of the building (see plat), the deed being made for the same by Haller to one Duke, who executed a declaration ( dated April 9, 1898) that he held the \n\n[200 U.S. 257, 262]\n\u00a0\n property in trust for Haller and Wood, one half each. About the same time an arrangement was undertaken to be made by Haller, with the knowledge of Wood, by the terms of which, upon the payment of $4,000 upon the McReynold's trust, the 10-foot strip would be released therefrom, and $4, 000 was borrowed from a bank upon the security of $4,000 of the McReynold's notes, which loan, not having been paid, the release has not been obtained. On the first of April, 1899, Talbot purchased Haller's remaining one-half interest in the Victoria flats property, and also one half interest in that covered by the McReynold's trust, and Wood purchased Haller's remaining one-half interest in the McReynold's equity. The purchase price paid by Talbot was $3,100, and by Wood, for the remaining one-half interest in the McReynold's equity, $250. Thus Wood and Talbot became the owners of the equities of redemption in both lots.\n The supreme court gave the Warner trust a lien upon the 10-foot strip as part of the mortgage premises, a second lien to the Grayson trust, and ordered the property sold as an entirety, at the option of the trustees appointed to sell.\n When the case was in the court of appeals, upon appeal from the original decree of sale, that court modified the decree below in so far as it gave the Warner trust any lien upon the 10-foot strip on the south and west sides, and ordered a decree in favor of the Grayson trust upon this strip as an easement, and that the property be sold as an entirety or in parts, according to the discretion of the trustees ordered to sell. 22 App. D. C. 432. When the case went back to the supreme court the modified decree of sale was entered, from which an appeal was taken to the court of appeals, which affirmed the decree of the supreme court (24 App. D. C. 55), and these appeals were sued out to this court.\n Messrs. B. W. Parker and R. Golden Donaldson for Warner and Wine, trustees.\n\n\n[200 U.S. 257, 264]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John Ridont and Charles F. Carusi for Wood and talbott. \n\n[200 U.S. 257, 265]\n\u00a0\n Mr. J. J. Darlington for Grayson, trustee.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Day:\n\n\n[200 U.S. 257, 267]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Day, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n These appeals raise practically three questions:\n 1st. Was the Warner trust entitled to an easement, and, if so, to what extent, in the lands on the south and west of the flats building?\n 2d. Was the Grayson trust entitled to a like easement in the same premises? and,\n 3d. Was the property properly authorized to be sold as an entirety, in the discretion of the trustees?\n As to the first proposition, the supreme court was of opinion that the Warner trust was entitled to 10 feet on the south and west sides of the property. The court of appeals was of the opinion that, as the lots were not built upon at the time when the deed of trust was executed, and it was not then known that an easement would be necessary to the enjoyment of the property as constructed, the Warner trust took only the conveyances of the land by metes and bounds, without an easement, which that court held arose from the manner in which the building and its appurtenances were subsequently constructed and used.\n The record discloses that the loan secured by the Warner trust was made for the purpose of erecting a hotel or apartment building. It is established that the first purpose of the proprietor was to construct the building so as to leave an adjacent space and way for its accommodation and use, between \n\n[200 U.S. 257, 268]\n\u00a0\n its outer walls and the lot lands adjacent on the west and south. This purpose was changed upon notification that restrictions in the title of the property required the building to be set back from the streets. The building was thereupon constructed by the mortgagor in the manner shown. The deed of trust was a mortgage security, and Haller continued to be the owner of the property to the full extent of the lots. The building was constructed in such wise that the use of some of the adjacent property, even independent of an easement for light and air, was absolutely necessary to the use and enjoyment of the building as constructed. It did not need the expert testimony which was introduced in the case to establish the fact that if another structure should be erected, practically even with the wall of the building, it would prevent access to, and greatly impair the use of, the south and west sides thereof. It would require the closing of the areaways, the shutting of the windows and doors, and must necessarily greatly depreciate the value of the property. The Warner trust contained the language (above quoted), conveying the described premises, with all and singular the improvements, ways, easements, rights, privileges, and appurtenances to the same belonging or in anywise appertaining, etc., to have and to hold, to the second party, their heirs and assigns. It is true that there was no building upon the property at the time when this deed of trust was executed, but it is equally true that it was within the knowledge and purpose of the parties that a building should be constructed, which would be the principal security for the money loaned. And no one disputes that, when Haller constructed the building upon the property, it became immediately subject to the mortgage. He was the owner of the adjacent premises, and when he abandoned the design to leave sufficient space about the building for its proper use and enjoyment, and erected it in such manner, and so close to and overlapping upon other parts of his own property, as to require the use of an easement therein in order to occupy the building, and permit the enjoyment and use of it as constructed, we \n\n[200 U.S. 257, 269]\n\u00a0\n see no reason why the express language of the conveyance above quoted would not carry with the building thus constructed the improvements, ways, appurtenances, rights, and privileges necessary to the enjoyment of the same. The principle upon which subsequent buildings and fixtures annexed to the realty become a part thereof for the benefit of the mortgagee is thus stated in Butler v. Page, 7 Met. 40, 39 Am. Dec. 757:\n'All buildings erected and fixtures placed on mortgaged premises, by the mortgagor, must be regarded as permanently annexed to the freehold. They go to enhance the value of the estate, and will therefor inure to the benefit of the mortgagee, so far as they increase his security for his debt; and to the same extent they enhance the value of the equity of redemption, and thereby inure to the benefit of the mortgagor. Winslow v. Merchants Inc. Co. 4 Met. 306, 38 Am. Dec. 368. There is no necessity to adopt any liberal rule in regard to fixtures, to enable a mortgagor to remove what he has erected at his own expense; because he had the full benefit of all such improvements when he regains the estate by redemption, which he may do, simply by payment of his actual debt. The general rule of the common law, therefore, that what is fixed to the freehold becomes part of the realty, and passes with it, has its full effect in regard to things erected on the land by an owner who subsequently mortgages the land, and also in regard to things erected by the mortgagor after the mortgage.'\n\n To the same effect is Graeme v. Cullen, 23 Gratt. 266. Had Haller not owned the surrounding premises, but acquired the adjacent 10-foot strip with a view of remedying the fault which he had committed in putting the building flush upon the line, and constructed his building so as to make the easement necessary to its use, we think there could be no question that the easement thus acquired would inure to the benefit of the mortgagee. Such is the principle stated in Hankey v. Clark, 110 Mass. 262. In that case, tenants in common owned two adjoining tracts of land on a river, the lower one \n\n[200 U.S. 257, 270]\n\u00a0\n subject to a mortgage. They sold the upper tract, reserving to themselves, their heirs and assigns, the right to draw water from a reservoir on the upper for the use of the lower (mortgaged) tract. The equity of redemption of one of them in the lower tract was sold and vested in A, who also acquired title in that tract through mesne conveyances under a foreclosure of the mortgages. The court held that A was vested with the title to draw water from the reservoir under the reservation. The court said: 'Incorporeal rights of this description, acquired by the mortgagor subsequent to the date of the mortgage, for the permanent improvement of the estate, and annexed by the terms of the conveyance to the realty, may be considered as passing to the mortgagee by the foreclosure, to be exercised by him at his election. There is no reason why incorporeal rights annexed to the realty should not inure to the benefit of the mortgage security in the same manner as improvements in the nature of fixtures inure. Winslow v. merchants Ins. Co. 4 Met. 306, 310, 38 Am. Dec. 368. Until foreclosure the mortgage is deemed a lien or charge, subject to which the estate may be conveyed, improved, and in other respects dealt with as the estate of the mortgagor.' We cannot see that it makes any difference in principle that the easement in the present case is annexed by the mortgagor by necessity, as the result of the manner in which he has improved the property. It is not contended that, as against the McReynolds trust, created at the same time with the Warner trust, and before the erection of the building, an easement was acquired in this strip, but we are now dealing with rights in the property as between Haller and the mortgagee; and we think the granting clause quoted above included not only the improvements, ways, and easements upon the property at the time, but such as became necessarily appurtenant thereto upon the adjacent property of the grantor, because of the structure which he has placed upon the premises, to the enjoyment of which these privileges and rights are essential. As to the extent of this easement, the conduct of the parties in undertaking to acquire 10 feet, for the obvious purpose of \n\n[200 U.S. 257, 271]\n\u00a0\n this easement, the overhanging porches, the encroaching areas, seem to us to make 10 feet a reasonable width, and no more than is properly necessary. The unloading of coal, the carrying away of garbage, and other necessary usages, could hardly be accomplished in a narrower space. In this view of the case we find it unnecessary to treat this as an easement exclusively for light and air, or to enter upon a discussion of the doctrine of easements by implication. Nor is it an answer to the effect of this annexation to the property of the easement and rights resulting from the manner of improving the premises conveyed to say that Haller, as the owner, could not create an easement for himself in his own land. The question here is, What is the effect of his conveyance, and what has he added to the realty in favor of his grantee in the mortgage? We think he annexed not only the building, but the rights and privileges in his adjacent land, essential to its enjoyment.\n\n 2. \nAs to the Grayson trust. In addition to the discussion already had as to the right of the Warner trust to have an easement in this strip, it is admitted that when the Grayson trust was executed the building was up, the easement was in actual use and, it is apparent, had become necessary to the building as constructed. The purpose of Haller to use this part of the property for the purposes stated is manifested in what he had done, and the subsequent purchasers of the equity took with full notice, not only of the language of the recorded deed of trust, but had actual notice of the condition of the property. We think this feature of the case comes clearly within the doctrine ruled in Shepherd v. Pepper, \n133 \nU.S. 626, 650\n, 33 S. L. ed. 706, 715, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 438. It is important to note in this connection that counsel for the Grayson trust do not dispute the right of the Warner trust to have a lien upon the easement in the 10-foot strip, and states that he does not desire to be heard upon that subject. The persons contesting that right (and as well the right of Grayson) in this court are Wood and Talbot, the successors of Haller, and, upon the facts shown, standing in his shoes, and with full notice of the necessity of this right of way or easement to the use of the \n\n[200 U.S. 257, 272]\n\u00a0\n property, and Haller's attempt to obtain it by release from the MeReynolds and Merriweather trust. It was subsequently specifically covered in the conveyance in trust for Haller and Wood to Duke, and it is admitted in the answer of Wood and Talbot that it was the original intent to so place the building as to give room about it; the rights of Wood and Talbot are no higher or better as against either Warner or Grayson than Haller's from the facts presented in this case.\n Third. Was the decree right in ordering the sale of the property in its entirety, in the discretion of the trustees? Sales are thus ordered in entirety when the interests of the mortgagors and encumbrancers require it. Shepherd v. Pepper, \n133 \nU.S. 626, 651\n, 33 S. L. ed. 706, 715, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 438, and the authorities there cited. In this case, counsel for the Grayson trust states in his brief that he does not insist upon such sale as an entirety, and, in the draft of a decree, as submitted by him, no such sale is provided for. In the view we have taken of this case, we cannot see that the first encumbrance, the Warner trust, requires such a sale to protect that interest. There is no dispute as to the lien of the McReynolds trust upon the property described in their deed; as against it no easement is claimed. We see no reason why, with adequate protection for the McReynolds trust, in a sum to be found sufficient in the court executing the decree, to be retained out of the purchase money of the flats property with an easement in the 10-foot strip, the flats may not be sold with the 10-foot strip as one piece, and the remainder of the property as another. Such a form of decree is suggested in the brief of a counsel for the Grayson trust, and no encumbrancer seems to object to it, and the holders of the equity of redemption insist upon a separate sale. We think it would be the fairer way to all concerned to order the sale of the property as herein indicated.\n We therefore, upon the whole case, modify the decree of the court of appeals in respect to the Warner trust and the 10-foot strip, and as to the sale of the property as an entirety, as \n\n[200 U.S. 257, 273]\n\u00a0\n hereinbefore stated. In other respects the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.\n This disposes of the appeals in Nos. 89 and 90, which were taken from the last and final decree in the court of appeals. The appeal in No. 439 was taken from the decree of the court of appeals remanding the case to the supreme court, which was not final, and it is therefore dismissed. The other appeals raise all the questions made in the case. \n\n\n\n","182":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWECKER v.

S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 549), upon a question of jurisdiction. \n\n[204 U.S. 176, 178]\n\u00a0\n Conrad Wecker, the plaintiff below, brought his action in the circuit court of the city of St. Louis, state of Missouri, against the National Enameling & Stamping Company, Harry Schenck, and George Wettengel, undertaking to recover jointly against the National Enameling & Stamping Company, a corporation of the state of New Jersey, and Schenck and Wettengel, residents of the city of St. Louis, state of Missouri. The substance of the complaint is that defendant is a corporation employing the plaintiff in the work of firing, filling, stirring, emptying, and attending certain metal pots used in the melting of grease and lubricant matter in the plant of the defendant corporation; that the grease and lubricant matter was delivered by the corporation to the plaintiff in barrels of great weight,-about 600 pounds each,-and it was the plaintiff's duty in the course of his employment to hoist the same to the top surface of the furnace structure, into which the pots were set, and then to dump the grease and lubricant matter into the pots.\n The negligence charged against the defendant corporation consisted in allowing the pots, which were constantly filled with hot and boiling lubricants, to remain open and exposed, without covering, railing, device, or means of any character to protect the plaintiff from accidentally slipping or falling into the same while engaged in the service of the corporation in the performance of his duties, and negligently failing to provide and properly place safe and sufficient hoisting apparatus for the use of the plaintiff in his employment in lifting said massed of grease and lubricant to the top of the furnace, and for failing to give the plaintiff instructions as to the proper manner of performing his duty, and thereby unreasonably endangering his safety in said employment. Plaintiff alleges that, by reason of this negligence, while engaged in the performance of his duties on the 12th of November, 1902, on the top of the furnace, he lost his balance and fell into one of the open, unguarded, and unprotected pots containing hot and boiling grease and lubricant, receiving thereby great and painful in- \n\n[204 U.S. 176, 179]\n\u00a0\n juries. Plaintiff below further charged that Schenck and Wettengel were employed by the corporation and charged by it with the superintendence and oversight of the plaintiff in the performance of his duty, and were employed and charged by the corporation with the duty of superintending and properly planning the construction of a furnace, and with the duty of providing for said pots reasonably safe and suitable covering, railing, or other device, and with the duty of providing and properly placing reasonably safe and sufficient hoisting apparatus for lifting the masses of grease and lubricant to the top of the furnace, and were further charged by the corporation with the duty of instructing the plaintiff as to the manner of performing his duties, and charges negligence of Schenck and Wettengel in planning and directing the construction of the furnace structure and providing suitable covers or railings as aforesaid, and providing and placing reasonably safe and sufficient hoisting apparatus, and in giving instructions as to the manner of performing plaintiff's duties, by reason whereof the plaintiff lost his balance and fell into one of the pots as aforesaid, to his great injury; and the complaint charges the joint negligence of the corporation and the defendants Schenck and Wettengel, and avers that his injuries were the result thereof, and prays judgment for damages jointly against the three defendants.\n The defendant company filed its petition for a removal of the cause to the circuit court of the United States for the eastern district of Missouri, which petition contained the usual averments as to the character of the suit and the right of removal and diversity of citizenship between the defendant corporation and the plaintiff, and averred that Schenck, one of the codefendants, was also a nonresident of the state of Missouri and a citizen of the state of Illinois, and not served with process; also stated that Wettengel was, at the time of the commencement of the suit and since, a citizen of the state of Missouri; averred a separable controversy between it and the plaintiff as to the alleged negligence and as to the assump- \n\n[204 U.S. 176, 180]\n\u00a0\n tion of the risk upon the part of the plaintiff. As to Wettengel, the citizen of Missouri, it was alleged in the removal petition that he was not, at the time of the accident or prior thereto, charged with the superintendence and oversight of the plaintiff, or with the duty of superintending and properly planning the construction of the furnace, or providing a reasonably safe and suitable furnace and pots and railings or other device to protect the plaintiff, and was not charged with the duty of placing reasonably safe and sufficient hoisting apparatus, nor with the duty of instructing the petitioner in respect to his duties, as charged in the complaint, and, after stating that Schenck, like the defendant corporation, was a nonresident of Missouri and a citizen of another state, charged that Wettengel had been improperly and fraudulently joined as a defendant for the purpose of fraudulently and improperly preventing, or attempting to prevent, the defendant from removing the cause to the United States circuit court, and that the plaintiff well knew, at the time of the beginning of the suit, that Wettengel was not charged with the duties aforesaid, and that he was joined as a party defendant to prevent the removal of the cause, and not in good faith.\n After removal, plaintiff filed his motion to remand the case to the state court, on the ground that there was not in the case a controversy between citizens of different states, and no separable controversy between the plaintiff and the company within the meaning of the removal act. The court, upon hearing the motion, refused to remand the cause, and afterward, plaintiff electing to stand upon his motion to remand, and refusing to recognize the jurisdiction of the United States court or to proceed with the prosecution of his case therein, upon motion of the defendant the court ordered the case to be dismissed, and rendered judgment that the plaintiff take nothing by the suit, and that the defendants go hence without day and recover their costs against the plaintiff. A bill of exceptions was allowed, and the court also certified that the only question decided by the court in the cause was that the join- \n\n[204 U.S. 176, 181]\n\u00a0\n ing of Wettengel as a codefendant with the company was palpably groundless and fictitious, and for the purpose of unlawfully depriving the defendant company of its right to remove the cause to the Federal court for trial; that for this reason the motion to remand was denied; that in deciding the motion the court took into consideration not only the complaint and petition for removal, but also the affidavits filed in support and opposition to the motion to remand; that the plaintiff refused to submit to the jurisdiction of the court and suffered a dismissal of the suit for the want of prosecution; that the question is whether the court had jurisdiction of the action.\n In the first ruling upon the motion to remand, the court, in a written opinion, based its refusal upon the ground that the petition of plaintiff clearly showed that there was no joint cause of action against the company and the defendant Wettengel. Subsequently, the judge filed an opinion in which he said that in his former opinion he made no allusion to the affidavits tending to show the fictitious and fraudulent joining of Wettengel, and that, in his opinion, the same inevitably showed that the inferences drawn from the allegations of the petition were correct, and that he might properly consider these affidavits in determining the question of removal.\n It is urged by counsel for defendants in error that the writ of error should be dismissed because there was no final judgment, and only in a case where a final judgment has been rendered can the question of jurisdiction be certified from a circuit court under  5 of the court of appeals act. McLish v. Roff, \n141 U.S. 661\n, 35 L. ed. 893, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 118, is relied upon, in which it was held that a writ of error could only be taken out after final judgment.\n It is true that, after the circuit court of the United States maintained its jurisdiction, the plaintiff could have gone on and tried the case on its merits, and, after judgment, had there been reason for doing so, taken the case to the circuit court of appeals; but, upon refusing to recognize the jurisdiction of \n\n[204 U.S. 176, 182]\n\u00a0\n the circuit court, final judgment in the action was rendered, that the plaintiff take nothing by the suit and that the defendants go hence without day, and recover their costs against the plaintiff. Whether this judgment would be a bar to another action is not now before us; it is final, so far as the case is concerned, and terminated the action.\n Section 5 of the court of appeals act provides that only the question of jurisdiction shall be brought to this court from the circuit court, and that is all that is now before us.\n It is contended that this case should have been remanded upon the authority of Alabama Great Southern R. Co. v. Thompson, \n200 U.S. 206\n, 50 L. ed. 441, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 161, decided at the last term of this court. In that case it was held that, upon a question of removal, where a plaintiff, in good faith, prosecuted his suit as upon a joint cause of action, and the removal was sought when the complaint was the only pleading in the case, the action as therein stated was the test of removability; and if that was joint in character, and there was no showing of a want of good faith of the plaintiff, no separable controversy was presented with a nonresident defendant, joined with a citizen of the state; in other words, if the plaintiff had, in good faith, elected to make a joint cause of action, the question of proper joinder is not to be tried in the removal proceedings, and that, however that might turn out upon the merits, for the purpose of removal the case must be held to be that which the plaintiff has stated in setting forth his cause of action. And in that case it was said:\n'The fact that by answer the defendant may show that the liability is several cannot change the character of the case made by the plaintiff in his pleading so as to affect the right of removal. It is to be remembered that we are not now dealing with joinders which are shown, by the petition for removal or otherwise, to be attempts to sue in the state courts with a view to defeat Federal jurisdiction. In such cases entirely different questions arise, and the Federal courts may, and should, take such action as will defeat attempts to wrong- \n\n[204 U.S. 176, 183]\n\u00a0\n fully deprive parties entitled to sue in the Federal courts of the protection of their rights in those tribunals.'\n\n And it was further stated in the court's opinion that there was nothing in that case to suggest an attempt to commit a fraud upon the jurisdiction of the Federal court.\n Much discussion is had in this case as to whether the alleged cause of action is joint or several in its character, and whether the corporation and Wettengel could be jointly held responsible to the plaintiff upon the allegations of the complaint, but we do not deem it necessary to determine that question.\n Upon the authority of the Alabama Great Southern case, supra, and the preceding cases in this court which are cited and applied in the opinion in that case, if the complaint is filed in good faith, the cause of action, for the purposes of removal, may be deemed to be that which the plaintiff has undertaken to make it; but in this case both parties filed affidavits upon the motion to remand, for and against the right to remove.\n The petition for removal was sworn to by an agent of the company, and defendant corporation filed the affidavit of one George Eisenmayer, who testified that he was the chief engineer of the company, charged with the planning of new apparatus and the construction and repair thereof for the company, and that Wettengel was employed in the office as a draftsman, with several other persons in a similar capacity; that the sole work of Wettengel was as such draftsman, and that he had nothing to do with selecting plans or approving the same, but took the plans and ideas furnished him and made the necessary drawings for the use of mechanics, and that he had no authority to employ or discharge men or superintend work or give instructions to any of the men as to how they should perform their work. Wettengel's affidavit was also filed, in which he stated that for ten years he had been employed as a draftsman by the defendant company; that his work was performed in the office of the company; that he had no duties outside of the office or with the plaintiff; that he had \n\n[204 U.S. 176, 184]\n\u00a0\n no duty of superintendence in connection with him; that he was not charged with any duty of planning or constructing the apparatus which was used in the defendant's plant; that the designing and selection thereof was made by other persons, and that his sole duty was to attend to the mechanical work of drafting, based upon the ideas and plans of others; that he had no discretion whatever as to the sort of appartus to be used in any part of defendant's plant, nor as to the structures mentioned in plaintiff's petition; that he had nothing to do with the planning of the pots, no right to determine what they should be, or whether a railing should be used, nor what sort of hoisting apparatus should be used in connection therewith; that he had no duty in connection with the plaintiff as to how or when he should do his work, and no authority to give him instructions; in short, that his position was merely clerical and his duties confined to the making of drawings to enable mechanics to construct work from plans furnished by others in the employ of the defendant, and that he did not know the plaintiff by name, and did not know what sort of work he was doing or in what portion of defendant's plant he was engaged.\n To these affidavits Wecker, the plaintiff, filed a counter affidavit, admitting that Eisenmayer was charged with the general supervision of the work and business of the company at the place plaintiff was employed and received his injury, and stating that just prior to the construction of the furnace structure he heard Eisenmayer direct Wettengel to prepare plans for a furnace to be erected where the one was built shortly after, upon which the plaintiff was at work when he received his injuries, and states his belief that the defendant Wettengel planned and directed the construction of the furnace.\n Upon these affidavits the court reached the conclusion that, considered with the complaint, they showed conclusively an attempt to defeat the jurisdiction of the Federal court by wrongfully joining Wettengel.\n The consideration of these affidavits clearly shows that Wettengel's employment was not that of a superior or superin- \n\n[204 U.S. 176, 185]\n\u00a0\n tendent, or one charged with furnishing designs, for it is not contradicted that he was employed as a draftsman, receiving his instructions from others; nor is there the slightest attempt to sustain the allegations of the petition that Wettengel was a superintendent over the plaintiff, or had any authority to direct his work or to give him instructions as to the manner in which his duty should be performed. The testimony certainly shows no basis for these charges. The affidavit of Wecker, except as to the statement of his belief, admits that Eisenmayer was superintendent, and claims that he heard him direct Wettengel to prepare plans for a furnace structure. This is not inconsistent with the undisputed testimony as to the nature and character of Wettengel's employment in the subordinate capacity of a draftsman.\n In view of this testimony and the apparent want of basis for the allegations of the petition as to Wettengel's relations to the plaintiff, and the uncontradicted evidence as to his real connection with the company, we think the court was right in reaching the conclusion that he was joined for the purpose of defeating the right of the corporation to remove the case to the Federal court.\n It is objected that there was no proof that Wecker knew of Wettengel's true relation to the defendant, and consequently he could not be guilty of fraud in joining him; but even in cases where the direct issue of fraud is involved, knowledge may be imputed where one wilfully closes his eyes to information within his reach.\n It is further objected that the court should not have heard the matter upon affidavits, and should have required testimony, with the privilege to cross-examine; but the plaintiff made no objection to the consideration of affidavits in support of the petition for the removal, and himself filed a counter affidavit. In this state of the record there certainly can be no valid objection to the manner in which the court heard and considered the testimony.\n While the plaintiff, in good faith, may proceed in the state \n\n[204 U.S. 176, 186]\n\u00a0\n courts upon a cause of action which he alleges to be joint, it is equally true that the Federal courts should not sanction devices intended to prevent a removal to a Federal court where one has that right, and should be equally vigilant to protect the right to proceed in the Federal court as to permit the state courts, in proper cases, to retain their own jurisdiction.\n Reaching the conclusion that the court did not err in holding upon the testimony in this case that the real purpose in joining Wettengel was to prevent the exercise of the right of removal by the nonresident defendant, we affirm the action of the Circuit Court in refusing to remand the case.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","183":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWEST CHICAGO ST R.

Upon appeal to the supreme court of Illinois a judgment was rendered in favor of the city.\n The contention of the company is that the judgment under review cannot be sustained consistently either with the contract clause of the Constitution of the United States or with the due process of law enjoined by the 14th Amendment.\n The case presented by the record is substantially as will be now stated.\n On or about April 2d, 1888, the city council of Chicago adopted in due form the following ordinance:\n'Whereas, the board of directors of the West Chicago Street Railroad Company, on the second day of April, 1888, by and at the request of the mayor of the city of Chicago, adopted the following resolution: Resolved, That the West Chicago Street Railroad Company, in consideration of the passage and approval by the mayor of the three ordinances passed by the city council of Chicago on the 30th day of March, 1888,-one granting to the West Division Railway Company the right to change its motive power from horse to cable or electric power; one granting to the Chicago Passenger Railway Company the right to make the same change; and one granting to the West Chicago Street Railroad Company the right to construct its tracks on Jefferson street, between Madison and Washington streets, and to use horse, cable, or electric power thereon,-hereby agrees, by and with the city of Chicago, at its own expense to construct a tunnel under the Chicago river, and acquire the necessary right of way therefor on a route to be located by said company between Madison and Twelfth streets, with the east terminus at Fifth avenue or west thereof, and \n\n[201 U.S. 506, 515]\n\u00a0\n the western terminus at Halsted street or east thereof; provided, however, that this company shall have the right from said city to construct said tunnel under any intervening street or streets and said river within said limits, but such location and construction shall be such as not to interfere with the capacity, usefulness, or grade of said streets; said tunnel to be used by this company for street railroad tracks, and the construction thereof shall be commenced within three years, and be completed within four years, after the said city council shall grant permission to said railroad company to make said improvements, unless prevented by injunctions or strikes, and the time said construction is so interfered with shall be added to said four years, all work to be done in a manner satisfactory to the commissioner of public works, and the tracks through the tunnel shall be connected with the street railroad tracks controlled by this company. Now, therefore, be it ordained by the city council: That the agreement in said resolution contained be and the same is hereby accepted by and on behalf of the city of Chicago as a consideration from said company for the passage and approval by the mayor of the ordinances in said resolution specified, and authority is hereby granted said company to make the improvements therein mentioned.'\n\n When this ordinance was passed there was in force what is known as the horse and dummy act, passed in 1874, which provided: 'That any company which has been or shall be incorporated under the general laws of this state, for the purpose of constructing, maintaining, or operating any horse or dummy railroad or tramway, may enter upon and appropriate any property necessary for the construction, maintenance, and operation of its road, and all necessary siding, side tracks, and appurtenances, and may, subject to the provisions contained in this act, locate and construct its road upon or over any street, alley, road, or highway, or across or over any waters in this state, in such manner as not to unnecessarily obstruct the public use of such street, alley, road, or highway, or interrupt the navigation of such waters.' \n\n[201 U.S. 506, 516]\n\u00a0\n In 214 Ill. 9, 19, 73 N. E. 393, 396, the supreme court of Illinois, referring to this act, said: 'This act was an addition to the charter of any company organized under the general incorporation act, and its provisions have existed under some form ever since, conferring powers upon street railroad companies organized as the defendant is. It gave the defendant the right to construct its railroad either over or across the Chicago river, which included the tunnel, subject to the condition contained in it. Defendant could only hold real estate for the transaction of its business of maintaining and operating a street railroad, and the statute fixed the conditions under which it might use its real estate for building the tunnel.'\n The tunnel was completed by the railroad company in March, 1894, and has ever since been used and is now being used as a passageway under the river for its cars. When constructed (as well as at the present time) the water in the south branch of the Chicago river over the tunnel, near Van Buren street, varied in depth from 17 to 18 3-10 feet.\n On the 3d day of March, 1899, Congress passed a river and harbor act, among the provisions of which was one directing the Secretary of War to cause surveys to be made and the cost of improving certain rivers and harbors to be estimated and reported to Congress, as follows: 'Improving Chicago river in Illinois: Survey and estimate of cost for a channel twenty-one feet deep from its mouth to the stock yards, on the south branch, and to Belmont avenue, on the north branch, so far as may be permitted by existing docks and wharves, exclusive of cost of removing or constructing bridges or piers or lowering tunnels; and the aforesaid depth of twenty-one feet is hereby adopted as the project depth for the improvement in lieu of that fixed by the act of June third, eighteen hundred and ninety-six [29 Stat. at L. 202, chap. 314]; Provided, That all the work of removing and reconstructing bridges and piers and lowering tunnels necessary to permit a practicable channel with said depth to \n\n[201 U.S. 506, 517]\n\u00a0\n be obtained shall be done, or caused to be done, by the city of Chicago, without expense to the United States.' 30 Stat. at L. 1156, chap. 425.\n After the passage of that act steps were taken to dredge the Chicago river so as to deepen its channel in accordance with the provisions of the act of Congress, and, it is alleged, such work 'has been proceeding under the authority and supervision of the government of the United States, for the purpose of providing a sufficiently deep channel for the uses and purposes of commerce and navigation as aforesaid.'\n For the purpose of obeying the act of Congress, and in order to obtain a free and unobstructed navigation of the Chicago river for the benefit of commerce, interstate and domestic, the city council of Chicago, on the 19th day of March, 1900, duly passed the following ordinance: ' Whereas, by act of Congress of March, 3d, 1899, it is provided that in the survey and estimate of cost for a channel 21 feet deep, in the improvement of the Chicago river from its mouth to the stock yards on the south branch, and to Belmont avenue on the north branch, the aforesaid depth of 21 feet is adopted as the project depth for such improvement; whereas, it is in said act further provided that all the work of removing and reconstructing bridges and piers and lowering tunnels necessary to permit a practicable channel with said depth to be obtained shall be done or caused to be done by the city of Chicago, without expense to the United States; whereas, the tunnel under the south branch of the Chicago river at Van Buren street was constructed by the West Chicago Street Railroad Company under a certain ordinance of the city of Chicago, passed April 2d, 1888; whereas, a channel in the Chicago river of the depth of at least 21 feet, is now made necessary by the requirements of navigation and by the increase in the draft of vessels engaged in the shipping trade of the Lakes; whereas, the said tunnel is an obstruction to said proposed improvement to the Chicago river and to the navigation thereof, and, as such obstruction, must be lowered so that there may be above it in \n\n[201 U.S. 506, 518]\n\u00a0\n said river a depth of at least 21 feet of water, or be removed altogether: Now, therefore, be it ordained by the city council of the city of Chicago: That the West Chicago Street Railroad Company be and it is hereby ordered and directed within three months after the date of the passage of this ordinance, at the sole cost and expense of said West Chicago Street Railroad Company, and without cost, damage, loss, or expense of any kind whatsoever to the city of Chicago, to proceed to lower the tunnel under the south branch of the Chicago river at or near Van Buren street, being the same tunnel heretofore constructed by the said West Chicago Street Railroad Company under an agreement dated April 2, 1888, between the said West Chicago Street Railroad Company and the city of Chicago, and an ordinance passed by the city council of the city of Chicago, April 2, 1888, authorizing the construction of said tunnel in accordance with the provisions of said agreement, so as to provide for a clear depth above said tunnel of at least 21 feet of water at all times. Said work shall be performed by the said West Chicago Street Railroad Company under the supervision and direction, and subject to the approval, of the commissioner of public works of the city of Chicago, and shall be completed on or before March 1, 1901.'\n In execution of the provisions of that ordinance the city caused notice to be given to the railroad company, demanding compliance with its provisions. The company did not heed that notice.\n The present action was thereupon instituted by the people of Illinois, on the relation of the city of Chicago, against the railroad company. The specific relief asked was the issuing of a writ of mandamus directing the railroad company, without cost, damage, loss, or expense of any kind whatsoever to the city, to proceed to lower its tunnel under the south branch of the Chicago river at or near Van Buren street, so as to provide for a clear depth above it of at least 21 feet of water at all times, for its entire width and length, or to wholly remove it, 'so that the same shall cease to be an obstruction to the free \n\n[201 U.S. 506, 519]\n\u00a0\n navigation of said Chicago river or the south branch thereof, and to perform said work under the supervision and direction of the commissioner of public works of the city of Chicago.'\n The circuit court found the issues for the defendant, and denied the application for a mandamus. Upon error to the appellate court, first district, the judgment of the circuit court was reversed and the cause remanded with directions 'to issue a writ of mandamus commanding the railroad company to remove its tunnel, said writ not to be executed until the Washington street and La Salle street tunnels are both removed or lowered to a sufficient depth to be no longer an obstruction to navigation.'\n Upon appeal to the supreme court of Illinois a final judgment was there entered awarding a peremptory writ of mandamus as prayed for in the petition. 214 Ill. 9, 73 N. E. 393.\n As explanatory of the reference to the tunnels on Washington and La Salle streets it may be here stated that those tunnels belonged to the city, and were located between the tunnel at Van Buren street, owned by the railroad company, and the mouth of the river at the lake. Of course, until the city's tunnels are lowered or removed, the lowering or removal of the tunnel on Van Buren street would not be of material aid to navigation.\n We come now to consider the questions arising on the record and discussed at the bar.\n\n 1. \nThe contention of the city that the writ of error should be dismissed for want of jurisdiction in this court cannot be sustained. It is true that the judgment of the state court rests partly upon grounds of local or general law. But, by its necessary operation,-although the opinion of the state court does not expressly refer to the Constitution of the United States,-the judgment rejects the claim of the company, specially set up in its answer, that the relief asked by the city cannot, in any view of the case, be granted consistently either with the contract clause of the Constitution or with the clause prohibiting \n\n[201 U.S. 506, 520]\n\u00a0\n the state from depriving anyone of his property without due process of law. If that position be well taken, then a judgment based merely upon grounds of local or general law would be error; for the Federal questions raised cover the whole case, and are of such a nature that the rights of the parties could not be finally determined without deciding them. As the judgment, by its necessary operation, denied the company's claims based on the Constitution of the United States, this court has jurisdiction to inquire whether those claims are sustained by that instrument. Our views on this question are fully stated in Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. People ( recently decided) \n200 U.S. 561\n, 50 L. ed.--, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 341.\n\n 2. \nGreat stress is placed by the railroad company on the fact that it is the owner in fee of the bed of the river at the point where the tunnel was constructed. But that fact is not vital in the present discussion; for it was adjudged by the state court-in harmony with settled doctrines, as will presently appear-that 'the title to land under a navigable river is not the same as the title to the shore land:' that 'in a navigable stream the public right is paramount, and the owner of the soil under the bed of such a stream can only use and enjoy it in so far as is consistent with the public right, which must be free and unobstructed;' that 'the title to the upland is absolute and paramount, while the title to the lands over which the navigable water flows is subordinate to the public right of navigation;' and that 'the city could not, if it would, grant the right to obstruct the navigation of the river, or bind itself to permit anything which has become an obstruction to be continued.' 214 Ill. 9, 20, 21, 73 N. E. 393, 397.\n\n 3. \nWe next consider the first of the strictly Federal questions raised by the company. Its contention is that the tunnel was constructed under a valid contract with the city, evidenced by the ordinance of 1888, and that the mere order to remove or lower the tunnel impaired the obligation of that contract, in violation of the Constitution.\n Upon a careful scrutiny of the ordinance of 1888, we find no \n\n[201 U.S. 506, 521]\n\u00a0\n clause or provision which so restricted the power of the city that it could not require the railroad company to lower or remove the tunnel when the public interests, as involved in the unobstructed navigation of Chicago river, demanded that to be done. The railroad company, in consideration of certain rights and privileges granted to it by the city, undertook to construct the tunnel; and it is true that when constructed the tunnel did not interfere with navigation; nor would it now obstruct navigation, if only boats and vessels of the size and capacity in use when the tunnel was constructed were engaged in commerce on the river. But such boats and vessels are insufficient to meet the present needs of commerce at Chicago. The business of that city has enormously increased since the passage of the ordinance of 1888, and, admittedly, the tunnel is now an obstruction to free navigation on the river by boats and vessels of large size. The railroad company may have believed, when the ordinance of 1888 was passed, that the tunnel would never interrupt or obstruct navigation. Nevertheless, the ordinance did not expressly or by necessary implication bind the city to forbear the exercise of any power it had to deepen the channel of the river and thereby improve navigation. As the city could not legally adopt an ordinance inconsistent with a statute of the state, we must read into the ordinance of 1888 that part of the act of 1874 which, as construed by the supreme court of Illinois, made it a condition of the right of a street railroad company to cross its cars through a tunnel under Chicago river that its road and tunnel should be so located and constructed as not unnecessarily to interrupt navigation. Apart from any question as to the power of the city to bargain away or surrender its authority to improve navigation and protect it against obstruction, the railroad company must be held to have accepted the ordinance and constructed the tunnel subject to the requirement that navigation should not be interrupted by it. As the present tunnel is an obstruction to the use of the river by many boats and vessels employed in commerce on the Lakes, and as, by the ordinance \n\n[201 U.S. 506, 522]\n\u00a0\n in question, the city did not stipulate-even if it could lawfully have stipulated-that it would not exert whatever powers it had in order to protect the free navigation of Chicago river whenever it became necessary or proper to do so, the result must be that the execution of the order to lower or remove the tunnel would not impair the obligation of any contract protected by the Constitution of the United States. If, in the ordinance of 1888, the city had stipulated that it would meet the expense of any alteration of the tunnel made by its direction, a different question would have been presented. But the ordinance cannot be construed as containing such a stipulation, and consistently with the settled doctrines of this court no such stipulation can arise from mere implication. There is, in our judgment, no ground whatever for holding that the city, by the ordinance of 1888, came under the obligation of a contract to meet the cost of any changes in the tunnel that might be lawfully required in order that the river could be safely navigated by large vessels.\n\n 4. \nThis brings us to the principal question in the case: Whether, consistently with the Constitution of the United States, the railroad company can be required to lower or remove the tunnel in question and (if it continues to use a tunnel in crossing Chicago river with its cars) to construct and maintain, at its own expense, such a tunnel as will conform to the provisions of the ordinance of March 19th, 1900\n\n\n It is indisputable, on this record, that the depth of water over the present tunnel is not sufficient to accommodate many boats and vessels now commonly employed in commerce between Chicago and other cities and towns on the Lakes. It is to be taken also as indisputable that, in order that such boats and vessels may navigate the south branch of Chicago river with safety the depth of water over the Van Buren street tunnel must be at least as great as that specified in the city ordinance of 1900. We assume also-as by the record we may properly do-that the ordinance is a reasonable, not an arbitrary, exertion of the power conferred on the city 'to construct and keep \n\n[201 U.S. 506, 523]\n\u00a0\n in repair bridges, viaducts, and tunnels, and to regulate the use thereof,' and 'to deepen, widen, dock, cover, wall, alter, and change the channel of the water courses.' We must, in addition, upon this record, assume that the means adopted by the city have a direct, real, and substantial connection with the public object intended to be accomplished, namely, to free the navigation of the south branch of Chicago river from an obstruction which prevents the use of that river by vessels of the size demanded by the vast business transacted at Chicago.\n As already observed, the contention of the company is, in effect, that even if the present tunnel be an obstruction to the navigation of the river by large vessels, the lowering or removal of the tunnel, against the company's will, would be a taking of private property for public use without compensation, in violation of the constitutional guaranty of due process of law.\n This result, it is supposed by the railroad company, necessarily follows from the fact that the present tunnel was constructed with the assent of the city, and when constructed was sufficient for purposes of navigation by vessels, of whatever size, then engaged in commerce on the Chicago river. But these facts are not all that must be considered in this discussion. They cannot be considered apart from other matters of a vital character, namely: That the city was under the duty of protecting the free navigation of the river and its branches,-a duty from the discharge of which it could not be exempted by any agreement it might make with the railroad company; that the city granted the right to construct the present tunnel under the river subject to the condition, necessarily implied by the statute of 1874, in force when the ordinance of 1888 was adopted, that the tunnel should not interrupt navigation; that if the assent of the company to such a condition was important, it must be held to have given such assent by accepting the ordinance of 1888, into which, as already indicated, must be read the requirement in the statute of 1874 that navigation should not be unnecessarily interrupted; and that the provision in \n\n[201 U.S. 506, 524]\n\u00a0\n that statute forbidding any interruption of the navigation of the river had reference to the needs of navigation not only at the time the tunnel was constructed, but its needs at any subsequent period, as found and declared by the city, upon reasonable grounds; which declaration would, of course, be subject to the condition, vital in our system of government, that the courts may look through and behind mere forms, and interfere, whenever necesary, for the protection of private rights against an illegal, arbitrary exercise of governmental power.\n In addition to these considerations we may suggest the important one that the rights of the company, as the owner of the fee of land on either side of the river or in its bed, were subject to the paramount right of navigation over the waters of the river.

The principle is thus declared by a leading text writer: 'The privilege of navigation upon all waters which are capable of such use in their natural condition, and are accessible without trespassing upon private lands, is a common and paramount right . . . . At common law the right of navigating a public stream is paramount to the right of passage across the stream by means of a bridge.' Gould, Waters,  86, 88.\n If, then, the right of the railroad company to have and maintain a tunnel under the Chicago river is subject to the paramount public right of navigation; if its right to maintain a tunnel in the river is a qualified one, because subject to the specific condition in the act of 1874 that no tunnel should interrupt navigation; if the present tunnel is an obstruction to \n\n[201 U.S. 506, 525]\n\u00a0\n navigation, as, upon this record, we must take it to be; and if the city, as representing the state and public, may rightfully insist that such obstruction shall not longer remain in the way of free navigation,-it necessarily follows that the railway company is under a duty to comply with the demand made upon it to remove, at its own expense, the obstruction which itself has created and maintained. If the obstruction cannot be removed except by lowering the tunnel to the required depth and ( if a tunnel is to be maintained) providing one that will not interrupt navigation, then the cost attendant upon such work must be met by the company. The city asks nothing more than that the railroad company shall do what is necessary to free navigation from an obstruction for which it is responsible, and (if it intends not to abandon its right to maintain a tunnel at or near Van Buren street) that it shall itself provide a new tunnel with the necessary depth of water above it. The case differs somewhat from Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. People (just decided) \n200 U.S. 561\n, 50 L. ed.--, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 341. In that case we held it to be the duty of the railway company, at its own cost, to remove the bridge, culvert, timbers, and stones which it placed in Rob Roy creek, and which prevented the execution of the plan devised by the drainage commissioners. But the commissioners demanded that more be done; for their plan contemplated that earth outside of the railroad bridge and culvert be removed, in order that the channel be enlarged, widened, and deepened. But in that improvement the railway company had no interest. It was not responsible for the inadequacy of the original channel of Rob Roy creek for the system of drainage adopted by the commissioners. Its only duty, and the only burden imposed upon it, was to remove, at its own cost, the obstructions placed by it in the creek, and which stood in the way of the proposed system of drainage. In the case before us the public demands nothing to be done by the railroad company except to remove the obstruction which itself placed and maintains in the river under the condition that navigation should not at any time be thereby in- \n\n[201 U.S. 506, 526]\n\u00a0\n terrupted. The removal of such obstruction is all that is needed to protect navigation. So that whatever cost attends the removal of the obstruction must be borne by the railroad company. The condition under which the company placed its tunnel in the river being met by the company, the public has no further demands upon it. This cannot be deemed a taking of private property for public use or a denial of the equal protection of laws, within the meaning of the Constitution, but is only the result of the lawful exercise of a governmental power for the common good. This appears from the authorities cited in Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. People, supra. The state court has well said that to maintain the navigable character of the stream in a lawful way is not, within the meaning of the law, the taking of private property or any property right of the owner of the soil under the river, such ownership being subject to the right of free and unobstructed pavigation. People ex rel. Chicago v. West Chicago Street R. Co. 203 Ill. 551, 557, 68 N. E. 78. What the city asks, and all that it asks, is that the railroad company be required, in the exercise of its rights and in the use of its property, to respect the public needs as declared by competent authority, upon reasonable grounds, to exist. This is not an arbitrary or unreasonable demand. It does not, in any legal sense, take or appropriate the company's property for the public benefit, but only insists that the company shall not use its property so as to interrupt navigation.\n Further discussion of the general question will be found in \n Northern Transp.

We need not repeat all said in the opinion in that case on this question.\n Another matter requires notice. The railroad company contends that the city had no power to require or authorize any changes in the bed of the river without the approval of the Secretary of War. River and harbor act of 1899,  10, 30 Stat. at L. 1151, chap. 425, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3541. The same act contains directions for the improvement of Chicago river. Construing all the provisions together, we think it clear that when Congress declared in the river and harbor act of 1899, under the heading of 'Improving Chicago River in Illinois' (p. 1156), that 'all the work of removing and reconstructing bridges and piers and lowering tunnels necessary to permit a practicable channel' with the prescribed 'project' depth of 21 feet in Chicago river should be done by the city, without expense to the United States, it meant to give the assent of the United States to any work done by the city towards accomplishing the end which the government had in view. The state court properly said that 'the city has power, under its charter, to deepen the channel, and as a preliminary to doing so, to require this tunnel to be lowered or removed, and the act of Congress permits it to proceed, so far as the lowering of the tunnel is concerned.'\n As showing that the action taken by the city of Chicago is in accordance with the will of Congress, we may refer to the act of Congress of April 27th, 1904, relating to certain tunnels under Chicago river, including the particular tunnel here in question. That act provides: 'That the tunnels under the Chicago river, in the state of Illinois, at La Salle street, Washington street, and near Van Buren street, in the city of Chicago, in said state of Illinois, are, and each of them is, hereby declared to be, as now constructed, an unreasonable obstruction to the free navigation of said Chicago river, and each of said tunnels is hereby declared to be a public nuisance. And it shall be the duty of the Secretary of War to give notice to the persons or corporations owning or controlling said tunnels, or any of them, so to \n\n[201 U.S. 506, 528]\n\u00a0\n alter the same as to render navigation over said tunnels free, easy, and unobstructed, and in giving such notice he shall specify the changes recommended by the chief of engineers that are needed to be made in order that said tunnels, or any of them, shall not thereafter be an obstruction to navigation, and shall prescribe in each case a reasonable time in which to make said changes. If, at the expiration of such time, such changes have not been made, the Secretary of War shall forthwith notify the United States district attorney for the northern district of Illinois, in which said tunnels are situated, to the end that the criminal proceedings hereinafter prescribed may be taken. If the person or persons, corporation or corporations, owning or controlling any of the said tunnels shall, after receiving notice to that effect, as hereinbefore required, from the Secretary of War, and within the time prescribed by him, fail or refuse to remove the same or to make the changes specified in the notice of the Secretary of War, such person or persons, corporation or corporations, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine not exceeding ten thousand dollars; and each and every month such person or persons, corporation or corporations, shall remain in default in respect to the removal or alteration of such tunnel shall be deemed a new offense and subject the person or persons, corporation or corporations, so offending to the penalty herein prescribed: Provided, That in any case arising under the provisions of this act an appeal or writ of error may be taken from the district court or from the circuit court direct to the Supreme Court either by the United States or by the defendants.' 33 Stat. at L. 314, chap. 1615. For some reason, not explained in the record, no allusion was made to this act in the opinion of the supreme court of Illinois, nor is it alluded to in the briefs of counsel. That act, it seems to the court, emphasizes and strengthens the views expressed in this opinion, and tends to support the conclusions reached.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes concurs in the judgment, upon the authority of Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. People.\n For the reasons we have stated, and in conformity with the principles announced in Chicago, B. & Q. R. \n\n[201 U.S. 506, 529]\n\u00a0\n Co. v.

Fearons, and Francis Raymond Stark for plaintiff in error.\n No counsel for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n By statutes of the state of Virginia a liability to forfeit the sum of $100 was imposed upon a telegraph company for an omission to promptly transmit and deliver telegrams received by it. Va. Code 1887,  1291, \n\n[203 U.S. 505, 506]\n\u00a0\n 1292. On November 2, 1903, Hughes, the defendant in error, handed to the Western Union Telegraph Company, at its office in Danville, Virginia, a message to be transmitted by wire to Pocahontas, Virginia, and there delivered to the addressee. In regular course such message would have gone by way of Bluefield, West Virginia. It reached that point, but was not sent further. For failure to make delivery Hughes sued the telegraph company in the corporation court of the city of Danville to recover the statutory penalty, and obtained a judgment. Error was prosecuted to the supreme court of appeals of Virginia, upon the contention that the transmission of the message in question was interstate commerce, and not subject to the statutory regulations of Virginia, heretofore referred to. The appellate court, however, held (104 Va. 240, 51 S. E. 225) that the case was ruled by a prior decision (Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Reynolds, 100 Va. 459, 93 Am. St. Rep. 971, 41 S. E. 856), and that such decision had not been overruled by the decision of this court in Hanley v. Kansas City Southern R. Co. \n187 U.S. 617\n, 47 L. ed. 333, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 214, and being of opinion, as recited on its journal, 'that the writ of error was improvidently awarded,' and that it had 'no jurisdiction to entertain the same,' dismissed the writ of error.\n Treating the order of dismissal as a final judgment, we are now asked on this writ of error to reverse the ruling of the supreme court of appeals of Virginia. This, however, we cannot do. It is immaterial that the supreme court of appeals was vested by the state Constitution with appellate jurisdiction in all cases involving the constitutionality of a law as being repugnant to the Constitution of Virginia or of the United States, or that, in the opinion delivered by the court, it discussed the Federal question and declared it to be without merit. The fact is undoubted that the writ of error was dismissed solely and expressly because of a want of jurisdiction, and the effect of the formal entry, adjudging that the court was without jurisdiction to pass upon the questions presented by the writ of error, cannot be different from what it would have been had the court not given expression to its views \n\n[203 U.S. 505, 507]\n\u00a0\n in a written opinion. The necessary result of the ruling that the court had not jurisdiction of the writ of error was to determine that the trial court was the final court where the questions presented by the writ could be decided; and, hence, the writ of error should have been directed to that court.

DICK(1906)\nNo. 494\nArgued: Decided: April 30, 1906\n\n\n\n\n[202 U.S. 132, 133]\n\u00a0\n On May 16, 1905, the respondent in these two cases was convicted in the district court of the United States for the district of Idaho, northern division, on the charge of unlawfully and feloniously introducing intoxicating liquors into the Nez Perce Indian reservation, and sentenced to pay a fine of $100 and be confined in the penitentiary for the term of one year and ten days. On July 21, 1905, a bill of exceptions was duly prepared and signed. Thereafter, without suing out a writ of error, respondent applied to the circuit court of appeals of the ninth circuit for writs of habeas corpus and of certiorari. It does not affirmatively appear that any writ of habeas corpus was issued, the record in the court of appeals reciting:\n'The petition in the above-entitled matter for a writ of habeas corpus and a writ of certiorari having been duly submitted to the court, and the petition for a writ of certiorari therein having been granted, and a writ of certiorari having been issued, directed to the honorable the United States district court for the district of Idaho, and requiring the said district court to certify to this court a transcript of the record and proceedings in the suit therein of the United States v. George Dick, and the return to the said writ of certiorari having been filed, the matter was duly argued and submitted to the court for consideration and decision upon the said return and upon the briefs of counsel for the respective parties.\n\n'On consideration whereof, and the court being of the opinion that the United States district court for the district of \n\n[202 U.S. 132, 134]\n\u00a0\n Idaho did not have jurisdiction of the offense charged in the indictment found against the petitioner in the suit of the United States v. George Dick, it is ordered and adjudged that the petitioner, George Dick, be discharged from imprisonment.'\n\n From this order of discharge, Whitney, as warden of the Idaho state penitentiary (the respondent named in the petition for a habeas corpus), perfected an appeal to this court, and that appeal is case No. 494. Subsequently he applied for a writ of certiorari, to review the decision of the court of appeals, which was allowed, and that is case No. 557. The record in case No. 494 was directed to stand as the return to the writ of certiorari. Both the appeal and the certiorari were taken by the warden, appearing by the United States attorney for the district of Idaho, under the direction of the Attorney General of the United States.\n Solicitor General Hoyt for appellant and petitioner.\n Mr. Frank E. Fogg for appellee and respondent.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Brewer: \n\n[202 U.S. 132, 135]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n The first question is, of course, one of jurisdiction. Final orders of the circuit court of appeals may of right be brought to this court only where the matter in dispute exceeds in value $1,000. As there is no amount in controversy, the appeal was unauthorized and must be dismissed. Lau Ow Bew v. United States, \n144 \nU.S. 47, 58\n, 36 S. L. ed. 340, 344, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 517. But by certiorari the judgment of the court of appeals is properly before us. Re Chetwood, \n165 \nU.S. 443, 462\n, 41 S. L. ed. 782, 788, 17 Sup.Ct.Rep. 385.\n Had the court of appeals jurisdiction to issue separately either a writ of certiorari or one of habeas corpus, or the two jointly? And, first, as to the writ of habeas corpus. Undoubtedly that writ is one of high privilege. We are not confronted with the case of a failure by Congress to make any provision vision for it. Under  751, Rev. Stat. (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 592), the Supreme, circuit, and district courts may issue writs of habeas corpus, and by  752 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 592), like power is given to the several justices and judges of said courts for the purpose of inquiry into the cause of restraint of liberty. Thus adequate provision has been made for securing to everyone entitled thereto the writ of habeas corpus. So, when Congress passes an act establishing a new court, there is no constraining presumption that it must intend to give to that court jurisdiction in habeas corpus. The court of appeals act ( 26 Stat. at L. 826, chap. 517, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 488) does not in terms grant authority to issue the writ. It is silent on the subject, and in order to sustain its jurisdiction we must write something into the statute which Congress itself did not put there. In this we are speaking of the writ of habeas corpus as an original \n\n[202 U.S. 132, 136]\n\u00a0\n and independent proceeding, for by  12 of the act 'the circuit court of appeals shall have the powers specified in  716 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 580).' Section 716 provides that 'the Supreme Court and the circuit and district courts shall have power to issue writs of scire facias. They shall also have power to issue all writs not specifically provided for by statute, which may be necessary for the exercise of their respective jurisdictions, and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.' Cases may arise in which the writ of habeas corpus is necessary to the complete exercise of the appellate jurisdiction vested in the circuit court of appeals. But it is unnecessary to speculate under what circumstances such an exigency may exist, for the writ, asked for here was an independent and original proceeding challenging in toto the validity of a judgment rendered in another court. There was no proceeding of an appellate character pending in the court of appeals, for the complete exercise of jurisdiction in which any auxiliary writ of habeas corpus was requisite. Appellate proceedings are, generally speaking, initiated by appeals and writs of error, and for these the court of appeals act specifically provides. The writ of habeas corpus is not the equivalent of an appeal or writ of error. It is not a proceeding to correct errors which may have occurred in a trial of the case below. It is an attack directly upon the validity of the judgment, and, as has been frequently said, it cannot be transformed into a writ of error. It is doubtless true that if the language of the court of appeals act was fairly susceptible of two constructions, one granting and the other omitting to grant power to issue a writ of habeas corpus, the great importance of the writ might justify a construction upholding the grant. This is indicated by the ruling in Ex parte Bollman, 4 Cranch, 75, 2 L. ed. 554. The 14th section of the original judiciary act contained this language: 'That all the before-mentioned courts of the United States shall have power to issue writs of scire facias, habeas corpus, and all other writs not specially provided for by statute, which may be necessary \n\n[202 U.S. 132, 137]\n\u00a0\n for the exercise of their respective jurisdictions, and agreeable to the principles and usages of law.' [1 Stat. at L. 81, chap. 20, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 580.] And the question presented was whether the grant of power to issue a writ of habeas corpus was an absolute and independent grant or one simply authorizing the issue of the writ when necessary for and in aid of the exercise of a jurisdiction already otherwise obtained, and it was held to be an absolute and independent grant, the conclusion being placed by Chief Justice Marshall, delivering the opinion of the court, partly on the grammatical construction of the section and partly on the significance and importance of the writ itself. But in the court of appeals act there is no mention of habeas corpus, no language which can be tortured into a grant of power to issue the writ, except in cases where it may be necessary for the exercise of a jurisdiction already existing.\n It will be borne in mind that the circuit court of appeals, which is a court created by statute (Kentucky v. Powers, \n201 \nU.S. 1, 24\n, 50 S. L. ed . --, 26 Sup.Ct.Rep. 387), is not in terms endowed with any original jurisdiction. It is only a court of appeal. Section 2 of the act says that it 'shall be a court of record with appellate jurisdiction, as is hereafter limited and established.' Section 6 provides that it 'shall exercise appellate jurisdiction to review by appeal or by writ of error final decision in the district court and the existing circuit courts in all cases,' etc. By  10, 'Whenever, on appeal or writ of error, or otherwise, a case coming . . . from a circuit court of appeals shall be reviewed and determined in the Supreme Court, the cause shall be remanded by the Supreme Court to the proper district or circuit court for further proceedings in pursuance of such determination.' [26 Stat. at L. 826, 828, 829, chap. 517, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 547, 550, 552.] Sections 4, 13, and 15 name the courts whose judgments may be reviewed in the courts of appeals. Obviously, the courts of appeal are simply given appellate jurisdiction over certain specified courts. It follows that they are not authorized to issue original and independent writs of habeas corpus.\n Have they jurisdiction to issue writs of certiorari? As we have seen, the procedure prescribed by the statute for bring- \n\n[202 U.S. 132, 138]\n\u00a0\n ing to the courts of appeal those final decisions of courts which they are authorized to review is appeal or writ of error, and that, in this country, is the ordinary method by which review is obtained in an appellate court. Especially is this true of the Federal procedure, the only instance in which certiorari is named as the writ for the removal of cases from a lower to a higher court being in the authority given to this court to bring up cases from the courts of appeal by certiorari. Inasmuch as appeal and writ of error are specifically prescribed in the court of appeals act as the process to bring up final decisions to that court for review, the authority to issue a certiorari must be found in the grant of power 'to issue all writs not specifically provided for by statute, which may be necessary for the exercise of their respective jurisdictions, and agreeable to the usages, and principles of law.' That certiorari may be used to bring up portions of a record not originally returned to a court of appeals is undoubted, for it may be necessary for the complete exercise of its appellate jurisdiction; but not otherwise, for every case of which that court may take jurisdiction can be carried up by appeal or writ of error. Of course, if, in the case at bar, the writ of habeas corpus was not or could not rightfully be issued, then certiorari cannot be sustained as auxiliary process, but must stand or fall as an independent proceeding.\n It may be said that the power of this court to issue original and independent writs of certiorari has been upheld under the authority given by  716. A reference to some of the decisions may be well. See generally Ex parte Vallandigham, 1 Wall. 243, 17 L. ed. 589, and cases cited in the opinion; Ewing v. Louis, 5 Wall. 413, 18 L. ed. 657; Ex parte Lange, 18 Wall. 163, 21 L. ed. 872.\n Fowler v. Lindsey, 3 Dall. 411, 1 L. ed. 658, was the case of an application before judgment to remove certain actions from the circuit court to this court on the ground that a state was the real party in interest, and it was said by Mr. Justice Washington (p. 413, L. ed. p. 659):\n'But as it is proposed to remove the suits under considera- \n\n[202 U.S. 132, 139]\n\u00a0\n tion from the circuit court into this court, by writs of certiorari, I ask whether it has ever happened, in the course of judicial proceedings, that a certiorari has issued from a superior to an inferior court, to remove a cause merely from a defect of jurisdiction? I do not know that such a case could ever occur.'\n\n In American Constr. Co. v. Jacksonville, T. & K. W. R. Co. \n148 U.S. 372\n, 37 L. ed. 486, 13 Sup.Ct.Rep. 758, where an application was made for mandamus and certiorari, Mr. Justice Gray, speaking for the court, after quoting  716, said (p. 380, L. ed. p. 489, Sup.Ct.Rep. p. 762):\n'Under this provision, the court might doubtless issue writs of certiorari, in proper cases. But the writ of certiorari has not been issued as freely by this court as by the court of Queen's bench, in England. Ex parte Vallandigham, 1 Wall. 243, 249, 17 L. ed. 589, 592. It was never issued to bring up from an inferior court of the United States for trial a case within the exclusive jurisdiction of a higher court. Fowler v. Lindsey, 3 Dall. 411, 413, 1 L. ed. 658, 659; Patterson v. United States, 2 Wheat. 221, 225, 226, 4 L. ed. 224-226; Ex parte Hitz, \n111 U.S. 766\n, 28 L. ed. 592, 4 Sup. Ct. Rep. 698. It was used by this court as an auxiliary process only, to supply imperfections in the record of a case already before it; and not, like a writ of error, to review the judgment of an inferior court.

Rep. p. 392):\n'By  14 of the judiciary act of September 24, 1789 (1 Stat. at L. 81, chap. 20), carried forward as  716 of the Revised Statutes, this court and the circuit and district courts of the United States were empowered by Congress 'to issue all writs, not specifically provided for by statute, which may be agreeable to the usages and principles of law;' and, under this provision, we can undoubtedly issue writs of certiorari in all proper cases. American Constr. Co. v. Jacksonville, T. & K. W. R. Co. \n148 \nU.S. 372, 380\n, 37 S. L. ed. 486, 489, 13 Sup.Ct.Rep. 758. And although, as ob- \n\n[202 U.S. 132, 140]\n\u00a0\n served in that case, this writ has not been issued as freely by this court as by the court of Queen's bench, in England, and, prior to the act of March 3, 1891, chap. 517, 26 Stat. at L. 826, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 488, had been ordinarily used as an auxiliary process merely, yet, whenever the circumstances imperatively demand that form of interposition, the writ may be allowed as at common law, to correct excesses of jurisdiction and in furtherance of justice. Tidd, Pr. *398; Bacon, Abr., Certiorari.'\n\n And in Re Tampa Suburban R. Co. \n168 U.S. 583\n, 42 L. ed. 589, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 177, it was held that 'a writ of certiorari, such as is asked for in this case, will be refused when there is a plain and adequate remedy, by appeal or otherwise.'\n This court has never decided that certiorari was to be resorted to in place of a writ of error whenever it suited the convenience of parties. There must be 'circumstances imperatively demanding' a departure from the ordinary remedy by writ of error or appeal. In the case at bar the indictment charges the introduction of liquor into the Indian country. It is not questioned that this is a criminal offense under the laws of the United States, but it is contended that the place of the alleged offense was not Indian country. The trial court ruled that it was. This ruling was excepted to, a bill of exceptions prepared and signed, and the case put in proper condition for review in the court of appeals on writ of error. There was no necessity for a certiorari.\n Apparently the thought of petitioner was to get rid of the case at once and entirely. It was not a new trial or any mere correction of errors, but a termination of the litigation which induced this proceeding rather than a writ of error. It was a short way of disposing of the entire matter,- the same reason that has so often prompted writs of habeas corpus. We have repeatedly held against such procedure. While undoubtedly the power exists, and it may sometimes be proper for a court to put an end to the litigation by some short summary process, yet, as a rule, the orderly way is to proceed by writ of error. The latest expression of the views of this court is to be found \n\n[202 U.S. 132, 141]\n\u00a0\n in Riggins v. United States, \n199 U.S. 547\n, 50 L. ed. --, 26 Sup.Ct.Rep. 147. To that and the cases cited in the opinion we refer, saying that in the case at bar there is no special reason why the ordinary procedure should not obtain. It will be borne in mind that the act with which the respondent was charged was not done under or by virtue of the authority of the Constitution or laws of the United States, and therefore his prompt release is not necessary in order to uphold the national authority. It was not an act to be commended, and the only question is whether its punishment was within the jurisdiction of the Federal courts, and that question, under the circumstances, should have been settled in the ordinary way.\n For these reasons the decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded with instructions to quash the writ of certiorari and dismiss the petition. \n\n\n\n","186":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWHITNEY v. DRESSER(1906)\nNo. 180\nArgued: January 26, 1906Decided: February 19, 1906\n\n\n\n Mr. George H. Gilman for appellant. \n\n[200 U.S. 532, 533]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Adrian H. Joline, Adrian H. Larkin, and George E. Hargrave, for appellee.\n\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is an appeal from the allowance of a claim of Emma B. Dresser against the firm of Dresser & Company, bankrupts, the members of the firm being Daniel Le Roy Dresser and Charles E. Reiss. The allegations of the amended proof, so far as necessary to be stated, are that the bankrupts are justly and truly indebted to the deponent in the sum of $88,145, upon the following consideration: Before May, 1896, the deponent lent certain specified shares of stock to the firm of Dresser & Goodrich for the purpose of the firm's borrowing money upon the same, etc., and the firm did so. In May, 1896, the firm was dissolved, Daniel Le Roy Dresser took over its assets and assumed its liabilities, including that to the deponent with her consent, 'and the proceeds of the loans for which said securities had been deposited by said firm as collateral were turned over to said Daniel Le Roy Dresser, and used by him in his business.' In May, 1897, the present bankrupts formed their partnership, taking over the assets and assuming the liabilities of said Dresser. At the request of said Dresser and Reiss, with deponent's knowledge and consent, the liability of Dresser \n\n[200 U.S. 532, 534]\n\u00a0\n to the deponent was assumed by the firm, 'and used by said firm in its business.' Evidently some words were omitted at this point, by mistake, and we agree with the court below that the most reasonable view is that it was intended to repeat the phrase quoted above in speaking of the transfer from Dresser & Goodrich to Dresser.\n The trustee objected to the allowance of the claim against the assets of the partnership, and put in evidence before the referee, the main fact proved being that Dresser personally signed the notes on which were made the advances for which the stocks were pledged. This was relied on, in connection with the form of the proof of claim before it was amended, to show that the stocks really were lent to Daniel Le Roy Dresser alone. On the other hand, it appeared that some, at least, of the checks for the money lent went to the firm, and all the evidence was reconcilable with the averments of the amended claim. The referee ruled that the verified amended proof of claim was prima facie proof of the indebtedness of Dresser & Company to the claimant, held the evidence introduced insufficient to rebut it, and dismissed the objection. The district judge sustained the action of the referee, and his order was affirmed by the circuit court of appeals. 68 C. C. A. 207, 135 Fed. 495.\n It is urged that the claim is bad on its face because it showed at most a promise to answer for the debt of another, required to be in writing by the New York statute of frauds, and no such writing was filed with the proof in accordance with the requirement of the bankruptcy law,  57b. [30 Stat. at L. 560, chap. 541, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3418.] It is unnecessary to consider whether the objection is open or otherwise sound, because, if it is, which we are far from intimating, the claim clearly imports a novation; that is to say, the giving and accepting of the responsibility of the present firm in place of that of Daniel Le Roy Dresser alone. The only question warranting the appeal is whether the sworn proof of claim is prima facie evidence of its allegations in case it is objected to. It is not a question of the burden of proof in a technical sense,-a \n\n[200 U.S. 532, 535]\n\u00a0\n burden which does not change, whatever the state of the evidence,-but simply whether the sworn proof is evidence at all.\n The circuit court of appeals observed that the proof of claim warrants the payment of a dividend in the absence of objection, and, therefore, must have some probative force. In reply it is argued that what is done in default of opposition is no test of what is evidence when opposition is made; that a judgment may be entered on a declaration for want of an answer, yet a declaration is not evidence; that it is contrary to analogy to give effect to an ex parte affidavit, and that, on general principles, it is the right of any party against whom a claim is made to have it proved, not only upon oath, but subject to cross-examination.\n Notwithstanding these forcible considerations, we agree with the circuit court of appeals. The prevailing opinion, not only in the second circuit, but elsewhere, seems to have been that way, Re Sumner, 101 Fed. 224; Re Shaw, 109 Fed. 780; Re Cannon, 133 Fed. 837; Re Carter, 138 Fed. 846; Re Doty, 5 Am. Bankr. Rep. 58. See also Re Saunders, 2 Low. Dec. 444, 446, Fed. Cas. No. 12,371; Re Felter, 7 Fed. 904, 906. The alternative would be that the mere interposition of an objection by any party in interest ( 57d), would require the claimant to produce evidence. For if the formal proof is no evidence, a denial of the claim must have that effect. If it does not, then the formal proof is some evidence, even when there is testimony on the other side. The words of the statute suggest, if they do not distinctly import, that the objector is to go forward, and thus that the formal proof is evidence even when put in issue. The words are: 'Objections to claims shall be heard and determined as soon,' etc.  57f. It is the objection, not the claim, which is pointed out for hearing and determination. This indicates that the claim is regarded as having a certain standing already established by the oath. Some force also may be allowed to the word 'proof' as used in the act. Convenience undoubtedly is on the side of this view. Bankruptcy proceedings are more summary than ordi- \n\n[200 U.S. 532, 536]\n\u00a0\n nary suits. Judges of practical experience have pointed out the expense, embarrassments, and delay which would be caused if a formal objection necessarily should put a creditor to the production of evidence or require a continuance. Justice is secured by the power to continue the consideration of a claim whenever it appears there is good reason for it. We believe that the understanding of the profession, the words of the act, and convenient and just administration, all are on the side of treating a sworn proof of claim as some evidence, even when it is denied.\n Order affirmed. \n\n\n\n","187":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWICOMICO COUNTY COM'RS v. BANCROFT(1906)\nNo. 129\nArgued: October 9, 1906Decided: November 5, 1906\n\n\n\n Mr. James E. Ellegood for petitioners. \n\n[203 U.S. 112, 113]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Nicholas P. Bond, Ralph Robinson, and Edward Duffy for respondent.\n\n\n\n[203 U.S. 112, 114]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n The respondent, Samuel Bancroft, Jr., began an action in the circuit court of the United States for the district of Maryland to enjoin the county commissioners of Wicomico county from levying taxes on the property of the Baltimore, Chesapeake, & Atlantic Railway Company, alleging that he was the holder of twenty bonds secured by mortgage upon the company's property, which, under the laws of the state, had been exempted from taxation. Such proceedings were had that a decree was entered enjoining taxation of certain property of the railway company. Upon appeal to the circuit court of appeals, the judgment was affirmed (70 C. C. A.287, 135 Fed. 977), and the case was brought here by writ of certiorari. \n\n[203 U.S. 112, 115]\n\u00a0\n The case was tried upon an agreed statement of facts, from which the following, pertinent to the determination of the case, may be extracted: The Baltimore & Eastern Shore Railroad Company, organized to build a line of road from Eastern Bay, in Talbot county, to Salisbury, Wicomico county, in the same state, by act of the legislature of Maryland, was granted certain privileges (Acts of the Assembly, 1886, chap. 133),  2, 4, and 5 being as follows:\n'Sec. 2. And be it enacted, That said corporation shall have perpetual existence, and its franchises, property, shares of capital stocks, and bonds shall be exempt from all state, county, or municipal taxation for the term of thirty years, counting from the date of the completion of said road between the termini mentioned in its charter.'\n\n'Sec. 4. And be it enacted, That the said Baltimore & Eastern Shore Railroad Company aforesaid shall have power to unite, connect, and consolidate with any railroad company or companies, either in or out of this state, so that the capital stock of said companies so united, connected, and consolidated (respectively) may, at the pleasure of the directors, constitute a common stock, and the respective companies may thereafter constitute one company and be entitled to all the property, franchises, rights, privileges, and immunities which each of them possess, have, and enjoy under and by virtue of their respective charters.\n\n'Sec. 5. And be it enacted, That the Baltimore & Eastern Shore Railroad Company shall have power to lease or purchase and operate any railroad or railroads, either in or out of this state, for the purpose of carrying on their business, and any other railroad company in this state shall have the right to lease or sell its railroad or other property to the said Baltimore & Eastern Shore Railroad Company.'\n\n The Baltimore & Eastern Shore Railroad Company accepted the provisions of the act and completed the construction of its road between the termini named in August, 1891. In June, 1890, it purchased the property of the \n\n[203 U.S. 112, 116]\n\u00a0\n Wicomico & Pocomoke Railroad Company, extending from Salisbury to Ocean City. Afterwards, the Baltimore & Eastern Shore Railroad Company mortgaged the entire property to secure $1,600,000 of mortgage bonds. This mortgage was foreclosed in 1894, and the purchaser proceeded to organize a new corporation-the Baltimore, Chesapeake, & Atlantic Railway Company-the respondent becoming the holder of some of its mortgage bonds. This reorganization was under  187 and 188 of art. 23, Maryland Code of 1888, which provides as follows:\n Section 187, that in case of the sale of any railroad under foreclosure of mortgage, the purchaser may form a corporation for the purpose of owning, possessing, maintaining, and operating such railroad, by filing in the office of the secretary of state, a certificate of the name and style of such corporation, the number of directors, etc.\n'Sec. 188. Such corporation shall possess all the powers, rights, immunities, privileges, and franchises in respect to such railroad, or the part thereof included in such certificate, and in respect to the real and personal property appertaining to the same, which were possessed or enjoyed by the corporation which owned or held such railroad previous to such sale under or by virtue of its charter, and any amendments thereto, and of [any] other laws of this state,' etc.\n\n Under authority of the Maryland statutes the Baltimore, Chesapeake, & Atlantic Railway Company issued the mortgage bonds of which respondent is the holder. The county commissioners of Wicomico county have levied and assessed taxes upon the railroad company's property, and threatened to sell the same for nonpayment thereof. The circuit court held, and the circuit court of appeals affirmed the judgment, that  187 and 188 of the Maryland Code, extending immunities to the new company, had the effect to exempt from taxation certain property of the reorganized company, and that the exemption constituted a contract between the state and the company entitled to protection under the con- \n\n[203 U.S. 112, 117]\n\u00a0\n tract clause of the Federal Constitution, against the subsequent attempt of the county commissioners to levy taxes upon the property.\n Notwithstanding this decision of the circuit court of appeals, it is now conceded in the brief of the respondent's counsel, so far as this argument is concerned, that there was no binding contract upon the state entitled to protection under the Federal Constitution (article 1,  10) against state impairment of the obligation of the contract. In view of the provisions of the Maryland Constitution this concession would seem in harmony with the right reserved in that instrument to amend, repeal, and alter charters. Northern C. R. Co. v. Maryland, \n187 U.S. 258\n, 47 L. ed. 167, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 62. And see Wisconsin & M. R. Co. v. Powers, \n191 U.S. 379\n, 48 L. ed. 229, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 107. But it is insisted, conceding that the exemption from taxation was merely a bounty or gratuity, it extended to the reorganized company by force of the Maryland statutes above quoted, and has never been repealed nor withdrawn by the state, and, therefore, the bondholder, being directly interested in the property, has a right to be protected by injunction against the levying of such taxes so long as the act remains in force.\n The questions arising in this case, as to the construction and force of the acts of the legislature of the state, have been before the supreme court of Maryland in three cases: Baltimore, C. & A. R. Co. v. Ocean City, 89 Md. 89, 42 Atl. 922; Baltimore C. & A. R. Co. v. Wicomico County, 93 Md. 113, 48 Atl. 853; and Baltimore, C. & A. R. Co. v. Wicomico County, 63 Atl. 678. In these cases it was held that the exemption from taxation provided for by the laws above quoted did not extend to the reorganized company, and in the last case, decided March 27, 1906, since the decision in the circuit court of appeals, it was held that the general assessment law of 1896 (Acts of 1896, chap. 120) declaring that the property of every railroad should be assessed for county and municipal purposes, and providing that noth- \n\n[203 U.S. 112, 118]\n\u00a0\n ing in the act should discharge or release any irrepealable contract or obligation existing at the date of the passage of the act, amounted to a recall of the immunity granted by the former law, which had at all times been subject to repeal by the state, and that, conceding the immunity extended to the reorganized company under  187 of the statute, the repeal of the exemption did not violate any contract with the state, entitled to the protection of the Federal Constitution.\n As we have said, the argument addressed to this court is rested upon the proposition that the subsequent law of 1896, imposing taxes upon the property of the railroad company in general terms, did not repeal prior legislation, which, properly construed, gives the privilege of exemption from taxation to the property of the reorganized railroad company. We, therefore, are to consider a case wherein there is no contention that a valid and binding contract has been impaired by state action, and the questions are as to the proper construction of the statute, and whether a repealable exemption from taxation has been withdrawn by subsequent legislation of the state.\n Previous decisions of this court have settled the proposition that whether such exemption has been in fact repealed by a subsequent state statute is a question of state law in which the decisions of the highest courts of the state, in the absence of contract, are binding; and that it is only where the exemption is irrepealable, thus constituting a contract, that it becomes the duty of this court to decide for itself whether the subsequent act did or did not impair the obligation of the contract. Gulf & S. I. R. Co. v. Hewes, \n183 U.S. 66\n-74, 46 L. ed. 86-90, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 26; Northern C. R. Co. v. Maryland, \n187 \nU.S. 258, 266\n, 267 S., 47 L. ed. 167, 170, 172, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 62. It is contended, however, that inasmuch as the respondent acquired his bonds in 1896, which were issued in 1894, at a time when none of the Maryland decisions above referred to had been made, the first of them being in 1899, the construction of the statutes and their continued force are questions for the Federal courts having jurisdiction of the cause and the parties. And further, that while \n\n[203 U.S. 112, 119]\n\u00a0\n the Federal tribunals will differ reluctantly from the state courts upon a question of the validity of state statutes, and will 'lean towards an agreement of views with the state courts,' nevertheless, they must in such cases exercise an independent judgment in determining the force and validity of state statutes. Burgess v. Seligman, \n107 \nU.S. 20, 23\n, 27 S. L. ed. 359, 361, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 10; Great Southern Fire Proof Hotel Co. v. Jones, \n193 U.S. 532\n, 48 L. ed. 778, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 576, and cases cited in the opinion in that case.\n If we could concede the soundness of this contention, we are of opinion that the court of appeals of Maryland was right in holding that the legislation of 1896 (Acts of 1896, chap. 120), directing a new assessment of the property of the state, and expressly declaring that the property of every railroad in the state should be valued and assessed for county and municipal purposes, had the effect to withdraw the prior exemption from taxation if a proper construction of the legislation of the state would extend it to the property of the reorganized company. The act contains the significant proviso that nothing therein contained shall be held to discharge, release, impair, or affect any irrepealable contract or obligation of any kind whatsoever existing at the date of the passage of the act. This proviso evidences the legislative intent to repeal exemptions from taxation which were not protected by binding contracts beyond legislative control, if any such existed, and to bring all property within the taxing power of the state. We agree with the reasoning expressed by the court of appeals of Maryland upon this branch of the case. Baltimore, C. & A. R. Co. v. Wicomico County, 63 Atl. 683.\n From this view it follows that the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be reversed and the cause remanded to the Circuit Court with directions to dismiss the bill. \n\n\n\n","188":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWISNER, EX PARTE(1906)\n\nArgued: Decided: December 10, 1906\n\n\n\n Abram C. Wisner, a citizen of the state of Michigan, commenced an action at law, on February 17, A. D. 1906, in the circuit court in and for the city of St. Louis and state of Missouri, against John D. Beardsley, a citizen of the state of Louisiana, by filing a petition, together with an affidavit on which that court issued a writ of attachment, in the usual form, directed to the sheriff of St. Louis. The sheriff returned no property found, but that he had garnisheed the Mississippi Valley Trust Company, a corporation of Missouri, and also had served Beardsley with summons in the city of St. Louis.\n Saturday, March 17, A. D. 1906, the garnishee answered, and on the same day Beardsley filed his petition to remove the action from the state court into the circuit court of the United States for the eastern division of the eastern district of Missouri, on the ground of diversity of citizenship, together \n\n[203 U.S. 449, 450]\n\u00a0\n with the bond required in such case. An order of removal was thereupon entered by the state court and the transcript of record was filed in the circuit court of the United States.\n Monday, March 19, Wisner moved to remand in these words:\n'Now at this day comes plaintiff, by his attorneys, Jones, Jones, & Hocker, and appearing specially for the purposes of this motion only, saving and reserving any and all objections which he has to the manifold imperfections in the mode, manner, and method of the removal papers, and expressly denying that this court has jurisdiction of this cause, or of the plaintiff therein, respectfully moves the court to remand this cause to the circuit court of the city of St. Louis, from whence it was removed, for the reason that this suit does not involve a controversy or dispute properly within the jurisdiction of this court, and that it appears upon the face of the record herein that the plaintiff is a citizen and resident of the state of Michigan and the defendant a citizen and resident of the state of Louisiana, and the cause is not one within the original jurisdiction of this court; hence this court cannot acquire jurisdiction by removal.'\n\n The motion was heard and denied April 2, 1906, the circuit court referring to Foulk v. Gray, 120 Fed. 156, and Rome Petroleum & Iron Co. v. Hughes Specialty Well Drilling Co. 130 Fed. 585, as representing the different views of the courts below on the question involved.\n On April 23, Wisner applied to this court for leave to file a petition for mandamus as well as a petition for prohibition; leave was granted, and rules entered, returnable May 14, 1906, and the cases submitted on the returns to the rules.\n Messrs.

Moore, Edward C. Eliot, and George H. Williams for respondent. \n\n[203 U.S. 449, 455]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n By article 3 of the Constitution the judicial power of the United States was 'vested in one Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts as the Congress may, from time to time, ordain and establish.'\n And the judicial power was extended 'to all cases, in law and equity, arising under this Constitution, the laws of the United States, and treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority; to all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls; to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; to controversies to which the United States shall be a party; to controversies between two or more states; between a state and citizens of another state; between citizens of different states; between citizens of the same state claiming lands under grants of different states, and between a state or the citizens thereof, and foreign states, citizens, or subjects.'\n The Supreme Court alone possesses jurisdiction derived immediately from the Constitution, and of which the legislative power cannot deprive it (United States v. Hudson, 7 Cranch, 32, 3 L. ed. 259); but the jurisdiction of the circuit courts depends upon some act of Congress ( Turner v. Bank of North America, 4 Dall. 8, 10, 1 L. ed. 718, 719; McIntire v. Wood, 7 Cranch, 504, 506, 3 L. ed. 420, 421; Sheldon v. Sill, 8 How. 441, 448, 12 L. ed. 1147, 1150; Stevenson v. Fain, \n195 \nU.S. 165, 167\n, 49 S. L. ed. 142, 143, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 6). In the latter case we said: 'The use of the word 'controversies' as in contradistinction to the word 'cases,' and the omission of the word 'all' in respect of controversies, left it to Congress to define the controversies over which the courts it was empowered to ordain and establish might exercise jurisdiction, and the manner in which it was to be done.'\n The 1st section of the act of March 3, 1887 (24 Stat. at L. 552, chap. 373), as corrected by the act of August 13, 1888 (25 Stat. at L. 433, chap. 866), \n\n[203 U.S. 449, 456]\n\u00a0\n amended  1, 2, and 3 of the act of Congress of March 3, 1875 (18 Stat. at L. 470, chap. 137, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 508), as follows:\n'That the circuit courts of the United States shall have original cognizance, concurrent with the courts of the several states, of all suits of a civil nature, at common law or in equity, where the matter in dispute exceeds, exclusive of interest and costs, the sum or value of two thousand dollars, and arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States, or treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority, or in which controversy the United States are plaintiffs or petitioners, or in which there shall be a controversy between citizens of different states, in which the matter in dispute exceeds, exclusive of interest and costs, the sum or value aforesaid; . . . But no person shall be arrested in one district for trial in another in any civil action before a circuit or district court; and no civil suit shall be brought before either of said courts against any person by any original process or proceeding in any other district than that whereof he is an inhabitant; but where the jurisdiction is founded only on the fact that the action is between citizens of different states, suit shall be brought only in the district of the residence of either the plaintiff or the defendant; . . .\n\n'Sec. 2. That any suit of a civil nature, at law or in equity, arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States, or treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority, of which the circuit courts of the United States are given original jurisdiction by the preceding section, which may now be pending, or which may hereafter be brought, in any state court, may be removed by the defendant or defendants therein to the circuit court of the United States for the proper district. Any other suit of a civil nature, at law or in equity, of which the circuit courts of the United States are given jurisdiction by the preceding section and which are now pending, or which may hereafter be brought, in any state court, may be removed into the circuit court of the United States for the proper district by the defendant \n\n[203 U.S. 449, 457]\n\u00a0\n or defendants therein, being nonresidents of that state. And when, in any suit mentioned in this section, there shall be a controversy which is wholly between citizens of different states, and which can be fully determined as between them, then either one or more of the defendants actually interested in such controversy may remove said suit into the circuit court of the United States for the proper district. And where a suit is now pending, or may be hereafter brought, in any state court, in which there is a controversy between a citizen of the state in which the suit is brought and a citizen of another state, any defendant, being such citizen of another state, may remove such suit into the circuit court of the United States for the proper district, at any time before the trial thereof, when it shall be made to appear to said circuit court that, from prejudice or local influence, he will not be able to obtain justice in such state court, . . .\n\n'Whenever any cause shall be removed from any state court into any circuit court of the United States, and the circuit court shall decide that the cause was improperly removed, and order the same to be remanded to the state court from whence it came, such remand shall be immediately carried into execution, and no appeal or writ of error from the decision of the circuit court so remanding such cause shall be allowed.'\n\n Section 3, as amended, provided for petition and bond for 'the removal of such suit into the circuit court to be held in the district where such suit is pending.'\n As it is the nonresident defendant alone who is authorized to remove, the circuit court for the proper district is evidently the circuit court of the district of the residence of the plaintiff.\n And it is settled that no suit is removable under  2 unless it be one that plaintiff could have brought originally in the circuit court.

'in any other district than that whereof he is an inhabitant, or in which he shall be found at the time of serving the writ.' 1 Stat. at L. 78, 79.'\n\n And, after observations in relation to the use of the word 'inhabitant' in that act, and referring to the act of May 4, 1858 (11 Stat. at L. 272, chap. 27),  1, and the act of March 3, 1875 (18 Stat. at L. 470, chap. 137, U.

As has been adjudged by this court, the last clause is by way of proviso to the next preceding clause, which forbids any suit to be brought in any other district than that whereof the defendant is an inhabitant; and the effect is that 'where the jurisdiction is founded upon any of the causes mentioned in this section, except the citizenship of the parties, it must be brought in the district of which the defendant is an inhabitant; but where the jurisdiction is founded solely upon the fact that the parties are citizens of different states, the suit may be brought in the district in which either the plaintiff or the defendant resides.' McCormick Harvesting Co. v. Walthers, \n134 \nU.S. 41, 43\n, 33 S. L. ed. 833, 834, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 485. And the general object of this act, as appears upon its face, and as has been often declared by this court, is to contract, not to enlarge, the jurisdiction of the circuit courts of the United States. Smith v. Lyon, \n133 \nU.S. 315, 320\n, 33 S. L. ed. 635, 637, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 303; Re Pennsylvania Co. \n137 \nU.S. 451, 454\n, 34 S. L. ed. 738, 740, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 141; Fisk v. Henarie, \n142 \nU.S. 459, 467\n, 35 S. L. ed. 1079, 1082, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 207.\n\n'As to natural persons, therefore, it cannot be doubted that the effect of this act, read in the light of earlier acts upon the same subject, and of the judicial construction thereof, is that the phrase 'district of the residence of' a person is equivalent to 'district whereof he is an inhabitant,' and cannot be construed as giving jurisdiction, by reason of citizenship, to a circuit court held in a state of which neither party is a citizen, but, on the contrary, restricts the jurisdiction to the district in which one of the parties resides, within the state of which he is a citizen; and that this act, therefore, having taken away the alternative, permitted in the earlier acts, of suing a person in the district 'in which he shall be found,' requires any suit, the jurisdiction of which is founded only on its being between citizens of different states, to be brought in the state of which one is a citizen, and in the district therein of which he is an inhabitant and resident.'\n\n In short, the acts of 1887, 1888 restored the rule of 1789, as we stated in Cochran v. Montgomery County, supra. \n\n[203 U.S. 449, 460]\n\u00a0\n In the present case neither of the parties was a citizen of the state of Missouri, in which state the suit was brought, and, therefore, it could not have been brought in the circuit court in the first instance.\n Wisner did not, of choice, select the state court as the forum, since he could not have sued in the circuit court under the act, because neither he nor Beardsley was a citizen of Missouri. And the question of jurisdiction relates to the time of commencing the suit.\n But it is contended that Beardsley was entitled to remove the case to the circuit court, and as, by his petition for removal, he waived the objection so far as he was personally concerned that he was not sued in his district, hence that the circuit court obtained jurisdiction over the suit. This does not follow, inasmuch as, in view of the intention of Congress by the act of 1887 to contract the jurisdiction of the circuit courts, and of the limitations imposed thereby, jurisdiction of the suit could not have obtained, even with the consent of both parties. As we have heretofore remarked: 'Jurisdiction as to the subject-matter may be limited in various ways as to civil and criminal cases; cases at common law or in equity or in admiralty; probate cases, or cases under special statutes; to particular classes of persons; to proceedings in particular modes; and so on.' Louisville Trust Co. v. Comingor, \n184 \nU.S. 18, 25\n, 46 S. L. ed. 413, 416, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 293. In Central Trust Co. v. McGeorge, \n151 U.S. 129\n, 38 L. ed. 98, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 286, it was assumed, however, that the requirement that no suit should be brought in any other district than that of the plaintiff or of the defendant might be waived, where neither resided therein, because, in that case, the nonresident plaintiff had sued in the circuit court and the nonresident defendant had answered on the merits, which showed the consent of both parties, and not unnaturally led to the result announced, while in this case there was no such consent. As was stated by Mr. Justice Brewer, in Kinney v. Columbia Sav. & L. Asso. \n191 \nU.S. 78, 82\n, 48 S. L. ed. 103, 105, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 30, 32: 'A petition and bond for removal are in the nature of process. They \n\n[203 U.S. 449, 461]\n\u00a0\n constitute the process by which the case is transferred from the state to the Federal court.' When, then, Beardsley filed his petition for removal, he sought affirmative relief in another district than his own. But plaintiff, in resisting the application, and moving to remand, denied the jurisdiction of the circuit court. In St. Louis & S. F. R. Co. v. McBride, \n141 U.S. 127\n, 35 L. ed. 659, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 982, where the plaintiffs were citizens and residents of the western district of Arkansas, and commenced their action in the circuit court of the United States for the district, and the defendant was a corporation and citizen of the state of Missouri, it was held that, as the defendant appeared and pleaded to the merits, he thereby waived his right to challenge thereafter the jurisdiction of the court over him, on the ground that the suit had been brought in the wrong district. And there are many other cases to the same effect.\n Our conclusion is that the case should have been remanded; and, as the circuit court had no jurisdiction to proceed, that mandamus is the proper remedy.\n Mandamus awarded; petition for prohibition dismissed.\n Mr. Justice Brewer concurred in the result. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] U.

WALLACE(1906)\nNo. 191\nArgued: Decided: April 2, 1906\n\n\n\n\n[201 U.S. 230, 231]\n\u00a0\n Prior to December 21, 1895, the American National Bank and the Union National Bank, hereinafter called respectively the American and Union bank, were each engaged in business in the city of Omaha, Nebraska. During that month the American bank was in such financial condition that it became necessary for it to provide for the payment of a large amount of deposits on or about January 1, 1896, and, though possessed of abundant nominal assets, did not have sufficient funds to make such payment. It knew that a neglect to pay would precipitate a run and bring on a failure of the bank. Thereupon, in order to obtain the money necessary therefor, its officers and leading stockholders entered into negotiations with the Union bank for the payment of its immediate obligations, and thus enabling it to secure an opportunity to realize upon its assets. As a result of such negotiations a contract was entered into by and between the two banks, through their boards of directors. By its terms the Union bank was to assume the payment of all the liabilities of the American bank, receiving therefor cash and such bills receivable as it was willing to accept at par and without recourse. The difference between the amounts so received and the liabilities assumed was to be represented by three non-negotiable promissory notes of the American bank, the payment of which was to be secured by a pledge of all its remaining assets to Thomas L. Kimball, as trustee. This contract was carried out. The Union bank moved into and took possession of the offices of the American bank. Upon adjustment, as above indicated, the difference was found to be $201,000, for which the American bank executed to the Union bank three non-negotiable promissory \n\n[201 U.S. 230, 232]\n\u00a0\n notes, each being for $67,000, and payable in one, two, and three years, respectively. In accordance with the contract the remaining assets of the American bank were placed in the hands of the trustee, Thomas L. Kimball, who proceeded to collect them and apply the proceeds on the notes until his death during the pendency of this suit. Subsequently a successor was appointed, who continued in performance of the trust until the entry of the decree. The execution of the contract of December 21, 1895, by the president and cashier of the American bank, was directed by resolution of its board of directors. On January 14, 1896, at an annual meeting of the shareholders of that bank, at which were represented 1,665 3\/4 shares out of a total of 2,000, a resolution was adopted instructing the directors to take action looking to the liquidation of the bank. On February 25, 1896, another meeting of the shareholders was held, at which 1,696 shares were represented, and a resolution for voluntary liquidation was adopted by an affirmative vote of 1,639 3\/4 shares. The Union bank fulfilled its obligations under the contract, having taken up all the liabilities assumed by it. The trustee meeting with little success in collection of the assets, this suit was, after the first note had matured, instituted in the circuit court of the United States for the district of Nebraska by Sumner Wallace, a citizen of New Hampshire, to whom the note had been transferred, against the Union bank, Thomas L. Kimball, the trustee, the American bank and its stockholders, including the appellants. By an amended bill the complainant sought, on behalf of himself and all other creditors of the American bank, the winding up of the affairs of that bank, the determination of the amount due upon his note, the ascertainment of all the creditors and the amounts of their claims, the subjection of the remaining assets to the payment of those claims, and the enforcement of the liability of the stockholders. He had not reduced the note to judgment prior to the commencement of this suit. Upon a final hearing a decree was entered ascertaining the amounts due the complainant and the Union bank \n\n[201 U.S. 230, 233]\n\u00a0\n (they being the only creditors) after the application of all credits, the number of shares of stock held by each shareholder of the American bank, and directing a recovery of $97.23 on account of each share of stock. This decree was affirmed by the United States circuit court of appeals for the eighth circuit (68 C. C. A. 40, 135 Fed. 286), from whose decision an appeal was taken to this court.\n Messrs. Westel W. Morsman and Howard B. Smith for appellants.\n\n\n[201 U.S. 230, 238]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. James M. Woolworth and R. S. Hall for appellees.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Brewer:\n\n\n[201 U.S. 230, 240]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n A matter of jurisdiction is first presented. The note, which is the foundation of plaintiff's suit, is one made by the American bank to the Union bank, both located in Nebraska, and, under the statute, for the purpose of jurisdiction, to be considered citizens of Nebraska. 25 Stat. at L. 436, chap. 866,  4 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 514). The plaintiff is a citizen of New Hampshire. He could not main- \n\n[201 U.S. 230, 241]\n\u00a0\n tain an action against the maker of the note, although a citizen of a state other than that of the maker and payee. 25 Stat. at L. 434, chap. 866,  1. But if diverse citizenship was the sole basis of the jurisdiction of the circuit court, the decision of the court of appeals would be final and there would be no appeal to this court. 26 Stat. at L. 828, chap. 517,  6 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 549). But the jurisdiction of the circuit court was not invoked on the ground of diverse citizenship,- at least, not on that alone. The case presented was one arising under the laws of the United States. It was a suit to enforce a special right given by those laws. Section 5220, Rev. Stat. (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3503), reads: 'Any [national banking] association may go into liquidation and be closed by the vote of its shareholders owning two thirds of its stock.'\n By  5151, Rev. Stat. (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3465), stockholders in national banks are made liable for 'all contracts, debts, and engagements of such association, to the extent of the amount of their stock therein, at the par value thereof, in addition to the amount invested in such shares.' Section 2 of the act of June 30, 1876 (19 Stat. at L. 63, chap. 156, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3509), is as follows:\n'Sec. 2. That when any national banking association shall have gone into liquidation under the provisions of section five thousand two hundred and twenty of said statutes, the individual liability of the shareholders provided for by section fifty-one hundred and fifty-one of said statutes may be enforced by any creditor of such association, by bill in equity in the nature of a creditor's bill, brought by such creditor on behalf of himself and of all other creditors of the association, against the shareholders thereof, in any court of the United States having original jurisdiction in equity for the district in which such association may have been located or established.'\n\n More than two thirds of the stock voted, on February 25, 1896, for a voluntary liquidation, and on April 27, 1896, the Comptroller of the Currency formally approved the liquidation and notified the cashier of the American bank to that effect.\n In proceeding, therefore, by this suit to enforce, in behalf \n\n[201 U.S. 230, 242]\n\u00a0\n of himself and all other creditors of the American bank, the extra liability imposed by Rev. Stat.  5151, a case was presented arising under the laws of the United States, and of which, independently of the matter of diverse citizenship, the circuit court had jurisdiction.\n The bill is not multifarious. 'The two subjects of applying the assets of the bank and enforcing the liability of the stockholders, however otherwise distinct, are by the statute made connected parts of the whole series of transactions which constitute the liquidation of the affairs of the bank.' Richmond v. Irons, \n121 \nU.S. 27, 50\n, 30 S. L. ed. 864, 871, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 788, 798.\n It is suggested that no judgment had been obtained upon the note prior to this suit in equity, but as one object of the suit was to subject to the satisfaction of the debt certain property conveyed to a trustee as security therefor, no judgment at law was a prerequisite. Day v. Washburn, 24 How. 352, 16 L. ed. 712; Case v. Beauregard (Case v. New Orleans & C. R. Co.) \n101 \nU.S. 688, 691\n, 25 S. L. ed. 1004, 1005, in which the court said:\n'Without pursuing this subject further, it may be said that whenever a creditor has a trust in his favor, or a lien upon property for the debt due him, he may go into equity without exhausting legal processes or remedies. Tappan v. Evans, 11 N. H. 311; Holt v. Bancroft, 30 Ala. 193.'\n\n We come, then, to the final question in the case, and that is whether the notes executed by the American bank were its valid obligations. And in reference to this question these are the significant facts: The demands against the American bank were pressing. It had not the money with which to meet them. It arranged with the Union bank to advance the money for the payment of all its outstanding obligations. When the Union bank paid these obligations of the American bank it was the same as though it advanced money to that bank to pay them. To reimburse and secure the former the latter bank turned over certain property, and executed these notes for the balance, securing them by a pledge of all its other assets, which were placed in the hands of its president, as trustee. \n\n[201 U.S. 230, 243]\n\u00a0\n All the stipulations and agreements made by the directors of the two banks were carried out in good faith; and, with full knowledge of what had been done, the stockholders voted for a voluntary liquidation. The borrowing of the money by the American bank did not necessarily put it into liquidation. It had a large amount of assets, and if the real had equaled the nominal value of these assets, it would have been enabled, after discharging its obligation to the Union bank, to continue business. But, on an examination, the stockholders felt that it was wiser to stop at once. But that decision did not at all impugn the wisdom or bona fides of the transaction by which the money was obtained to pay off the pressing demands of the American bank. The question, therefore, is, whether a national bank, finding itself embarrassed, with a large amount of assets, much in excess of its obligations, yet without the cash to make payment of those which are due and urgent, can borrow to meet those pressing demands. A very natural answer is, why not? It is not borrowing money to engage in a new business. It simply exchanges one creditor for others. There may be wisdom in consolidating all its debts into the hands of one person. At least such a consolidation cannot be pronounced beyond its powers. When time is obtained by the new indebtedness (in this case a year) it gives the borrowing bank and its officers and stockholders time to consider and determine the wisdom of attempting a further prosecution of business. In the case of an individual it would be a legitimate and often a wise transaction. It is not in terms prohibited by the national banking act. Aldrich v. Chemical Nat. Bank, \n176 U.S. 618\n, 44 L. ed. 611, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 498, is very clearly in point. The opinion in that case is quite lengthy and considers many authorities, but the gist of the decision is expressed in these words (p. 635, L. ed. p. 617, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 505):\n'Without further citation of cases we adjudge, both upon principle and authority, that as the money of the Chemical bank was obtained under a loan negotiated by the vice president of the Fidelity bank, who assumed to represent it in the transaction, and as the Fidelity bank used the money so obtained in \n\n[201 U.S. 230, 244]\n\u00a0\n its banking business and for its own benefit, the latter bank, having enjoyed the fruits of the transaction, cannot avoid accountability to the New York bank, even if it were true, as contended, that the Fidelity bank could not, consistently with the law of its creation, have itself borrowed the money.'\n\n We are of the opinion that the notes given by the American bank for the money advanced by the Union bank were its valid obligations, and can, therefore, be enforced against its stockholders.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","190":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nYORK MFG CO. v. CASSELL(1906)\nNo. 208\nArgued: March 14, 1906Decided: April 2, 1906\n\n\n\n\n[201 U.S. 344, 344]\n\u00a0\n The York Manufacturing Company has appealed from a judgment of the circuit court of appeals, which held that the company had no lien upon or right to remove certain machinery, as against creditors of the Mount Vernon Ice, Coal, & Milling Company, a bankrupt corporation. The facts upon which the question arises are as follows:\n The corporation above named was organized under the laws of the state of Ohio, and was doing business at Mount Vernon, in that state. The company desired to enlarge its plant for the purpose of making ice, and to that end it was necessary to secure the proper machinery. It therefore entered into a contract, which was concluded October 27, 1902, with the appellant, the York Manufacturing Company, to supply that machinery for the sum of $7,375, to be paid in instalments, as stated in the contract. The contract also contained a stipulation 'that the title to the ownership of the machinery, apparatus, or plant herein contracted for, shall remain in the York Manufacturing Company until the entire purchase price herein agreed to be paid . . . shall be actually paid in cash.' The vendor \n\n[201 U.S. 344, 345]\n\u00a0\n was given the right to enter the premises of vendee and remove the property in case of default. Twenty-five per cent only of the price of the machinery was ever paid. This contract was never filed, as required by the statute of Ohio relating to conditional sales. Section 4155, which is set forth in the margin. \n The corporation, being short of funds for the purpose of building, desired to obtain them by the execution of a mortgage on the lot on which the building was to be erected. One William Mild was the president of the corporation and was the owner of and had the legal title to the real estate upon which its plant was being constructed. Mild applied to Messrs. Waight & Ames to assist in raising money, by lending their credit as sureties on notes to be given for loans to the corporation up to the sum of $10,000, by such persons or banks as loans could be\n Section 4155, Revised Statutes of Ohio, provides as follows:\n'In all cases where any personal property shall be sold to any person, to be paid for in whole or in part in instalments, or shall be leased, rented, hired, or delivered to another on condition that the same shall belong to the person purchasing, leasing, renting, hiring, or receiving the same whenever the amount paid shall be a certain sum, or the value of such property, the title to the same to remain in the vendor, lessor, renter, hirer, or deliverer of the same, until such sum or the value of such property or any part thereof shall have been paid, such condition, in regard to the title so remaining until such payment, shall be void as to all subsequent purchasers and mortgagees in good faith, and creditors, unless such condition shall be evidenced by writing signed by the purchasers, lessor, renter, hirer, or receiver of the same, and also a statement thereon, under oath, made by the person so selling, leasing, or delivering any property as herein provided, his agent or attorney, of the amount of the claim, or a true copy thereof, with an affidavit that the same is a copy, deposited with the clerk of the township where the person signing the instrument resides at the time of the execution thereof, if a resident of the state, and if not such resident, then with the clerk of the township in which such property is sold, leased, rented, hired, or delivered is situated at the time of the execution of the instrument; but when the person executing the instrument is a resident of a township in which the office of county recorder is kept, or when be is a nonresident of the state, and the property is within such township, the instrument shall be filed with the county recorder; and the officer receiving any such instrument shall proceed with the same in all respects as he is required to do by  4152 of the Revised Statutes of Ohio, and shall receive the same fees as are allowed by law for similar services in other cases.' \n\n[201 U.S. 344, 346]\n\u00a0\n obtained from. Waight & Ames agreed to become such sureties, and the parties then entered into an agreement for that purpose, the particulars of which it is not necessary here to deal with.\n\n At the date of the Waight & Ames agreement,-November 1, 1902-no part of the machinery had come to the possession of the company, but it began to arrive in January, 1903, and was finally installed in the plant three or four months later.\n On the same date that the agreement was executed, a mortgage, without date, was also executed by William Mild, in whom the title was, to Waight & Ames, conditioned for their indemnification for becoming sureties, as contemplated by their agreement. This mortgage was not recorded until July 16, 1903, and on the next day the corporation made a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors. On July 22, 1903, a petition by creditors of the corporation was filed for an adjudication of bankruptcy against it, and on December 11, 1903, the adjudication was made.\n Soon after the adjudication the York Manufacturing Company filed an intervening petition, which set forth the contract under which they sold the machinery to the bankrupt, and alleged default in payment, and prayed that the company might be allowed to enter the premises and remove the machinery therefrom. This petition was resisted by the creditors.\n A short time thereafter Waight & Ames filed their intervening petition, setting up their mortgage, and alleging that they had no knowledge of the contract with the York Manufacturing Company at the time of taking their mortgage, and prayed that they might be given precedence over that company. It appears they did raise for Mild the sum of $10,000, by indorsing for him to that extent, and a portion of it they have since been compelled to pay, and they are liable for the balance.\n The referee in bankruptcy, before whom the question came, held that the mortgage of Waight & Ames was a valid lien on all the bankrupt's property, including the machinery furnished by the York Manufacturing Company, subject, however, to a \n\n[201 U.S. 344, 347]\n\u00a0\n purchase-money mortgage on the lot for $1,000. He also held that the York Manufacturing Company had no lien on the machinery, but was a general creditor only.\n The district court, on a petition for review, reversed this ruling, and held that the mortgage of Waight & Ames did not cover the machinery supplied by the York Manufacturing Company, but that the latter had no lien thereon as against general creditors; that the mortgage of Waight & Ames was a valid lien on the rest of the property, subject to the purchase- money mortgage on the lot; that they were not creditors of the bankrupt corporation, except as to the sum of $1,500 they had charged for becoming sureties under the contract above mentioned, but the court held that they might prove the debts of the creditors who held the notes on which they were sureties, if the creditors failed to do so, and that they might be subrogated to the rights of the creditors to the extent they had paid or might pay any balance due on said notes remaining after applying thereon the surplus of the proceeds of the sale of the real estate, after the purchasemoney mortgage had been paid, and that the entire $10,000 of the notes, which were mentioned in the contract between Waight & Ames and the company, and for which they were to be sureties, might be included in this right of subrogation. This, of course, did not include a note for $1,000, which had been paid five months before the proceedings in bankruptcy. The district court held that the mortgage of Waight & Ames was subordinate to the lien of the York Manufacturing Company, because no part of it had been placed on the ground of the bankrupt until two months after the making of the mortgage to Waight & Ames. The court, however, held that the general creditors were entitled to have the plant of the York Manufacturing Company sold for the payment of their claims because of the failure of that company to file the conditional sale contract, as required by the Ohio statute, and such failure rendered the contract void as to the creditors. Waight & Ames did not appeal from the district court's decree. \n\n[201 U.S. 344, 348]\n\u00a0\n The circuit court of appeals, upon appeal by the York Manufacturing Company, affirmed the district court (67 C. C. A. 526, 135 Fed. 52), and that company has appealed here.\n Messrs. Constant Southworth, John L. Lott, and Louis J. Dolle for appellant.\n\n\n[201 U.S. 344, 350]\n\u00a0\n No counsel for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice Peckham, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The question is simply whether the York Manufacturing Company has a right, under its conditional sale of the machinery to the bankrupt corporation, to take the machinery out of the premises where it was placed, as against all except judgment or other creditors by some specific lien. There are no judgment creditors in the case and no attachment has been levied, and the question is simply whether the adjudication in bankruptcy is equivalent to a judgment or an attach- \n\n[201 U.S. 344, 351]\n\u00a0\n ment on the property, so as to prevent the York Manufacturing Company from asserting its right to remove the machinery by virtue of the reservation of title contained in its contract.\n In Wilson v. Leslie, 20 Ohio, 161, the court was construing the language of the statute relating to chattel mortgages, which declared a mortgage absolutely void as against creditors of the mortgagor, and as against subsequent purchasers and mortgagees in good faith, unless the mortgage or a true copy thereof should be deposited forthwith, as directed in the act. The court held that the mortgage was not void for lack of filing, as between the parties thereto, but that the statute only avoided the instrument as to those creditors who, between the time of the execution of the mortgage and the filing thereof, had taken steps to 'fasten upon the property for the payment of their debts.' As against such as had in the interim secured liens by attachment, execution, or otherwise, the mortgage would be void. When filed with the recorder the instrument became valid as against all persons except those whose rights have attached upon the property before the recording of the instrument. See to the same effect Re Shirley, 50 C. C. A. 252, 112 Fed. 301.\n We have not been referred to any decision of the supreme court of Ohio as to the meaning of the statute requiring the filing of contracts of conditional sales, but we concur with the circuit court of appeals in this case, that the statute would render the unfiled contract void as to the same class of creditors mentioned in the chattel mortgage statute. Therefore the contract would be void as to creditors who, before its filing, had 'fastened upon the property' by some specific liens. As to creditors who had no such lien, being general creditors only, the statute does not avoid the sale, which is good between the parties to the contract.\n The mortgage of Waight & Ames cannot be a lien on the machinery sold by the York Manufacturing Company, because the mortgage was prior to the time when any portion of such machinery was placed upon the land. There was no clause in \n\n[201 U.S. 344, 352]\n\u00a0\n the mortgage covering after-acquired property, and, in any event, the mortgage would not cover property so acquired, the title to which, as in this case, was reserved to the vendor. This was the ruling of the district court, and no appeal was taken therefrom by the mortgagees. There are no creditors with any specific liens, nor is there any other mortgage, and there is no attachment.\n We come, then, to the question whether the adjudication in bankruptcy was equivalent to a judgment, attachment, or other specific lien upon the machinery. The circuit court of appeals has held herein that the seizure by the court of bankruptcy operated as an attachment and an injunction for the benefit of all persons having interests in the bankrupt's estate.\n We are of opinion that it did not operate as a lien upon the machinery as against the York Manufacturing Company, the vendor thereof. Under the provisions of the bankrupt act the trustee in bankruptcy is vested with no better right or title to the bankrupt's property than belonged to the bankrupt at the time when the trustee's title accrued. At that time the right, as between the bankrupt and the York Manufacturing Company, was in the latter company to take the machinery on account of default in the payment therefor. The trustee, under such circumstances, stands simply in the shoes of the bankrupt, and, as between them, he has no greater right than the bankrupt. This is held in Hewit v. Berlin Mach. Works, \n194 U.S. 296\n, 48 L. ed. 986, 24 Sup.Ct.Rep. 690. The same view was taken in Thompson v. Fairbanks, \n196 U.S. 516\n, 49 L. ed. 577, 25 Sup.Ct. Rep. 306. It was there stated that 'under the present bankrupt act, the trustee takes the property of the bankrupt, in cases unaffected by fraud, in the same plight and condition that the bankrupt himself held it, and subject to all the equities impressed upon it in the hands of the bankrupt.' See Yeatman v. New Orleans Sav. Inst. \n95 U.S. 764\n, 24 L. ed. 589; Stewart v. Platt, \n101 U.S. 731\n, 25 L. ed. 816; Hauselt v. Harrison, \n105 U.S. 401\n, 26 L. ed. 1075. The same doctrine was reaffirmed in Humphrey v. Tatman, \n198 U.S. 91\n, 49 L. ed. 956, 25 Sup.Ct.Rep. 567. The law of Ohio says the conditional sale contract was good between the parties, although not filed. In such a \n\n[201 U.S. 344, 353]\n\u00a0\n case the trustee in bankruptcy takes only the rights of the bankrupt, where there are no specific liens, as already stated.\n The remark made in Mueller v. Nugent, \n184 U.S. 1\n, 46 L. ed. 405, 22 Sup.Ct.Rep. 269, 'that the filing of the petition [in bankruptcy] is a caveat to all the world, and in effect an attachment and injunction,' was made in regard to the particular facts in that case. The case itself raised questions entirely foreign to the one herein arising, and did not involve any inquiry into the title of a trustee in bankruptcy as between himself and the bankrupt, under such facts as are above stated. The dispute in the Mueller Case was whether the court in bankruptcy had power to compel, in a summary way, the surrender of money or other property of the bankrupt, in the possession of the bankrupt, or of someone for him, without resorting to a suit for that purpose. This court held, as stated by the chief justice in delivering its opinion: 'The bankruptcy court would be helpless indeed if the bare refusal to turn over could conclusively operate to drive the trustee to an action to recover as for an indebtedness or a conversion, or to proceedings in chancery, at the risk of the accompaniments of delay, complication, and expense intended to be avoided by the simpler methods of the bankrupt law.' It was held that the trustee was not thus bound, but had the right, under the facts in that case, to proceed under the bankrupt law itself and take the property out of the hands of the bankrupt or anyone holding it for him.\n In this case, under the authorities already cited, the York Manufacturing Company had the right, as between itself and the trustee in bankruptcy, to take the property under the unfiled contract with the bankrupt, and the adjudication in bankruptcy did not operate as a lien upon this machinery in favor of the trustee as against the York Manufacturing Company.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and the case remanded to the District Court, with directions to enter a decree in conformity with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n"}}
