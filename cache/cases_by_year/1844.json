THOMPSON(1844)\nNo. 874\nArgued: Decided: January 1, 1844\n\n\n UPON a certificate of division from the judges of the Circuit Court for the southern district of Mississippi.\n This was a motion made by Thomas Griffin and Hugh Ervin to have satisfaction entered on an execution of fieri facias, which issued from the clerk's office of the court against them on the 4th day of June, 1840, in favor of Robert Thompson, for the sum of $1,740.02, with interest thereon at the rate of 8 per cent. per annum, from the 7th day of November, 1839, until paid, together with costs. And also to quash an execution of fieri facias which issued against them, \n\n[43 U.S. 244, 245]\n\u00a0\n in favor of said Thompson, on the same judgment, on the 6th day of November, 1841.\n In support of this motion, the plaintiffs below read in evidence first, an execution of fi. fa. numbered 874, which was sued out of the court against Griffin in favor of Thompson on the 1st day of January, 1840, returnable on the 1st Monday of May ensuing, for the sum of $1,740.02 and the costs, this being the amount of a judgment rdcovered in the court on the 7th day of November, 1839. Upon this execution was endorsed the return of the marshal, dated May the 4th, 1840, setting forth the levy of that process on the 25th of March, 1840, on certain subjects of property, the execution of a forthcoming bond by Griffin with Ervin as surety for the delivery of the property at the day and place of sale, and the forfeiture of the bond by the failure of the obligors to comply with its condition.

J. S. GOOCH.\n They then read in evidence to the court the following receipts which were proved to be signed by, and in the handwriting of, John F. Cook, who at the date of said receipts, and before, was a deputy of William M. Gwin, marshal of the southern district of Mississippi, which receipts are in the words and figures following, to wit.: Received of Thomas Griffin the sum of eight hundred dollars, to be applied to part payment of an execution obtained vs. him at the November term, 1839, of Circuit Court United States as security for I.

The said sums of $800 and $200, mentioned in said receipts, constituting the $100 in post-notes of the Mississippi Union Bank, returned by the marshal as received on 2d of January, 1840, on execution of fieri facias herein-before referred to, dated 1st January, 1840. They also read in evidence to the court the following additional receipts, to wit.: Thompson v. Griffin and Surety. Circuit Court U. S. fi. fa. to Nov. term, 1840. Received of Thomas Griffin in the above stated case, the sum of four hundred dollars in Louisiana money. November 3d, 1840. W. M. GWIN, Marshal, Per deputy, JNO. F. COOK. Received of Thomas Griffin the sum of five hundred dollars, \n\n[43 U.S. 244, 247]\n\u00a0\n to be applied to the payment of an execution, in the hands of the marshal, of Thompson v. Thomas Griffin and sureties.\n WM. M. GWIN, Marshal,\n By his deputy, JNO. F. COOK.\n November, 1840.\n The said Robert Thompson then, in opposition to said motion, read in evidence to the court, the judgment pronounced at its November term, 1841, quashing so much of the return of the marshal made on the execution of fieri facias numbered 874, which issued on the first day of January, 1840, as stated that he has 'received on said execution one thousand dollars in post notes of the Mississippi Union Bank,' which judgment is in the words and figures following, to wit.:\n'Robert Thompson \nv.\n Thomas Griffin.\n\n Motion by the plaintiff to quash that part of the marshal's return on fi. fa. No. 874, to May term, 1840, which is as follows: 'January 2d, 1840. Received on this execution one thousand dollars in post notes of the Mississippi Union Bank.'\n'Motion sustained and said marshal's return on said fi. fa. quashed, and an alias fi. fa. ordered to May term, 1842.'\n\n The said Thompson then introduced Joseph Holt as a witness, who being sworn, stated that he was one of the plaintiff's attorneys of record, who obtained the said judgment of $1,740.02 against said Thomas Griffin, at the November term, 1839, of the court; and that as the attorney of record of the said plaintiff, (Robert Thompson,) he had full authority to collect said judgment, and to control the executions which might issue thereon; that supposing the execution on said judgment when issued would come into the hands of the said 'Jno. F. Cook,' deputy marshal; he had a conversation with him a short time after the judgment was rendered, say some time in the month of November, 1839, in which he notified the said Cook distinctly, that good money would be required to be collected on said judgment, and that he must receive no other kind of money on the execution, when it should come into his hands. That he saw said Cook several times during the ensuing winter, but that he (Cook) never mentioned to him that he had made any collection on said judgment. That the first knowledge or intimation witness had of the receipt of the $1,000 in post-notes of the Mississippi Union Bank, \n\n[43 U.S. 244, 248]\n\u00a0\n mentioned in the return of the said Cook on the execution as collected 2d January, 1840, was in the month of May, 1840, when going into the marshal's office at Jackson, Mississippi, he found the said execution had just been returned, with the receipt of the $1,000, in post-notes of the Mississippi Union Bank, endorsed thereon as aforesaid.\n Witness at once refused to receive said post-notes from the marshal in part satisfaction of said execution, and has ever since refused, and still refuses to receive them. Witness further stated, that at the time referred to, (May, 1840,) said post-notes had greatly depreciated in value, and were not worth more than fifty cents to the dollar, and that on the 17th of February, 1840, said post-notes were worth but seventy-five cents to the dollar. That he immediately entered a motion to quash said return of the said deputy marshal, (Cook,) which motion was sustained by the court at its November term, 1841. Witness further stated that in a conversation he had held with said Thomas Griffin, he (Griffin) had stated that the $800 mentioned in said receipt, dated 10th December, 1839, and the $200 mentioned in said receipt, dated 17th February, 1840, constituting together the $1,000 returned as made on 2d January, 1840, in 'post-notes of the Mississippi Union Bank,' were paid by him to said John F. Cook, deputy marshal as aforesaid, at times mentioned in the said receipts respectively, in post-notes of the said Mississippi Union Bank. It was also in proof that, on the 10th day of December, 1839, the post- notes of the Mississippi Union Bank were current in the state of Mississippi, and were generally received by the sheriffs and marshal unless instructions to the contrary were given by plaintiffs or their attorneys. It was also admitted that Griffin had no actual notice of the instructions given by the plaintiff's attorney in this case to said John F. Cook, deputy marshal. This was all the evidence offered either in support or in opposition to the plaintiff's motion. Whereupon on the question whether satisfaction should be entered on said execution of fieri facias, which was sued out on the 4th of June, 1840, in favor of said Robert Thompson v. Thomas Griffin and Hugh Ervin for the sum of $1,740.02 with interest and costs as aforesaid; and also on the question whether said execution of fieri facias which was sued out against the said Griffin and Ervin on the 6th of November, 1841, should be quashed, the judges were opposed in opinion, and the questions were ordered to be certified to this court for decision.\n The cause was argued by Henderson for Griffin, the defendant in \n\n[43 U.S. 244, 249]\n\u00a0\n the original suit below, who had made the motion to have satisfaction entered on the judgment and to quash the second fieri facias; and by Harrison and Holt for Thompson, the plaintiff below.\n Henderson, for plaintiffs.\n This was a motion in the court below to have satisfaction entered on a certain execution against the plaintiffs, in the motion which issued against them on 4th June, 1840; and to have a subsequent execution quashed, which was issued on the same judgment, 6th November, 1841, and after said judgment was wholly satisfied, as the plaintiffs in the motion allege.\n The first execution issued first January, 1840, for $1,740.02, returnable to May term, 1840, which the marshal returned bonded, and with a credit in these words:\n'January 2, 1840. Received on this execution one thousand dollars in post-notes of the Mississippi Union Bank.'\n\n After the return, viz., 4th June, 1840, the plaintiff sued out another execution, on which is endorsed by the clerk:\n'This execution is entitled to a credit of one thousand dollars, paid 2d Jan'y, 1840, in Union post-notes.'\n\n This execution, returned to November term, 1840, bears the marshal's endorsement, as follows:\n'Made on this case four hundred dollars, Nov. 3, 1840. Rec'd balance of this case in full, for costs &c., say five hundred and fifteen 30\/100 dollars. Nov. 3, 1840.'\n\n On 6th November, 1841, notwithstanding the previous satisfaction, so made and returned, another execution issued, credited only by $803.47, paid 3d November, 1840.\n This constitutes the plaintiff's case in the motion, though some receipts and statements of account were presented, substantially in accordance with the foregoing returns of the marshal.\n The defendant in the motion then exhibited a judgment of November term, 1841, of the court below, quashing so much of the marshal's return on the first execution, as denoted the receipt of $1,000 Union post-notes, on 2d January, 1840, which judgment was entered, on the now defendant's motion, with the court's order for the execution, which subsequently issued, of 6th November, 1841.\n The attorney of the plaintiff in the execution (the defendant in \n\n[43 U.S. 244, 250]\n\u00a0\n this motion) testified, that in November, 1839, he informed Cook, deputy marshal, that 'good money' would be required. That he knew nothing of the collection of the Union Bank notes till in May, 1840, and he then refused to receive them. That in May, 1840, these notes were down to fifty cents in the dollar, and on 17th February, 1840, they were worth but seventy-five cents to the dollar. Record states it was in proof these notes were current 10th Dec., 1839, and that the defendants in the execution (plaintiffs in this motion) knew nothing of plaintiff's instruction to Cook, the deputy marshal. On the case so presented, the court below divided in opinion, whether or not the execution of June 4, 1840, should be discharged as against the defendants therein; and that issued against them of November 6, 1841, quashed. The sole question presented by the record is, Does the record in its proofs show the defendants, in the executions which issued on January 1, 1840, and June 4, 1840, lawfully paid and discharged them? For if so, the motion in the court below should be sustained. The record presents no case of the marshal assuming to settle a plaintiff's debt, without a writ authorizing him. No case of a false return of the execution. No case of a sheriff's assuming to discharge an execution by an offset of his own debt to the defendant in execution. No case of taking promissory notes in discharge of an execution. No case, in our opinion, of the sheriff having seized, or received any thing, in satisfaction of the execution, which the law did not authorize him, in his discretion, to receive in discharge of the writ. We make no question against the adjudged cases upon such and similar facts. Nor shall we contend, if this motion was against the marshal to pay the plaintiff in execution in lawful coin, he could resist the motion, by showing he had received, in satisfaction of the execution of the defendant, copper coin, or unlegalized foreign coin, or bullion, or Treasury notes of the United States, or bank-notes of the states. But the first question is, Are not state bank-notes a good tender, if not objected to? All our state courts uniformly decide they are, and so decided this court in 10 Wheat. 347; and Gwin v. Breedlove, decided at this term. And bank-notes certainly constitute good and lawful payment, if \n\n[43 U.S. 244, 251]\n\u00a0\n received; and the effect of such payment cannot, for cause of depreciation of the notes before redeemed, or the like, be avoided, and the original demand resorted to; as if promissory notes only had been received. All our state courts decide this principle continually, and so in England. Burr., 457.\n These principles of tender and payment in bank-notes, as between debtor and creditor, have never been questioned. Copper coin, Treasury notes, and bank-notes, are the greater part of our currency; and as all society use them as currency, as the law recognises and legalizes their circulation, debtors may lawfully tender them in payment, and creditors may lawfully receive them, though not legally bound to do so.\n The marshal is the plaintiff's agent, who, by his execution, may receive payment of the plaintiff's debt. He who may lawfully receive payment, may have lawful tender of payment made to him. What sophistry can plausibly maintain, that a tender of bank-notes to the principal, and not objected to, is a good tender; or payment in such notes to the principal is a good payment; and yet the like tender, and like payment, is not equally good when made to the agent?\n But it is said in this case, the principal forbade the marshal to receive bank-notes. Admit the fact thus; it is also admitted in the record, the defendant in execution, who tendered and paid his bank-notes to the marshal, was ignorant of plaintiff's instruction; and we maintain this fact can only avail the plaintiff in execution as between himself and the marshal, who may have disregarded his instruction. See decision, Gwin v. Breedlove.\n But the marshal's return of satisfaction of the execution in bank- notes, in no state of case, as against the debtor in execution, can be treated as a nullity; and so I understand the intimation of the court in the case of Gwin v. Breedlove.\n But the proof in this case is not, as in the case of Gwin v. Breedlove, that specie would be required of the officer; on the contrary, the inference is irresistibly otherwise. The testimony of plaintiff's attorney for the execution is, that in November, 1839, he told Cook, the deputy, that 'good money would be required.' And it is in proof also, that this bank paper was current-was 'good'-as late as 10th December, 1840, and no proof it was depreciated before 17th February, 1840, being one and a half months after its payment; while the historical fact is, the bank did not suspend \n\n[43 U.S. 244, 252]\n\u00a0\n specie payments till 22d March, 1840. The payment of these notes on execution was 2d January, 1840.\n It is in proof, too, that much of the remaining amount due by this execution was paid in bank-notes of the state of Louisiana.\n Why then has not the plaintiff in execution sought to have execution for the whole amount of the judgment? Why, but that he has regarded the Louisiana bank-notes 'good money' within the meaning of his instructions.\n We contend, too, the plaintiff adopted this payment of $1,000 on the first execution of 1st January, 1840, by issuing his 2d execution, of 4th June, 1840, with a credit endorsed of the $1,000 previously paid. The attorney proves he knew the payment of this $1,000 in May, 1840; and in June following he issued his second execution, adopting the payment by way of credit.\n This was after he had told the sheriff he would not receive it, and the legal presumption must be, he had changed his purpose, and that the clerk but obeyed his instructions in proceeding to collect the remainder by a further execution.\n This court, as matter of evidence, are bound to regard this act as prima facie the act of the party, and a subsequent ratification of the previous payment. In conformity with this legal aspect of the proof, the balance due is returned, fully satisfied on the 2d execution, 3d November, 1840. One year afterwards, November term, 1841, a motion was made and sustained, not against the marshal, but ex parte against Griffin, to eradicate and annul to his prejudice a payment made by him twenty-two months before on executions returned finally satisfied one year before. Griffin is not shown to have had any notice of that motion, and is first admonished in April, 1842, by another execution, that his payments were unsatisfactory to the plaintiff. If then the rule of law was, as the plaintiff in execution insists, viz.: that a defendant in execution can make no safe payment of the execution to the sheriff in bank-notes, though the sheriff be content to receive them, unless the plaintiff shall approve such payment as a discharge of the defendant; yet the rigor of such a rule should, in common and equal justice, require the plaintiff to notify his objection to the defendant, so soon at least as the return of the execution shall advise the plaintiff of the manner of its payment. Here the plaintiff slept upon his collection of the defendant, implying his approval (if such approval as to the defendant be necessary), without notice to the defendant, of any exception for nearly two years after execution, \n\n[43 U.S. 244, 253]\n\u00a0\n evidencing the objectionable payment was returned; and the plaintiff admits he knew the fact. Must defendants in execution, though not required by the sheriff, always pay in specie, or be subject to traps of this sort for ever after, or how long after?\n We consider this case is not governed in any degree by the process act of Congress, of May 19, 1828. The motion in this case now pending, and the motion and judgment therein rendered in the court below, to quash the marshal's return on the execution of January 1st, 1840, are predicated on no statute, of Mississippi, nor in conformity to any established rule of proceedings, or of decisions. They are motions of first impression pursued upon general common law principles. In this view of the subject, I notice the case in 5 How. (Miss.), 624. The facts in that case present no proper analogy to this. There the sheriff was also the defendant. Hence, beside other inconsistencies of his case, he could not avail himself of our position that, as defendant, he paid the sheriff, ignorant that the plaintiff entertained objections to the currency in which payment was made. He, in fact, could not pay himself. It is only by this explanation of the case that the decision can be sustained. The language of the court, then, that 'the return was not a legal return, and the plaintiff was not bound by it, unless he had agreed to receive such money or notes in payment,' is language only properly predicable of a controversy between the plaintiff and the sheriff, or as in that case against the defendant too, he being the sheriff.\n This court, in the case of Gwin v. Breedlove, in referring to the above case in 5 How. (Miss.), are not understood to mean more by the reference than to show the case not then applicable as a precedent; while it is submitted, as a fair conclusion, whether the principles adopted in the case of Gwin v. Breedlove do not go to show, this court would not extend the decision of that case beyond its peculiar facts.\n This court, in Gwin v. Breedlove, again declare, as in 10 Wheat., that payment in bank-notes is good, unless objected to. And they apply the declaration of this rule in a case where payment was to the marshal in bank-notes, on execution, where it was in proof that, as between the marshal and plaintiff in execution, he had been forbidden to receive bank- notes; and the integrity of the rule must come to this, or it is no rule as to payments made on execution.\n Such payment, received without objection by the sheriff (who undoubtedly has the right to receive payment), must have some recognition \n\n[43 U.S. 244, 254]\n\u00a0\n in law, or it is a nullity. And if such payment is a nullity, it is so, whatever the form of return. A payment, therefore, of an execution in bank- notes, with a return 'satisfied,' will, of course, not prevent the plaintiff from pursuing the defendant with further executions, if he can show that such payment was made in bank-notes; for such payment, if good at all, is good for itself, and not made good or bad according as the sheriff may report the facts in his return. If it can ever be good, it is only so because it is a discharge lawfully made of the defendant's debt.\n The reasoning of the court in Gwin v. Breedlove, we think, shows that such payment is a good and valid payment, and discharges the debtor in execution, if received without objection by the sheriff; and that such payment, though not binding the plaintiff in his demand against the sheriff, does bar him from further process against the defendant.\n The rule of law is, that whatever the sheriff may lawfully take in discharge of an execution, must bar the plaintiff from further execution v. the defendant, though plaintiff get nothing from the sheriff. 12 T. R., 207; 4 Mass., 403; 7 T. R., 428; 2 Ld. Raym., 1072.\n When a sheriff seizes goods to satisfy an execution, he cannot compel the plaintiff to receive the goods or property in kind (except in cases of extent); and though he waste the goods, the defendant is discharged. Either plaintiff or defendant in execution may controvert, with the sheriff, the truth of his return.\n The sheriff is estopped by his own return. The sheriff cannot be heard to testify in disproof of his own return. 3 How. (Miss.), 68.\n And, quoere-Is not the rule universal, that the plaintiff, as to the defendant in execution, is bound and precluded by sheriff's return?\n Now, it is in proof, by return on the second execution, of 4th June, 1840, that the marshal received $515.30, as balance in full of debt and cost. Whilst this remains true and uncontradicted, what pretext has the plaintiff for further execution against the defendant? If the balance of the case, in full, for costs and all, have been received by the marshal on the execution, what right has the plaintiff further against the defendant?\n And this execution and its return have not been complained of, have not been quashed, or in any way set aside. If it stands, therefore, for any evidence, it is evidence, full and complete, to discharge the defendant, as sought for by his motion in this case. \n\n[43 U.S. 244, 255]\n\u00a0\n Harrison and Holt, for Thompson.\n The motion in this case was on behalf of defendant and sureties, to have satisfaction entered on the judgment, and the last execution of fi. fa. which issued, quashed. The plaintiff resists the motion on several grounds. As to the $800 for which a receipt of the deputy marshal (Cook) was produced, dated in November or early in December, 1839, it is insisted that this sum cannot be taken in part discharge of the execution, because it was collected before the execution issued, and of course without warrant of law. The officer derived his power solely from the process, and acting before its existence, his act was unofficial, could not be obligatory on the principal marshal and sureties, or on the plaintiff. The following authorities are full to the point that money collected by an officer after the return day of an execution is no satisfaction of it. 4 Rand. (Va.), 336; 1 Bibb (Ky.), 608; 5 Lit. (Ky.), 19; 2 J. J. Marsh. (Ky .), 29, 30; 5 How. (Miss.), 246. So in 3 Stew. & P. (Ala.), 385-388, it was held that the receipt of money by an officer before an execution issued, was no satisfaction of the fi. fa. which afterwards came into his hands.\n But it is further urged that neither the $800 received in 1839, nor the $200 received in February, 1840, can be taken in part payment of the execution, because these sums were collected, not in money, but in depreciated post-notes of the Mississippi Union Bank, not only without the assent of the plaintiff, but in direct violation of the instructions of his attorneys.\n The command of the process to the officer, was that he should cause to be made so many dollars, which in legal estimation are gold or silver dollars-the constitutional coin of the United States. The special authority thus given, being matter of law, of which all concerned were bound to take notice, could not be departed from to plaintiff's prejudice, without his assent express or implied-neither of which is shown or alleged. This question has been settled repeatedly, by tribunals of the highest respectability. 4 How. (Miss.), 404; 5 Id., 246, 621-624; 9 Johns. (N. Y.), 261, 262; 1 Cow. (N. Y.), 46; 4 Id., 553; 2 J. J. Marsh. (Ky.), 70, 71; 2 N. C., 529; Dud. (N. C.), 356; Mart. (La.) N. S., 205.\n Inasmuch as the execution process, and the forms of returns upon it as existing in Mississippi are the creatures of the local laws of that state, it is believed that the decisions of her Supreme Court cited, should be conclusive of the questions involved. \n\n[43 U.S. 244, 256]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice DANIEL delivered the opinion of the court.\n This court is unable to perceive upon what principle of law either of the objects sought by the motion of the plaintiffs in the Circuit Court could have been accorded to them. It cannot be questioned that the defendant in that motion was entitled to the full benefit and operation of his execution, and these were to cause to be made for him of the goods and chattels, lands and tenements, of his debtor, the sum of $1740.02 of lawful money of the United States. With his claim thus solemnly ascertained of record, we are aware of no authority, from any source, which can compel him to commute it, or to receive in satisfaction thereof any other thing which he shall not voluntarily elect. But least of all should such an authority be recognized in a quarter more fruitful than any other of abuses in its exercise; for instance, from the will either of the debtor, or the officer whose position would enable him in some degree to practice on both creditor and debtor. To permit either the debtor or the officer to impose upon the creditor the receipt of depreciated paper in payment, would be to permit not merely a repeal of the judgment, but a violation, a virtual abrogation indeed, of the contract on which it was founded;2 for none can fail to perceive the thousand fraudulent devices for profit or favor which the toleration of such a practice would naturally call into action to defeat the rights of creditors. The courts of justice might thus be made to subserve only the purposes of dishonesty, and be transformed into engines of monstrous wrong. It has been argued in support of this motion, that bank-notes constitute good and lawful payment if received; that as the law recognizes their circulation, debtors may lawfully tender them in payment, and creditors, may lawfully receive them though not legally bound to do so. From these postulates it is then attempted to draw the following conclusions: 1. That the marshal is the plaintiff's agent, who by the execution may receive the plaintiff's debt. 2. That he who may lawfully receive payment, may have a lawful tender of payment made to him. 3. That if a tender or payment of bank-notes to the principal, not by him objected to, is a good tender or payment, the like tender or payment to the agent is equally good. This argument, to say the least of it, is wholly untenable. 'Tis undoubtedly true that the creditor may receive either bank-notes or blank paper in satisfaction of his debt, for the reason that his power over that debt is supreme, and he may release it without payment of any kind, if he think proper. But the fallacy of the argument here \n\n[43 U.S. 244, 257]\n\u00a0\n consists in totally misconceiving the situation and functions of the marshal. He is properly the officer of the law rather than the agent of the parties, and is bound to fulfil the behests of the law; and this too without special instruction or admonition from any person. If, then, when commanded to levy a sum of money, he make a return that he has not done this, but has of his own mere will substituted for money depreciated bank- notes, his return is an admission, on oath, that he has both disobeyed his orders and transcended his powers, for legally he has no powers save those he derives from the precept he is ordered to obey. Can it be doubted that upon application from those whose interests are involved in the performance of his duties by the marshal, it is the right and the duty of the court in such a case to correct the irregularities of its officer, and to compel him to perform his duty? There is inherent in every court a power to supervise the conduct of its officers, and the execution of its judgments and process. Without this power, courts would be wholly impotent and useless. The returns of the marshal in this case upon the final process in his hands, showing the receipt by him of depreciated bank-paper in satisfaction of that process which ordered him to collect money, are held to be departures from the performance of his duty as plainly enjoined by the process itself, are deemed therefore illegal and void, and ought, upon the application of the party injured thereby, to have been set aside and annulled by the court. In conformity with the principles herein sanctioned, we therefore order it to be certified to the judges of the Circuit Court for the southern district of Mississippi, that satisfaction should not be entered on the execution of fieri facias which was sued out in this case on the 4th of June, 1840, in favor of the said Robert Thompson v. the said Thomas Griffin and Hugh Ervin, for the sum of $1740. 02 with interest and costs; and farther, that the execution of fi. fa., which was sued out against the said Thomas Griffin and Hugh Ervin on the sixth day of November, 1841, should not be quashed; and that the motion of the plaintiff in the Circuit Court should be overruled.\n\n\n ORDER.\n\n This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern District of Mississippi, and on the points and questions on which the judges of the said Circuit Court were opposed in opinion, and which were certified to this court for its opinion agreeably to the act of Congress \n\n[43 U.S. 244, 258]\n\u00a0\n in such case made and provided, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, It is the opinion of this court, that satisfaction should not be entered on the execution of fieri facias, which was sued out in this case on the 4th of June, 1840, in favor of the said Robert Thompson against the said Thomas Griffin and Hugh Ervin for the sum of $ 1740.02, with interest and costs: and farther, that the execution of fi. fa., which was sued out against the said Thomas Griffin and Hugh Ervin on the 6th day of November, 1841, should not be quashed: and that the motion of the plaintiff in the Circuit Court should be overruled. Whereupon it is now here ordered and adjudged that it be so certified to the said Circuit Court. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] QUOTED. Boyd v. Olvey, 82 Ind., 300. \n\n\n\n\n","1":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGWIN v. BREEDLOVE(1844)\n\nArgued: Decided: January 1, 1844\n\n\n THIS case was brought up by writ of error, from the Circuit Court of the United States for the southern district of Mississippi, and arose upon the following statement of facts:\n At some period prior to the 13th day of February, 1839, James W. Breedlove, the defendant in error, had recovered a judgment in the Circuit Court of the United States for the southern district of Mississippi, against certain persons there, for the sum of $12,976, with interest at the rate of 8 per cent. per annum, from the 24th of May, 1838, until paid; and on the said 13th of February, an execution was issued upon the judgment, and placed in the hands of Gwin, the marshal. The sum of $5000 was collected in unexceptionable \n\n[43 U.S. 29, 30]\n\u00a0\n money, and paid over to plaintiff; the balance was received in notes of the Commercial Bank of Vicksburg, and Planter's Bank of Mississippi, which the plaintiff refused to receive.\n At the November term, 1839, of the Circuit Court of the United States, Breedlove moved for a judgment against Gwin, the marshal, for the sum of $ 7976, being the balance due to the plaintiff on the execution. This motion was made under a statute passed by the legislature of Mississippi on the 15th day of February, 1828, which had been adopted in the practice of the Circuit Court by a rule of that court. The statute provided, (Howard and Hutchinson, 296,) that if the sheriff should fail to pay, on demand by the plaintiff, money collected by execution, such sheriff and his sureties should be liable to pay to the plaintiff the whole amount of money so collected, together with 25 per cent. damages thereon, with interest at the rate of 8 per cent. per annum, to be recovered by motion before the court to which such execution is made returnable. The statute further provided for a jury, if the sheriff should deny that the money was collected by him. In case the sheriff failed to return as execution on the return day thereof (Howard and Hutchinson, 298,) the plaintiff was allowed to recover judgment against the sheriff and his sureties, with 5 per cent. damages, by motion before the court. It was also declared to be a misdemeanor for the sheriff to refuse to pay over money which he had collected, and punishable on conviction, by removal from office. How. and Hut., 299.\n The reasons filed in support of the motion were, that the marshal had made the money and failed, or refused, to pay it over to the plaintiff.\n Gwin demurred to the motion; but the demurrer being overruled, he filed four pleas. In the first two, he denied having received money. In the last two, he alleged that he had collected and received notes of the Planter's Bank of the State of Mississippi, and of the Commercial and Rail Road Bank of Vicksburg, due and payable on demand, when said banks were paying gold and silver on all their notes payable on demand; which notes, so collected and received, were collected and received without any instructions from the plaintiff or his attorney that gold or silver would be required, and at a time when the bank-notes received were the current circulating medium; and the same were tendered to the attorney of the plaintiff, before the suspension of specie payments by any or either of said banks-all of which said bank-notes said defendant had always been ready and \n\n[43 U.S. 29, 31]\n\u00a0\n willing, and was then ready and willing, to pay over to the plaintiff or his attorney.\n The plaintiff joined issue upon the first two pleas, and replied, specially, to the last two, that the defendant was, previous to the reception of the notes, instructed, that gold or silver would be required of him. Issue was joined upon the last two replications.\n Evidence was offered at the trial, that the attorney of the plaintiff, Breedlove, told the marshal frequently, before the money was collected, that specie would be required; that he had demanded the money of the marshal, who refused to pay him; that the marshal never tendered him any bank-notes, and that the notes of those banks, before their suspension, were received in the community everywhere as specie, and by the sheriffs and officers in collection of executions.\n The execution was issued on the 13th of February, and the banks suspended specie payments on the 15th or 22d of March, 1839.\n The counsel for the defendant prayed the court to instruct the jury as follows:\n\n 1. \nThat if the jury believe from the evidence that bills of exchange and bank-notes were received by the marshal, and not gold or silver, then the jury will find the issues on the first and second pleas in favor of the defendant.\n\n 2. \nIf the jury believe that the instructions given to the marshal were intended to authorize the marshal to collect gold or silver, or its equivalent, and he collected bank-notes which were equivalent to gold or silver, then they should find the issue for the defendant.\n\n 3. \nAnd that if they find that the marshal received banknotes or bills of exchange and not money is specie, which the plaintiff refused to receive as money, then they must find the issues for the defendant, as the issue is, whether he received and collected money or not.\n The first and third of which charges, the court refused to give, but gave the second charge to the jury; to which refusal to give the first and third charges, the defendant excepted.\n The jury found for the plaintiff. Walker, for Gwin, the plaintiff in error. C. Cox, for the defendant. Walker made the following points: 1. That the statute of Mississippi had not been strictly pursued. 2. That it did not apply to marshals of the United States. \n\n[43 U.S. 29, 32]\n\u00a0\n 3. That there is a want of jurisdiction, inasmuch as the record does not show, in any part of it, that Breedlove was not a citizen of Mississippi.\n\n 1. \nThe statute is highly penal in its character; and, therefore, like all other penal statutes, must be construed strictly. It provides (Howard and Hutchinson, 296,) two remedies against sheriffs; one for not paying over the money which they may have collected, and the other for neglecting to levy the execution. The motion below was under the first head, which was an erroneous proceeding, because bank-notes are not money. The return states the collection to have been in bank-notes; but, if they had been notes of a mercantile firm, it would clearly not have been money. The one is no more money than the other. The statute is so highly penal that a refusal on the part of the sheriff to pay, is declared to be a misdemeanor , (page 299,) and punished by removal from office.\n The agreement of the sheriff, to receive any thing but money, does not bind the plaintiff. 5 How., 246. Where the sheriff returned that he had received bank bills, it was not considered a legal return or binding on the plaintiff, and a new execution was awarded. 5 How., 621. A sheriff cannot take a negotiable note and return the execution satisfied. 1 Cow. ( N. Y.), 46. The payment must be in cash. 9 Johns. (N. Y.), 263. There being no money received, the remedy pursued ought to have been for omitting to collect the money. How. and Hut., page 642, sec. 42.\n\n 2. \nThe statute does not apply to marshals. It was passed on 16th February, 1828. The process act of Congress was passed on 19th May, 1828; but no rule of court has ever adopted the state law. How came marshals, then, to be under the state law? Their duties are pointed out by acts of Congress, (Gordon's Digest Laws of the United States, articles 610, 611,) and a party injured may sue on their bond and recover damages legally assessed. But the sheriffs, under the state law, are subject also to a penalty of 25 per cent. in addition: Can the marshals be legislated by a state into this responsibility? The sheriffs are also to be removed from office: Can a state law require the President of the United States to remove a marshal? If not, where can the line be drawn?\n The words in the act of Congress of 1828 are borrowed from the act of 1792, and direct that the process at common law used in state courts should be adopted in the courts of the United States. But the process in the original suit below had been exhausted. The \n\n[43 U.S. 29, 33]\n\u00a0\n motion against the marshal was a new proceeding, and not a part of the process of the other case.\n 10 Wheat., 1, 32; 6 Pet., 658; 7 Cranch, 654; 1 How., 300.\n 2 Dall., 396,\n 5 Mason, 26,\n 12 Pet., 300, that attachment laws of states are not included in the process act.\n The courts of the United States do not adopt state, criminal, or penal laws; 17 Johns. (N. Y.), 1, 4.\n\n 3. \nBreedlove is not shown in the record to have been a citizen of another state. This court has decided that, as the courts of the United States are of limited jurisdiction, it must appear on the face of the record. 10 Wheat., 192; 2 Cranch, 9; 2 Baldw., 275; 13 Pet., 45; 4 Wash. C. C., 32.\n C. Cox, for defendant, argued:\n\n 1. \nThat it was no ground of exception to defendant's motion; that it does not show him to be a citizen of a state other than Mississippi; in all other respects it is formal. 2. The plaintiff was accountable on his return, and on the facts established by the verdict, for the amount of $7,000 in money. 3. The statute of Mississippi is applicable to the present case. 1. The question of jurisdiction was settled by the original judgment; and a ministerial officer of the court cannot be permitted to raise the objection. After an appearance, the objection cannot be made. 3 Pet., 459; 5 How., 432; 9 Pet., 156. 2. Issue was joined below upon the question whether the marshal received notice that coin would be required, and decided against him. The plaintiff below was, therefore, entitled to consider the marshal's return as of money. A tender of bank-notes is good, unless objected to. 10 Wheat., 333. 3. The act of Congress of 1828 was subsequent to the statute of Mississippi. Process means the proceedings until the end of the suit, the possession of the fruits of the judgment. 10 Wheat., 1, 51.\n The statute of Mississippi was adopted by rule of court.\n The bond of the marshal is a cumulative remedy. All courts have authority over their officers, and the remedy for injury is by motion. There is nothing unusual in the proceeding. All amercements are penal. In 9 Pet., 156, a judgment was entered on motion and refused to be re-opened. \n\n[43 U.S. 29, 34]\n\u00a0\n Walker, in reply.\n If the return of the marshal was that the execution was satisfied, was it not an end of that suit?\n No matter who makes the question of jurisdiction, the court will always notice it. The original judgment does not settlet, because the proceedings there do not make the necessary averment.\n The case in 9 Peters does not apply: there is no case where the penal laws of a state have been applied to marshals.\n\n Mr. Justice CATRON delivered the opinion of the court.\n The writ of error in this case is prosecuted by the former marshal to reverse a judgment recovered against him by motion in the Circuit Court of the United States for the district of Mississippi. The proceeding in this form is founded on a law of that state governing sheriffs, as will be seen by the statement of the reporter.\n The first objection raised on behalf of the plaintiff in error is, that it does not appear on the record, that Breedlove was a citizen of a different state from the defendant; and therefore it is insisted the court below had no jurisdiction as between the parties. As this does not appear, in an ordinary case jurisdiction would be wanting. On the other hand, it is contended that the motion against the ministerial officer of the court for not performing his duty, was an incident, and part of, the proceeding in the suit of Breedlove against Marsh and others, in which the execution issued; and that no question of jurisdiction can be raised.\n The motion for a judgment being a proceeding according to the statute of Mississippi, it is also objected that Congress by the act of 1806 (ch. 31,) had provided a complete and exclusive remedy on marshal's bonds by suit; but if it was otherwise, still, the additional remedy furnished by the state law when substituted, must be treated as an independent suit, in like manner as an action on the marshal's bond, and the residence of the parties be such as to give the federal court jurisdiction.\n These propositions are so intimately blended that it is most convenient to consider them together.\n We think it true beyond doubt, that if the bond had been proceeded on against the marshal and his sureties, it could not have been done by motion, according to the state practice prescribed by the statute of Mississippi; but the proceeding must have been according \n\n[43 U.S. 29, 35]\n\u00a0\n to the act of Congress. Yet before the act of 1806 was passed, and ever since, the common law remedy by attachment has been the most usual to coerce the marshal to perform his various duties; and among others, to bring into court moneys collected on executions. So in the state courts, nothing is more common than to proceed by attachment against the sheriff, instead of resorting to a summary motion, for judgment against him by force of a statute, where he withholds moneys collected. The marshal's bond is for twenty thousand dollars; the sureties are bound to this amount only; and if no other remedy existed save on the bond, after the penalty was exhausted, he might set the court at defiance; the marshal could also be sued in assumpsit, by the plaintiff in the execution. It has therefore never been true, that a suit on his bond, governed by the acts of Congress, furnished the exclusive remedy as against the marshal himself; and we think that Congress intended by the new process act of 1828, to add the cumulative remedies, then existing by statute, in the new states, where they could be made to apply, because they were more familiar to the courts and country, and better adapted to the certain and speedy administration of justice. In our opinion, the act of Mississippi authorizing a judgment by motion, against a sheriff for failing to pay over moneys collected on execution, to the party on demand, or into court at the return day, was adopted by the act of 1828, and does apply in a case like the present, as a mode of proceeding in the courts of the United States, held in the district of Mississippi; and could be enforced against the marshal in like manner it could be against a sheriff in a state court.\n The same facts that justified the judgment against the goods, &c., of the marshal, would have authorized at attachment against his person; operating even more hastily than a capias ad satisfaciendum founded on a judgment; and therefore no objection to this means of coercion can be perceived, that did not apply with still more force to the old mode by attachment. The latter remedy was never deemed an independent suit, but a means to compel the ministerial officer of the court to perform his duty, so that the plaintiff should have the fruits of his judgment; and the same end is attained by the new remedy under the state law; each, is an incident of the suit between the plaintiff and defendant to the execution, of which the proceeding against the officer is part; and to that suit the question of jurisdiction must be referred: It follows the officer had no right to raise the question. \n\n[43 U.S. 29, 36]\n\u00a0\n The next inquiry is, to what extent does the statute of Mississippi apply to the courts of the United States held there?\n It is contended for the defendant in error, that the act of Congress of 1828 did intend, and could only have intended, to adopt the state law entire; that when the process and modes of proceeding were adopted, the provision carried with it the penalties prescribed to enforce their performance; to recognize part as governing the practice of the federal courts, and reject other parts, as not applicable to them, would break up the whole system. That so doing is a delicate, and difficult duty, experience has taught us; it is impossible, however, to do otherwise in many cases. That of Amis v. Smith, 16 Pet., 303, was an instance. It also came up from Mississippi. By the laws of that state, the sheriff is commanded to take a forthcoming bond for the delivery of property on the day of sale, levied on by virtue of an execution; if the bond if forfeited for not delivering the property, it operates as a new judgment against the defendant to the execution, and also against the sureties to the bond; and no writ of error is afterwards allowed to reverse the original judgment. Pursuant to the laws of Mississippi a delivery bond had been taken by the marshal; it was forfeited, and then the defendant prosecuted a writ of error to this court to reverse the judgment on which the execution issued. It was held here, that that part of the state law authorizing the delivery bond to be given, was adopted by the act of 1828, and that a new execution might issue on it; but the part cutting off the writ of error must be rejected. Another instance will be given, which is presented by the statute of Mississippi, on which the present motion against the marshal was founded. The 27th and 28th sects. enact, that if the sheriff shall make a false return on an execution or other process, to him directed, for every such offence he shall pay a fine of $500, one half to the plaintiff, and the other half to the use of the literary fund, recoverable by motion. If the fact that the return is false does not appear of record, the court shall immediately empannel a jury to try such fact, and on its being found, proceed to assess the fine.\n The recovery of the penalty could with quite as much propriety have been on conviction by indictment as on a summary motion; and in neither mode can it be plausibly contended that the courts of the United States could inflict the penalty on its marshal; the motion and assessment of the fine being distinct from the process and mode of proceeding in the cause of which the execution was \n\n[43 U.S. 29, 37]\n\u00a0\n part, on which the false return was made. This being an offence against the state law, the courts of the state alone could punish its commission; the courts of the United States having no power to execute the penal laws of the individual states.\n A judgment below for 25 per cent. damages was given against the marshal for failing to pay over the debt collected; the penalty amounted to $1,750. The motion for judgment was founded on the 25th section of the act; it declares judgment on motion shall be rendered against the marshal, for the money collected, with legal interest; and also, for 25 per cent. damages on the amount.\n This is just as much the infliction of a penalty, as if a fine had been imposed under the 27th and 28th sections for a false return; and for the same reasons was beyond the competency of the Circuit Court; and for so much the judgment cannot stand.\n We next come to the question whether the marshal is rendered liable by his return, and the proofs, and pleadings.\n By the state statute he was allowed to contest the fact by pleading to the motion, that he had not received the money. He first demurred to the written grounds of the motion; being in the nature of a declaration. The demurrer was overruled, and the defendant had leave given to plead over. He pleaded 1st, That he did not receive or collect on said execution the moneys specified in the motion. The 2d plea is to the same effect, but for the larger sum, including a bill of exchange, about which there is no controversy.\n 3d. That he received and collected the notes of the Commercial and Railroad Bank of Vicksburg, and the Planter's Bank of Mississippi, due and payable at said banks; and which were paying specie on their notes on demand-that is on the 12th day of March, 1839; which notes were collected and received without any instructions from the plaintiff or his attorney that gold or silver would be required; and at a time when the bank-notes were the current circulating medium; and that the same on the day aforesaid were tendered to the attorney of the plaintiff before the suspension of specie payments by the banks-all of which bank-notes he had always been ready, and is yet ready and willing to pay over to the plaintiff. The 4th plea is the same in substance.\n On the first two pleas issues were joined to the country: To the other two, the plaintiff replied-That previous to the reception of the bank-notes, the defendant was instructed that gold and silver would be required upon the execution; and issues were tendered to \n\n[43 U.S. 29, 38]\n\u00a0\n the country, which were joined on the single point, whether the marshal had been instructed that gold or silver would be required.\n Two instructions were asked on behalf of the marshal and refused-1st,\n'If the jury believe from the evidence that the bills of exchange and bank-notes were received by the marshal, and not gold and silver, then the jury will find the issues on the first and second pleas in favor of the defendant.'\n\n 3d. 'And that if they find that the marshal received bank-notes or bills of exchange, and not money in specie, which the plaintiff refused to receive as money, then they must find the issues for the defendant; as the issue is, whether he received and collected money, or not.'\n The 2d instruction asked was given, and need not be noticed.\n The return of the marshal was, that he had received on the execution, bank-notes due on demand and payable in specie-on the two banks, named in the return, amounting to $7,000-the subject of the present motion.\n No question is, or can be raised, on the two last issues; they were found against the defendant on the proof that he had been instructed that nothing but gold or silver would be received in satisfaction. The merits of the case therefore turn on the two instructions refused; they are referable to the facts giving rise to the instructions; the facts briefly are, that the marshal was instructed to collect specie on the execution; he failed to do so, and took bank-notes from the debtor to the amount of $ 7,000 in lieu of specie. A few days after the notes were received, one of the banks at which a part of them were payable suspended specie payments, and its notes thereby became depreciated in value. The instructions raise the question, who shall bear the loss: If the officer's return is treated as a nullity, then it will fall on Marsh and others, defendants to the execution; if the marshal's offer to deliver the notes to Breedlove's attorney, and his plea of tender had been good, then the execution creditor must have dustained the loss-but failing in these grounds of defence the officer must bear it himself.\n By the Constitution of the United States (section ten) gold or silver coin made current by law can only be tendered in payment of debts: Nevertheless, if the debtor pays bank-notes, which are received by the creditor in discharge of the contract, the payment is just as valid as if gold or silver had been paid. Had March paid \n\n[43 U.S. 29, 39]\n\u00a0\n his creditor Breedlove in the manner he did the marshal, then there can be no doubt Breedlove could not have treated the payment as a nullity, and on this assumption have issued an execution on his judgment, and enforced payment again in specie.\n By the writ of execution the marshal was commanded to collect so many dollars; this meant gold or silver of course: And the court of errors and appeals of Mississippi, in the case of Nutt v. Fulgham, 5 How. (Miss.), 621, ordered the return of a sheriff, like the one before us, to be struck out, on motion of the plaintiff in the suit. That court says: 'The return of the sheriff, that he took the Union bank-notes, is not a legal return, and the plaintiff is not bound by it, unless the plaintiff had agreed to receive that kind of money or notes in payment; and no such agreement appears.\n In the case before us no motion was made to strike out the return on the part of the plaintiff Breedlove; nor did the marshal ask leave to alter his return, stating he had not made the money: the three parties interested treated the payment as a valid discharge of the judgment against Marsh; and we think, for the purposes of this motion, at least, it must be so deemed. Gwin, the marshal, did receive bank-notes in payment, and intended they should be taken in discharge of the execution; the record throughout shows he did so receive them-and, that they were received as money. Still, he could only pay into court gold or silver, if required by the execution creditor to do so; and therefore he ran the risk of converting the notes into specie when he took them; having incurred the risk, the marshal must bear the loss of depreciation. We apprehend this view of an officer's responsibility who collects bank-notes, is in conformity to the general practice of the courts and collecting officers, throughout the country.\n This court therefore reverses so much of the judgment of the Circuit Court, as adjudged the plaintiff in error, Gwin, to pay the twenty-five per cent. damages, on the amount recovered against him-, and affirms, the residue of said judgment.\n\n Mr. Justice DANIEL dissented.\n I am unable to concur with the majority of the court in their opinion just announced. 'Tis my opinion, that the judgment of the Circuit Court should have been wholly reversed.\n Congress, by express enactment, have defined the duties and responsibilities of the marshals, and prescribed the modes in which \n\n[43 U.S. 29, 40]\n\u00a0\n they shall be enforced. These express regulations, designed for the government of the peculiar officers of the federal courts, cannot, I think be varied or controlled by rules established by the states for the conduct of their respective ministerial agents; but must be of paramount authority.\n The laws of Mississippi, therefore, denouncing penalties against the misconduct of sheriffs, and directing the manner of enforcing them, cannot govern this case. Should it be conceded, however, that the laws of Mississippi concerning sheriffs could have effect in this motion against the marshal, it seems obvious, to my mind, that the appropriate remedy under the state law for an act like that complained of, has not, in this case, been adopted. The alleged delinquency in the marshal, made the foundation of this motion-a delinquency identically the same for which a like proceeding is authorized against a sheriff-is the refusal to pay over money actually made and in his hands, and collected in satisfaction of an execution. For such a refusal, a peculiar penalty, the very same sought and adjudged by the court in this instance, is provided. By the return of the marshal, relied on in proof by the plaintiff, it is conclusively shown, that the money which the officer was commanded to make, had never been received; but that he had received, in part, that which was not money, and which had never been converted into money, and which the plaintiff in the execution, would never have received in lieu of money. Nay, the oral evidence introduced by the plaintiff was brought in to prove that the marshal, in opposition to the plaintiff's positive instructions, had received that which was not money, excluding, upon this proof as well as upon the return, every inference that money had been actually received in satisfaction of the proccss in his hands. A refusal or an omission to levy or to return an execution, the statutes of Mississippi designate as different and distinct offences, and the conduct of the marshal as shown in the proofs, approaches more nearly to either of these than it does to the misfeasance alleged in the notice, and, for which, the court has awarded a penalty against him, although the fact charged is positively disproved by all the testimony, as it is also by the plaintiff's replications to the defendant's 3d and 4th pleas. But whether or not the conduct of the marshal can in literal strictness be denominated a failure or refusal to levy or to return an execution, it is surely not a failure or refusal to pay over money actually levied, and, therefore, the proceeding, under color of the statute of Mississippi, is not \n\n[43 U.S. 29, 41]\n\u00a0\n the proceeding appropriate to the act of the officer, however that act may be characterized. This is, too, a statutory proceeding, and should strictly conform to the power which authorizes it. It cannot be extended either to modes or objects not clearly embraced within the terms of that authority. It cannot, therefore, in any event, warrant the judgment now proposed, as that is clearly for a penalty wholly different from the one imposed by the law of Mississippi, for an offence such as is assumed by the court to have been committed in this instance. Surely the law of Mississippi either should or should not govern this case.\n Again, I do not think that the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court is made out as between the parties to the judgment. The motion on which it is founded is neither process nor a mode of proceeding in the suit between Breedlove and Marsh and Company, nor can it be deemed an execution or process or proceeding upon or regularly incident to the judgment between those parties. It is a distinct and substantive and original proceeding against a third person no party to the controversy. A right of action is claimed against this third person for his own acts or delinquencies, independently of the contract or controversy between the parties to the judgment. In his character of officer of the court, he would, doubtless, be amenable to the authority it possesses to supervise the conduct of its own officer, and to secure the enforcement of its own judgments; an attachment would, therefore, lie against him, to effect these ends of justice. He would, also, be liable upon his official bond as marshal; because the judicial act confers a right of action thereon, without restriction as to citizenship, on all persons who may be injured by a breach of the condition of that bond. But if a farther or different recourse is sought against the marshal, one which may be supposed to arise neither from the inherent power of the court over its peculiar officer, or its judgments; then it is presumed that those who seek such recourse, must show their right as arising out of their character to sue in the federal courts; they must show themselves by regular averment to be citizens of a state other than that of him whom they seek to implead. The present case closely resembles that of Course et al. v. Stead et ux., 4 Dall., 22, in which it was ruled that the want of a proper description of parties in a supplemental suit was not cured by a reference to the original suit.\n The judgment should, I think, be reversed. \n\n[43 U.S. 29, 42]\n\u00a0\n ORDER.\n This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern District of Mississippi, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, it is now here ordered and adjudged by this court, that so much of the judgment of the said Circuit Court in this cause as adjudges William M. Gwin, the plaintiff in error, to pay 25 per cent. damages thereon be, and the same is hereby reversed and annulled, and that the residue of the judgment of the said Circuit Court in this cause, be in all respects, and the same is hereby affirmed. \n\n\n\n","2":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLOUISVILLE, C. & C. R. CO. v. LETSON(1844)\n\nArgued: Decided: January 1, 1844\n\n\n THIS case was brought up, by writ of error, from the Circuit Court of the United States for the district of South Carolina.\n Letson, a citizen of New York, brought an action of covenant against the Louisville, Cincinnati, and Charleston Railroad Company, alleging that they had not fulfilled a contract with him relating to the construction of the road\n The suit was brought in November, 1841.\n In April, 1842, the defendants filed a plea to the jurisdiction, which was afterwards amended to read as follows:\n'And the said the Louisville, Cincinnati, and Charleston Railroad Company come and say, that this court ought not to have or take further cognisance of the action aforesaid, because they say that the said the Louisville, Cincinnati and Charleston Railroad Company is not a corporation whose members are citizens of South Carolina, but that some of the members of the said corporation are citizens of South Carolina, and some of them, namely, John Rutherford, and Charles Baring, are, and were at the time of commencing the said \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 498]\n\u00a0\n action, citizens of North Carolina; and the state of South Carolina is, and was at the time of commencing the said action, a member of the said corporation, and the Bank of Charleston, South Carolina, is also, and was at the time of commencing the said action, a member of the said corporation, which said the Bank of Charleston, South Carolina, is a corporation, some of whose members, namely, Thomas Parish and Edmund Lafau, are, and were at the time of commencing the said action, citizens of New York. And the Charleston Insurance and Trust Company is now, and was at the time of commencing the said action, a member of the said Louisville, Cincinnati and Charleston Railroad Company; which said Charleston Insurance and Trust Company, is a corporation, some of whose members, namely, Samuel D. Dickson, Henry R. Dickson, Henry Parish, and Daniel Parish, are now, and were at the time of commencing the said action, citizens of the state of New York.\n\n'And this the said Louisville, Cincinnati, and Charleston Railroad Company are ready to verify. Wherefore they pray judgment whether this court can or will take further cognisance of the action aforesaid.'\n\n To this plea there was a general demurrer, which, upon argument, was sustained by the court.\n The railroad company then pleaded the general issue, and the cause went on to trial. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, and assessed his damages at $18,140.23.\n The writ of error was brought to review the opinion of the court upon the demurrer.\n Mazyck, for the plaintiffs in error.\n Pettigru, Lesesne, and Legar, (then attorney-general,) for the defendant in error.\n The case was submitted upon printed arguments; and, on account of its great importance, the reporter has thought it proper to insert these arguments in extenso.\n Mazyck, for the plaintiffs in error.\n An action is brought by a citizen of New York, in the Circuit Court in South Carolina, against a corporation whose members are alleged to be citizens of South Carolina. A plea to the jurisdiction is set up, in which it is averred: 1st. That two of the members of the corporation sued are citizens of North Carolina. 2d. That the state of \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 499]\n\u00a0\n South Carolina is also a member. 3d. That two other corporations are also members, and that some of the members of each of them are citizens of the state of New York.\n The objections to the jurisdiction of the court arising out of these facts, (the facts themselves being admitted by demurrer,) are embraced in the following propositions:\n\n 1. \nThat a citizen of one state cannot sue a corporation in the Circuit Court of the United States in another state, unless all the members of the corporation sued are citizens of the state in which the suit is brought.\n\n 2. \nThat a citizen of one state cannot sue a corporation in the Circuit Court of the United States in another state, if the state be a member of the corporation, though all the other members of the corporation may be citizens of the state.\n\n 3. \nThat a citizen of one state cannot sue a corporation in the Circuit Court of the United States in another state, where one of the members of the corporation sued is another corporation, any of whose members are citizens of the same state with the plaintiff.\n\n 1. \nA citizen of one state cannot sue a corporation in the Circuit Court of the United States in another state, unless all the members of the corporation are citizens of the state in which the suit is brought.\n Sect. 2, art. 3, of the Constitution of the United States, provides that the judicial power shall extend to controversies 'between citizens of different states.' In the case of the Bank of the United States v. Deveaux et al., 5 Cranch, 84, it was determined that 'the artificial being, the mere legal entity, a corporation aggregate, is not a citizen, and cannot sue or be sued in the courts of the United States, unless the rights of the members in this respect can be exercised in their corporate name. If the corporation be considered as a mere faculty, and not as a company of individuals, who in transacting their joint concerns may use a legal name, they must be excluded from the courts of the Union. The corporate name cannot be a citizen, but the persons whom it represents may be citizens, and the controversy is in fact, and in law, between those persons suing in their corporate character, by their corporate name, for a corporate right, and the individual against whom the suit may be instituted. Substantially and essentially, the parties in such a case, where the members of the corporation are citizens of a different state from the opposite party, come within the spirit and terms of the jurisdiction conferred by the Constitution on the federal courts. The controversy \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 500]\n\u00a0\n is substantially between citizens of one state suing by a corporate name and those of another state.'\n In other words, when a suit is brought in a Circuit Court of the United States, by or against a corporation, the court with reference to the question of jurisdiction, depending on the character of the parties, overlooks the artifical person, the mere legal entity, which cannot be either citizen or alien, and regards only the natural persons of whom it is composed. They are the substance, the real parties; the corporate character and style are only the form and name under which they are presented.\n As far as this question is concerned, the members of the corporation are regarded as individuals jointly suing or being sued.\n If they have the requisite character, if they are citizens of a different state or states from the other party to the suit, the case falls within the constitutional provision.\n In Strawbridge v. Curtis, 3 Cranch, 267, it was held that where the interest was joint, and two or more persons were concerned in that interest as joint plaintiffs, or joint defendants, each of them must be competent to sue, or liable to be sued in the federal courts, and the suit was dismissed because some of the plaintiffs and defendants were citizens of the same state.\n And accordingly, the members of a corporation being regarded with reference to the question of jurisdiction, as joint plaintiffs of joint defendants in the same interest, it has been determined that if any of them are citizens of the same state with the other party to the suit, the federal courts have no jurisdiction. Ward v. Arredondo, 1 Paine, 410; Commercial and Railroad Bank of Vicksburg v. Slocomb et al., 14 Pet., 60.\n But in order to give jurisdiction to the Circuit Courts, founded on the character of the parties in a suit between citizens of different states, not only is it necessary that none of the parties on one side should be citizens of the same state with any of the parties on the other side, but the suit must be between a citizen or citizens of the state in which the suit is brought, and a citizen or citizens of some other state or states. In other words, all the parties on one side must be citizens of the state in which the suit is brought, and all the parties on the other side must be citizens of some other state or states.\n It is not denied that under the constitutional provision as to the judicial power, Congress might, if they had thought proper, have given to the Circuit Courts jurisdiction of all cases between citizens \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 501]\n\u00a0\n of one or more states on one side, and citizens of one or more other states on the other side, as, for example, a case in which some of the plaintiffs should be citizens of New York, and some of them citizens of New Jersey, and some of the defendants citizens of South Carolina, and some citizens of North Carolina. But though Congress might constitutionally have given to the Circuit Courts jurisdiction of such a case, they have not done so. The 11th sect. of the judicial act of 1789, provides that the Circuit Courts shall have cognisance of all suits, &c., where 'the United States are plaintiffs or petitioners, or an alien is a party, or the suit is between a citizen of the state where the suit is brought and a citizen of another state.' If the parties on one side are citizens of a different state from that in which the suit is brought, and some of the parties on the other side are citizens of the state in which the suit is brought, and some of them are citizens of a third state, the suit is clearly not a suit between a citizen or citizens of the state in which it is brought, and a citizen or citizens of another state.\n This suit, for example, being brought in South Carolina, by a citizen of New York, against citizens of South Carolina and North Carolina, is not a suit between citizens of the state in which the suit is brought, and a citizen of another state. It is true that if you regard only the citizens of South Carolina who are defendants, it is a suit between citizens of the state in which it is brought, and a citizen of another state. But, if you regard only the citizens of North Carolina who are defendants, (which is just as reasonable,) it is not a suit between citizens of the state in which it is brought and a citizen of another state. In truth the suit is between the plaintiff and all the defendants, and as all the defendants are not citizens of South Carolina, it is not a suit between citizens of the state in which the suit is brought, and a citizen of another state. The same rule of construction which would make this 'a suit between citizens of the state where the suit is brought, and a citizen of another state,' within the provision of the act of 1789, would, if applied to the constitutional provision, make it a case 'between citizens of different states,' even though some of the defendants were citizens of New York; for if you regarded only those who are citizens of South Carolina, it would be a case between citizens of different states, yet it has been repeatedly determined, that to bring a case between citizens within the jurisdiction of the federal courts, on account of the character of the parties, all the parties on both sides must be citizens of different states. \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 502]\n\u00a0\n Strawbridge v. Curtis, 3 Cranch, 267; Cumberland Bank v. Willis, 3 Sumn., 472; Ward v. Arredondo, 1 Paine, 410; Commercial and Railroad Bank of Vicksburg v. Slocomb et al., 14 Pet., 60.\n The case of Gracie v. Palmer, 8 Wheat., 699, was an action against citizens of New York, brought in the state of Pennsylvania, but that was not a case between citizens of different states, but a case 'to which an alien was a party,' the plaintiffs being subjects of Great Britain, and the defendants, though citizens of New York, being found in Pennsylvania, or voluntarily appearing there, which the court deemed equivalent to an acknowledgment of process served there.\n But it will be said that the act of 1839, (9 Laws of United States, 962,) has enlarged the jurisdiction of the federal courts so as to embrace this case. That act provided that, 'where in any suit in law, or in equity, commenced in any court of the United States, there shall be several defendants, any one or more of whom shall not be inhabitants of, or found within the district where the suit is brought, or shall not voluntarily appear thereto, it shall be lawful for the court to entertain jurisdiction, and proceed to the trial and adjudication of such suit between the parties who may be properly before it, but the judgment or decree rendered therein shall not conclude or prejudice other parties not regularly served with process, or not voluntarily appearing to answer.' In the case of the Commercial and Railroad Bank of Vicksburg v. Slocomb et al., 14 Pet., 60, the court gave the following construction to that act: 'The 11th section of the judicial act declares that no civil suit shall be brought before either of the (Circuit) Courts against an inhabitant of the United States by original process, in any other district than that whereof he is an inhabitant, or in which he shall be found at the time of serving the writ. Many difficulties occurred in practice in cases in which it was necessary to join several defendants, some of whom were not inhabitants of the district in which the suit was brought. The act of 1839 was intended to remove these difficulties, by providing that persons not inhabitants, or not found in the district, may either not be joined at all, or if joined, and did not waive their personal exemption by voluntary appearance, the court may go on to judgment against the parties before it, as if the others had not been joined. But it did not contemplate a change in the jurisdiction of the courts, as regards the character of the parties, as prescribed by the judicial act, and expounded by this court.' \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 503]\n\u00a0\n Before the act of 1839, a creditor, citizen of one state, having two joint debtors citizens of two other states could only proceed against them jointly. If a citizen of South Carolina, and a citizen of North Carolina, were jointly indebted to a citizen of New York, he could not proceed against one of them without joining the other. If he could find them both in the state of New York, he might have sued them there in the Circuit Court of the United States, because his suit would then have been 'a suit between a citizen of the state in which it was brought, and citizens of other states, but he could not have sued them in the Circuit Court, either in North Carolina, or South Carolina, because in neither case would the suit have been a 'suit between citizens of the state in which it was brought, and a citizen of another state.' But the act of 1839, by enabling him to proceed against them separately, enables him to sue each of them in the Circuit Court of the United States in the state of which he is a citizen, for then each suit is 'a suit between a citizen of the state in which it is brought, and a citizen of another state.'\n This is the whole effect of the act of 1839. But such as it is, it is entirely inapplicable to a suit against a corporation. It provides that the judgment, or decree, shall not conclude or prejudice other parties not regularly served with process, or voluntarily appearing. Now, of two or more individuals, joint debtors, each is liable for the whole amount of the debt; and there is, therefore, no reason in the nature of the obligation why separate judgments should not be awarded against them. But the members of a corporation are not individually liable for its obligations at all, and therefore from the nature of the obligation, there can be no judgment against them individually, nor against a part of them; the judgment must be against the body corporate, which includes all the members. And, accordingly, in the case last cited, Commercial and Railroad Bank of Vicksburg v. Slocomb et al., the court say: 'There is another reason why this act cannot apply to this case. It expressly declares that the judgment, or decree, shall not conclude or prejudice other parties not regularly served with process, or not voluntarily appearing. Now, defendants being a corporation aggregate, any judgment against them must be in their corporate character, and the judgment must be paid out of their corporate funds, in which is included the interest of the two Louisiana stockholders, consequently such judgment must prejudice those parties.'\n\n 2. \nA citizen of one state cannot sue a corporation in the Circuit \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 504]\n\u00a0\n Court of the United States in another state if the state be a member of the corporation, though all the other members of the corporation may be citizens of the state in which the suit is brought.\n A corporation is not a citizen of any state, and therefore an action brought by a citizen of one state against a corporation in another state, is not within the jurisdiction of the federal courts, as 'a suit between citizens of different states,' unless each member of the corporation is a citizen of a different state from the plaintiff, as prescribed by the constitution, and as it is still further restricted by the judicial act of 1789, 'a citizen of the state in which the suit is brought.' As far as the question of jurisdiction is concerned, the members of the corporation are regarded as the real defendants, sued by the name of the corporation, and each, and all of them, must have the requisite character. Cumberland Bank v. Willis, 3 Sumn., 472; Ward v. Arredondo, 1 Paine, 410; Commercial and Railroad Bank v. Slocomb et al., 14 Pet., 60.\n Now, the state is certainly not a citizen, and therefore the state being a member of the corporation, one of its members has not, and cannot have the requisite character to give jurisdiction to the court.\n But it will be said that the case of The Bank of the United States v. The Planters' Bank of Georgia, 9 Wheat., 904, has settled this point in favor of the jurisdiction. It is not so. There is a very wide distinction between that case and this. That case, so far from having decided this question, did not involve it, nor depend upon it at all. It was not a case in which the jurisdiction was founded on the character of the parties. It was not a case between citizens of different states, for some of the corporators of the Bank of the United States were citizens of Georgia, as appeared by the pleadings, and therefore if the jurisdiction had depended on the citizenship of the parties, it could not have been sustained. It was a case in which the jurisdiction of the federal courts depended altogether upon the nature of the case, and not at all on the character of the parties. The act of Congress, incorporating the Bank of the United States, authorized it to sue in the Circuit Courts of the United States, and it was held in the case of Osborne v. The Bank of the United States, 9 Wheat., 738, that therefore, every suit brought by the bank was a case arising under a law of the United States, and as such fell within the jurisdiction of the federal courts, without respect to the character of the parties.\n Chief Justice Marshall, delivering the judgment of the court, in \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 505]\n\u00a0\n the case of the Bank of the United States v. Planters' Bank, says-'This is not a case in which the character of the defendant gives jurisdiction to the court. The suit is not to be sustained, because the Planters' Bank is suable in the federal courts, but because the plaintiff has a right to sue any defendant in that court who is not withdrawn from its jurisdiction by the Constitution or by law. The suit is against a corporation, and the judgment is to be satisfied by the property of the corporation, not by that of the individual corporators. The state does not, by becoming a corporator, identify itself with the corporation. The Planters' Bank of Georgia is not the state of Georgia, although the state holds an interest in it.' And again-'The bank does not sue because the defendant is a citizen of a different state from any of its members, but because its charter confers upon it the right of suing its debtors in a Circuit Court of the United States.'\n In that case, the court having jurisdiction on another ground, it was not necessary to look beyond the corporation to find a ground of jurisdiction in the character of its members.\n The suit could be entertained against the corporation as a mere artificial being, and it was not material that the corporators should be citizens of Georgia, or who or what they were. The objection that the state was a corporator, would have been as strong in a state court having general jurisdiction as in the federal courts, whose jurisdiction is limited, the case being, from its nature, within the jurisdiction; for a state can no more be sued in a state court than in the federal courts, and as it could not have prevailed in a state court, so neither could it in the federal courts. The answer is, the action and the judgment are against the corporation, and the corporation is not the state, though the state may be a member of it. But in this case, in order to give jurisdiction to the federal court, it is necessary that all the members of the corporation should be citizens of the state, and the objection is, not that one member of the corporation is the state, which cannot be sued, but that one member of the corporation being the state is not a citizen of the state, and therefore, it is not a case in which all the members of the corporation are citizens of the state in which the suit is brought, or citizens of a different state from the plaintiff. There is nothing in the character of the defendants to deprive the court of jurisdiction, if the court possessed jurisdiction independently of that character; but then there is nothing in their character to give jurisdiction, and there is not, as in the Bank of the United States v. Planters' \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 506]\n\u00a0\n Bank of Georgia, a ground of jurisdiction independent of the character of the defendants.\n\n 3. \nA citizen of one state cannot sue a corporation in the Circuit Court of the United States in another state, where one of the members of the corporation sued is another corporation, any of whose members are citizens of the same state with the plaintiff.\n It has been sufficiently shown that a corporation is not a citizen, and that a suit brought by a citizen of one state against a corporation in another state, is not within the jurisdiction of the federal courts, unless all the members of the corporation are citizens of the state in which the suit is brought, or at least citizens of a different state from the plaintiff. If one of the members of the corporation sued is another corporation, and you regard the latter only as an artificial being, then one of the members of the corporation sued is not a citizen, and the suit is not a suit 'between citizens of different states.' But if you follow up the process which was adopted in the first instance, and looking beyond the stockholder corporation to the individuals of whom it is composed, with reference to the question of jurisdiction, regard them as the real stockholders, and the corporation only as the mode and name in which they hold their shares, then if they are citizens of a different state from the plaintiffs, it is a suit between citizens of different states, but otherwise it is not. If the same individuals without being incorporated were joint owners of the same shares, and some of them were citizens of the same state with the plaintiff, the suit would certainly not be a suit 'between citizens of different states.' And if for the purpose of determining the jurisdiction, the corporate character is overlooked, and only the individuals are considered, the case must be the same as if they were not incorporated at all. If the court will not look beyond the service of the constituent corporation to the character of its members, the jurisdiction cannot be sustained. If it will, and should find them to be all citizens of the state in which the suit is brought, would they not be regarded as the real parties for the purpose of sustaining the jurisdiction? Then if any of them are found to be citizens of the same state with the plaintiff, must they not be equally regarded as the real parties, and so defeat the jurisdiction?\n Suppose that the corporation against which the action was brought, was found to be composed entirely of corporations, (which is a very possible case,) and that all the members of the several constituent corporations were citizens of the state in which the suit was brought, \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 507]\n\u00a0\n would the court refuse to entertain jurisdiction? Would it not in such a case, with reference to the jurisdiction, regard the members of the constituent corporations as the real defendants, and assume the jurisdiction? They would be as truly the real parties as the individual members of a corporation consisting of individuals, and being the immediate defendant; the corporation being only the modes in which they are associated, affecting very materially the nature and extent of their rights and obligations, the forms of proceeding, and the nature and extent of the remedies for or against them, but not at all affecting their liability to the jurisdiction of the federal courts. For if they did, then all men might be withdrawn from the jurisdiction of the federal courts by charters of incorporation. But if in the case of a corporation, consisting entirely of several corporations, the court would look beyond the constituent corporations to the character of their members, it must also in a case of a corporation, consisting in part of individuals, and in part of another corporation, and if any of the members of the constituent corporations are citizens of the same state with the plaintiff, the jurisdiction cannot be sustained.\n Pettigru and Lesesne, for the defendant in error.\n This was an action of covenant by T. W. Letson, a citizen of New York, against the defendants, described as a corporation consisting of citizens of South Carolina.\n After a summons and distringas, the defendants appeared, and pleaded to the jurisdiction. 1. That Mr. Baring and Mr. Rutherford are members of the company, and citizens of North Carolina. 2. That the state of South Carolina is a member of the company. 3. That the Bank of Charleston, South Carolina, is a member of the company; and that Edmund Laffan, a shareholder in said bank, is a citizen of New York. 4. That the South Carolina Insurance and Trust Company is a member of the company that is sued; and that Samuel Dickson, a shareholder in the South Carolina Insurance and Trust Company, is a citizen of New York.\n The plaintiff below demurred to the plea, and the court sustained the demurrer. The defendants then pleaded to the action, and a verdict was had against them, judgment entered up on the demurrer and verdict. To reverse the judgment, this writ of error is prosecuted.\n\n 1. \nThe first objection assumes that all the defendants must bbelong to one state. But there is no such rule. According to the authorities, \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 508]\n\u00a0\n it is sufficient that all the members of the corporation that is sued are citizens of some state, other than that of which the plaintiff is a citizen. Cumberland Bank v. Willis, 3 Sumn., 373. It may, perhaps, be questionable, whether the citizenship of any but the persons who have the government of the corporation should be inquired into. In Curtiss v. Strawbridge, 3 Cranch, 267, it was settled, that each distinct interest must be represented by persons, all of whom are entitled to sue or be sued in the federal courts. But this leaves open the question, whether all the private members of a corporation are properly the persons by whom a distinct interest is represented, when the corporation sues, or is sued. The interest of the corporation is, in fact, represented by the official members of the company. The real plaintiffs are those who have the right to sue, and the defendants those who may be compelled to plead. But a private member of the company has no power to sue, nor to prevent a suit in the name of the company; nor can his admissions be given in evidence, as in the case of a plaintiff. Greenleaf on Ev., 383. And when the corporation is used, there is the same want of privity between a private member and the party to the record. He cannot be summoned or distrained to answer to a demand against the corporation, or to any rule or order connected with the cause. 'Where a corporation is impleaded, the sheriff cannot distrain a private man;' Bro. Ab. Trespass, 135. 'For a duty or charge on a corporation, every particular member is not liable but process ought to go in their public capacity.' Vent., 351. In practice a summons goes in the first instance, and is served on the head of the company, and in case of refusal, a distress issues against the company's goods, &c., to compel an appearance, (Tidd. Prac., 115,) but no appearance could be enforced by any proceedings against a particular member. Now it is difficult to conceive of a defendant, without some process to compel him to appear; but if that be essential to the character of a defendant, the private member of a corporation is excluded. If every member of the corporation has a right to be heard as a party objecting to the jurisdiction, it must be competent to the plaintiff to treat any member of the company as a defendant throughout. But a corporation in South Carolina cannot be sued in North Carolina by proceeding against a private member domiciled there. It seems a solecism to hold that the plaintiff cannot proceed in the federal court against the corporation, because A. is a defendant; and yet that A. cannot be sued for the same cause of action anywhere, or in any court. It is \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 509]\n\u00a0\n as much as to say that A. is a defendant, and no defendant-a party, and not a party, at one and the same time. The result of these considerations is, that in suits by or against a corporation, the relation of the official members to the rest of the company is not that of partners, but of trustee and cestui que trust. If this be admitted, there is an end of the matter, for nothing is more familiar than the difference between an interest in the suit, and the character of a party to the record. There is no rule of pleading, or of evidence, that will apply to a particular member of a corporation, as a party to the record; he cannot be called on to answer, or to accept notice; his release would not affect the action; his admissions are not evidence; and, in fact, he never was taken notice of as a party, except to defeat the jurisdiction in this court. It may well be questioned whether such an anomaly can be reconciled with legal principles.\n Nor does this reasoning militate against the decision of the Bank v. Deveaux, 5 Cranch, 61, which is admitted to be the leading case. It was necessary in that case, to look beyond the corporate character to see who were the persons that were suing in the corporate name. The court decided that they would take notice of the individuals who composed the corporation. But this rule is satisfied if the court ascertains that the individuals who effectually represent the company are amenable to the jurisdiction. There are other instances in which it has been necessary to look beyond the corporate name for the real actors; but in such cases, the official members only have been considered. We have the benefit of precedents here. The residence of a corporation can only be ascertained by reference to the natural persons composing it. Just as the court will inquire who sue in the corporate name, to ascertain whether they are citizens; the same question is sometimes asked to ascertain where they live. Rex v. Gardiner, Cowp., 85. But it is to the official, not to the private members, that the court refers in such case, to determine the occupancy or residence of the corporation. It is held to reside where its principal office is. Bank v. Mackenzie, 2 Brock., 393. And so in the grant of administration where the question of bona notabilia occurs; a share in a company that extends to both provinces, is considered assets in that province where the office of the company is situated. Smith v. Stafford, 2. Wil. Ch., 166. There can be no reason for making a difference between residence and citizenship. If the condition of the official members is decisive of the question of domicil, it is equally so of citizenship. \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 510]\n\u00a0\n A corporation is but a state in miniature; but in political societies, the persons in whom the powers of government are vested, are everywhere considered trustees for the rest of the community. Public acts are done in the name of the whole community, and all are bound by them; but the real authors of them are the persons who have the administration; nor are such acts referred personally to anybody else. In public questions, the demand is made on the government; and in private causes, the same course is pursued, when the injured party has any judicial redress. The Supreme Court has jurisdiction between the states of the confederacy, and before the 11th amendment, the states were liable to be sued as corporations. But though the corporate interests of the whole community are at stake in such a controversy; agreeably to the principles of legal procedure, no notice is taken of any person as defendant, but those who have the right to exercise the powers of government. In the English courts, when a foreign state is the suitor, the head of the state is the only person that is recognized as the plaintiff. The Columbian Government v. Rothschild, 1 Sim ., 94. Every analogy confirms the conclusion, that the parties who are invested with the corporate powers, as governors of the company, are trustees; and in legal procedure should be treated so throughout.\n The case of London v. Wood, 12 Mod., 669, is the authority which the court followed, in the Bank v. Deveaux, taking notice of the natural persons who sue in the corporate name. But that case is a striking illustration of the distinction contended for, between the official and the private members of the corporation, as parties before the court in their natural persons. Wood was sued in the mayor's court by the mayor and commonalty of London; and the judgment was reversed for error, because the mayor was both judge and plaintiff. It was not an answer to the objection, that he was plaintiff in his corporate character, and judge in his natural person, for it was the same individual. But if the cause had been tried in the Common Pleas, before a judge who was a freeman, and therefore one of the commonalty of London, the objection would not have applied. The argument for reversing the judgment against Wood is confined to the incongruity of the mayor being plaintiff in the same case in which he was judge. But no objection is made to the aldermen who were a constituent part of his court, although they must have been included in the general designation of the commonalty. Suits in the name of the people of the state are tried before a judge who is one of the same \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 511]\n\u00a0\n people, and no one imagines that he is both party and judge. And so suits in which the city is a party are without any incongruity tried before a citizen.\n The distinction between the official and the private members of the corporation corresponding exactly with that of trustee and cestui que trust, is founded on the plainest principles; and has never been overlooked in any case, but in that of the jurisdiction of this court. Yet there is no reason why this case should be an exception. On the contrary, every reason in favor of the jurisdiction applies with great force to a controversy between a stranger and a large corporation. In legal reason, the president and directors are trustees for the company; and in point of fact, the contest is between the plaintiff and the persons who have the government of the company; and so falls within the letter as well as the spirit of the Judiciary act; as a suit between citizens of the state in which the action is brought and a citizen of another state.\n A corporation has not the qualities of a person. But it acts by the agency of natural persons, and the acts which they do in the execution of the corporate powers are strictly their personal acts. The bringing of defending of a suit in the corporate name is the act of the official members in their natural persons; but is not the personal act of their constituents. The private members of the company are concerned in the suit in their corporate character merely, and the only persons having any personal relation to the suit are the official members. The private members cannot be called parties to the suit of a corporation without confounding the distinction between the natural and corporate character. In their corporate character they are parties; but as persons or citizens they have nothing more to do with the suit than a private man with a state prosecution. When, therefore, to defeat the jurisdiction, it is alleged that such or such a person, a private member of the corporation, is a party to the suit, the allegation is neither accurate in reason nor true in fact. The private persons are represented by the corporate name, not as persons, but as a faculty. The only persons who have any individuality in the corporate name, or can be called persons suing, are the official members.\n Waiving, however, this discussion, which is not essential to the case, the objection that two of the members of the corporation are citizens of North Carolina, cannot avail. There is nothing in the constitution or in the act of Congress, which requires that all the defendants \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 512]\n\u00a0\n must be citizens of the state in which the action is brought. The act of 1838, 9 Laws United States, 699, seems to be only declaratory. By the constitution, the jurisdiction of the federal courts extends to cases generally between citizens of different states. The Judiciary act confers jurisdiction on the Circuit Court in narrower terms, between a citizen of the state where the suit is brought and a citizen of another state. But when the parties to the contract reside in different states, the party who is sued cannot plead the nonjoinder of the party who is out of the jurisdiction. The proviso in the 11th section exempts persons from being arrested in one district for trial in another, and from any process to compel appearance in any other than that in which the party is found. But the defendant may waive this exemption, and if he voluntarily appears to a suit properly brought against his co-defendant, and which might have been properly brought against him in his district, it is no error. Gracie v. Palmer, 8 Wheat. 699.\n No attempt has been made to arrest Mr. Baring or Mr. Rutherford, in the district of North Carolina, for trial in this district. Nor has any attempt been made to bring a suit against either of the defendants in any district in which they were not found. The original process was directed to the marshal of South Carolina, and executed in his district. If the members who are alleged to be citizens of North Carolina are before the court, they have either appeared voluntarily or they have been found in South Carolina. If the plea is considered the plea of the absentees, it contradicts itself; they cannot appear and object to appear. If they have been found in South Carolina, they are rightly suable there with co- defendants who are citizens of that state, by the plaintiff, a citizen of New York. If they have not been found in South Carolina, how can they allege that they are parties? But if the plea to the jurisdiction be considered as the plea of the other members objecting that they cannot be sued without joining persons who are inhabitants of North Carolina, the answer is that they are joined. All the members of the company in their corporate character are residents at Charleston; and for any cause of action which concerns the corporation, they cannot be sued anywhere else. A defendant who is arrested in one district for trial in another, may waive his privilege; and if he appear to the suit he cannot object to the jurisdiction. But in a suit against a corporation, the defendants are not liable to be sued any where except in the district in which the corporation can be compelled to appear. By becoming members of the company they have submitted generally to the jurisdiction; by \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 513]\n\u00a0\n appearing to the writ they have submitted to the jurisdiction in this particular case; and the plea to the jurisdiction is doubly irregular.\n\n 2. \nThe second objection is conclusively answered by the Bank of the United States v. The Planters' Bank, 9 Wheat., 904. It is, however, argued that the decision in that case depended on the charter of the bank authorizing the said bank to sue in the federal court. But the Judiciary act authorizes the plaintiff to sue the citizens of South Carolina in the federal court. The bank charter did not authorize the bank to sue a state, nor does the law authorize the plaintiff to sue a state; but the state, by becoming a party to a company, whether corporate or not, does not exempt the company from suit; and so the cases of the plaintiff, and of the Bank of the United States v. The Planters' Bank, are identical in principle.\n\n 3. \nThe third objection resolves itself into the question whether Mr. Laffan is a defendant in this suit; or, in other words, a member of the Louisville, Cincinnati, and Charleston Railroad Company. The negative is so evident that it is difficult to illustrate what is so clear. If he was a member, he would be entitled to the same privileges with other members; but he is in fact incapable of doing any act which it requires a member of the company to do. He may vote in the choice of an agent or proxy to represent the Bank of Charleston in the charter-meetings of the company. But to call him a member of the company is to overlook the distinction between the representative and the constituent. It is not the charter of the company, but that of the bank, under which he acts when he votes for an agent of the bank. If his right to vote for an agent or proxy were contested, it is to the charter of the bank, and to that alone, that he must refer for his authority.\n Again; if he was a member of the company he would be liable to the same burdens as the rest of the company; but he is entirely exempt from their obligations and bound by none of their by-laws. They could not expel him or forfeit his stock. It is true that he has an interest, though a remote one, in the company. It is an interest of the same kind as that which creditors or legatees have in the testator's assets, or a cestui que trust in the trust-estate. But such an interest, though immediate and direct, would not make him a party to the suit in which the subject was contested by the executor or trustee. Chappedelaine v. Decheneau, 4 Cranch, 306. 'It may be laid down as a rule without exception, that when jurisdiction depends on the party, it is the party named on the record.' Madrazzo \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 514]\n\u00a0\n v. The Governor of Georgia, 1 Pet., 110. Mr. Laffan then, is not a defendant, and the third objection fails.\n But it is said that the Bank of Charleston is a defendant in its corporate character, and that against a corporation as such, the federal court has no jurisdiction. In answer, it is sufficient to say that the court has jurisdiction, because all the persons who are sued are citizens of South Carolina. The members of the company must be understood to be persons. It is enough that against the persons sued the court has jurisdiction. There is no such thing as the communication of an immunity from justice. It would have been competent for the legislature of South Carolina to exempt the Bank of Charleston from the ordinary jurisdiction. But the privilege would not have extended to every joint-stock company in which the bank might become a shareholder. A corporation, as a mere faculty or legal entity, cannot be a member of an incorporated company, for by members is meant the natural persons of whom the body politic is made up. The property in the shares is a different matter. The stock of the company may be appropriated to objects animate or inanimate. A slave, an alien, an enemy, or even a dead man, might be a shareholder; or the shares might be dedicated to the repairs of a house, to the improvement of land, or to the use of persons unborn. But it would be a frivolous objection to a suit against the corporation that some of its shares belonged to nobody. When shares in one corporation are held by another corporation, they belong to the government of the corporation which is the shareholder, a trustee for the corporate uses. In fact, the Bank of Charleston would have been incompetent to make the contract on which the action in this case is founded; and if this could be regarded as an action against the bank, it might have been resisted as founded on an illegal contract.\n\n 4. \nThe fourth objection is the same precisely as the third, and must be overruled for the same reasons.\n Legar, (then attorney-general,) on the same side.\n The argument of Mr. Petigru, for the defendant in error, contains such a clear and able exposition of the question arising under the demurrer, that I will submit it to the court, by way of an opening, and cast my own in the form of a reply to Mr. Mazyck's, for the plaintiffs.\n But I will, in the first place, barely recall to the recollection of the \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 515]\n\u00a0\n court, that this is an action brought by a citizen of New York against a corporation chartered by the state of South Carolina, having its principal, if not only, office in Charleston, conducted by a president and directors who are all citizens and residents of the latter state, and composed of stockholders, among whom, two only are so much as surmised to be absent from the state, (but neither of these resident in New York;) and a third is another corporation, in all respects exclusively an institution-a creature of the law of South Carolina, identified with it even in name-viz .: the Bank of Charleston.\n If this court has not jurisdiction to protect the rights of a citizen of New York, whose whole fortune-the fruit of his labor-is involved in a controversy with a trading company, thus created, thus composed, thus situated, under that article of the Constitution of the United States which gives to the federal courts cognisance of 'controversies between citizens of different states,' everybody will admit that there is somewhere a great chasm in our laws, and a serious grievance in our practice.\n But I am bold to assert, that the paradox which I have just stated does not exist in our jurisprudence. All will admit that the burden of proof is upon him who affirms the existence of such a state of the law. In an age when, more than ever, and in a country where, most of all, from obvious peculiarities of position and of polity, the spirit of association goes hand in hand with that of commerce; and all great enterprises, without exception, throughout the whole extent of this vast confederacy, are carried on by incorporated companies, local in nothing but their name and origin, it will be admitted to be, a priori, a most improbable proposition, that in any courts, under any circumstances, in any cause in which mere voluntary partnerships would have a remedy, all redress is denied to a company, because it is clothed by law in the attributes of a partnership expressly adapted, by a peculiar organization, to the most important ends. This is putting the case in the least adventurous manner; for, in truth, in the eye of the law, a corporation, while it is a partnership for all the good purposes of such a company, differs from it in this, that its business can be transacted, and its existence perpetuated, without the complexity and embarrassments of rights, responsibilities, and representations incident to a change of individual members in a mere voluntary concern. Bell's Comm.; Adley v. Whitestaple Company, 17 Ves., 323. It is a legal unit-a distinct and well defined person-immortal, unchangeable; capable, as such, of taking, holding, conveying, \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 516]\n\u00a0\n administering, and defending property; known to the law by its corporate name only; speaking (formally and strictly) its will only by its seal; appearing in the courts only by its attorney, with a warrant under seal; represented only by its regularly constituted trustees or managers-the feoffees, so to speak, to its uses; and having a persona standi in judicio in this representative capacity, and by this name, and none other. Therefore, as I shall contend, it ought to be less embarrassed in the judicial pursuit of its rights than an unincorporated company; but say that it is liable to the same and no greater disadvantages, the question is whether, in the present state of the law, it would be any answer to the demand of the defendant in error for justice in a federal court-the Circuit Court of South Carolina-against a partnership with its office in Charleston, and carrying on its business there, as the domicile of the company, that one of those interested in it, as a dormant partner, for so a mere stockholder is, or even as an open and proclaimed partner, resides in a third state, neither that of the plaintiff nor of the defendant.\n If the act of 1839 was not made to prevent the possibility of such a denial of justice, what is it good for?\n That act dispenses with the appearance, in a suit, of a party confessedly necessary, at common law, to a complete representation of all the interests in controversy. It ordains, that when there shall be several defendants, any one or more of whom shall not be found within a district, or be inhabitants of it, or shall not voluntarily appear, the court may proceed to adjudication between the parties properly before it, and the non-joinder shall not be pleadable in abatement.\n Admit, therefore, that Baring and Rutherford, members of this partnership or company, are inhabitants of North Carolina, who do not choose to appear, and have not been found in Charleston; and admit further , (what is not the fact,) that they are necessary parties as defendants-I say, put aside the corporation, which merges entirely their legal interests, and makes their appearance in person a legal impossibility, and violating every principle of pleading and practice known in an English court-admit them to be full, open, and avowed co-partners, and competent co-suitors, of the defendants below-yet their appearance to this suit is dispensed with. If they appear, the jurisdiction is unquestionable, by the express words of the act, and the judgment binds them as parties; if they do not appear, they are not parties to the judgment, as they are not parties in interest, and \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 517]\n\u00a0\n it will be time enough to plead their absence (if such a plea be possible in our law) when any suit shall be prosecuted against them personally on the strength of the judgment in this case. But how can their appearance or non-appearance affect the question of jurisdiction, which depends, even in the case of necessary parties, on the fact of citizenship? Who ever heard before that the voluntary appearance of a citizen of a state gives jurisdiction to the federal courts, in a case in which that jurisdiction depends, not on the character of the cause, or the state of the pleadings, or the service of process-still less the will of an individual-but simply on the fact of citizenship or no citizenship, or, as it is commonly expressed, on the character of the parties-that is, on a distinct and ascertained civil status in the parties.\n But this is putting the case much too favorably for the plaintiffs in error. It is admitting Baring and Rutherford to be necessary parties; that is, parties having a legal capacity to represent the interests in controversy, and indispensable to an adjudication on the subject of those interests. This, however, is not the fact. These gentlemen, even considered as partners, were dormant partners, not known in the transaction-never heard of by the plaintiff below-no parties (except by legal distant consequence) to the covenant he sues upon; and, therefore, laying the charter and the metaphysical being of the corporation out of the case for the present, and considering them as members of a mere voluntary partnership, it is not true that they could have come in and pleaded at all to the declaration; still less that the president and directors, who did contract and covenant with the plaintiff below, would be allowed to plead that these unknown, unheard of, foreign persons, ought to be made parties to the suit, for the purpose of defeating it. The law is settled that dormant partners, as defendants, are not only not necessary parties, but are not allowed to become parties to the record where they were not so to the contract, and thus to defeat by surprise ( which might be a fraud) a plaintiff who had never heard of them. De Montford v. Saunders, 1 Barn. & Ad., 398.\n It does not lie in their mouths, as the legal phrase is, after treating as A., B., and C., to say, they represented the whole alphabet. To say that this is true in all contracts whatever, except where they are to be passed on by a federal court, would be simply absurd. It might just as well be pleaded to a separate action on a joint and several bond against a citizen of South Carolina, that the co-obligor resided in North Carolina. \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 518]\n\u00a0\n Analagous to this equitable rule is that which makes a distinction between the form of an objection for nonjoinder of parties in an action. If the plaintiff comes into court without making all who have a joint interest in the subject of the controversy a legal interest, that is, parties to the suit, it is a defect of which (if it appear upon the pleadings) advantage may be taken by demurrer, or in arrest of judgment. But in a non-joinder of defendants, there is only one way and one time of taking the exception-it must be done by plea in abatement. It is no bar, it is no ground for nonsuit on variance, and if the cause is allowed to go on at all, it is too late to object that some parties to the contract have not been held to their responsibility. Whelpdale's case, 5 Co., 119 a; 1 Saund., 154, n. 1, 291 b, n. 4, &c.\n Those well-established general principles should seem to make it very clear, that by the law as it stands, especially since the passing of the act of 1839, Messrs. Baring and Rutherford were either no parties to this suit at all, as having nothing to do with the transaction of the ordinary business of the company, or might be dispensed with under that act as absent defendants.\n It is beyond all controversy, that were this a mere voluntary partnership and they avowed members, their appearance might be dispensed with, and their existence, as citizens of North Carolina, would not affect the jurisdiction. This is the act of 1839.\n It is, if possible, still clearer, that were they only dormant partners of a firm, the aid of the act of 1839 would not be at all wanted to dispense with their appearance. They would not be allowed at common law to come in and plead even in abatement, must less in bar, that they were parties; neither would the visible and legally responsible members of such a partnership be permitted to put in any such plea.\n It is certain that, if they appeared voluntarily, the court would have jurisdiction, for so says the act of 1839, in the words just cited: 'if the absent do not voluntarily appear.' So said this court in Gracie v. Palmer, 8 Wheat., 699, and this notwithstanding the words of the 11th sect. of the Judiciary act, in that very proviso of which the act of 1839 was intended to mitigate or prevent the evil effects. That act, after conferring the jurisdiction in general terms, goes on to make an exception, which proves the extent of the rule it modifies and restricts. It authorizes suits to be brought 'between a citizen of the state where the suit is brought and a citizen of another state,' with \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 519]\n\u00a0\n this important qualication, 'that no inhabitant of the United States shall be suable in any other district than that whereof he is an inhabitant, or in which he shall be found at the time of serving the writ.' Nothing can be more express than this proviso, but the court said these words were to be understood there, 'if he saw fit to object to it.'\n It is the settled law of this court, that a defendant may renounce the privilege extended to him in this proviso, and if he be suable at all in the Circuit Court, that is, if he be a citizen of a state different from that of the plaintiff, he may be sued by consent in any court; for it is only in matters of personal privilege that consent gives jurisdiction. This I say is settled law, and so clear and unquestionable that the learned counsel for the plaintiff in error admits that before the act of 1839, if a creditor having two debtors, citizens of different states, could find them both in his own, (New York,) he might have sued them there in the Circuit Court of the United States, because his suit would then have been a suit between a citizen of the state in which it was brought and citizens of other states. (p. 7.) But suppose he did not find them there, and they chose to appear, or, which is the same thing, to be regarded in law as found in the state of one of them, how could the privileged partner at once waive and assert his personal exemption?-appear and not appear? Or, what is still more important, if consent can give jurisdiction in such a case in one place, why should it not have the same virtue in another?\n The truth is, the moment it is admitted that a party may appear voluntarily, or be held in any other way to answer in any state, which is neither his own nor that of his adversary, the whole matter is settled to be one of mere procedure and service of process; jurisdiction is no wise involved in it, for that is matter of fundamental law, and not at the discretion of parties.\n And so is the act of 1839. It applies to the very case of a joint contract between parties residents of different states, (both different of course from that of the plaintiff, for only in such a case was it competent for Congress to give jurisdiction,) and it provides expressly, that if the absent party will not waive his privilege by appearing, as this court in Palemr's case, 8 Wheat., 699, ruled that he might, the Circuit Court should go on without him.\n The case appears to me so very simple, upon the principles and authorities already cited, that I should leave it here, but that the counsel for the plaintiff in error founds himself upon a recent decision of \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 520]\n\u00a0\n this court, which he seems to think has made a law for corporations aggregate, altogether different from any law applicable to natural persons, either as individuals or as partnerships, and altogether different, I must say, from any law known to any system of jurisprudence with which I am acquainted.\n He lays down these propositions:\n\n 1. \n'That a citizen of one state cannot sue a corporation in the Circuit court of the United States in another state, unless all the members of the corporation are citizens of the state in which the suit is brought.'\n I have demonstrated that if this company be considered as a mere partnership, or voluntary association, the residence in another state, as well as the non-appearance of Messrs. Baring and Rutherford, would be wholly immaterial under the act of 1839.\n If the company be considered as a corporation, the same consequence follows, with the single anomalous exception which I shall presently notice, a fortiori.\n The first great difference between a corporation and a private partnership or voluntary association is, that in the former the company acts only by its constitutional organs, whether a committee of directors or appointed officers; while, in the latter, the obligations of a single member, or number of members, by the subscription of the firm, will bind the society. 2 Bell's Com., 556, 5th ed.\n A corporation, or to speak in the more accurate and scientific language of the continental jurists, 'a juridical person,' is, as I have said, a creature of the law, known to it under a given name, whose essence is in that name, and the social identity it implies-whose capacities are defined in its charter-whose will is expressed under its seal-whose unity is attected by no change in the parts that compose it-and whose existence survives the deaths of its members.\n It is, properly considered, a personification of certain legal rights under a description imposed upon it by the power that created it. Its name is a thing-it is everything: this creature of law is a standing fiction and style-stat nominis umbra.\n The first consequence of this definition is, that the whole is essentially and unchangeably different from all the parts, which are as completely merged and lost in it as the ingredients are in a chemical compound.\n This personification of the rights of property has, as a necessary instrument, a persona standi in judicio of its own; and it appears, defends, \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 521]\n\u00a0\n and pleads in the court, as it transacts all its other business, ex necessitate rei, by means of living agents, generally organized in a particular form, proceeding in prescribed modes, and testifying the will of the ideal unity by authentic acts.\n A corporation aggregate is the most common-in this country perhaps, strictly speaking, the only form of this juridical person; but, the common condition of all of them, whether sole or aggregate, lay or ecclesiastical, civil or eleemosynary, ordinata or inordinata, is a capacity to enjoy the rights of property, without the capacity of contracting in regard to them, except through guardians, trustees, or curators.\n They stand in this respect precisely in the same category with minors, lunatics and idiots. For instance, the church is considered in law as a minor; the text is express: fungitor vice minoris. ... Infra aetatem et in custodia domini regis est. 2 Inst., 3.\n Therefore, as we have seen, for all the purposes of valid agreement or judicial remedy and representation, this ideal cestui que trust or ward, wills, speaks, acts, pleads, only in the name of its constitutional curator or trustee.\n It is all-important to anything like correct thinking on the subject of corporations, that this distinction between the members as constituents of an organized body, and as unorganized individuals, should never be lost sight of. The principle is inflexible that in a corporation all the parts are not the whole. This is not only true of the conduct or administration of a corporation; it is true also of its rights of property. They are referred, not to all the members, but entire and undivided to the judicial person as a unity in law.\n Hence, for the purpose of a suit, the corporation must appear by its constitutional organs or curators; the appearance of each and every member is no appearance at all. Bro. Corporation, 28; Co. Litt., 66 b.\n A corporation, when it is a universitas ordinata, may be so organized that one or a few of its officers, or a small minority of its members, may exercise all its legal rights and powers, Union Turnpike v. Jenkins, 1 Cai . (N. Y.), 381; but even were the whole body of the society required to pass upon every corporate act, in the spirit of a perfect democracy, yet a majority would be a quorum, and a majority of that quorum would have, in the absence of any restraints in the charter, the supreme disposal of its concerns. The fundamental maxim here is, ubi est major pars, ibi est tota, ( universitas.) \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 522]\n\u00a0\n On principle, therefore, and in the absence of all positive authority to the contrary, it must be considered as wholly immaterial, with a view to the validity of any legal act, what one or a few members of a numerous incorporated society have thought, or wished, or done in regard to it. 'A corporation,' as the greatest jurist of our day expresses it, 'consists of the whole, formed of its members. The will of a corporation is not merely the concurring will of all its members, but that even of a bare majority of them. Therefore, the will of a bare majority of all its existing members is to be regarded as having the disposal, and being invested with all the rights of the corporation. This rule is founded on the law of nature, inasmuch as, if unanimity were demanded, it would be quite impossible for any corporation to will and to act. It is also confirmed by the Roman law.' (Savigny's System of the Roman Law, as it now is, vol. 2, p. 329, sect. 97, cites L., 160, sect. 1, reg. jur., Dig., 50, 17. Refertur ad universos quod public e fit per majorem partem.)\n And so it is by the common law, of which I have just cited the received maxim on this head. Indeed, as Savigny remarks, it must be so in the nature of things; and the consequence is irresistible, that, to set up the will of a few members of a society, artificially organized into a body corporate, against that of the majority or the governing part of it, is to violate fundamental principles, and to confound all ideas of such an association.\n Take the case before the court; domicile, supposing it to depend on the will of the members of a corporation, is, perhaps, a subject of more vital importance than any other that can be submitted to their decision. Great interests of all sorts, as we see in this case, depend upon it. And is it to be tolerated for a moment, as a doctrine of law, that such a question shall be determined by the caprice of every member of the body? According to such a doctrine, no corporation can possibly have a 'local habitation' with its 'name,' or if it have one, be sure of keeping it for any time, although the rule of the common law is the very reverse of this, and requires every corporation to be named of some particular place, evidently with a view to this subject of jurisdiction. 10 Co., 123.\n Nothing can be more irresistible than the conclusion to be drawn from these premises, that a plea to a suit brought against a corporation created, established, and transacting all its business in South Carolina, with its president, directors, and all its constitutional organs there, that one or two individual stockholders reside in a neighboring \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 523]\n\u00a0\n state, and so that the body is exempt from suit in the forum domicilii, is frivolous and impertinent. (See the analogy of commercial partnership, with its house in enemy's country, and one or two members residing in neutral territory, the Antonia Joanna, 1 Wheat., 159). It is a legal absurdity, if there ever was one. A plea that an abbot or prior was an alien n e was never good, for the reason that he was civiliter mortuus, as a monk professed in his natural capacity, and in his corporate character he was a subject of the crown of which his land was held.\n But then, it seems, however cogent, and indeed conclusive, all this reasoning may be, it is too late to urge it. The law has been long settled in this court, that the federal courts will look beyond the charter to see whether the individual members are citizens who have a right, under the Constitution of the United States, to sue in those courts; and while I admit and deplore what I consider a deviation from clear principles, I do not desire any judicial innovation on a rule so well established, however wrong in itself. But what I confidently expect of the court is, that it will push this perverse doctrine expect of beyond the adjudged cases-quod contra rationem juris receptum est, non est producendum ad consequentias; but, on the contrary, looking at the immense inconveniences likely to result from it, will rather narrow it down once more to what it originally was; more especially as the great consideration which moved the judges who decided the first and leading case on the subject was, that unless they were permitted to look beyond the charter there would be a total failure of justice in the federal courts, as to all the rights and responsibilities of corporations; for it is quite manifest that if the three propositions advanced by the counsel for the plaintiffs in error, as legitimate corollaries from the decided cases, be recognized as the law of this court, there will soon be an end of all federal jurisdiction in this most important class of cases.\n I have said that the court, in weighing the considerations of expediency connected with this subject, will be acting in the very spirit of its decision in the leading case in regard to it. This was the Bank of the United States v. Deveaux, 5 Cranch, 61. (So, Lexington Manufacturing Company v. Dorr, 2 Litt., (Ky.), 256, where justice requires it, the court will look into the evidence of the individual members, &c.) The great argument of the counsel of the bank there was, that a corporation not being a citizen of a state, under the words of the Constitution, if the court did not look beyond the charter to the \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 524]\n\u00a0\n individuals that composed the company, there would be a denial of justice in a great number of the most important cases.\n This argument was what principally led the court to the conclusion which they adopted. I confess I do not see the alleged necessity of departing at all from the principle which considers a corporation a legal unit and an ideal person. And, accordingly, the court afterwards, in the case of the Bank of the United States v. The Planters' Bank of Georgia, 9 Wheat., 962, ruled that the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court over a corporation in Georgia was not ousted by the fact that one of its stockhoders was the state itself. In other words, they ruled, Chief Justice Marshall expressly declares, that the state qua stockholder in a private company laid down its sovereignty, and became a citizen, and might be sued as such. But if a state, which is a corporation, and the greatest of all, can be sued as being, under certain circumstances, a citizen in legal contemplation, why should not any other corporation be considered, for the furtherance of a plain constitutional remedy, as a citizen for judicial purposes.\n But conceding that the court was right in this very narrow construction of a great remedial provision in the Constitution, and that it was necessary to look beyond the charter of an incorporated company to give it jurisdiction, the next, and not less important, question was, how far was it necessary or proper to look? Certainly no further then to those who had the control of all the legal interests and rights of the company- to its government, its trustees, representatives, and administrators. This would have been agreeable to all the analogies of the law, which seldom inquires into secondary responsibilities and mere equities. At any rate, the most scrupulous adherence to the letter of the Constitution could not require more than an averment that the majority of an incorporated company were citizens of a different state, for that majority wills and acts for the whole-is, indeed, in legal contemplation, the whole, to all judicial intents and purposes whatsoever.\n Now this leading case of the Bank v. Deveaux settles nothing on this point. There is no intimation in it of any such legal solecism as that all the members of a corporation, without exception, should be of the same state, whether as defendants or plaintiffs. The court strained a point, according to their own view of the subject, to prevent a denial of justice in that case; but that they did not seriously contemplate pushing the matter further than was necessary for that purpose, is, I think, plain, from their recoiling from the application \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 525]\n\u00a0\n of the principle in in Bank of the United States v. The Planters' Bank of Georgia. The attention of the court is particularly called to this latter decision under this head, as it will be under a subsequent one.\n All that they aimed at was to do what the ecclesiastical courts are said to do in England. These tribunals have no power to summon a corporation aggregate to answer before them. 1 Kyd, 277; Skin., 27, 28. They therefore cite the members (that is, the curators, directors, or constitutional organs, who are authorized and bound to appear for the body they represent,) of such companies by their proper names, with the addition of the names of their corporate capacity, but they proceed against them in the latter character, for those courts have no other means of citing them. This is instead of the distringas at common law, which is the only means of compelling an appearance in the civil courts; so that if a corporation have no lands or goods, there is no way to make it appear. In the court Christian, however, though the official or representative members are cited by their proper names, it is only in their political capacity. Skin., 27, 28; 1 Kyd, 227.\n But although the case of the Bank v. Deveaux did not go beyond this practice of the ecclesiastical courts, and with a view to jurisdiction, to bring the parties into court, said only that it would look to the character of the members, without saying what members; and so, in legal contemplation, confined their views to the members representing the corporation, and capable of appearing for it; yet I admit that other cases, especially the recent case of the Bank of Vicksburg v. Slocomb, 14 Pet., did go a step further.\n That case decides that where a corporation sues, if any of its members reside in the state of the defendant, or vice versa, the court has no jurisdiction.\n I admit that this case, if it is to be supported as law settles the doctrine, so far as to treat corporations precisely as if they were private societies or partnerships, but it goes not one step further, even this, as I have attempted to show, is clearly against all principle. But be it so. I have no interest in disputing it for the purposes of this case. This I have already established.\n Suppose, as I argued above, this railroad company to be a private partnership, and the controversy is at an end; for beyond all doubt the act of 1839 would cure any defect in the process or pleadings in the case. \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 526]\n\u00a0\n All that the court, in Slocomb's case, ruled, was that the act of 1839 was not to be construed as enabling the parties, by their own contrivance, to give jurisdiction to the court, by severing a joint suit, and omitting some of the necessary parties to it, over whom the federal courts would have had no jurisdiction under the Constitution.\n Nothing could be clearer under the decision in Curtiss v. Strawbridge, 3 Cranch, 267, than that if some of the members of a company or partnership, plaintiffs, were citizens of the same state with the defendant, this case could not be within the act of 1839, because it was not within the provision of the Constitution itself. The act of 1839 was not to be made unconstitutional by construction. Undoubtedly not; but cessante ratione, cessat lex; and there is not a word or a hint, that in a case clearly within the Constitution, where, namely, the plaintiff is of a different state from all the defendants, and where, consequently, if he could sever his action, he might, beyond all doubt, sue them all in the federal courts, even at common law-he cannot, under the act of 1839, make that very severance and enjoy his constitutional privilege. I say there is not one word to that effect, and 'twere most strange if there were; for I ask again, if the act of 1839 be not made for that very case, for what case was it made? or what is it good for?\n The result of the whole now is, exactly to fulfil the provision of the Constitution in this particular, and to enable every citizen of the United States, who has a claim or complaint against citizens of other states, to assert his privilege under that instrument, whether the ground of action be joint or several. It is a statutable severance of the joint- it is a statutable ratification of the judgment of this court, in Gracie v. Palmer, as to a voluntary appearance in a several suit.\n This, and no more than this, is what we claim, and what the Circuit Court has adjudged we have a right to claim under the law. It is unquestionably our right under the Constitution, and we ask only for that right, and unless the statutes passed to carry it into effect, and therefore to be read in pari materia with it, be mutilated by a subtle and unauthorized construction, the remedy is precisely co-extensive with the right, neither more nor less.\n Since the act of 1839, which was intended to complete and perfect the system established by that of 1789, this case does not rest on the latter act alone. It might, therefore, be safely conceded, that on a strict and subtle construction, it does not fall within that statute.\n But in truth, there is no ground for the objection founded on a \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 527]\n\u00a0\n mere literal interpretation of that statute. The argument proves too much, and so proves nothing. It would exclude all joint suits whatever from the jurisdiction of the federal courts. The words expressly are: 'between a citizen (not citizens) of the state in which the suit is brought and a citizen (not citizens) of another state,' (not other states.) Now, on what principle, can it be pretended that a joint action may be brought against citizens of another state under the word 'citizen,' and yet not against citizens of other states? What is there in the word 'citizen' in the statute, that admits of an obvious and most reasonable generalization in the plural form, that is not in the word 'state?'4\n Only one answer need be given to such interpretation, but it is fatal. It is summed up in a maxim as old as the common law; qui heret in litera heret in cortice.\n But the court, in Gracie and Palmer, seemed to feel no difficulty at all upon the subject, as in truth none ever existed.\n\n 2. \nAs to the objection that the state of South Carolina is a stockholder, much of the reasoning upon the first point is applicable to this. But there is no possible escape from the doctrine of the court in the case of the Bank of the United States v. The Planters' Bank of Georgia, 9 Wheat. Either the state qua stockholder in a private company, as Chief Justice Marshall in that case, and the jus gentium everywhere affirm, is to be regarded as a citizen, and so suable in the Circuit Court, or it is still a sovereign, and not suable at all. In the former hypothesis, there is no difficulty under the Constitution; in the latter, the common law obviates all objections to proceeding without such a party.\n The rule of pleading, as to parties (defendants) not legally responsible, is to omit them entirely in an action. This is the case even where they are expressly and on the fact of the contract parties to it; a multo fortiori where they are only so consequentially and by construction. Actus legis nemini facit injuriam. The state of South Carolina is no party eo nomine to this covenant; but if her interest as a stockholder makes her so by construction of law, then, being by the supposition not suable as a sovereignty anywhere, she must be \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 528]\n\u00a0\n considered as in legal contemplation not existing at all. 4 Taunt., 468; 1 Wils., 89. If a married woman in New York were one of a partnership or voluntary appociation carrying on its business in Charleston, as this railroad company does, it would be no sort of objection to the jurisdiction, as between Letson and the others. It would be a ground of nonsuit to join her in a suit with persons legally responsible. So of an infant. Their names must be omitted altogether; and if the non-joinder were pleaded, the reply of infancy or coverture would be conclusive. (When a man is bound to an abbot, and J. N. not styling him monk in the bond, nevertheless the abbot alone shall have the action, and shall surmise that the other obligee was his commoign (and so incapable in law) at the time. Bro. Abr. Dette, 191.) It would be an unheard of irregularity, nay, a gross infringement of law, to violate this fundamental rule of pleading and practice, merely to oust the jurisdiction in such a case.\n It is obvious that the very same principle applies in the case of a sovereignty, that is, a political person not legally responsible, member of a voluntary joint-stock company, or party to a joint contract, if as a member it is not considered as a mere private person.\n Either way the jurisdiction is clear on principle, besides being conclusively settled by the case in 9 Wheat.\n\n 3. \nThe third objection is a reductio ad absurdum of the principle of the Bank of Vicksburg v. Slocomb, 14 Pet.\n Where shall we stop? Not only do we look beyond the parties to the action, the constitutional organs of the first corporation, to see whether none of its members are citizens of the same state with the plaintiffs, we are now asked to carry this process of perversion ad infinitum. If we find out one of the members to be a corporation, we are to look still further, and if it be shown that of this corporation one share has been transferred, it may be in trust, or by way of pledge to another, then the court is not to meddle with an action against the first corporation. But suppose we find that a member of the second corporation is a third, and of that a fourth in an infinite series: Is this seriously put forth as the doctrine of this court, or is it meant as a jest upon it?\n The great moving cause, as I have shown, that influenced the court in Deveaux's case, was to authorize its jurisdiction in a category of all others the most important, and to prevent a failure of justice, just as the case in Skinner shows that the courts Christian summoned the natural person, whom they wished to hold responsible \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 529]\n\u00a0\n as an artificial one, ex necessitate. But now, it seems, this is to be done for the very opposite purpose, and the plainest rules of law to be broken through, in order to do injustice and to withhold a constitutional right.\n To sum up the argument in a few words, a corporation, as such, has no persona standi in judicio in the federal courts, where the case is between citizens of one state and citizens of another; but for advancing the remedy and doing justice, and for no other purpose, the court will look beyond the charter to the individual members. In other respects, and to other purposes, the existence of the corporation is not noticed quoad hoc in those courts.\n On the whole, the case appears to me a very clear one. The mischiefs prevented by the judgment below are of the most serious character; and not only does no legal or constitutional difficulty stand in the way, but every consideration of right and justice, and the very principle of the leading case of the Bank v. Deveaux, imperatively require that the court should maintain the jurisdiction.\n Mazyck, in reply, for the plaintiffs in error.\n In addition to the argument formerly submitted, (to which the attention of the court is again solicited,) and by way of reply to the views put forward by the two learned counsel for the defendant in error, it is proposed now to offer some further remarks in support of the objections to the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court. Before noticing in detail the particular points made by the learned counsel on the other side, it may be well, as the clearest and most convenient method of proceeding, to premise one or two general observations, which will perhaps be found to cover them all.\n In actions by or against corporations in the Circuit Courts of the United States, in which the jurisdiction depends on the character of the parties, in other words, where there is no other ground of jurisdiction than that the suit is one 'to which an alien is a party,' or that it is 'between a citizen of the state in which the suit is brought, and a citizen of another state,' the court looks beyond the corporation to the individuals of which it is composed, for the purpose of ascertaining whether they have the requisite character, and for no other purpose. That being ascertained, the veil of the corporation is again thrown over the individuals, and in all other respects-in all matters of procedure-in all things concerning rights, obligations and remedies, the Circuit Court, like the ordinary tribunals of general \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 530]\n\u00a0\n jurisdiction, loses sight of the individuals, and sees nothing but the legal entity, the corporation. The questions of jurisdiction, and of procedure, are totally distinct from, and independent of each other, and there can be no just reasoning from one to the other.\n Again-the jurisdiction of the Circuit Courts of the United States is limited by their fundamental law, to certain specified descriptions of cases only, and even the consent of parties cannot give them jurisdiction of cases not falling within one or other of the specified descriptions.\n A court of general and unlimited jurisdiction, may be unable to take cognizance of a cause, from the want of power to bring the parties before it. For example, a court of unlimited jurisdiction in South Carolina may be unable to take cognizance of a claim against a resident of New York, not found in South Carolina, and having no property there, from the want of means to bring the defendant before the court. So a court of limited jurisdiction, having jurisdiction only of a certain class of cases, may be unable to take cognizance of a case belonging to the prescribed class, from the want of power to bring the parties before it. This is sometimes called want of jurisdiction, but it is a very different thing from the inability of a court having jurisdiction only of a certain class of cases, to take cognizance of a case not within the prescribed class. The one is the want of jurisdiction of the party only, which may be removed by the consent or appearance of the party, the other is a want of jurisdiction of the cause, which cannot be removed by consent of parties. The case of Gracie v. Palmer, 8 Wheat., 690, so often referred to by the counsel for the defendants in error, furnishes an illustration of this distinction.\n That was an action brought in the Circuit Court of the United States in Pennsylvania, by aliens against citizens of New York. Being a suit to which 'an alien was a party,' it was by the express terms of the 11th section of the Judiciary act of 1789, within the jurisdiction of the court. But though the cause was within the jurisdiction of the court, the defendants were not subject to its jurisdiction, because they were not inhabitants of the district of Pennsylvania, nor were they found in that district to be served with process, and one of the provisos of the 11th section of the act of 1789 is, that 'no civil suit shall be brought before a Circuit or District Court, against an inhabitant of the United States, by any original process, in any other district than that whereof he is an inhabitant, or in which \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 531]\n\u00a0\n he shall be found at the time of serving the writ.' The defendants, however, voluntarily appeared, and afterwards objected to the jurisdiction of the court, because it did not appear on the record that they were inhabitants of, or found in Pennsylvania at the time of serving the writ. But Chief Justice Marshall, delivering the judgment of this court, said, 'the uniform construction of the clause referred to, had been that it was not necessary to aver on the record that the defendant was an inhabitant of the district or found therein. It was sufficient if the court appeared to have jurisdiction by the citizenship or alienage of the parties. The exemption from arrest in a district of which the defendant was not an inhabitant, or was not found at the time of serving the process, was the privilege of the defendant, which he might waive by a voluntary appearance. If process was returned by the marshal, as served upon him within the district, it was sufficient, and where the defendant voluntarily appeared in the court below, without taking the exception, it was an admission of the service, and a waiver of any further inquiry into the matter.'\n That the cause should be within the jurisdiction of the court, that is to say, that it should belong to one of those classes of cases of which alone the court is authorized to take cognizance, is indispensable: that the parties should be before the court is matter of procedure and of the service of process. If the defendant is not an inhabitant of, or found within the district, he cannot be brought before the court by any compulsory process, but if he voluntarily appears, he is before the court, and then the court having jurisdiction of the cause, and having the parties before it, it would be strange if it declined to take cognizance of the matter, for no other reason, than that if the defendant had not voluntarily appeared, he could not have been compelled to appear.\n If the principles above stated be kept steadily in view, it is believed, that all the points raised by the learned counsel in answer to the argument against the jurisdiction of the court in this case, will vanish, one after another, as they are approached.\n In the first place it is said, that, according to all the authorities, it is sufficient that all the members of the corporation sued, are citizens of some other state than that of which the plaintiff is a citizen. But there is no authority which says, that where the jurisdiction depends on the citizenship of the parties, a citizen of one state may bring an action in the Circuit Court in another state, against a citizen of that state, and a citizen of a third state. If it had ever been so decided, \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 532]\n\u00a0\n the decision would be utterly inconsistent with the highest authority, the Judiciary act itself, which expressly limits the jurisdiction to cases between citizens of the state in which the suit is brought, and citizens of another state, and the court would rather conform to the plain language and meaning of the act, than to a judicial decision or dictum clearly conflicting with it.\n But it is now, for the first time suggested, that in an action by or against a corporation, the citizenship of the governing members only need be inquired into, or, in other words, that an action by or against a corporation, is an action by or against the official members alone.\n In Curtiss v. Strawbridge, 3 Cranch, 267, it was saie that each distinct interest must be represented by persons, all of whom must be capable of suing, or liable to be sued in the federal courts.\n The word 'represented,' used by the court in that case, is seized upon by the counsel, and it is said, the governing members of a corporation represent the interests of the corporation; therefore, they are the real parties, and it is sufficient, if they have the requisite citizenship, to give the court jurisdiction. But in order to understand the true meaning of the court, we must advert to the fact that the suit was on the equity side of the court, where there may be several defendants having distinct interests from each other, and where it may happen that a complete decree may be made between some of the parties without affecting the interests of others.\n Each party having an interest, is said to represent that interest. If several persons have the same interest, they jointly represent that interest, and if they all have the requisite citizenship, and a complete decree can be made as against them, without affecting other defendants having a different interest, notwithstanding such other defendants, or some of them, have not the requisite citizenship, the court will proceed to adjudicate between the complainant and the defendants, who have the requisite citizenship. Carneal v. Banks, 10 Wheat., 181.\n In an action by or against a corporation, the corporate name represents the rights and interests of the corporation, that is to say, the corporate rights and interests of the members of the corporation, in the subject-matter of the suit-not the governing members only, but all the members; for though the governing members ordinarily manage the business of the corporation, the corporate rights and interests belong to all the members, not according to their official \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 533]\n\u00a0\n rank, but in proportion to their respective shares of interest in the corporation.\n It is said that the governing members have the e right to sue, and may be compelled to plead, and are therefore the real plaintiffs or defendants. But that a private member can neither sue nor prevent a suit, nor can his admissions be given in evidence against the company\n It is true that a single private member cannot sue, nor prevent a suit, nor could one only of the governing members, but the private members, acting together in their corporate capacity, might control the action of the official members, and cause a suit to be brought or defended. It would seem from the principle of the case of The King v. The Inhabitants of Hardwicke, 11 East, 379, that the admissions of a private member might be given in evidence against the company; for, having an interest in the suit, he could not be made a witness. But if the admissions of a private member could not be given in evidence, so neither could the admissions of a single director. For the acts or declarations of a single director, or of any one not authorized to act alone for the company, are not the acts or declarations of the company, and the interest of a single director, or even of the president, may be less than that of a private stockholder.\n Again-it is said that a private member cannot be summoned or distrained to answer to a demand against a corporation. The rule is that for a public concern the sheriff cannot distrain any individual member. 2 Bac. Abr. E. 2 note; Thursfield v. Jones, Skin., 27. It is true that a summons is served upon the chief officer of the company, but it is a summons of the company, not of the chief officer, who is only the organ through whom it is communicated to the company. If upon this summons the corporation does not appear, there is no further process either against the person or property of the head of the corporation, any more than against the person or property of any private member; but the process to compel the corporation to appear is a distringas against the corporate property.\n But the manner of requiring the appearance of a corporation is mere matter of procedure, and even if it were allowable to reason from matter of procedure to the question of jurisdiction, so that only the individual upon whom process is served should be regarded as the real defendant, the summons which is served upon the head of the corporation is not the original process, but a mere preliminary notice which may always be dispensed with. The real process is \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 534]\n\u00a0\n the distringas, which is not served upon the head or governing members of the corporation, but is levied upon its property. And if the summons were the original process, that is served upon the head of the corporation only, and not upon all the governing members, and by this rule the president would be the only defendant, and it would be sufficient if he had the requisite citizenship.\n If in an action against a corporation, no member can be regarded as a defendant, against whom there is no process to compel him to appear, then no member, either official or private, can be a defendant, for there is absolutely no process by which any one of them can be compelled to appear; the only process is against the property of the corporation, which belongs not to the official members only, but to all the members in their corporate capacity.\n It is not pretended that any individual member of a corporation has a right to be heard as a party objecting to the jurisdiction, nor does the objection in this case come from any individual member; it comes from the corporation, that is, from all the members in their corporate capacity. It is not, that Baring and Rutherford object, that being citizens of North Carolina, they cannot be sued in South Carolina, but the corporation objects that the action being against the corporation, and Baring and Rutherford being members of the corporation, it is an action against them, as well as against the other members, and is therefore not a suit between 'citizens of the state in which the suit is brought, and a citizen of another state.'\n A corporation in South Carolina cannot be sued in North Carolina, by proceeding against a private member, or any member domiciled there, neither can it be sued in South Carolina, by proceeding against any member domiciled there. But it is no solecism, that the corporation cannot be sued in the Circuit Court, because A., one of the members, is a citizen of North Carolina, and yet that A. cannot be sued anywhere for the same cause.\n If one of the members, or at all events if one of the directors were a citizen of New York, it is conceded that the corporation could not be sued in the Circuit Court in South Carolina, nor could the New York member or director be sued in any court in New York for the same cause, yet where is the solecism in this? It is simply that the Circuit Court is a court of limited jurisdiction, and that the case is not within the jurisdiction. If the action were brought in a court of general jurisdiction, it would be no objection that some, or even \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 535]\n\u00a0\n all of the members of the corporation were citizens of North Carolina or New York.\n That the plaintiff cannot sue the corporation in the Circuit Court, because some of the members of the corporation are citizens of North Carolina, is no more than happens to every plaintiff whose case is not within the jurisdiction of that court; justice is not therefore denied him, it is only necessary for him to seek it in another tribunal.\n The relation of the governing members of a corporation to the private members, is rather that of agents than of trustees. If they were trustees, suits by and against the corporation ought to be brought in their proper names, and not in the corporate name which represents all the members in their corporate character, and not the governing members alone.\n It does not follow, that because in matters of procedure a particular member of a corporation is not noticed as a party, therefore he shall not be noticed in the matter of jurisdiction. In matters of procedure, a particular director is no more noticed as a party to the record than a particular private member; why then should the citizenship of a director determine the jurisdiction any more than that of a private member?\n That the particular members of a corporation have never been noticed as parties, except to defeat the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court is not true. In the Bank of the United States v. Deveaux they were noticed for the purpose of sustaining the jurisdiction, which could not otherwise have been supported.\n The residence of a corporation is not determined by the residence of its members, nor by that of the president and directors. A corporation created by a law of South Carolina, and for an object to be pursued in South Carolina, must have its location there, and nowhere else. Its artificial being, as a creature of the law of South Carolina, can only exist where that law is in force. The individual members, or even the president and directors, might be anywhere else, but the body corporate would still be there. It is by no means clear that a corporation is held to reside where its principal office is. In the case of the Bank of the United States v. McKenzie, 2 Brock., 393, in which it was contended that the bank resided in Philadelphia, and therefore was not affected by the statute of limitations of Virginia, Chief Justice Marshall says, 'the counsel for the plaintiff contends that the corporation resides in Philadelphia. How is this to be sustained? The corporate body consists of all the stockholders, and acts by a name \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 536]\n\u00a0\n comprehending all the stockholders. These stockholders reside all over the United States, but being in their corporate capacity, in which alone they act, a mere legal entity, invisible, inaudible, incorporeal, they act by agents. It may well be doubted, and is doubted, whether the residence of those agents can fix the residence of the corporation,' and the statute of limitations prevailed against the bank. Perhaps the true view of the matter is, that the corporate existence of the Bank of the United States, being a law of the United States, the corporation must be held to be wherever that law prevails. But however this may be, there is a wide difference between residence and citizenship. A corporation may have a residence, but, as this court has solemnly decided, it cannot be a citizen.\n The supposed analogy between a corporation and a state is rather fanciful than real. When a state is called a corporation, or a corporation a state, it is a mere figure of speech. They are as different from each other as the creator and the thing created. A state is the lawmaker, above and independent of the law. A corporation is a creature of the law, a modified association of individuals, and, like other associations of individuals, subject to the law.\n Nor is it invariably true, that in political societies public acts are referred to the persons who have the administration of the government. In England the public property, and other public rights, are vested in the king, and suits concerning them are brought in his name, but in these states the public property and rights are vested in the commonwealth, and not in any individual, and suits concerning them are brought in the name of the commonwealth, and not referred to any individual more than another as the plaintiff. The public business is necessarily done by agents, and these agents, like other agents, are trustees as to the powers with which they are invested, but the acts which they do within the limits of their powers are referred to the commonwealth, and not to them, as individuals.\n It is true that before the 11th amendment of the constitution, the states were liable to be sued, but t not as corporations. They were liable to be sued as states, because by the Constitution, as it stood before the 11th amendment, th judicial power extended to controversies 'between a state, and citizens of another state, and between a state and foreign states, citizens or subjects.' Without this provision of the Constitution, it would surely never have been pretended, that because the individuals having the administration of the state government were citizens of the state, or because the state was composed \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 537]\n\u00a0\n of its citizens, a suit between two states, or between a state and a citizen of another state, was a suit between citizens of different states, and therefore within the jurisdiction of the federal judiciary.\n The case of London and Wood, 12 Mod. 669, does not show that only the official members of a corporation will be noticed as parties. The judgment was reversed, because the mayor was both plaintiff and judge. The strong good sense of the common law would not permit substantial justice to be sacrificed to a legal fiction, by suffering the same person to be plaintiff in one capacity, and judge in another. True, it was said the objection would not have prevailed if one of the aldermen had been plaintiff,-not because he would not have been noticed as a member of the corporation, but because he would not have been both plaintiff and judge. Hatsell, Baron, said-'if one of the aldermen should bring an action before the mayor and aldermen, that may be a good judgment, because it may be a court of mayor and aldermen without him, and the plaintiff would not be an essential part of the court.' But the mayor is an essential part of the court. No doubt if each individual of the commonalty had been an essential part of the court, he would have been noticed as a party. As to suits in the name of the people of the state being tried before a judge who is one of the people, that is a matter of unavoidable necessity, and besides, the judge has no more interest in the suit than anybody else, not more than even the defendant himself.\n It is true that a corporation acts by the agency of natural persons, but no principle is more familiar than that the acts of an agent, acting within the limits of his agency, are referred to the principal, and regarded as the acts of the principal only, and not of the agent. A corporation sues and defends suits by attorney. He is the natural person by whom the personal acts of suing and defending are done, yet nobody ever imagined that he is the party to the suit. The official members are concerned in the suit in their corporate character as well as the private members, and it is as much confounding the distinction between the natural and corporate character, to call the official members parties to the suit, as it is to call the private members parties. To say that the corporate name represents the private members not as persons, but as a faculty, and the official members alone as individuals or persons, is an incomprehensible refinement-very little better, in fact, than a mere jargon of words without meaning. The truth of the matter is well expressed by Chief Justice Marshall in the Bank of the United States v. McKenzie, 2 Brock., 393. \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 538]\n\u00a0\n 'The president and directors at Philadelphia are neither the nominal nor real plaintiffs. The nominal plaintiffs are the president, directors, and company; the real plaintiffs are all the stockholders: the corporate body consists of all the stockholders, and acts by a name comprehending all the stockholders.'\n But in point of fact, this action is brought against all the members of the corporation in their corporate character, and not against the official members only. The corporation is sued as one whose members are citizens of South Carolina. If the official members only are to be regarded as parties, why was it not sued as a corporation whose president and directors are citizens of South Carolina?\n It seems to be admitted, that though by the Constitution the judicial power of the United States extends to cases between citizens of different states, the Judiciary act confers jurisdiction on the Circuit Courts only, as between citizens of the state where the suit is brought, and citizens of another state. But it is said that since the act of 1839, when one of two parties to a joint contract is sued, he cannot plead the non-joinder of the other party who resides in another state, and is not found in the district where the suit is brought. This is because the act of 1839 authorizes the plaintiff to sue each of the parties separately, as if the contract were joing and several. But the suit must still be 'between a citizen of the state in which the suit is brought, and a citizen of another state.' And therefore a citizen of New York, having two joint debtors, one a citizen of Pennsylvania, and the other a citizen of Virginia, could not sue either of them in the Circuit Court in New Jersey, and even the voluntary appearance of the defendant would not give the court jurisdiction of the case. And if they were found in Pennsylvania, and sued jointly in the Circuit Court there, they might plead to the jurisdiction that the case was not one between citizens of the state in which the suit was brought, and a citizen of another state; nor would the voluntary appearance of the citizen of Virginia make it such a case, so as to bring it within the jurisdiction.\n The objection in this case is not that some of the defendants are sued in a district in which they were not found, but that a suit is brought in the Circuit Court in South Carolina by a citizen of New York, against citizens of South Carolina, and citizens of North Carolina; for a suit against a corporation is a suit against all the members in their corporate character. If Baring and Rutherfore had happened to be in South Carolina when the suit was commenced, \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 539]\n\u00a0\n still being citizens of North Carolina, it would not be a suit 'between citizens of the state in which the suit is brought, and a citizen of another state.' And the voluntary appearance and consent of Baring and Rutherford, and every other member of the corporation, each in his natural character, and of all the members collectively in their corporate character, would not remove the objection.\n All the members of the corporation may be said, in a certain ideal and fictitious sense, to be residents of South Carolina in their corporate character, because the corporation of which they are members resides there. But the corporation is not a citizen, and therefore they are not citizens of South Carolina in their corporate character. By becoming members of the corporation, they have subjected themselves to be sued in their corporate character in any court of general jurisdiction in South Carolina, but they could not, either by a general or particular consent, give jurisdiction to the Circuit Court, of a cause of which it is not authorized by its fundamental law to take cognisance.\n Again, it is said that if the company were a co-partnership, having its office and carrying on business in South Carolina, and Baring and Rutherford, two of the partners, residing in North Carolina, their appearance would be dispensed with; and this position is founded on the act of 1839. Since that act it is conceded that if they were partners in an incorporated company, they might have been omitted altogether, and then all the defendants being citizens of South Carolina, the jurisdiction would be clear. But if they were included in the action, and described in the writ and declaration as citizens of North Carolina, so that it appeared on the record that the suit was not one 'between citizens of the state in which the suit was brought, and a citizen of another state,' it is very difficult to conceive how the jurisdiction could be sustained. Or if they were described as citizens of South Carolina, and voluntarily appeared and pleaded, not that they were not found in the district of South Carolina, which is mere matter of procedure, and is waived by the appearance, but that they were citizens of North Carolina, so that the case was not between citizens of South Carolina and a citizen of New York, which is matter of jurisdiction, there can be no doubt that as to them the plea must have prevailed. Though, perhaps, the court might then have proceeded against the other defendants as if they had never been joined. But however this may be in the case of a mere partnership, it is wholly out of the question in the case of a corporation. \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 540]\n\u00a0\n Who ever yet heard of an action or a judgment against a part only of the members of a corporation on a contract of the corporation?\n Surely if any thing is settled beyond all controversy, it is that an individual member of a corporation, or any number of members less than the whole united under the corporate name, and in the corporate character, cannot be sued on a contract of the corporation. That indeed is the very thing which constitutes the chief inducement to the formation of incorporated companies.\n There could be no action in this contract, but against the corporation, by the corporate name, which includes all the members in their corporate character and connection-those who are citizens of North Carolina, as well as those who are citizens of South Carolina; nor could there be any judgment which would not include the North Carolina members with those in South Carolina. An action against a corporation is an action against all the members of the corporation, in the corporate name and character, which necessarily imply the corporate union and association of all the members, and exclude the idea of any separate identity or liability, with reference to the subject matter of the suit.\n But it is said that Baring and Rutherford, considered as partners, were dormant partners, and that dormant partners, as defendants, are not only not necessary parties, but are not allowed to become parties to the record, where they were not so to the contract, and thus to defeat by surprise (which might be a fraud) a plaintiff who had never heard of them.\n They were no more dormant partners than any other stockholders, not more even than the directors. There is nothing in the name of the corporation to indicate who are the president and directors, any more than who are the private members, and it is almost as easy in point of fact, for a stranger to ascertain who are the private members as who are the official members. The corporation is sued, as it must be, by the corporate name, and no individual member can come in and say, I ought to be included in the action, and am not, nor can the whole body say, there is a member who ought to be and is not included in the action. Whoever is a member is included under the corporate name, and whoever is not included under the corporate name, is not a member. DeMautort v. Sanders, 1 Barn. & Ad., 398, is no more than this.\n Again-it is said that if Baring and Rutherford appeared voluntarily, it is certain the court would have jurisdiction, for so says the act \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 541]\n\u00a0\n of 1839. But the act of 1839 says no such thing. It does not enlarge the jurisdiction of the Circuit Courts, so as to make it extend to all suits between citizens of different states, no matter where brought, provided the defendants can be found in the district, or voluntarily appear. It leaves the matter of jurisdiction depending on the citizenship of the parties, confined as it was by the act of 1789, to cases 'between citizens of the state in which the suit is brought, and citizens of other states,' and only provides that when the case is within the jurisdiction, that is, when it is a case between citizens of the state in which the suit is brought, and citizens of another state,' if the defendants voluntarily appear, though not inhabitants of, or found in the district, the court may proceed to adjudicate the cause; or if some of them are found in the district, or voluntarily appear, and others are not found, and do not appear, those who are found, or do appear, may be proceeded against without prejudice to the others. For example, the Circuit Court in New York would have jurisdiction of a suit brought by a citizen of New York, against several defendants citizens of South Carolina and North Carolina, because it would be a case 'between a citizen of the state in which the suit was brought, and citizens of other states,' but unless the defendants were found in New York, or voluntarily appeared, they could not be proceeded against. Since the act of 1839, if either of them was found in New York, or voluntarily appeared, he might be proceeded against alone, and could not plead the non-joinder of the others. This is the effect of the judicial exposition given to the proviso of the 11th section of the act of 1789, in Gracie and Palmer, 8 Wheat., 690, and of the act of 1839.\n But the Circuit Court in New Jersey would not have jurisdiction of a suit between the same parties, because neither of them being a citizen of New Jersey, it would not be a case 'between a citizen of the state in which the suit was brought, and citizens of other states,' and even if the defendants were found in New Jersey, or voluntarily appeared, they could not be proceeded against; for to use the language of the attorney-general in this very case, 'who ever heard before that the voluntary appearance of a citizen of a state gives jurisdiction to the federal courts in a case in which that jurisdiction depends, not on the character of the cause, or the state of the pleadings, or the service of process-still less the will of an individual-but simply on the fact of citizenship or no citizenship, or as \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 542]\n\u00a0\n it is commonly expressed, on the character of the parties; that is, on a distinct and ascertained civil status in the parties.'\n Now the civil status on which the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court depends is, that the parties on one side should be citizens of the state in which the suit is brought, and those on the other side, citizens of one or more of the other states; and as citizens of North Carolina are and must be included as defendants in this action with citizens of South Carolina, under the corporate name, neither the plaintiff nor defendants are citizens of the state in which the suit is brought, and therefore the parties have not the civil status necessary to give the court jurisdiction, and the want of this necessary status cannot be supplied by consent.\n Again-it is said that corporations aggregate in this country are without the capacity of contracting, except through guardians, trustees, or curators, and that in this respect they are like minors and lunatics; yet nothing is more certain than that in all the corporations with which we are acquainted in this country, the ultimate power of making by-laws for the government of the corporation, and of otherwise controlling the action of the official members, resides in the body of the members, and is frequently exercised by them; but who ever heard of a minor, or a lunatic, prescribing rules for the government of his guardian or curator?\n But it is affirmed that in a corporation all the parts are not the whole. Now nothing is more true than that a corporation aggregate, consisting of a given number of individuals, is in legal contemplation, for all puposes of administration, rights, obligations, and procedure, a different thing from the aggregate of the individuals composing it. The legal entity, the corporation, is a different thing from the natural persons, the members, but it is nevertheless true, that the corporation includes all the members, and that any one of them is just as much a part of the corporation as any other. It is not denied that in the language of Savigny, cited by the learned counsel, 'a corporation consists of the whole formed of its members,' but it is not always true that the will of a bare numerical majority of the members is the will of the corporation, and has the disposal of, and is invested with all the rights of the corporation. That depends upon the charter. In all cases it is necessary that the concurring will of a part of the members should constitute the will of the corporation, since the concurrence of all the members would be generally impracticable. \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 543]\n\u00a0\n But admitting all that is said on this point, the will of one, or a few, or even a majority of the members of a corporation, has nothing to do with the domicile of the corporation. Does any body suppose that if nine- tenths of the members of this corporation were citizens, and residents of New York, the domicile of the corporation would be any less in South Carolina than if all the members were citizens and residents of South Carolina; or that it would be any less liable to be sued in South Carolina in a court of general jurisdiction; or that it could be sued in any court in New York.\n It might be frivolous and impertinent in a court of general jurisdiction to plead to a suit brought against a corporation, created, established, and transacting all its business in South Carolina, that one or two individual stockholders reside in a neighboring state, and therefore the corporation is exempt from suit in the forum domicilii. Such a plea would be wholly inadmissible if the plaintiff had brought his action in the state court of South Carolina, the real forum domicilii. But it is neither frivolous nor impertinent when the action is brought in the Circuit Court in South Carolina, which certainly has no jurisdiction of the cause, unless it is a suit between citizens of South Carolina and a citizen or citizens of some other state, (the corporation itself not being a citizen of any state, and the jurisdiction depending on the citizenship of the members,) to plead that two of the members are not citizens of South Carolina, but citizens of North Carolina.\n Again-it is said that in the Bank of the United States v. Deveaux, the court looked beyond the corporation to the individuals composing it only for the purpose of sustaining the jurisdiction, and the Bank of the United States v. The Planters' Bank of Georgia is invoked to show that they will not look beyond the corporation to defeat the jurisdiction. The truth is, that the court looks beyond the corporation neither for the purpose of sustaining nor defeating the jurisdiction, but simply for the purpose of ascertaining whether the citizenship of the parties is such as to bring the cause within the jurisdiction. If in the Bank of the United States v. Deveaux, they had found that some of the stockholders of the Bank of the United States were citizens of the same state with the defendants, so that it was not a case 'between citizens of different states,' or that one of the defendants was a citizen of some other state than Georgia, so that it was not a case 'between citizens of the state in which the suit was brought, and \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 544]\n\u00a0\n citizens of another state,' they would certainly not have taken cognisances of the cause.\n There is no reason to believe that the course of this court, with respect to suits by or against corporations, was at all influenced by the alleged practice of the ecclesiastical courts in England, of which not the least notice was taken in the leading case of the Bank of the United States v. Deveaux.\n The only point of resemblance is, that both look beyond the corporation to the individual members, but the ecclesiastical courts dealing only in ecclesiastical censures and discipline, which would be powerless and nugatory against the corporation or its property, proceed directly against the persons of the members, who are cited by their proper names with the addition of their corporate style; whereas, this court looks beyond the corporation only to ascertain whether the citizenship of the members is such as to give it jurisdiction, and that being ascertained, proceeds against the corporation.\n The ecclesiastical courts, it is to be observed, take notice of and proceed against all the members, and not the curators or directors only, as the counsel suppose. In the case of Thursfield v. Jones, Skin., 27, 28, the Master and Wardens of the Waxchandlers Co. were the whole corporation.\n It is said that at all events it is sufficient that a majority of the members should have the requisite citizenship; for that a majority wills and acts for the corporation, and is indeed the corporation. But, besides that, it is not always or generally true, that the ultimate power to will and act for a corporation resides in a numerical majority of the members; even if it were true, yet there is a very clear and obvious distinction between the majority of a body of individuals and the whole body. If a majority of the members be indeed the whole corporation, then it follows as a matter of course, that the minority are no part of the corporation. By parity of reasoning, if the members of a mere co-partnership should agree that a majority of the partners should control its affairs, such majority would be the partnership, and suit might be brought against the partnership in the Circuit Court of the United States, by a person who was a citizen of the same state of which the minority of the co-partnership were citizens.\n It is admitted by the learned counsel that the case of the Bank of Vicksburg v. Slocomb, 14 Pet., settles the doctrine so far as to treat corporations precisely as if they were private partnerships; but \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 545]\n\u00a0\n this is only with reference to the question of jurisdiction as depending on the citizenship of the parties. That case is very far from having settled that as to the rights and obligations of the individual members, and the mode of judicial procedure a corporation is to be regarded as if it were a private partnership. And it is useless to appeal to the act of 1839 to sustain that position. It is impossible so to torture that act as to make it mean that a party having a demand against a corporation, founded on a contract of the corporation, might sue a part of the members, and obtain judgment against them exclusively of the rest. In the case of a private partnership Congress might authorize the suing of a part of the members of the firm for a partnership obligation, because they are all individually bound, and whether they shall be proceeded against jointly or severally is mere matter of procedure. But nothing is more certain, indeed nothing has been more strenuously insisted on by the learned counsel themselves, than that the members of a corporation are not individually bound by the obligations of the corporation. How then can Congress be supposed to have intended to enact, that in the courts of the United States a part of the members of a corporation should be held bound by the contracts of the corporation, and that judgment should be given against them on account of such contracts? Surely such a law, not merely regulating the procedure of the courts, but totally changing the relative rights and obligations of the parties to a contract, and creating new obligations and liabilities entirely different from those which the parties intended to contract, would be utterly inconsistent with the plainest principles of constitutional liberty and common right. And nothing but the most unequivocal language could induce the court to suppose that such was the intention of Congress.\n If the defendants in error found themselves upon the act of 1839, to be consistent, they ought to have entered their judgment only against the South Carolina members. That would have been their proper course, and it would have been something novel and original, but they have entered their judgment against the corporation by its corporate name, including the North Carolina members as well as the rest.\n It is said that the construction of the act of 1789, for which we contend, is inadmissible, because it would exclude all joint suits whatever from the jurisdiction of the federal courts-that the words are 'between a citizen (not citizens) of the state in which the suit \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 546]\n\u00a0\n is brought, and a citizen (not citizens) of another state,' and it is asked very triumphantly why a plural signification should be given to the word citizen, so as to permit joint actions to be brought, and not to the word state, so as to embrace actions between citizens of several different states. There is no reason why the word state should not be generalized by a plural construction as well as the word citizen; and accordingly it has been freely admitted throughout the whole argument, that an action might be brought in the Circuit Court by or against citizens of several states, provided it was between 'citizens of the state in which the suit was brought, and citizens of other states,' as it might well be. But there is a reason so obvious, that it is surprising, and almost incredible, it should have escaped the notice of the learned counsel, why the words 'state in which the suit is brought' should not have a plural construction, and that is simply, that the state in which the suit is brought can be but one.\n\n 2. \nAs to the objection that the state of South Carolina is a stockholder, it is said that if an infant, or a married woman, a citizen of New York, were one of a partnership in Charleston, it would be no objection as between the plaintiff, a citizen of New York, and the other partners, citizens of South Carolina, because the infant, or married woman, not being suable at all, would be omitted, and the action would be brought only against the other partners, and so the state of South Carolina, not being suable, cannot be regarded for any purpose as a defendant to this suit, and therefore the other members of the corporation are the only defendants. Passing over the obvious distinction, that the infant and married woman are omitted, because, being incapable of contracting, the contract is in fact only the contract of the other parties, and that the state is capable of contracting, as this court has repeatedly determined. Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch, 87; New Jersey v. Wilson, 7 Cranch, 164; Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 4 Wheat., 578; Green v. Biddle, 8 Wheat., 1. There is another and a conclusive answer to this argument.\n There is no doubt that infants and married women may be members of a corporation, and in their corporate character would be bound with the other members by the contracts of the corporation. It is equally certain that an action against the corporation would be as much an action against them as against the other members, and that their coverture or infancy would not protect them in their corporate interests from judgment and its consequences. In other words, \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 547]\n\u00a0\n though not capable of contracting or suable in their natural character, as members of a corporation, in their corporate character they are both-and the counsel cannot forget that they themselves, in this very case, have cited The Bank of the United States v. The Planters' Bank of Georgia, to show that a state, as a member of a corporation, is suable in the corporate name with the other members.\n\n 3. \nThe third objection, it is said, resolves itself into the question whether Mr. Laffan is a defendant in this suit, or, in other words, a member of the Louisville, Cincinnati, and Charleston Railroad Company.\n According to the law of corporations, Mr. Laffan is not a defendant; and so, according to the same law, no individual member of the railroad company is a defendant. But according to the Constitution of the United States, as interpreted by this court, with reference to the jurisdiction of the federal judiciary, either Laffan is a defendant, or the Bank of Charleston in its corporate character is a defendant; and in either case the jurisdiction cannot be sustained. It is said if he was a member, he would be entitled to the same privileges with other members, but he is incapable of doing any act which it requires a member of the company to do. By the law of the corporation he is not a member. That law regards only the Bank of Charleston in its corporate character as a member, and does not see or recognize the individuals of which it is composed. But this court is not governed by that law in deciding the question of jurisdiction. With reference to that question, it regards only the individuals composing the Bank of Charleston, and considers them as joint holders of an interest in the railroad company, and in that view Laffan is just as much a member of the company as if he were one of a partnership firm holding shares in it.\n It is said, though he has an interest in the corporation sued, it is of the same kind as that which creditors or legatees have in the testator's estate, or a cestui que trust in the trust estate. In the case of an executor or trustee, he alone is the legal party-he has the whole legal interest, as is said by this court in the case of The Bank of the United States v. Deveaux. But in the case of a corporation, the legal interest is in the body corporate-the artificial person, which this court for the purposes of this question regards as a common name and description of the natural persons composing the corporation; and it is impossible to deny in any rational and real sense, that Mr. Laffan is one of the natural persons of which the railroad company \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 548]\n\u00a0\n is composed, though he has not, by the law of the corporation as an individual, a right to vote in the corporation, and is not, as an individual, liable to its burdens, because there is another artificial person interposed between him and the railroad company, which by the law of the corporation exercises the powers and is subject to the burdens of a member.\n It is argued that the court has jurisdiction, because all the persons sued are citizens of South Carolina. According to the view taken by this court in the first instance, for the purpose of maintaining the jurisdiction, the persons sued are the natural persons who compose the corporation; and Laffan, as has just been shown, is one of the natural persons composing the corporation, though he is not by the law of corporations in his individual character a corporator. It is true, that if the legislature of South Carolina had exempted the Bank of Charleston from the ordinary jurisdiction, that would not have extended to every joint stock company in which the bank might become a shareholder, but that is because, in the ordinary jurisdiction, it would be immaterial who were the members of the corporation sued, the suit being against the corporation as a legal entity. If the ordinary jurisdiction were expressly limited to cases against corporations, of which all the members were subject to the jurisdiction; then, if it appeared by the pleadings that the Bank of Charleston was a member of the corporation sued, and that bank was not liable to the jurisdiction, the court certainly would not take cognizance of the suit.\n It is not true that the shares of a company may belong to an inanimate object. It may happen tht some of the shares of a company may belong to nobody, as in the case of a dead man, whose estate is unrepresented; but in such case the owners of the other shares would be all the members of the company, and it would be no objection to the jurisdiction that some of the shares belonged to nobody. Again, it is said, that when shares in a corporation are held by another corporation, they belong to the government of the corporation, as trustee for the corporate uses; but this is no more true of shares in a corporation held by another corporation than it is of any other property held by them; they belong to the whole body and not to a part; that is, the legal estate is in the whole body and not in the governing members in trust for the others. It is suggested that the Bank of Charleston would have been incompetent to make the contract on which this action is founded; and if this could be regarded as an action against the bank, it might have been resisted as founded on \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 549]\n\u00a0\n an illegal contract. But a corporation might be created for the very purpose of doing, and would of course be competent to do what no individual member of the corporation would be competent to do, yet it would not follow that the corporation had no members, or that an action against the corporation would not be an action against the members in their corporate character.\n As to this objection, it might have been sufficient to observe, that the plaintiffs in error are very far from insisting that the court shall look into the composition of the Bank of Charleston and the Charleston Insurance and Trust Company. They are content that those corporations shall be considered simply as legal entities, without regard to the individuals composing them.\n It is certain they are not citizens, but they are members of the railroad company, and therefore this action against the company would not be an action against citizens, if the individuals composing those corporations were not regarded. But this court has thought proper, with a view to the jurisdiction of the federal judiciary to regard an action against a corporation as an action against the natural persons composing it. And if it appears that one of the members of the corporation sued is not an individual entering directly into its composition in his natural character, but another corporation, that is, an association of individuals entering together under a corporate name and in the corporate character into the composition of the first corporation, they are, beyond all question, individuals contributing to make up the corporation sued; and there is no imaginable reason why they should not be regarded as defendants and their citizenship considered, which would not be equally strong against regarding the immediate individual members as defendants, and considering their citizenship. Why should not they be seen through two corporations as well as through one? It is no sound objection that in pushing the analysis beyond the first corporation to the second, you may meet with a third and so on through many. The object of all judicial investigation is truth, and where it is attainable, there is surely nothing absurd or ridiculous in pursuing it through every cover to the end. The search could never prove interminable: it must sooner or later terminate in disclosing some individual not having the requisite citizenship, so as to render its further prosecution unavailing, as in this case, or in reducing the corporation sued to its original elements, and showing that they were all persons possessing the necessary civil status.\n The whole argument for the defendant in error, is an effort to construe \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 550]\n\u00a0\n the Constitution and the Judiciary act, or rather to evade their natural sense, by means of legal subtleties and fictions. The constitution declares that the party shall be a citizen, that is, a natural person having a domicil and a certain civil status in a state. The argument is-a corporation is 'a juridical or legal person,' why might it not as well be a 'legal or juridical citizen?' Let it be called so, and it will come within the constitutional requisition.\n The Judiciary act requires that the suit should be between citizens of the state in which it is brought and a citizen or citizens of another state. The suit is brought in South Carolina against a corporation of which some of the members are citizens of North Carolina; the corporate name represents the corporation, which consists of all the members; but it is said, let it be considered, 'in legal contemplation,' that the corporate name represents only the president and directors, and that the suit is only against them; they are all citizens of South Carolina, and then the suit will be between citizens of the state in which it is brought and a citizen of another state.\n Again. If the members of a corporation are all citizens, a suit against the corporation is a suit against citizens, but the state of South Carolina is a stockholder in this corporation, and two other corporations are also stockholders. It is said you have only to rule, that though a state and another corporation may be stockholders in a corporation, they cannot be members, and then all the members of this corporation will be citizens.\n Surely it is not in this court that the Constitution and the law are to be evaded by such easy devices as these.\n\n Mr. Justice WAYNE delivered the opinion of the court.\n The jurisdiction of the court is denied in this case upon the grounds that two members of the corporation sued are citizens of North Carolina; that the state of South Carolina is also a member, and that two other corporations in South Carolina are members, having in them members who are citizens of the same state with the defendant in error.\n The objection, that the state of South Carolina is a member, cannot be sustained. Cases have been already decided by this court which overrule it. The doctrine is, if the state be not necessarily a defendant, though its interest may be affected by the decision, the courts of the United States are bound to exercise jurisdiction. United States v. Peters, 5 Cranch, 115. In the case of the Bank of the \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 551]\n\u00a0\n United States v. Planters' Bank of Georgia, this court ruled 'that when a government becomes a partner in a trading concern, it divests itself, so far as it concerns the transactions of that company, of its sovereign character and takes that of a private citizen. Instead of communicating to the company its privileges and its prerogatives, it descends to a level with those with whom it associates itself, and takes the character which belongs to its associates and to the business which is to be transacted. Thus, many states of this Union, who have an interest in banks, are not suable even in their own courts, yet they never exempt the corporation from being sued. The state of Georgia, by giving to the bank the capacity to sue and be sued, voluntarily strips itself of its sovereign character, so far as respects the transactions of the bank, and waives all the privileges of that character.' 9 Wheat., 907. South Carolina stands in the same attitude in the case before us, that Georgia did in the case in 9 Wheat. It is no objection, then, to the jurisdiction of the court, on account of the averment in the plea, that the state of South Carolina is a member of the Louisville, Cincinnati, and Charleston Railroad Company. The true principle is, that the jurisdiction of the Circuit Courts of the United States cannot be decreed or taken away on account of a state having an interest in a suit, unless the state is a party on the record. Osborne and the Bank of the United States, 9 Wheat., 852. This must be the rule under our system, whether the jurisdiction of the court is denied on account of any interest which a state may have in the subject-matter of the suit, or when it is alleged that jurisdiction does not exist on account of the character of the parties.\n We will here consider that averment in the plea which alleges that the court has not jurisdiction, 'because the Louisville, Cincinnati, and Charleston Railroad Company is not a corporation whose members are citizens of South Carolina, but that some of the members of the said corporation are citizens of South Carolina, and some of them, namely, John Rutherford and Charles Baring, are and were at the time of commencing the said action, citizens of North Carolina.'\n The objection is equivalent to this proposition, that a corporation in a state cannot be sued in the Circuit Courts of the United States, by a citizen of another state, unless all the members of the corporation are citizens of the state in which the suit is brought.\n The suit, in this instance, is brought by a citizen of New York in the Circuit Court of the United States for the district of South Carolina, which is the locality of the corporation sued. \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 552]\n\u00a0\n Jurisdiction is denied, because it is said, it is only given, when 'the suit is between a citizen of the state where the suit is brought and a citizen of another state.' And it is further said that the present is not such a suit, because two of the corporators are citizens of a third state.\n The point in this form has never before been under the consideration of this court. We are not aware that it ever occurred in either of the circuits, until it was made in this case. It has not then been directly ruled in any case. Our inquiry now is, what is the law upon the proposition raised by the plea.\n Our first remark is, that the jurisdiction is not necessarily excluded by the terms, when, 'the suit is between a citizen of the state where the suit is brought and a citizen of another state,' unless the word citizen is used in the Constitution and the laws of the United States in a sense which necessarily excludes a corporation.\n A corporation aggregate is an artificial body of men, composed of divers constituent members ad instar corporis humani, the ligaments of which body politic, or artificial body, are the franchises and liberties thereof, which bind and unite all its members together; and in which the whole frame and essence of the corporation consist. Bac. Abr. Corp. (A.) It must of necessity have a name, for the name is, as it were, the very being of the constitution, the heart of their combination, with out which they could not perform their corporate acts, for it is nobody to plead and be impleaded, to take and give, until it hath gotten a name. Bac. Abr. Corp. (C.)\n Composed of persons, it may be that the members are citizens-and if they are, though the corporation can only plead and be impleaded by its name, or the name by which it may sue or be sued, if a controversy arises between it and a plaintiff who is a citizen of another state, and the residence of the corporation is in the state in which the suit is brought, is not the suit substantially between citizens of different states, or, in the words of the act giving to the courts jurisdiction, 'a suit between a citizen of the state where the suit is brought and a citizen of another state?'\n Jurisdiction, in one sense, in cases of corporations, exists in virtue of the character of members, and must be maintained in the courts of the United States, unless citizens can exempt themselves from their constitutional liability to be sued in those courts, by a citizen of another state, by the fact, that the subject of controversy between them has arisen upon a contract to which the former are parties, in their corporate and not in their personal character. \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 553]\n\u00a0\n Constitutional rights and liabilities cannot be so taken away, or be so avoided. If they could be, the provision which we are here considering could not comprehend citizens universally, in all the relations of trade, but only those citizens in such relations of business as may arise from their individual or partnership transactions.\n Let it then be admitted, for the purposes of this branch of the argument, that jurisdiction attaches in cases of corporations, in consequence of the citizenship of their members, and that foreign corporations may sue when the members are aliens-does it necessarily follow, because the citizenship and residence of the members give jurisdiction in a suit at the instance of a plaintiff of another state, that all of the corporators must be citizens of the state in which the suit is brought?\n The argument in support of the affirmative of this inquiry is, that in the case of a corporation in which jurisdiction depends upon the character of the parties, the court looks beyond the corporation to the individuals of which it is composed for the purpose of ascertaining whether they have the requisite character, and for no other purpose.\n The object would certainly be to ascertain the character of the parties, but not to the extent of excluding all inquiry as to what the effect will be, when it has been ascertained that the corporators are citizens of different states from that of the locality of the corporation, where by its charter it can only be sued.\n Then the question occurs, if the corporation be only suable where its locality is, and those to whom its operations are confided are citizens of that state, and a suit is brought against it by a citizen of another state, whether by a proper interpretation of the terms giving to the Circuit Court jurisdiction, it is not a suit between citizens of the state where the suit is brought and a citizen of another state. The fact that the corporators do live in different states does not aid the solution of the question.\n The first, obvious, and necessary interpretation of the terms by which jurisdiction is given, is, that the suit need not be between citizen and citizen, but may be between citizens. Then, do the words, 'of the state where the suit is brought,' limit the jurisdiction to a case in which all the defendants are citizens of the same state?\n The constitutional grant of judicial power extends to controversies 'between citizens of different states.' The words in the legislative grant of jurisdiction, 'of the state where the suit is brought and \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 554]\n\u00a0\n a citizen of another state,' are obviously no more than equivalent terms to confine suits in the Circuit Courts to those which are 'between citizens of different states.' The words in the Constitution then are just as operative to ascertain and limit jurisdiction as the words in the statute. It is true, that under these words 'between citizens of different states,' Congress may give the courts jurisdiction between citizens in many other forms than that in which it has been conferred. But in the way it is given, the object of the legislature seems exclusively to have been to confer jurisdiction upon the court, strictly in conformity to the limitation as it is expressed in the Constitution, 'between citizens of different states.'\n A suit then brought by a citizen of one state against a corporation by its corporate name in the state of its locality, by which it was created and where its business is done by any of the corporators who are chosen to manage its affairs, is a suit, so far as jurisdiction is concerned, between citizens of the state where the suit is brought and a citizen of another state. The corporators as individuals are not defendants in the suit, but they are parties having an interest in the result, and some of them being citizens of the state where the suit is brought, jurisdiction attaches over the corporation,-nor can we see how it can be defeated by some of the members, who cannot be sued, residing in a different state. It may be said that the suit is against the corporation, and that nothing must be looked at but the legal entity and then that we cannot view the members except as an artificial aggregate. This is so, in respect to the subject-matter of the suit and the judgment which may be rendered; but if it be right to look to the members to ascertain whether there be jurisdiction or not, the want of appropriate citizenship in some of them to sustain jurisdiction, cannot take it away, when there are other members who are citizens, with the necessary residence to maintain it.\n But we are now met and told that the cases of Srawbridge and Curtiss, 3 Cranch, 267, and that of the Bank of the United States and Deveaux, 5 Cranch, 84-hold a different doctrine.\n We do not deny that the language of those decisions do not justify in some degree the inferences which have been made from them, or that the effect of them has been to limit the jurisdiction of the Circuit Courts in practice to the cases contended for by the counsel for the plaintiff in error. The practice has been, since those cases were decided, that if there be two or more plaintiffs and two or more joint-defendants, each of the plaintiffs must be capable of suing each \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 555]\n\u00a0\n of the defendants in the courts of the United States in order to support the jurisdiction, and in cases of corporation to limit jurisdiction to cases in which all the corporators were citizens of the state in which the suit was brought. The case of Strawbridge and Curtiss was decided without argument. That of the Bank and Deveaux after argument of great ability. But never since that case has the question been presented to this court, with the really distinguished ability of the arguments of the counsel in this-in no way surpassed by those in the former. And now we are called upon in the most imposing way to give our best judgments to the subject, yielding to decided cases every thing that can be claimed for them on the score of authority except the surrender of conscience.\n After mature deliberation, we feel free to say that the cases of Strawbridge and Curtiss and that of the Bank and Deveaux were carried too far, and that consequences and inferences have been argumentatively drawn from the reasoning employed in the latter which ought not to be followed. Indeed, it is difficult not to feel that the case of the Bank of the United States and the Planters' Bank of Georgia is founded upon principles irreconcilable with some of those on which the cases already adverted to were founded. The case of the Commercial Bank of Vicksburg and Slocomb was most reluctantly decided upon the mere authority of those cases. We do not think either of them maintainable upon the true principles of interpretation of the Constitution and the laws of the United States. A corporation created by a state to perform its functions under the authority of that state and only suable there, though it may have members out of the state, seems to us to be a person, though an artificial one, inhabiting and belonging to that state, and therefore entitled, for the purpose of suing and being sued, to be deemed a citizen of that state. We remark too, that the cases of Strawbridge and Curtiss and the Bank and Deveaux have never been satisfactory to the bar, and that they were not, especially the last, entirely satisfactory to the court that made them. They have been followed always most reluctantly and with dissatisfaction. By no one was the correctness of them more questioned than by the late chief justice who gave them. It is within the knowledge of several of us, that he repeatedly expressed regret that those decisions had been made, adding, whenever the subject was mentioned, that if the point of jurisdiction was an original one, the conclusion would be different. We think we may safely assert, that a majority of the members of this court \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 556]\n\u00a0\n have at all times partaken of the same regret, and that whenever a case has occurred on the circuit, involving the application of the case of the Bank and Deveaux, it was yielded to, because the decision had been made, and not because it was thought to be right. We have already said that the case of the Bank of Vicksburg v. Slocomb, 14 Pet., was most reluctantly given upon mere authority. We are now called upon, upon the authority of those cases alone, to go further in this case than has yet been done. It has led to a review of the principles of all the cases. We cannot follow further, and upon our maturest deliberation we do not think that the cases relied upon for a doctrine contrary to that which this court will here announce, are sustained by a sound and comprehensive course of professional reasoning. Fortunately a departure from them involves no change in a rule of property. Our conclusion, too, if it shall not have universal acquiescence, will be admitted by all to be coincident with the policy of the Constitution and the condition of our country. It is coincident also with the recent legislation of Congress, as that is shown by the act of the 28th of February, 1839, in amendment of the acts respecting the judicial system of the United States. We do not hesitate to say, that it was passed exclusively with an intent to rid the courts of the decision in the case of Strawbridge and Curtiss.\n But if in all we have said upon jurisdiction we are mistaken, we say that the act of 28th of February, 1839, enlarges the jurisdiction of the courts, comprehends the case before us, and embraces the entire result of the opinion which we shall now give.\n The first section of that act provides, 'that where in any suit at law or in equity, commenced in any court of the United States, there shall be several defendants, any one or more of whom shall not be inhabitants of, or found within the district where the suit is brought, or shall not voluntarily appear thereto, it shall be lawful for the court to entertain jurisdiction, and proceed to the trial and adjudication of such suit between the parties who may be properly before it; but the judgment or decree rendered therein, shall not conclude or prejudice other parties, not regularly served with process, or not voluntarily appearing to answer.' We think, as was said in the case of the Commercial Bank of Vicksburg v. Slocomb, that this act was intended to remove the difficulties which occurred in practice, in cases both in law and equity, under that clause in the 11th section of the Judiciary act, which declares, 'that no civil suit shall be brought before either \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 557]\n\u00a0\n of said courts against an inhabitant of the United States, by any original process, in any other district than that whereof he is an inhabitant, or in which he shall be found at the time of serving the writ, but a re- examination of the entire section will not permit us to re-affirm what was said in that case, that the act did not contemplate a change in the jurisdiction of the courts as it regards the character of the parties. If the act, in fact, did no more than to make a change, by empowering the courts to take cognisance of cases other than such as were permitted in that clause of the 11th section, which we have just cited, it would be an enlargement of jurisdiction as to the character of parties. The clause, that the judgment or decree rendered shall not conclude or prejudice other parties, who have not been regularly served with process, or who have not voluntarily appeared to answer, is an exception, exempting parties so situated from the enactment and must be so strictly applied. It is definite as to the persons of whom it speaks, and contains no particular words, as a subsequent clause, by which the general words of the statute can be restrained. The general words embrace every suit at law or in equity, in which there shall be several defendants, 'any one or more of whom shall not be inhabitants of, or found within the district where the suit is brought, or who shall not voluntarily appear thereto.' The words, 'shall not be inhabitants of,' applies as well to corporators as to persons who are not so; and if, as corporators, they are not suable individually and cannot be served with process, or voluntarily appear in an action against the corporation of which they are mambers, the conclusion should be that they are not included in the exception, but are within the general terms of the statute. Or, if they are viewed as defendants in the suit, then, as corporators, they are regularly served with process in the only way the law permits them to be, when the corporation is sued by its name.\n The case before us might be safely put upon the foregoing reasoning and upon the statute, but hitherto we have reasoned upon this case upon the supposition, that in order to found the jurisdiction in cases of corporations, it is necessary there should be an averment, which, if contested, was to be supported by proof, that some of the corporators are citizens of the state by which the corporation was created, where it does its business, or where it may be sued. But this has been done in deference to the doctrines of former cases in this court, upon which we have been commenting. But there is a broader ground upon which we desire to be understood, upon which we \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 558]\n\u00a0\n altogether rest our present judgment, although it might be maintained upon the narrower ground already suggested. It is, that a corporation created by and doing business in a particular state, is to be deemed to all intents and purposes as a person, although an artificial person, an inhabitant of the same state, for the purposes of its incorporation, capable of being treated as a citizen of that state, as much as a natural person. Like a citizen it makes contracts, and though in regard to what it may do in some particulars it differs from a natural person, and in this especially, the manner in which it can sue and be sued, it is substantially, within the meaning of the law, a citizen of the state which created it, and where its business is done, for all the purposes of suing and being sued. And in coming to this conclusion, as to the character of a corporation, we only make a natural inference from the language of this court upon another occasion, and assert no new principle. In the case of Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 4 Wheat., 636, this court says, 'a corporation is an artificial being, invisible, intangible, and existing only in contemplation of law. Being the mere creature of law, it possesses only those properties which the charter of its creation confers upon it, either expressly or as incidental to its very existence. These are such as were supposed best calculated to effect the object for which it was created. Among the most important are immortality, and if the expression may be allowed, individuality-properties, by which a perpetual succession of many persons are considered as the same and may act as a single individual. They enable a corporation to manage its own affairs, and to hold property without the perplexing intricacies, the hazardous and endless necessity, of perpetual conveyances for the purpose of transmitting it from hand to hand. It is chiefly for the purpose of clothing bodies of men in succession with these qualities and capacities, that corporations were invented and are in use. By these means a perpetual succession of individuals are capable of acting for the promotion of the particular object like one immortal being.' Again, [in] the Providence Bank and Billings, 4 Pet., 514, it is said, 'the great object of an incorporation is to bestow the character and properties of individuality on a collective and changing body of men. This capacity is always given to such a body. Any privileges which may exempt it from the burdens common to individuals do not flow necessarily from the charter, but must be expressed in it, or they do not exist.' In that case the bank was adjudged to be liable to a tax on its property as an individual. Lord Coke, says, 'every corporation \n\n[43 U.S. 497, 559]\n\u00a0\n and body politic residing in any county, riding, city or town corporate, or having lands or tenements in any shire, qua propriis manibus et sumptibus possident et habent, are said to be inhabitants there, within the purview of the statute.' In the case of King v. Gardiner, in Cowper, a corporation was decided by the Court of King's Bench, to come within the description of occupiers or inhabitants. In the Bank and Deveaux, the case relied upon most for the doctrines contended for by the plaintiff in error, it is said of a corporation, 'this ideal existence is considered as an inhabitant, when the general spirit and purposes of the law requires it.' If it be so for the purposes of taxation, why is it not so for the purposes of a suit in the Circuit Court of the United States, when the plaintiff has the proper residence? Certainly the spirit and purposes of the law require it. We confess our inability to reconcile these qualities of a corporation-residence, habitancy, and individuality, with the doctrine that a corporation aggregate cannot be a citizen for the purposes of a suit in the courts of the United States, unless in consequence of a residence of all the corporators being of the state in which the suit is brought. When the corporation exercises its powers in the state which chartered it, that is its residence, and such an averment is sufficient to give the Circuit Courts jurisdiction.\n Our conclusion makes it unnecessary for us to consider that averment in the plea which denies jurisdiction on the ground that citizens of the same state with the plaintiff are members of corporations in South Carolina, which are members of the Louisville, Cincinnati, and Charleston Railroad Company.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court below is affirmed.\n\n\n ORDER.\n\n\n This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the United States for the district of South Carolina, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, it is now here ordered and adjudged by this court, that the judgment of the said Circuit Court in this cause be, and the same is hereby affirmed with costs and damages at the rate of six per centum per annum. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Heir in the singular number (even in a deed) held by Mr. Hargrave to be good as a word of inheritance, being nomen collectivum.

HAYWARD(1844)\n\nArgued: Decided: January 1, 1844\n\n\n THIS case came up on a certificate of division in opinion from the Circuit Court of the United States for the district of Illinois.\n The case was this: In 1840, McCracken, the plaintiff in error, recovered a judgment in the Circuit Court against Hayward for the sum of $ 3,986.67 cents and costs.\n In February, 1841, the state of Illinois passed the following law:\n'An act regulating the sale of property.\n\n'Sect. 1. Be it enacted by the people of the state of Illinois, represented in the general Assembly, That when any execution shall be issued out of any of the courts of this state, whether of record or not, and shall be levied on any real or personal property, or both, it shall be the duty of the officer levying such execution, to summon three householders of the proper county, one of whom shall be chosen by such officer, one by the plaintiff, and one by the defendant in the execution; or, in default of the parties making such choice, the officer shall choose for them: which householders, after being duly sworn by such officer so to do, shall fairly and impartially value the property upon which such execution is levied, having reference to its cash value, and they shall endorse the valuation thereof upon the execution, or upon a piece of paper thereunto attached, signed by them; and when such property shall be offered for sale, it shall not be struck off unless two-thirds of the amount of such valuation shall be bid therefor: Provided, always, that the plaintiff in any execution issued from any court of record of this state, may elect on what property he will have the same levied, except the land on which the defendant resides, and his personal property, which shall be last taken in execution. And in all other executions issued from any of the courts of this state not being courts of record, the plaintiff in execution may elect on what personal property he will have the same \n\n[43 U.S. 608, 609]\n\u00a0\n levied; excepting and reserving, however, to the defendant in execution, in all cases, such an amount and quantity of property as is now exempt from execution by the laws of this state: And provided, further, that all sales of mortgaged property shall be made according to the provisions of this act, whether the foreclosure of said mortgage be by judgment at law, or decree in chancery. The provisions of this act shall extend to judgments rendered prior to the first day of May, eighteen hundred and forty-one, and to all judgments that may be rendered on any contract or cause of action accruing prior to the first day of May, eighteen hundred and forty-one, and not to any other judgments than as before specified.\n\n'Sect. 2. When any property shall be levied on and appraised in the manner required by this act, and the same shall be susceptible of a division, no greater quantity thereof than will be sufficient to pay the amount of the execution or executions thereon levied, together with the proper costs, at two-thirds of the valuation thereof, shall be offered for sale by the officer in whose hands such execution or executions may have been placed for collection.\n\n'Sect. 3. This act shall be in force from and after its passage, and the secretary of state is hereby required to have a thousand copies thereof printed immediately after its approval, and transmit them to the clerks of the county commissioners' courts of the several counties in this state for distribution among the proper officers thereof. Approved February 27, 1841.'\n\n In June, 1841, the Circuit Court of the United States adopted the following rule:\n'When the marshal shall levy an execution upon real estate he shall have it appraised and sold under the provisions of the law of this state, entitled 'An act regulating the sale of property,' approved 27th February, 1841, if the case come within the provisions of that law; and any two of the three householders selected under the law agreeing, may make the valuation of the premises required.'\n\n In May, 1842, a pluries execution was issued on the judgment, under which the marshal levied upon real estate, and advertised it for sale in the ensuing August. It was appraised by three householders, and no person bidding two-thirds of the valuation, it was not sold.\n In March, 1843, the plaintiff sued out a venditioni exponas to sell \n\n[43 U.S. 608, 610]\n\u00a0\n the property levied upon as above stated; and in May served a written notice on the marshal, directing him not to have the property valued, but to sell it to the highest bidder, regardless of the statute of Illinois. The marshal replied that he conceived it to be his duty to be governed by the rule of court.\n In June, 1843, the plaintiff, by his counsel, made the following motion to the court:\n'1. The plaintiff, by Arnold, his attorney, comes and moves the court to set aside the return to the pluries execution issued in this cause, dated 16th day of May, 1842, under which the property levied upon was appraised, and not sold, because no one would bid two-thirds of appraised value.\n\n'2. That the court direct the marshal to sell said property to the highest bidder, without regard to the valuation already made, and without having it valued again.\n\n'3. That the marshal proceed to sell said property without regard to the provisions of the laws regulating the sale of property, passed since the rendition of the judgment, but that he execute the process of the court, enforcing the judgment according to the remedy existing at the time of the rendition of the judgment, and the making of the contract between the parties.\n\n'4. That the marshal be directed to proceed and sell the property levied upon, without regard to the provisions of the act of February, 1841, of the legislature of Illinois, and of January, 1843, regulating the sale of property, above referred to.'\n\n This motion was sustained by an affidavit, setting forth the facts in the case.\n Upon the argument of the motion, the judges were divided in opinion upon the following points.\n'1st. Whether the said motion shall be granted in manner and form as the same is asked, or refused, or any part thereof.\n\n'2d. Whether the return of the marshal on the execution above set forth, dated May 16, 1842, under which the property was appraised and not sold, because two-thirds of appraised value was not bid therefor, shall or shall not be set aside as insufficient.\n\n'3d. Whether the court shall or shall not make an order directing the marshal to sell the property levied on in the usual mode at public auction to the highest bidder, without having the same valued by three householders, and without regard to valuation which has \n\n[43 U.S. 608, 611]\n\u00a0\n been made, and without requiring two-thirds of said valuation to be bid therefor.\n\n'4th. Whether the court shall or shall not direct the marshal to proceed and sell the property levied upon without regard to the provisions of the act of February 27, 1841, of the legislature of Illinois, and the rule adopting said law at the June term, 1841.\n\n'5th. Whether the court will or will not direct the enforcement of said judgment according to the laws regulating the remedy when said judgment was entered and the contract made.'\n\n Upon which certificate of division the cause came up to this court.\n The case was submitted upon a printed argument by Isaac N. Arnold, counsel for the plaintiff, which the reporter regrets his limits will not allow him to re-publish.\n\n Mr. Justice BALDWIN delivered the opinion of the court.\n It appears from the record in this case, that the plaintiff obtained a judgment against the defendant, in June, 1840, on which a pluries fi. fa. issued at May term, 1842; real property was levied on; appraised according to the provisions of a law of Illinois, passed on the 27th February, 1841, and the rule of the Circuit Court of that state, adopted in June of the same year, which law and rule are inserted in the statement of the case by the reporter.\n The property levied on was advertised for sale by the marshal, in August, 1842, but was not sold, as no one bid two-thirds of the appraised value. In March, 1843, the plaintiff sued out a venditioni exponas, with directions to the marshal to sell the property, regardless of the state law, which the marshal refused to obey, conceiving himself bound by the aforesaid rule of court. Whereupon the plaintiff moved the court for an order directing the marshal to sell to the highest bidder, without valuation, or any regard to the state law.\n'1. The plaintiff, by Arnold, his attorney, comes and moves the court to set aside the return to the pluries execution issued in this cause, dated 16th day of May, 1842, under which the property levied upon was appraised, and not sold, because no one would bid two-thirds of appraised value.\n\n'2. That the court direct the marshal to sell said property to the highest bidder, without regard to the valuation already made, and without having valued it again. \n\n[43 U.S. 608, 612]\n\u00a0\n\n'3. That the marshal proceed to sell said property without regard to the provisions of the laws regulating the sale of property, passed since the rendition of the judgment, but that he execute the process of the court, enforcing the judgment according to the remedy existing at the time of the rendition of the judgment, and the making of the contract between the parties.\n\n\n'4. That the marshal be directed to proceed and sell the property levied upon, without regard to the provisions of the act of February, 1841, of the legislature of Illinois, and of January, 1843, regulating the sale of property above referred to.'\n\n On the argument of this motion, the court were divided in opinion on the points mentioned in the statement. These questions must be considered in two aspects, 1. In reference to the Constitution. 2. The laws of the United States, as the tests of the validity of the law of Illinois and the rule of court, which, it is said, affect only the remedy, but not the right of the plaintiff arising on the contract between the parties, and the judgment rendered upon it.\n In placing the obligation of contracts under the protection of the Constitution, its framers looked to the essentials of the contract more than to the forms and modes of proceeding by which it was to be carried into execution; annulling all state legislation which impaired the obligation, it was left to the states to prescribe and shape the remedy to enforce it. The obligation of a contract consists in its binding force on the party who makes it. This depends on the laws in existence when it is made; these are necessarily referred to in all contracts, and forming a part of them as the measure of the obligation to perform them by the one party, and the right acquired by the other. \n3\n There can be no other standard by which to ascertain the extent of either, than that which the terms of the contract indicate, according to their settled legal meaning; when it becomes consummated, the law defines the duty and the right, compels one party to perform the thing contracted for, and gives the other a right to enforce the performance by the remedies then in force. If any subsequent law affect to diminish the duty, or to impair the right, it necessarily bears on the obligation of the contract in favor of one party, to the injury of the other; hence any law, which in its operation amounts to a denial or obstruction of the rights accruing by a contract, though professing to act only on the remedy, is directly obnoxious to the prohibition of the Constitution. \n\n[43 U.S. 608, 613]\n\u00a0\n\n This principle is so clearly stated and fully settled in the case of Bronson v. Kinzie, decided at the last term, 1 How., 311, that nothing remains to be added to the reasoning of the court, or requires a reference to any other authority, than what is therein referred to; it is, however, not to be understood that by that, or any former decision of this court, all state legislation on existing contracts is repugnant to the Constitution.\n'It is within the undoubted power of state legislatures to pass recording acts, by which the elder grantee shall be postponed to a younger, if the prior deed is not recorded within the limited time; and the power is the same whether the deed is dated before or after the passage of the recording act. Though the effect of such a law is to render the prior deed fraudulent and void as against a subsequent purchaser, it is not a law impairing the obligation of contracts; such, too, is the power to pass acts of limitation, and their effect. Reasons of sound policy have led to the general adoption of laws of both descriptions, and their validity cannot be questioned. The time and manner of their operation, the exceptions to them, and the acts from which the time limited shall begin to run, will generally depend on the sound discretion of the legislature, according to the nature of the titles, the situation of the country, and the emergency which leads to their enactment. Cases may occur where the provision of a law may be so unreasonable as to amount to the denial of a right, and call for the interposition of the court.' 3 Pet., 290.\n\n The obligation of the contract between the parties, in this case, was to perform the promises and undertakings contained therein; the right of the plaintiff was to damages for the breach thereof, to bring suit and obtain a judgment, to take out and prosecute an execution against the defendant till the judgment was satisfied, pursuant to the existing laws of Illinois. These laws giving these rights were as perfectly binding on the defendant, and as much a part of the contract, as if they had been set forth in its stipulations in the very words of the law relating to judgments and executions. \n4\n If the defendant had made such an agreement as to authorize a sale of his property, which should be levied on by the sheriff, for such price as should be bid for it at a fair public sale on reasonable notice, it would have conferred a right on the plaintiff, which the Constitution made inviolable; and it can make no difference whether such right is conferred by the terms or law of the contract. Any subsequent law which \n\n[43 U.S. 608, 614]\n\u00a0\n denies, obstructs, or impairs this right, by superadding a condition that there shall be no sale for any sum less than the value of the property levied on, to be ascertained by appraisement, or any other mode of valuation than a public sale, affects the obligation of the contract, as much in the one case, as the other, for it can be enforced only by a sale of the defendant's property, and the prevention of such sale is the denial of a right. The same power in a state legislature may be carried to any extent, if it exists at all; it may prohibit a sale for less than the whole appraised value, or for three-fourths, or nine-tenths, as well as for two-thirds, for if the power can be exercised to any extent, its exercise must be a matter of uncontrollable discretion, in passing laws relating to the remedy which are regardless of the effect on the right of the plaintiff. This was the ruling principle of the case of Bronson v. Kinzie, which arose on a mortgage containing a covenant, that, in default of payment, the mortgagee might enter upon, sell, and convey the mortgaged premises, as the attorney of the mortgagor; yet the case was not decided on the effect and obligation of that covenant, but on the broad and general principle, that a state law, which professedly provided a remedy for enforcing the contract of mortgage, effectually impairing the rights incident to, and attached to it by the laws in force at its date, was void. No agreement or contract can create more binding obligations than those fastened by the law, which the law creates and attaches to contracts; the express power which a mortgagor confers on the mortgagee to sell as his agent is not more potent than that which the law delegates to the marshal, to sell and convey the property levied on, under an execution. He is the constituted agent of the defendant, invested with all his powers for these purposes. The marshal can do under the authority of the law whatever he could do under the fullest power of attorney from the execution debtor; and no state law can prohibit it. It follows that the law of Illinois now under consideration, so far as it prohibits a sale for less than two- thirds of the appraised value of the property levied on, is unconstitutional and void.\n The second aspect in which this case must be considered, is with reference to the acts of Congress relating to process and proceedings in the courts of the United States in cases at common law. All the early laws on this subject were carefully and most ably reviewed by this court, in Wayman and Southard, and the Bank of the United States v. Halstead in which it was held, that the proceedings in the \n\n[43 U.S. 608, 615]\n\u00a0\n courts of the United States should be the same as they were in the several states at the time of passing the acts of Congress, subject to be altered by the Circuit Courts, or regulations of the Supreme Court. That the proceedings on executions were to be governed by such laws until final satisfaction was obtained, regardless of any subsequent changes by state legislation. 10 Wheat., 20, 51.\n Prior to 1828, Congress had passed no process acts applicable to the states admitted into the union after 1789. To remedy this defect, and to confirm the decisions in the above cases, the act of May, 1828, directed that writs of execution and other final process issued on judgments and decrees, and the proceedings thereupon, shall be the same in each state as are now used in the courts of such state, &c.; thus adopting the same principles which had been established by this court in the construction of the acts of 1789 and 1792. Consequently no state law passed since May, 1828, can have any effect on the proceedings on executions issued from the courts of the United States, unless such laws are adopted by those courts under the proviso in the third section of the act.\n The rule adopted by the Circuit Court of Illinois does not fall within this proviso, which declares, 'that it shall be in the power of the courts, if they see fit in their discretion, so far to alter final process in said courts as to conform the same to any change which may be adopted by the legislatures of the respective states for the state courts.'\n This authorizes the court to adopt the change so made by a state law, but not to adopt it only in part, or alter it in any respect. The law directs the appraisement to be made by three householders, one to be selected by the defendant, one by the officer, and one by the plaintiff, without any authority to any two to make it, and, consequently, requiring the concurrence of all. The rule of court adopting this law provides, 'that any two of the three householders selected under the law agreeing, may make the valuation required,'-such an adoption is not warranted by the act of 1828; it is legislation in effect, by prescribing a new rule unknown to any act of Congress, or the state law professedly adopted. But had the adoption been in the terms of the law, it could not be recognized, inasmuch as the appraisement therein directed, with the prohibition to sell at less than two-thirds of the valuation, is repugnant to the Constitution of the United States. It also conflicts with the process acts, as construed \n\n[43 U.S. 608, 616]\n\u00a0\n in Wayman v. Southard, and the Bank of the United States v. Halstead, and the repeated decisions of this court in later cases-that no state law can be adopted under the act of 1828, which is in collision with any act of Congress. 16 Pet., 94, 312-314.\n It must therefore be certified to the Circuit Court, that the motion made by the plaintiff's counsel ought to be granted, and that the directions to the marshal prayed for by the plaintiff, ought to be given in the manner stated in the second, third, fourth, and fifth points certified.\n\n Mr. Justice CATRON.\n The third section of the act of 1828, provides, 'that writs of execution, and other final process, issued on judgments and decrees rendered in any of the courts of the United States, and the proceedings thereupon, shall be the same, (except their style,) in each state, respectively, as are now used in the courts of such state.'\n A system of rules has been adopted in the Circuit Court of the Kentucky district, regulating final process, and giving a widely different effect to such process from what it had by the laws of Kentucky; a violent controversy was the consequence in that state, and which gave rise to the cases of Wayman v. Southard, and United States Bank v. Halstead, reported in 10 Wheat. The agitation it is understood, was one prominent reason for the introduction of the act of Congress of 1828. It repealed and rules made by the courts of the United States regulating final process, in all the districts, and adopted the execution laws of the respective states, as they then stood; and if nothing more had been done, future legislation on the subject, by the states, would have been cut off. Congress, however, foreseeing new states might come into the Union, to which the act would not apply; and that it might be proper to adopt future state laws, in the existing states, provided-'that it should be in the power of the courts, if they see fit, in their discretion, by rules of court, so far to alter final process in said courts as to conform the same to any change which may be adopted by the legislatures of the respective states for the state courts.'\n An adoption of the state law, as the legislature had made that law, is the extent of the power conferred. If the courts can alter the law in one respect, it may be altered in all respects, this is not 'conformity,' but an exercise of the same power the act of 1828, \n\n[43 U.S. 608, 617]\n\u00a0\n prohibited. The rule before us will illustrate it. The state law of Illinois enacts that, three valuers shall determine the value of the property levied on by the sheriff; one chosen by the plaintiff; one by the defendant, and the other by the sheriff; that the three must agree in the valuation; and if the property does not bring two-thirds of such valuation, it shall not be sold.\n The rule provides, that if the appraisers disagree, the value fixed by any two of them shall be sufficient to authorize the marshal to sell. The debtor will naturally select one, who he supposes will set the highest value on the property; the creditor one he supposes will fix the lowest value; the marshal may be favorably disposed to the one side or the other; most probably to the absent creditor-the appraiser of his selection, and the one selected by the debtor, may agree, and usually would. This will cut out all the advantages the statute secured to the creditor, as his selection would have no effect: Take it the other way and the operation will be the same.\n If this change were sanctioned, then, in Pennsylvania and other states, where there are statutes by which lands are directed to be valued by a jury of twelve, to ascertain whether the rents and profits will pay the debt in a given number of years; in which case, the debtor is compelled to take the accruing profits in satisfaction as they arise; and if not, then the lands are to be sold to the highest bidder, could also be altered, and by a rule of court, a majority of two-thirds of the jury be authorized to assess the annual income. It is manifest, if amendments and alterations can be made by the courts, of the state statutes, they must, of necessity, run into an unlimited discretion, if any one feature of the state law is retained. I therefore think the rule of court, adopting the statute of Illinois, with the foregoing amendment, is merely void; and that no part of the state statute is in force in the Circuit Court of the United States in the district of Illinois.\n And not having been adopted, it is not before this court for construction; and that it is unnecessary and improper to inquire into the constitutionality of the state law, as the laws in force in 1828 must govern. In this respect, the opinion in the United States Bank v. Halstead is followed, where the precise question arising in the case before us was presented, (the rule aside,) and in which this court then declined giving any opinion on the valuation law of Kentucky. I have formed no opinion, whether the statute of Illinois is \n\n[43 U.S. 608, 618]\n\u00a0\n constitutional or otherwise. The question raised on it is one of the most delicate and difficult of any ever presented to this court; and as our decision affects the state courts throughout, in their practice, I feel unwilling to form or express any opinion on so grave a question, unless it is presented in the most undoubted form, and argued at the bar.\n On the questions propounded by the certificate of division, I agree in the answers given by my brethren, because the execution is governed by the laws of Illinois as they stood at the passing of the act of Congress of 1828, without going farther, as I know the constitutional question will affect other states beside Illinois; many, not to say most of them have had, and some now have, valuation laws; in which no distinction is made between contracts made before the passing of the act, and those made afterwards, and that the decision against their validity as to past contracts, will reach a great way farther than may be supposed on a slight examination.\n\n\n ORDER.\n\n This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the United States for the district of Illinois, and on the points and questions on which the judges of the said Circuit Court were opposed in opinion, and which were certified to this court for its opinion, agreeably to the act of Congress in such case made and provided, and was argued by counsel, on consideration whereof, it is the opinion of this court: 1st. That the motion made by the plaintiff's counsel ought to be granted in manner and form as the same is asked; 2d. That the return of the marshal on the execution as set forth, dated May 16, 1842, under which the property was appraised and not sold, because two-thirds of the appraised value was not bid therefor, should be set aside as insufficient; 3. That the court should direct the marshal to sell the property levied on in the usual mode at public auction to the highest bidder, without having the same valued by three householders, without regard to the valuation which has been made, and without requiring two-thirds of said valuation to be bid therefor; 4th. That the court should direct the marshal to proceed and sell the property levied upon without regard to the provisions of the act of Feb. 27, 1841, of the legislature of Illinois, and the rule adopting said law at the June term, 1841; and, 5thly and lastly, That the court should \n\n[43 U.S. 608, 619]\n\u00a0\n direct the enforcement of said judgment, according to the laws regulating the remedy when said judgment was entered and the contract made. Whereupon, it is now here ordered and adjudged by this court, that it be so certified to the judges of the said Circuit Court. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] QUOTED. Palmer v.

The vessel was armed with a cannon and \n\n[43 U.S. 210, 211]\n\u00a0\n some ammunition, and there were also pistols and daggers on board. It appeared from the evidence, which is hereinafter particularly set forth, that she stopped several vessels upon the high seas, and at length put into the port of Fayal, where she remained for some days. Departing thence, she arrived at Bahia, in Brazil, about the twenty-first of August, 1840, where she was seized by the Enterprise, a vessel of war belonging to the United States, and sent into the port of Baltimore for adjudication. A libel was there filed against vessel and cargo upon five counts, all founded upon the act of Congress to protect the commerce of the United States, and to punish the crime of piracy, passed on the 3d of March, 1819, ch. 76, (200.) Two other counts were afterwards added in an amended information, charging the acts complained of to have been done in violation of the laws of nations.\n A claim was filed for the brig, her tackle, apparel, furniture, and cargo, on behalf of Peter Harmony, Leonardo Swarez, and Bernard Graham.\n The evidence produced upon the trial in the District Court, will be recapitulated when the proceedings before the Circuit Court are stated; under which evidence the case was augued, together with the following admission of the proctors for the United States:\n United States \nv.\n The Malek Adhel and cargo.\n District Court, United States.\n The proctors of the United States in this case admit, for the purposes of this case, and to have the same effect as if fully proven, that the claimants were, when the Malek Adhel left New York, the exclusive owners of that vessel, and were such owners during the period the acts stated in the information are alleged by the United States to have been done. And they also admit, that the claimants never contemplated or authorized said acts. They further admit that the equipments of the said vessel when she left New York, and ever afterwards, were the usual equipments of a vessel of her class, on an innocent commercial voyage from that port to Guayamas, the voyage stated in the evidence in this case. NATH'L WILLIAMS, and REVERDY JOHNSON, Proctors for the United States. Baltimore, 15 June, 1841. The District Court condemned the vessel, restored the cargo to the claimants, apportioned a part of the costs upon the claimants, and directed the residue to be deducted from the proceeds of the property \n\n[43 U.S. 210, 212]\n\u00a0\n condemned. Both parties appealed from this decree; the claimants from the condemnation of the vessel, and the United States from that part of it which restored the cargo.\n The cause came before the Circuit Court upon the evidence which had been given before the District Court, (reduced to writing by consent,) and upon additional evidence which is set forth in the following deposition. It was corroborated in its main points by the evidence of two other persons.\n John Myers, a witness, produced and examined on the part of the United States, deposes as follows:--\n That he was not first mate when he joined the Malek Adhel; Peterson was first mate; witness joined her 23d June, 1840. On Friday, afterwards, Peterson came on board, hauled the vessel out into the stream. On Sunday, Captain Nunez told Peterson to go on shore on account of a quarrel; Peterson was intoxicated; witness was then made first mate; witness told the captain, that one of the crew (W. R. Crocker) was competent to go out as second mate, and he was then promoted to that office. On Tuesday, 30th June, took pilot, got under weigh about ten or eleven o'clock that day, and went to sea; discharged the pilot on afternoon of same day; fourth or fifth day out, captain said the chronometer wouldn't speak, had forgotten to wind it up; on the 6th of July, saw a vessel standing to the northward, and we to the eastward, five or six miles apart; ran down to the vessel and hove maintopsail back; ran to leeward and then to windward of her, and fired a blank cartridge; hailed the vessel and asked 'where from?' they said from Savannah, bound to Liverpool; we hailed her again, and told her to send her boat alongside; she sent her boat with four men and an officer, and they came alongside; Captain Nunez asked if they had a chronometer; officer in the boat said he did not know whether they had or not; would go on board and see; went on board and returned in about half an hour with a chronometer; brought it on board, and while we were regulating our chronometer, our captain and four men went on board the other vessel, which was the 'Madras, of Hull;' captain stayed on board a short time and then returned; they then took their chronometer and returned to their vessel, the Madras; while we were hoisting our boat up and securing her, the Madras made sail; as soon as the boat was secured, we ran to leeward some distance, and fired another blank cartridge, but not in the direction of the\n Madras, and then proceeded on our own course. Next, about \n\n[43 U.S. 210, 213]\n\u00a0\n 9th or 10th July, a vessel was standing to the westward, we to the eastward; captain said he would run after the vessel and catch her, as he wanted to send a letter to New York; made sail after her, and finding we did not come up very fast, we fired a blank cartridge; they still not taking any notice, our captain told the man to load a gun with shot; loaded the gun with shot and fired, when the other vessel hove her maintopsail back; we were about half a mile apart; we both had our American flag flying at first; when the second shot was fired, Captain Nunez ordered the Mexican or Columbian flag to be hoisted; we then hailed; they said they were from Liverpool, bound to Charleston; her name was the brig 'Sullivan;' she was an American vessel; had 'Sullivan, New York,' on her stern; hailed her and told her to send a boat alongside; while they were coming, our captain told Martin (called Peter Roberts in the shipping articles) to tell the crew not to speak any English, while the boat was alongside; this order the captain first told him in Spanish, then in English; when the boat came alongside, they asked where we were from; captain told Martin in Spanish, to say, we were from Vera Cruz, bound to Barcelona, and out forty-five days; Martin did so; our captain then told him we wanted some lamp-oil; the officer in the other boat said he did not know whether they had any, but he would go on board and see; when they reached their own vessel, they hoisted their boat, and proceeded on their course; we had lamp-oil sufficient to last us twelve months; after they proceeded on their course, we made sail likewise; ran to leeward and fired a shot at her; this fire our captain ordered Martin to make; he, (Martin,) generally acted as gunner. Martin belonged to Malaga, and spoke Spanish; at the time of second fire, the vessels were about an eighth of a mile apart, hailing distance; we then kept on, and she did the same; the gun was fired at her; we were then standing to eastward, she to westward; did not see where the ball struck.\n The next vessel we saw and spoke, was the 'Ten Brothers;' this was two or three days after the affair with the Sullivan; passed her without doing any thing. Next vessel we met, was the 'Vigilant, of New castle, England;' spoke her; she showed English colors; hailed her, and told her to send her boat alongside; she did so. Nunez asked if they had a chronometer; they said that they had none; they were out of water, and wanted bread; we gave them two small barrels and some bread, by our captain's orders; we went on our course. The next vessel we met was the San Domingo, \n\n[43 U.S. 210, 214]\n\u00a0\n two days afterwards; our captain was acquainted with the passengers on board; he asked them to dine with him, which they did; after they left, Captain Nunez told witness, that the passenger had been a slaver, and was just returning from a prosperous voyage; the vessel belonged to Terceira, one of the Western Islands; she was Portuguese; we laid together that night, and the next morning the Portuguese sent on board of us to buy provisions; we then parted company, and two or three days after, went into Fayal; Nunez said his intention in going to Fayal, was to repair the vessel, and get his chronometer rated; remained there five or six days; had one carpenter employed four days, who did some slight work; he made a side ladder and some awning extensions, and put her to her head to find out leak. The principal leak was about eight or ten inches above the water line; the vessel leaked at sea, but not at Fayal; leaked as bad after we left there as she did before; the place of the leak discovered at Rio; there never having been oakum at all in that part of the seam, could put a knife in the seam; leak came into cabin; that leak was not stopped at Fayal.\n We took in at Fayal, potatoes, bread, and beef, for the use of the crew; we also took in two men as passengers, and a cabin boy; one of the passengers was named Silvie and the other Curry; the boy is here; the last I saw of the passengers was at Rio; got under weight from Fayal on Tuesday; do not know whether Nunez knew the two passengers before he saw them at Fayal; came to anchor and waited until Wednesday; there was a pleasure- party to come on board to said about the harbor; in attempting to tack she missed stays, captain at the helm; missed stays a second time; we were about twenty yards from the rocks; Nunez knew nothing of the usages of an American vessel before we left New York; I always worked the vessel myself; Nunez might have known, but he did not speak English well enough to make the men understand. After the sailing match about the harbor, we left Fayal with the whaling vessel Minerva, from New Bedford; Nunez went on board of her and took the chronometer to have it rated; had done nothing with it at Fayal; Nunez knew nothing about managing chronometer, though it is the captain's duty. Captain Nunez remained on board the Minerva five or six hours; he went on shore at Fayal before we had our sails furled; he went in a shore boat. After Nunez came from the Minerva we made sail and proceeded on our course; he brought chronometer with him: next day we saw a vessel \n\n[43 U.S. 210, 215]\n\u00a0\n standing to westward with all sail set, going directly before the wind; we were standing to southward; Nunez ordered to chase her; finding we did not come up very fast we fired, by Nunez's orders, a blank cartridge towards her; she still went on her course; Nunez ordered one of the guns to be shotted and fired at her, which was done; she then hove her maintop back; we were then about a mile astern of her; we rounded to, to fire at her; we came up, hailed her; she said she was from Palermo, bound to Boston; she was the 'Emily Wilder;' told her to send her boat alongside with their chronometer; they came alongside with the chronometer; we rated ours by it; I rated it and found a difference of time, and noted it in the log-book; after comparing the time of the two, they then took chronometer and went on board again; I made the entry in the log-book; we each made sail and stood on our course; they asked us no questions, except where we were from; Nunez said, from New York, bounded around Cape Horn; we stood to southward until 4th of August; the day before, captain said he was going to Rio; I told him it was a bad place to go, because it was a rendezvous for American vessels of war; on the 4th of August Nunez came on deck about half-past seven in the evening, and found fault with some orders witness had been giving, and Nunez told me that he did not want me to do more work on board the ship, and I accordingly went off duty; we ran on our course; that night Captain Nunez had the watch from eight to twelve; I heard a noise on board, went up and saw a vessel close ahead on the weather bow; when we came up Nunez hailed her, and told them to heave the maintop back; they did so, and we did the same; this was about ten o'clock at night; hailed them again and told them to send their boat aboard of us with the captain and his papers; this they said they could not do as their boat leaked and the night was dark; Nunez then got angry and told us to double shot the gun: it was done, and fired towards the strange vessel; Martin directed the gun; we were within close hailing distance. Curry, the forementioned passenger, then hailed in English and told them again to send their boat; the other captain answered in Portuguess or Spanish. Curry told witness that the answer was, they might sink their brig, but he could not come on board.' Nunez then told us to lower out boat and go on board the strange brig; Curry, Crocker, the second mate, Peter Roberts, ( Martin,) John Gray, and Dill or Smith, then went on board the stranger; Curry and Crocker had each a pair of pistols, they were buckled in a belt \n\n[43 U.S. 210, 216]\n\u00a0\n round their bodies; our boat returned in about three quarters of an hour with Curry and the captain of the strange brig, and three of her men; Curry and the captain came on board the Malek Adhel, the men remained in their boat alongside; the strange captain gave Nunez a tin box with the ship's papers, I believe; ship's papers are carried in such boxes. Curry and Captain Nunez took them down below; strange captain remained on deck; I saw them down the companion way, examining the papers in the cabin; they had them about a quarter of an hour, and then brought them up and gave them to the Portuguese captain; Nunez spoke English and told Curry to tell strange captain he must may twenty dollars for the shot Nunez had fired at him, and ten dollars for a keg of oil which had been knocked over by the recoil of the gun. Nunez also told Curry in English to look and see if there were any guns and powder on board the other vessel, and if there were any, to spike the guns and bring the powder on board, and see if any sweetmeats were on board, and bring them on board also; then they shoved off, Curry with them, and went to the Portuguese vessel; Nunez told me that the Portuguese vessel was from Rio Grande, bound to Oporto, with a cargo of hides and horns; in half an hour after our boat returned with those who originally went on board the Portuguese vessel, and brought a jar of sweetmeats, one dog, and twenty dollars for the shot; after the boat was secured Captain Nunez put me on duty again; this was two o'clock in the morning; Curry told me he had got twenty dollars for the shot, but was ashamed to ask for the other ten for the oil; I saw Curry give the captain the money in Spanish dollars; Curry said he wouldn't take Brazilian money, which was first offered him by the Portuguese captain; after that we left the vessel and proceeded on our course. The next vessel we met was on the 10th or 12th of August; they were standing to northward, we to southward; when she came abeam of us, she tacked ship and went in the same direction with us; in about two hours after we hove our maintop back and ran foul of each other; Captain Nunez got enraged and told them to shot the gun and fire at the stranger; it was done; we fired a second shot; Nunez ordered the second shot.\n When the first shot was fired, we were within close hailing distance; and also, when each shot was fired; we fired five times, gun shotted each time. After our fifth fire all our powder was gone: Nunez then told Martin something witness did not understand, and Martin then told the crew, he ( Captain Nunez) said he would give \n\n[43 U.S. 210, 217]\n\u00a0\n $500 to any volunteers of his crew, who would go and bring the captain aboard. Nunez asked me to go. I told him, I did not like it. He told me not to be afraid, and gave me his dirk; I threw the dirk down on the deck, and said to Nunez, I was afraid to go on board with the boat, for fear they would throw something in the long boat and sink her, when we were alongside. Nunez said, he wanted to bring the other captain on board the Malek, and give him twenty-five lashes; we were then some distance astern. Nunez told Martin to take two men, Dell and Helm, and go on board; they did so, and remained half an hour; they returned and brought back with them the time. I saw one shot go through the flying jib; it was the second shot. When Martin came back, he told Nunez he must send his chronometer with an officer, and rate it; I took the chronometer, went on board the other vessel, and rated it. Strange captain asked me why Nunez had fired at him; I said I did not know; the captain had ordered it. He asked me where we were bound. I said, 'God only knows.' When I returned to the Malek Adhel, I told Nunez what had happened, and he laughed. The strange brig was the 'Albert;' she was an English brig and bound to Rio; her stern sign was disfigured; she had English colors flying. We then proceeded on our course, and made the Brazils about the 20th or 21st of August; the land was some miles north of Cape Antonio. The passengers on board told me they were to go to Bahia. We got to Bahia about six o'clock in the evening, and Curry, Silvie, and the captain went ashore. They came on board again about nine o'clock next morning, and Nunez told me to make ready to clear the cargo, as he was going to repair his vessel. Nunez stayed about half an hour on board and went ashore again. Next morning got all clear, and about half-past eleven Nunez came on board; the men told me they would do no more work until they saw the American consul; this was told me before Nunez came on board; when he came, I told him; he asked me if I wanted to see the consul too. I said, 'Yes.' He then said, 'Very well, I will go ashore and see.' He went on shore, and the next morning between nine and ten o'clock, he came on board again. He told me to tell all the crew, who wanted to see the consul, to come aft, and go on the larboard side; the whole crew went on the larboard side, Martin among them. The second mate, Mr. Crocker, and four or five men, went on shore that day; they stayed on shore until about three o'clock, and then returned. Captain Nunez came on board \n\n[43 U.S. 210, 218]\n\u00a0\n the next morning, and told me the counsul wanted to see me, and that I must go on shore with him. We went to the consul's office, and he asked me about these charges. I had kept an account of some small transactions on a piece of paper; I gave it to the consul. The captain said I could be discharged, if I desired it; but the consul said, 'Not until the affair was settled.' By small transactions, witness means the firing, &c. Captain Nunez admitted that it was all right, as I had put it down. I told the American consul the same story as I am now telling. When we were going ashore, Nunez said, 'Suppose I sell the brig, how much she worth?' He also said, one man had offered to give him $22,000 for her. I told him I did not know how much she was worth. I stayed on shore until two o'clock, and then went on board again; that night, about one or two o'clock, a vessel ran foul of us, and tore away our jib-boom. The next morning while we were repairing it, the captain came on board and told me the consul wanted to see me. I went, returned afterwards on board, got my clothes and went ashore, where I remained nine or ten days; went on board, afterwards, the American brig Yankee, and remained there until the Enterprize, a United States schooner, seized and took the Malek and her crew. There were four men shipped by the captain at Bahia, after I left the brig; they were one Portuguese, one Spaniard, one English, and one American. The crew were examined in succession by the consul. We left Bahia on the 26th September, under the charge of Lieut. Drayton, on board the brig; none men and two officers were put on board; we then went to Rio; four of our crew were from the schooner Enterprize; we left Martin and the cook behind at Bahia. The day I returned from the consul's on board the Malek, Nunez and the cook had a quarrel, and Nunez struck the cook; cook said, 'When I shipped, I did not know I shipped on board a slaver.' I saw Captain Nunez at Rio, in prison. We stayed at Rio from the 2d of October until the 1st of March. We were taken before the authorities at Rio; they let the captain out of prison. I saw him afterwards walking about in Rio. I left Rio in the Malek, under the command of Lieut. Ogden, and with the crew who are now in prison, where we have been since we arrived. Lieut. Ogden had on board, besides ourselves, four men and one midshipman. I kept the log-book of the Malek; Captain Nunez got it from me, to take it to the consul the day we went before him. It was laid before the consul, and I never saw it afterwards. The log-book contained some of the \n\n[43 U.S. 210, 219]\n\u00a0\n particulars about the firing. (Here a book is shown to the witness.) This book was kept by the captain. Lient. Drayton kept a log-book from Bahia to Rio.\n Cross-Examination.\n Upon cross-examination, the witness further deposed: While I was on board the Yankee, a midshipman and four men came on board and ordered me on board the schooner Enterprize. I was not imprisoned at Bahia. Peter Roberts (Martin) was among the men who went on the larboard side. I do not know whether the pistols Curry carried were loaded or not; one pistol out of the four was loaded, I know. The men who accompanied Curry were unarmed, to the best of my knowledge. The Albert answered the hail of the Malek Adhel. Our brig had her name on the stern. I saw Curry put the money down on the cabin table. I did not tell any one I had seen the money counted out. On my examination at Bahia, I stated that Curry had told me that he had received the money. I do not recollect whether I stated then that I saw it. The cook's deposition was not taken, that I know of. Silvie and the boy were in the cabin with Nunez and Curry. I am from Philadelphia, but have sailed out of New York for the last five years. Have sailed as mate twice before. Before the offer of $500, made by Nunez to his crew to board the Albert, he had not ordered the crew, nor had they refused to go.\n Further Cross-Examination of John Myers.\n John Myers, upon his further cross-examination, deposed as follows:--\n We left Captain Nunez at Bahia. When we first arrived at Rio, I did not see him. The second time I went ashore I saw him in jail. I do not known how long he remained in jail. We remained at Rio four months. I never saw Nunez after the frigate Potomac arrived. The Enterprize and the Malek Adhel went into Rio together. Nunez was at liberty on shore after the Enterprize arrived. I saw Nunez three or four days before we sailed from Rio; he told me he was going to take command again of the Malek Adhel. Martin went with the rest of the crew before the consul. I saw him in the consul's office. I never saw Martin at Rio; we left him at Bahia. I saw both Curry and Sylvie at Rio, but do not know how they got there. A vessel bound direct from Bahia to Guayamas would not stop at Rio. I did not see either Curry or Sylvie after the Potomac \n\n[43 U.S. 210, 220]\n\u00a0\n arrived. I should think the Potomac was at Rio twelve or fifteen days before we sailed for home.\n At November term, 1841, the Circuit Court affirmed the decree of the District Court, dismissed the appeals, and ordered each party to pay their respective costs in that court. Both parties appealed to the Supreme Court.\n Z. Collins Lee, and R. Johnson, for the United States.\n Meredith, and Nelson, (attorney-general,) for the claimants.\n Lee, made the following points on behalf of the United States, as appellants:--\n 1st. That the cargo of the said vessel was subject to forfeiture, and ought to have been condemned; and the decree, so far as regards it, ought to be reversed.\n 2d. That no part of the costs and expenses incurred in the prosecution should be paid out of the proceeds of the property condemned; but that Peter Harmony and Co. should be decreed to pay the same.\n And on behalf of the United States, as appellees.\n 3d. That the Malek Adhel, her tackle, apparel, and furniture, were properly condemned; and that the decree, so far as regards them, ought to be affirmed.\n Lee argued that the brig was 'an armed vessel, or a vessel of which the crew were armed' within the true meaning and intent of the act of Congress of the 3d March, 1819, 3 Story's Laws, p. 1738; the 1, 2, 3, and 4 sects. of which were continued by the act of 15th May, 1820, 3 Story, 1798, and afterwards without limitation by the act of 30th January, 1823, 3 Story, 1874. And in the second place, that from the evidence exhibited on the record, the aggressions, restraints, and depredations proved were 'piratical' and such as the act of Congress contemplated and intended to punish.\n And lastly, that, assuming the said brig not to be 'an armed vessel' within the meaning of the act, yet the aggressions and depredations prepetrated on the Portuguese vessel were, according to the law of nations, piratical. To sustain the above propositions he referred to the following authorities:-- Act of Congress of 1790, ch. 36, 1 Story, 82, defining piracy.\n Act of 1825, ch. 276, 3 Story, 1999, defining and punishing as piratical certain offences therein named. \n\n[43 U.S. 210, 221]\n\u00a0\n Also, to the following cases:--\n United States v. Palmer, 3 Wheat., 610; p. 626, as to the construction of the act of 1790; The Marianna Flora, 11 Wheat., 37; and to show that a single piratical act is sufficient, referred to the speech of Chief Justice Marshall in the case of Jonathan Robbins, reported in the appendix to 5 Wheat., p. 8, 12; 3 Wash. C. C., 221, 214, case of United States v. John Jones; 5 Wheat., 145, 149, 153, and notes; Id, 412, 192; 2 Azuni, 351; 4 Bl. Com., 72, defining sea-robbery; 2 East, P. C., 707, Vattel, ch. 15,  226; Grotius, ch. 15,  85; Molloy, 57.\n Upon the question of the forfeiture of the cargo:--\n Dods. Adm., 470; case of The Neptune, 5 Robinson and Wheaton on Captures; 1 Hagg., 142, case of The Hallen; 3 Dall., 133, case of The Adams, and commented on the opinion of the court in the case of The Marianna Flora, 11 Wheat.\n Meredith, for the claimants.\n There are two questions in the case.\n\n 1. \nThe construction of the act of Congress.\n\n 2. \nThe bearing of the evidence.\n The innocence of the owners is admitted on the record. They were sole owners during all the voyage, and engaged in a lawful trade. The vessel was properly equipped for such a voyage, and the owners had nothing to do with the acts complained of. These admissions were not gratuitous but proved, and placed in this form for convenience.\n Does the act of 1819 reach such a case? She was armed only as the voyage required, and the captain departed from the orders of the owners. It is an important question, because, if decided in the affirmative, the risks of ship-owners will be increased, and in violation of the natural principles of justice.\n It is an open question. Some expressions of opinion by the court in the case of The Marianna Flora appear to incline to the construction of the other side, but there is no decision in any case. The only question there was one of damages; the claim of forfeiture was abandoned by the captors and by the United States. There was nothing to call for an opinion as to the construction of the act of 1819. The passage quoted by the opposite counsel was in answer to an argument used at bar that there was nothing suspicious in the case; but there has been no adjudication upon the point. \n\n[43 U.S. 210, 222]\n\u00a0\n If the act of 1819 includes the case of an innocent owner, it must be because,\n\n 1. \nThat such owner was liable under the maritime law, or\n\n 2. \nThat Congress intended to extend that law.\n\n 1. \nAs to maritime law.\n The owner, if liable, must be so in personam or in rem.\n His liability in personam, although varying in some particulars, is mainly the same with the liability of an employer at common law. The master is his agent. In civil cases the captain can sometimes bind his owner to a greater degree than other agents can, but not for torts. The owner is always responsible for the negligence of his agent in acts done within the scope of his authority, but not where the act is wilful and beyond the authority. And this is equally true whether the agent was or was not engaged, at the time, about the business of his principal.\n The whole law is collected in Story on Agency, 456. See also Skin., 228; 1 East, 106; 4 Barn. & Ald., 592; 19 Wend. (N. Y.), 343, cases collected; 1 Hill (N. Y.), 480.\n These cases show that the owner is responsible for negligence or unskilfulness, but not for wilful torts.\n The maritime law has the same rule. 8 T. R., 533; Story on Agency, 327,  319; Curtis, 195 note, 205 note; 1 Taunt., 567; Ingersoll's Roccus, 23, notes 11, 12, 13, 15; Salk., 282; 19 Johns. (N. Y.), 235, referred to in Story's Abbott, 19; 2 Brown's Admiralty Law, 140.\n Is the owner bound in rem?\n It would be contrary to reason and justice to hold him so. If he is not bound in damages, why is his vessel responsible? There is no moral delinquency in the owner. The ship, it is true, is considered sometimes as the offender, but only when something is done for which the owner is responsible, either for his own acts or those of his agent acting within the scope of his authority. 2 Brown Adm., 142, 143. The torts of the master cannot hypothecate the ship; she is seized only until the captain gives bail. Abbott, 99, note 1; same principle, Duponceau's Bynckershoek, ch. 18, pp. 129, 150, 151, 152, 154. In prize cases there is no forfeiture except on the presumed liability of the owner. The modern doctrine is that contraband does not affect the ship, or even cargo, if it is put on board without the knowledge of the owner, even by the captain. \n\n[43 U.S. 210, 223]\n\u00a0\n Bynckershoek, ch. 12, p. 93, says, that if the owner knows of it, or the captain is executing the orders of the owner, the vessel is forfeited- otherwise not. See also 1 Rob. Adm., 67-70, 104, 130; 3 Id., 143, 178.\n The owner is not responsible in damages where the vessel becomes a pirate. 3 Wash. C. C., 262, was a case of a privateer, where the owner's bond was liable and ship too, because of an understood contract to that effect between the government and all privateers; but not so as to other vessels.\n A piratical capture does not divest the owner of his property. 1 Moll ., 88, sect. 31, book 1, ch. 4; 1 Rob., 81, 229; 6 Id., 229; 1 Beawes's Lex Mercatoria, 6th ed. 364; 1 Rolle, 285.\n Did Congress intend to extend the provisions of the maritime law?\n Before saying so, the court will look to the injustice of such a construction, and its dangerous consequences to ship-owners. The act was not intended to repair private losses, but to punish crimes; and such a construction will punish one man for offences committed by another.\n The state of the country when the act was passed was referred to by the other side, to illustrate its meaning. It was shortly after a general peace, except as to South America. Sailors were discharged from navies; privateers abounded, and the transition was easy to piracy. In all the cases in this court, the vessels had been privateers. The act, therefore, did not contemplate merchant vessels armed for defence, but ships fitted out as privateers. The vessel is confiscated by the act, but there is a singular omission as to the cargo. Why not include it, if merchant vessels were embraced by the act? The omission was intentional, because on the same day an act was passed to suppress the slave trade, in which the cargo is forfeited as well as the ship. In 5 Wheat., 338, the court were prepared to construe an act as we contend for; the owners there were said to be innocent, because the ship was in the possession of piratical captors; 5 Wheat., 352. Yet the words of that act were as peremptory for that case as the act of 1819 is for ours. In page 357, the court say, that the vessel would have been restored if she was in possession of piratical captors, because the owners would have been innocent.\n In 13 State Trials, Dawson's case, taking the vessel from the owners was itself held to be an act of piracy.\n\n 2. \nWhat is the bearing of the evidence?\n The offences of 'aggression, search,' &c., must be 'piratical,' \n\n[43 U.S. 210, 224]\n\u00a0\n that is, with an intention to commit piracy; not piracy under the law of 1790, but under the law of nations, because it punishes the vessels of other nations as well as our own, and the last section refers to piracy under the law of nations, which is sea-robbery, forcible depredation at sea, animo furandi. At common law there is no piracy. The English statute did not change the nature of the offence, but only the mode of punishing it. Is there any proof of an intention to commit robbery? if not, the case is not within the act of Congress. There seems to have been a hallucination in the captain's mind, bordering on madness; wanted always to rate his chronometer. He had many opportunities to plunder, but did not; some vessels passed by, others were supplied with provisions. He did not think he had done wrong, because he permitted his crew to go freely to the American consul at Bahia, and would not take Brazilian dollars for the powder and oil which he had lost.\n But the cargo is sought also to be condemned. At first the information contained only counts depending upon the act of Congress; two were afterwards added upon the law of nations, with a view of reaching the cargo. The capture itself was a harsh measure; the papers showed the ship to have been American property; the crew were faithful to their duty, and it would have been praiseworthy to have despatched her on her voyage, in charge of the mate. The protection of commerce does not require that the cargo in this case should be aimed at as well as the ship. The offence charged in these two counts is a 'hostile aggression with intent to plunder.' If this is piracy under the law of nations, it is merged in the act of 1819, but the offences charged are only misdemeanors. 2 Brown's Adm. appendix, p. 519.\n The Constitution gives Congress power to define and punish piracies and offences against the laws of nations. If Congress has not done it, this court cannot punish petty offences.\n Nelson, attorney-general, on the same side, examined the facts in the case as disclosed by the record, and then commented on the acts of 1819, 1823, 1825, 1790, to show the history of the legislation upon the subject of piracy. The 'restraints, aggressions,' &c., must be 'piratical,' as that term is understood by the laws of nations. The 5th section of the act of 1819 declares that persons who commit piracy, as understood by the laws of nations, shall suffer death. The 8th section of the act of 1790 was said by the court, (5 Wheat., \n\n[43 U.S. 210, 225]\n\u00a0\n 184, 185, 202, 206,) not to be repealed; this decision was given on the 1st of March, 1820, and an act of Congress was passed immediately thereafter, (15th May, 1820,) the third section of which declared what should be piracy, (3 Story, 1798,) making robbery a necessary ingredient. The act of 1825, by implication, repeals the 8th sect. of the act of 1790, by declaring such offences to be felony. No person could be indicted under the acts of Congress as a pirate, because the act of 1825 says he shall be punished with death as a felon. The consequence is, that there is no piracy recognized by the laws of the United States, except that known to the law of nations, and the act of 1819 must be so construed. The offences charged in the five first counts under that act must, therefore, be shown to be piratical under the law of nations; that is, committed for the purposes of robbery. Does the evidence justify this? The court, acting as a jury, must acquit unless the affirmative be made out clearly. The acts of the captain are like those of an insane man.\n [Mr. Nelson here commented on these acts, in the case of each vessel successively.]\n In the case of the Palmyra, 12 Wheat., 15, it is said that a petty aggression is not a cause of condemnation, unless it indicates a bad mind.\n Ought the vessel to be condemned?\n There is no other law to condemn it except that of 1819. The policy of that law was to bear upon armed vessels, or the crews of which were armed. But neither branches of the alternative includes this case. The crew cannot be said to have been armed, within the meaning of the act, because the agreement says that the vessel had only ordinary equipments. All vessels going to the Pacific carry arms for defence. In the case of the Palmyra, the court said, a vessel might be armed for commercial purposes. So here. Why did not the act of 1819 include the cargo? because it struck at privateers who have no cargo. In all revenue laws, the cargo is condemned as well as the vessel.\n If the acts of the master were piratical, that very fact protects the owners, because the first offence was against them in divesting them of their property and converting it to his own purposes. He was guilty of a barratry, at least. Can the owners lose their property through an act of piracy? The 8th sect. of the act of 1790, makes it piracy to run away with a vessel or voluntarily give her up to a pirate. If this act be in force, the captain was a pirate. \n\n[43 U.S. 210, 226]\n\u00a0\n All the cases say that piracy does not divest ownership. 5 Wheat., 338, 357, 358. There need not be personal violence in running away with a ship. 1 Gall., 247, 253, 256. The proof here shows that the captain had been negotiating in Fayal for a sale of the vessel.\n Ought the cargo to be condemned?\n The act of 1819 clearly does not embrace the cargo, and there must be something more proved than an 'aggression' or 'restraint.' The opposite counsel cannot proceed on a statute for half and the law of nations for the other half, because Congress has exercised its power in the premises. How does the law of nations reach the cargo of an unoffending owner? If the vessel be construed to be the offender, the cargo is not. In war, the cargo is condemned, but then different rules apply. The vessel must be taken in delicto.\n The Marianna Flora, 11 Wheat., 40, 57, in which case the capturing vessel was attacked. But here, the Enterprize was not.\n As to costs-they are within the discretion of the court Dunlap's Practice, 164; 2 Mason, 58; 4 Gall., 414.\n Costs cannot be appealed from. 3 Pet., 307, 319.\n R. Johnson, for the United States, in reply.\n There are three questions,\n\n 1. \nWhat is the true construction of the act of 1819, as to the vessel?\n\n 2. \nWhat is the law of nations as to the cargo?\n\n 3. \nDoes the evidence show the ship to be within the act of Congress, and the cargo to be within the law of nations?\n\n 1. \nThe act of Congress had two objects in view, first, to protect commerce; and second, to punish piracy personally. Piracy had been in part defined and punished by the act of 1790. That of 1819 was passed when commerce was suffering, and its object was to punish piracy up to the full extent of the law of nations; it is punished with death. There are three objections made by the other side: 1. That the act does not cover the case of an innocent owner, but that the United States must always show that the owner was either a pirate himself or knowingly fitted out his vessel for such purposes. 2. That the vessel must be armed for 'affensive purposes,' and that the mere fact of being armed is not enough. 3. That the acts are not piratical, because it is not shown that they were done for the purposes of plunder. \n\n[43 U.S. 210, 227]\n\u00a0\n 1. As to the innocence of the owner. Must his guilt be established? The language of the act is 'to protect merchant vessels from piratical aggressions and depredations,' and the President is authorized to instruct officers to send in any armed vessel or crew which shall have attempted any piratical aggression upon an American vessel or any other. It is not their business to ask who is the owner; the fact is enough. It is said that the vessels must be fitted out for the purpose of depredating; but the history of the matter is, that the vessels intended to be reached were not so fitted out, but seized upon by the crews for piracy. The construction of the other side entirely defeats the object of protecting commerce. There are no words in the law relating to the owners; the vessel is declared to be the guilty thing. The only facts necessary to be proved are, that the vessel was armed, and that a piratical aggression was committed. Merchant vessels can aid in these captures. If Congress had intended to exempt the property of innocent owners, they would have left some discretion in the court; but the language is, the vessel shall be condemned. It is said to be unjust to punish the innocent for the guilty; but the object of Congress was to stop the crime by breaking up the means of committing it.\n In the case of the Marianna Flora, this court said that innocence of owners was no excuse. This was not a mere dictum, as the opposite counsel have said, but a point in the case.\n 2d objection. That this vessel was not armed within the meaning of the act. The only fact which the law looks to, is, whether the vessel was armed at the time of committing the aggression. Here, both vessel and crew were armed. But it is said that the arms were put on board for an innocent voyage. True. But so it was in the case of the Marianna Flora, and the court said she might have committed an aggression within the meaning of the act. What difference does it make, when the object of the law is to protect commerce? It is not said what number of guns must be on board, or to what extent the crew must be armed. What the law regarded was, that neither should be so far armed as to be capable of injuring commerce. It is said that the aggression must be piracy as described in the 5th section; that it must amount to searobbery. But it is perfectly clear Congress did not intend this; they knew what piracy was by the law of nations, and have declared that an 'attempt' to commit a depredation shall be punished. A 'search,' 'aggression' or 'restraint' are all punishable; and these are all beyond the limits of \n\n[43 U.S. 210, 228]\n\u00a0\n national law. These offences are not punished personally, but in the 5th section piracy is punished with death. The offences, therefore, are not the same. In the case of the Palmyra, 12 Wheat., 14, 15, it was argued that the vessel could not be condemned until the person was convicted; but the court said it was not necessary, because there was no personal punishment provided in the sections against restraint, &c. There is something more meant, therefore, than piracy at common law. There need not be robbery; a 'restraint' is enough. In the 3d section, where merchant vessels are authorized to capture, the word 'piratical' is dropped; the act meant to protect against all aggressions, and considered them all as piratical.\n [Mr. Johnson here examined the cases of aggression seriatim.]\n 3d objection. That the acts were not piratical, because it is not shown that they were committed for the sake of plunder. But the amount is not material in a question of robbery, and violence threatened is as criminal as if used; and it was argued on the other side, that there was sufficient evidence to show that the captain had run away with the ship, which was piracy. The money was paid by the Portuguese vessel under fear. The boarding party was armed with pistols and a dirk. Fear was purposely instilled, or why did the captain send his men armed. The firing into the other vessels was wilful and malicious. In the Marianna Flora, the court said, if death had ensued from firing, it would have been a grave inquiry whether some greater punishment should not be inflicted, although it was under a mistake.\n 2d point. What is the law of nations as to the cargo? Did it originally cover the case; and if so, has it been abrogated by Congress?\n Where a party roves the sea to commit murder and get gain by violence, he is at war with the whole world; and when his property is seized, a right of condemnation ensues as in the case of other enemies' property. But it is objected that this cargo is the property of innocent persons. The answer is, that the same motives which induced the act of 1819 to give the vessel to the captors, induces the law of nations to give them the cargo also. Nor has this rule been changed by legislation. In the case of United States v. Smith, 5 Wheat., 153, the court say that the 8th section of the 1st article of the Constitution, giving power to Congress to define and punish piracies and offences against the laws of nations, includes the power of punishing lesser offences than piracy. Congress did not intend, by the act \n\n[43 U.S. 210, 229]\n\u00a0\n of 1819, to take away any of the admiralty jurisdiction which had previously been vested in the judiciary. We must resort to the law of nations. The power to 'define and punish' means to inflict personal punishment, and the jurisdiction of admiralty is always in rem. It is untouched by the law. If a pirate were to claim a cargo, would a court give it to him? and yet the court can only condemn or restore. Admiralty law gives to the captors the property in the thing captured; and if the vessel be condemned, what can save the cargo? the same reason applies to both, which is, holding out an inducement to captors to be vigilant. If the captain were the owner of both ship and cargo, would the court condemn his vessel and restore his cargo? In 11 Wheat., before cited, the owner of the ship is held responsible for the acts of the agent, and what good reason can be given why the owner of the cargo should not also be so, especially when he is the same person who owns the ship.\n\n Mr. Justice STORY delivered the opinion of the court.\n This is an appeal from a decree of the Circuit Court of the United States for the district of Maryland, sitting in admiralty, and affirming a decree of the District Court rendered upon an information in rem, upon a seizure brought for a supposed violation of the act of the 3d of March, 1819, ch. 75, (ch. 200,) to protect the commerce of the United States, and to punish the crime of piracy. The information originally contained five counts, each asserting a piratical aggression and restraint on the high seas upon a different vessel: one, the Madras, belonging to British subjects; another, the Sullivan, belonging to American citizens; another, the Emily Wilder, belonging to American citizens; another, the Albert, belonging to British subjects; and another upon a vessel whose name was unknown, belonging to Portuguese subjects; and this last count contained also an allegation of a piratical depredation. The Malek Adhel and cargo were claimed by the firm of Peter Harmony and Co., of New York, as their property, and the answer denied the whole gravamen of the information. At the hearing in the District Court, the vessel was condemned and the cargo acquitted, and the costs were directed to be a charge upon the property condemned. An appeal was taken by both parties to the Circuit Court; and upon leave obtained, two additional counts were there filed, one alleging a piratical aggression, restraint, and depredation upon a vessel belonging to Portuguese subjects, whose name was unknown, in a hostile manner and with intent to destroy \n\n[43 U.S. 210, 230]\n\u00a0\n and plunder the vessel, in violation of the law of nations; and another alleging an aggression by discharge of cannon and restraint upon a British vessel called the Alert, or the Albert, in a hostile manner, and with intent to sink and destroy the same vessel, in violation of the law of nations. Upon the hearing of the cause in the Circuit Court, the decree of the District Court was affirmed; and from that decree an appeal has been taken by both parties to this court.\n It was fully admitted in the court below, that the owners of the brig and cargo never contemplated or authorized the acts complained of; that the brig was bound on an innocent commercial voyage from New York to Guayamas, in California; and that the equipments on board were the usual equipments for such a voyage. It appears from the evidence that the brig sailed from the port of New York on the 30th of June, 1840, under the command of one Joseph Nunez, armed with a cannon and ammunition, and with pistols and daggers on board. The acts of aggression complained of, were committed at different times under false pretences, and wantonly and wilfully without provocation or justification, between the 6th of July, 1840, and the 20th of August, 1840, when the brig arrived at Bahia; where, in consequence of the information given to the American consul by the crew, the brig was seized by the United States ship Enterprize, then at that port, and carried to Rio Janeiro, and from thence brought to the United States.\n The general facts are fully stated in a deposition of one John Myers, the first mate of the Malek Adhel; and his testimony is corroborated by the other evidence in the cause, in its main outlines and details. The narrative, although long, cannot be better given than in his own words. He says, among other things, 'On Tuesday, the 30th of June,' [Here the judge read a part of the evidence of Myers, which is set forth in the statement of the case by the reporter.]\n Now upon this posture of the case, it has been contended, 1st, That the brig was not an armed vessel in the sense of the act of Congress of 1819, ch. 75, (ch. 200.) 2. That the aggressions, restraints, and depredations disclosed in the evidence were not piratical within the sense of the act. 3. That if the case in both respects is brought within the scope of the act, still neither the brig nor the cargo are liable to condemnation, because the owners neither participated in nor authorized the piratical acts, but are entirely innocent thereof. 4. That if the brig is so liable to condemnation, the cargo is not, either under the act of Congress or by the law of nations. \n\n[43 U.S. 210, 231]\n\u00a0\n We shall address ourselves accordingly to the consideration of each of these grounds of defence. The act of 1819, ch. 75, (ch. 200,) provides, in the first section, that the President is authorized and requested to employ the public armed ships of the United States with suitable instructions 'in protecting the merchant ships of the United States, and their crews from piratical aggressions and depredations.' By the second section the commanders of such armed vessels are authorized 'to subdue, seize, take, and send into any port of the United States any armed vessel or boat, or any vessel or boat the crew whereof shall be armed, and which shall have attempted or committed any piratical aggression, search, restraint, depredation, or seizure upon any vessel of the United States, or of the citizens of the United States, or upon any other vessel,' &c. By the third section it is provided 'that the commander and crew of any merchant vessel owned wholly or in part by a citizen thereof, may oppose and defend against any aggression, search, restraint, depredation, or seizure, which shall be attempted upon such vessel, or upon any other vessel owned as aforesaid, by the commander or crew of any other armed vessel whatsoever, not being a public, armed vessel of some nation in amity with the United States, and may subdue and capture the same.' &c. Then comes the fourth section, (upon which the five counts of the original information are founded,) which is as follows, 'That whenever any vessel or boat from which any piratical aggression, search, restraint, depredation, or seizure shall have been first attempted or made, shall be captured and brought into any port of the United States, the same shall and may be adjudged and condemned to their use and that of the captors, after due process and trial in any court having admiralty jurisdiction, and which shall be holden for the district into which such captured vessel shall be brought; and the same court shall thereupon order a sale and distribution thereof accordingly, and at their discretion.' The fifth section declares, that any person who shall on the high seas commit the crime of piracy as defined by the law of nations, shall, upon conviction thereof, be punished with death.\n Such are the provisions of the act of 1819, ch. 75, (ch. 200.) And it appears to us exceedingly clear, that the Malek Adhel is an 'armed vessel' within the true intent and meaning of the act. No distinction is taken, or even suggested in the act, as to the objects, or purposes, or character of the armament, whether it be for offence or defence, legitimate or illegitimate. The policy as well as the words \n\n[43 U.S. 210, 232]\n\u00a0\n of the act equally extend to all armed vessels which commit the unlawful acts specified therein. And there is no ground, either of principle or authority, upon which we are at liberty to extract the present case from the operation of the act.\n The next question is whether the acts complained of are piratical within the sense and purview of the act. The argument for the claimants seems to suppose, that the act does not intend to punish any aggression, which, if carried into complete execution, would not amount to positive piracy in contemplation of law. That it must be mainly, if not exclusively, done animo furandi, or lucri causa; and that it must unequivocally demonstrate that the aggression is with a view to plunder, and not for any other purpose, however hostile or atrocious or indispensable5 such purpose, may be. We cannot adopt any such narrow and limited interpretation of the words of the act; and in our judgment it would manifestly defeat the objects and policy of the act, which seems designed to carry into effect the general law of nations on the same subject in a just and appropriate manner. Where the act uses the word 'piratical,' it does so in a general sense; importing that the aggression is unauthorized by the law of nations, hostile in its character, wanton and criminal in its commission, and utterly without any sanction from any public authority or sovereign power. In short, it means that the act belongs to the class of offences which pirates are in the habit of perpetrating, whether they do it for purposes of plunder, or for purposes of hatred, revenge, or wanton abuse of power. A pirate is deemed, and properly deemed, hostis humani generis. But why is he so deemed? Because he commits hostilities upon the subjects and property of any or all nations, without any regard to right or duty, or any pretence of public authority. If he wilfully sinks or destroys an innocent merchant ship, without any other object than to gratify his lawless appetite for mischief, it is just as much a piratical aggression, in the sense of the law of nations, and of the act of Congress, as if he did it solely and exclusively for the sake of plunder, lucri causa. The law looks to it as an act of hostility, and being committed by a vessel not commissioned and engaged in lawful warfare, it treats it as the act of a pirate, and of one who is emphatically hostis humani generis. We think that the aggressions established by the evidence bring the case completely within the prohibitions of the act; and if an intent to plunder were necessary to be established, (as we think it is not,) the acts of aggression and hostility and plunder committed on the \n\n[43 U.S. 210, 233]\n\u00a0\n Portuguese vessel are sufficient to establish the fact of an open, although petty plunderage.\n Besides, the argument interprets the act of Congress as though it contained only the word 'depredation,' or at least coupled aggression and depredation as concurrent and essential circumstances to bring the case within the penal enactment of the law. But the act has no such limitations or qualifications. It punishes any piratical aggression or piratical search, or piratical restraint, or piratical seizure, as well as a piratical depredation. Either is sufficient. The search or restraint may be piratical although no plunder follows, or is found worth carrying away. What Captain Nunez designed under his false and hollow pretences and excuses it may not be easy to say, with exact confidence or certainty. It may have been to train his crew to acts of wanton and piratical mischief, or to seduce them into piratical enterprises. It may have been from a reckless and wanton abuse of power, to gratify his own lawless passions. It could scarcely have been from mental hallucinations; for there was too much method in his mad projects to leave any doubt that there was cunning and craft and worldly wisdom in his course, and that he meditated more than he chose to explain to his crew. They never suspected or accused him of insanity, although they did of purposes of fraud.\n The next question is, whether the innocence of the owners can withdraw the ship from the penalty of confiscation under the act of Congress. Here, again, it may be remarked that the act makes no exception whatsoever, whether the aggression be with or without the co-operation of the owners. The vessel which commits the aggression is treated as the offender, as the guilty instrument or thing to which the forfeiture attaches, without any reference whatsoever to the character or conduct of the owner. The vessel or boat (says the act of Congress) from which such piratical aggression, &c., shall have been first attempted or made shall be condemned. Nor is there any thing new in a provision of this sort. It is not an uncommon course in the admiralty, acting under the law of nations, to treat the vessel in which or by which, or by the master or crew thereof, a wrong or offence has been done as the offender, without any regard whatsoever to the personal misconduct or responsibility of the owner thereof. And this is done from the necessity of the case, as the only adequate means of suppressing the offence or wrong, or insuring an indemnity to the injured party. The doctrine also is familiarly applied to cases of smuggling and other misconduct under our revenue laws; and has \n\n[43 U.S. 210, 234]\n\u00a0\n been applied to other kindred cases, such as cases arising on embargo and non-intercourse acts. In short, the acts of the master and crew, in cases of this sort, bind the interest of the owner of the ship, whether he be innocent or guilty; and he impliedly submits to whatever the law denounces as a forfeiture attached to the ship by reason of their unlawful or wanton wrongs. In the case of The United States v. The Schooner Little Charles, 1 Brock., 347, 354, a case arising under the embargo laws, the same argument which has been addressed to us, was upon that occasion addressed to Mr. Chief Justice Marshall. The learned judge, in reply, said: 'This is not a proceeding against the owner; it is a proceeding against the vessel for an offence committed by the vessel; which is not the less an offence, and does not the less subject her to forfeiture because it was committed without the authority and against the will of the owner. It is true that inanimate matter can commit no offence. But this body is animated and put in action by the crew, who are guided by the master. The vessel acts and speaks by the master. She reports herself by the master. It is therefore not unreasonable that the vessel should be affected by this report.' The same doctrine was held by this court in the case of the Palmyra, 12 Wheat., 1, 14, where referring to seizures in revenue causes, it was said: 'The thing is here primarily considered as the offender, or rather the offence is primarily attached to the thing; and this whether the offence be malum prohibitum or malum in se. The same thing applies to proceeding in rem or seizures in the Admiralty.' The same doctrine has been fully recognized in the High Court of Admiralty in England, as is sufficiently apparent from the Vrow Judith, 1 Rob. Adm., 150; the Adonis, 5 Id., 256; the Mars, 6 Id., 87, and indeed in many other cases, where the owner of the ship has been held bound by the acts of the master, whether he was ignorant thereof or not. \n6\n 7\n The ship is also by the general maritime law held responsible for the torts and misconduct of the master and crew thereof, whether arising from negligence or a wilful disregard of duty; as for example, in cases of collision and other wrongs done upon the high seas or elsewhere within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, upon the general policy of that law, which looks to the instrument itself, used as the means of the mischief, as the best and surest pledge for the compensation and indemnity to the injured party. \n\n[43 U.S. 210, 235]\n\u00a0\n The act of Congress has therefore done nothing more on this point than to affirm and enforce the general principles of the maritime law and of the law of nations.\n The remaining question is, whether the cargo is involved in the same fate as the ship. In respect to the forfeiture under the act of 1819, it is plain that the cargo stands upon a very different ground from that of the ship. Nothing is said in relation to the condemnation of the cargo in the fourth section of the act; and in the silence of any expression of the legislature, in the case of provisions confessedly penal, it ought not to be presumed that their intention exceeded their language. We have no right to presume that the policy of the act reached beyond the condemnation of the offending vessel.\n The argument, then, which seeks condemnation of the cargo, must rely solely and exclusively for its support upon the sixth and seventh counts, founded upon the law of nations and the general maritime law. So far as the general maritime law applies to torts or injuries committed on the high seas and within the admiralty jurisdiction, the general rule is, not forfeiture of the offending property; but compensation to the full extent of all damages sustained or reasonably allowable, to be enforced by a proceeding therefor in rem or in personam. It is true that the law of nations goes in many cases much farther, and inflicts the penalty of confiscation for very gross and wanton violations of duty. But, then, it limits the penalty to cases of extraordinary turpitude or violence. For petty misconduct, or petty plunderage, or petty neglect of duty, it contents itself with the mitigated rule of compensation in damages. Such was the doctrine recognized by this court in the case of the Marianna Flora, 11 Wheat., 1, 40, where an attempt was made to inflict the penalty of confiscation for an asserted (but not proved) piratical or hostile aggression. Upon that occasion, the court said: 'The other count' (which was similar to those now under our consideration) 'which seeks condemnation on the ground of an asserted hostile aggression, admits of a similar answer. It proceeds upon the principle that, for gross violations of the law of nations on the high seas, the penalty of confiscation may be properly inflicted upon the offending property. Supposing the general rule to be so in ordinary cases of property taken in delicto, it is not, therefore, to be admitted, that every offence, however small, however done under a mistake of rights, or for purposes wholly defensive, is to be visited with such harsh punishments. Whatever \n\n[43 U.S. 210, 236]\n\u00a0\n may be the case, where a gross, fraudulent, and unprovoked attack is made by one vessel upon another upon the sea, which is attended with grievous loss or injury, such effects are not to be attributed to lighter faults or common negligence. It may be just in such cases to award to the injured party full compensation for his actual loss and damage; but the infliction of any forfeiture beyond this does not seem to be pressed by any considerations derived from public law.' And the court afterwards added: 'And a piratical aggression by an armed vessel sailing under the regular flag of any nation, may be justly subjected to the penalty of confiscation for such a gross breach of the law of nations. But every hostile attack in a time of peace is not necessarily piratical. It may be by mistake or in necessary self-defence, or to repel a supposed meditated attack by pirates. It may be justifiable, and then no blame attaches to the act; or it may be without any just excuse, and then it carries responsibility in damages. If it proceed farther, if it be an attack from revenge or malignity, from a gross abuse of power, and a settled purpose of mischief, then it assumes the character of a private unauthorized war, and may be punished by all the penalties which the law of nations can properly administer;' that is ( as the context shows), confiscation and forfeiture of the offending vessel.\n Now, it is impossible to read this language and not to feel that it directly applies to the present case. In the first place, it shows, that the offending vessel may, by the law of nations, in the case supposed of an attack from malignity, from a gross abuse of power, and a settled purpose of mischief, be justly subjected to forfeiture. But it is as clear that the language is solely addressed to the offending vessel and was not intended, as of course, to embrace the cargo, even if it belonged to the same owner, and he did not participate in or authorize the offensive aggression. For the court afterwards, in another part of the case, where the subject of the cargo was directly under consideration said, 'But the second count' (founded on the law of nations) 'embraces a wider range; and if it had been proved in its aggravated extent, it does not necessarily follow that the cargo ought to be exempted. That is a question which would require grave deliberation. It is in general true that the act of the master does not bind the innocent owner of the cargo; but the rule is not of universal application. And where the master is also agent and the owner of the cargo, or both ship and cargo belong to the same person, a distinction may, perhaps, arise in the principle of decision.' So that the \n\n[43 U.S. 210, 237]\n\u00a0\n court studiously avoided giving a conclusive opinion upon this point. Looking to the authorities upon this subject, we shall find that the cargo is not generally deemed to be involved in the same confiscation as the ship, unless the owner thereof co-operates in or authorizes the unlawful act. There are exceptions founded in the policy of nations, and as it were the necessities of enforcing belligerent rights against fraudulent evasions, where a more strict rule is enforced and the cargo follows the fate of the ship. But these exceptions stand upon peculiar grounds, and will be found, upon a close examination, to be consistent with, and distinguishable from, the general principle above suggested. Many of the authorities upon this subject have been cited at the bar, and others will be found copiously collected in a note in the appendix to the 2d vol. of Wheat., p. 37-40.\n The present case seems to us fairly to fall within the general principle of exempting the cargo. The owners are confessedly innocent of all intentional or meditated wrong. They are free from any imputation of guilt, and every suspicion of connivance with the master in his hostile acts and wanton misconduct. Unless, then, there were some stubborn rule, which, upon clear grounds of public policy, required the penalty of confiscation to extend to the cargo, we should be unwilling to enforce it. We know of no such rule. On the contrary, the act of Congress, pointing out, as it does, in this very case, a limitation of the penalty of confiscation to the vessel alone, satisfies our minds that the public policy of our government in cases of this nature is not intended to embrace the cargo. It is satisfied by attaching the penalty to the offending vessel, as all that public justice and a just regard to private rights require. For these reasons, we are of opinion that the decrees condemning the vessel and restoring the cargo, rendered in both the courts below, ought to be affirmed.\n There remains then, only the consideration of the costs, whether the courts below did right in making them exclusively a charge upon the proceeds of the condemned property. Costs in the admiralty are in the sound discretion of the court; and no appellate court should ordinarily interfere with that discretion, unless under peculiar circumstances. Here, no such circumstances occur. The matter of costs is not per se the proper subject of an appeal; but it can be taken notice of only incidentally as connected with the principal decree, when the correctness of the latter is directly before the court. In the present case the cargo was acquitted, and there is no ground to im- \n\n[43 U.S. 210, 238]\n\u00a0\n pute any fault to it. If it had been owned by a third person, there would have been no reason for mulcting the owner in costs, under circumstances like the present, where it was impracticable to separate the cargo from the vessel by any delivery thereof, unless in a foreign port, and no peculiar cause of suspicion attached thereto. Its belonging to the same owner might justify its being brought in and subjected to judicial examination and inquiry, as a case where there was probable cause for the seizure and detention. But there it stopped. The innocence of the owner has been fully established; the vessel has been subjected to condemnation, and the fund is amply sufficient to idemnify the captors for all their costs and charges. We see no reason why the innocent cargo, under such circumstances, should be loaded with any cumulative burdens.\n Upon the whole, we are all of opinion that the decree of the Circuit Court ought to be, and it is affirmed, without costs.\n\n\n ORDER.\n\n\n This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Maryland, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, It is now here ordered, adjudged, and decreed by this court, that the decree of the said Circuit Court in this cause be, and the same is hereby affirmed, without costs. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The word 'indispensable' is probably a misprint for 'indefensible,' but the editor has followed the language of the court as given in the former edition of these reports, by the official reporter of the court. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] See 3 Wheaton's Rep., Appendix, p. 37 to p. 40. \n[\nFootnote 7\n] CITED.
