States Supreme Court\nAMERICAN AIRLINES v. NORTH AMERICAN(1956)\nNo. 410\nArgued: Decided: April 23, 1956\n\n\n\n\n In a proceeding under 411 of the Civil Aeronautics Act, the Civil Aeronautics Board found that respondent's use of the name \"North American\" in the air transportation industry, in which it competed with American Airlines, had caused \"substantial public confusion,\" by causing persons to check in at the wrong carrier, attempt to purchase transportation from the wrong carrier, meet flights of the wrong carrier, and otherwise, that such public confusion was \"likely to continue\" and was an unfair method of competition within the meaning of 411. It further found that the public interest required elimination of the use of the name, and it ordered respondent to cease and desist from engaging in air transportation under the name of \"North American Airlines\" or any combination of the word \"American.\" Held:\n\n 1. The Board applied criteria appropriate to a determination of whether a proceeding by it in this case would be in the \"interest of the public,\" as required by 411, and it had jurisdiction to inquire into the methods of competition presented here and to determine whether they constituted a violation of the Act. Pp. 80-85.\n\n\n 2. The Board's evidentiary findings concerned confusion of the type which can support a finding of violation of 411. Pp. 85-86.\n\n\n 3. However, since this Court does not understand the Court of Appeals to have decided whether the Board's findings were supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole, the case is remanded to that Court for further proceedings in the light of this opinion. P. 86.\n\n\n 97 U.S. App. D.C. 85, 228 F.2d 432, reversed and remanded.\n\nHoward C. Westwood argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief was J. Randolph Wilson.\n\nWalter J. Derenberg argued the cause for North American Airlines, Inc., respondent. With him on the brief was Hardy K. Maclay. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 79, 80]\n\u00a0\n\n\nSolicitor General Sobeloff, Assistant Attorney General Barnes, Daniel M. Friedman, Franklin M. Stone, O. D. Ozment and Gerald F. Krassa filed a brief for the Civil Aeronautics Board, respondent.\n\nMR. JUSTICE MINTON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nTwentieth Century Airlines, Inc., was issued a letter of registration as a large irregular air carrier by the Civil Aeronautics Board in 1947. For some reason, beginning in 1951 it conducted its business under the name of North American Airlines. On March 3, 1952, it amended its articles of incorporation so as legally to change its name to North American Airlines, Inc. By letter dated March 11, 1952, it requested the C. A. B. to reissue its letter of registration in the new corporate name. The Board took no action on that request, but rather, in August 1952, adopted an Economic Regulation requiring every irregular carrier after November 15, 1952, to do business in the name in which its letter of registration was issued. 14 CFR 291.28. The Board explained that under the Regulation it would allow continued use of a different name to which good will had become attached, except where use of such name constitutes a violation of 411 of the Civil Aeronautics Act, 52 Stat. 1003, as amended, 66 Stat. 628, 49 U.S.C. 491, which prohibits unfair or deceptive commercial practices and unfair methods of competition. 17 Fed. Reg. 7809.\n\nOn October 6, 1952, respondent applied for permission to continue use of its name, \"North American Airlines.\" Petitioner, American Airlines, on October 17, 1952, filed a memorandum with the Board requesting denial of North American's application for the reasons, among others, that use of the name \"North American\" infringed upon its long-established trade name, \"American,\" and constituted an unfair method of competition in violation of 411 of \n\n[351 \nU.S. 79, 81]\n\u00a0\n the Act. The Board, as authorized by 411, on its own motion instituted an investigation and hearing into whether there was a violation of 411 by North American. It consolidated with that proceeding an investigation and hearing into the matter of North American's application for change of name in its letter of registration. American was granted leave to intervene in the consolidated proceeding.\n\nAfter extensive hearings, the Board found that respondent's use of the name \"North American\" in the air transportation industry, in which it competed with American, had caused \"substantial public confusion,\" which was \"likely to continue\" and which constituted \"an unfair or deceptive practice and an unfair method of competition within the meaning of Section 411.\" Docket Nos. 5774 and 5928 (Nov. 4. 1953), 14-15 (mimeo). It found that the public interest required elimination of the use of the name, and accordingly it denied the application of North American and ordered it to \"cease and desist from engaging in air transportation under the name `North American Airlines, Inc.,' `North American Airlines,' `North American,' or any combination of the word `American.'\" Id., at 15-16. On petition for review by North American, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia set aside the Board's order. 97 U.S. App. D.C. 85, 228 F.2d 432. American, having been admitted as a party below by intervention, sought, and we granted, certiorari. \n350 \nU.S. 894\n.\n\nAs we understand its opinion, the Court of Appeals set aside the order because the public interest in this proceeding was inadequate to justify exercise of the Board's jurisdiction under 411. Although the court was critical of the finding of \"substantial public confusion,\" it did not, on its disposition of the case, expressly disturb that or any other of the Board's findings. For the purposes of review here, we will accept the findings, and there is no cause \n\n[351 \nU.S. 79, 82]\n\u00a0\n for this Court to review the evidence. Universal Camera Corp. v. Labor Board, \n340 \nU.S. 474\n, has no application in the present posture of the case before us. The questions then presented are whether confusion between the parties' trade names justified a proceeding by the Board to protect the public and whether the kind of confusion found by the Board could support a conclusion of a violation of the statute by respondent.\n\nThis is a case of first impression under 411. That section provides that\n\n \"The Board may, upon its own initiative or upon complaint . . . if it considers that such action by it would be in the interest of the public, investigate and determine whether any air carrier . . . has been or is engaged in unfair or deceptive practices or unfair methods of competition in air transportation or the sale thereof.\"\n\n\n If the Board finds that the carrier is so engaged, \"it shall order such air carrier . . . to cease and desist from such practices or methods of competition.\" Section 411 was modeled closely after 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act,\n*\n which similarly prohibits \"unfair methods of competition in commerce, and unfair or deceptive acts or practices\" and provides for issuance of a complaint \"if it shall appear to the Commission that a proceeding by it . . . would be to the interest of the public.\" 38 Stat. 719, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 45. We may profitably look to judicial interpretation of 5 as an aid in the resolution of the questions raised here under 411. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 79, 83]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt should be noted at the outset that a finding as to the \"interest of the public\" under both 411 and 5 is not a prerequisite to the issuance of a cease and desist order as such. Rather, consideration of the public interest is made a condition upon the assumption of jurisdiction by the agency to investigate trade practices and methods of competition and determine whether or not they are unfair. Thus, this Court has held that, under 5, the Federal Trade Commission may not employ its powers to vindicate private rights and that whether or not the facts, on complaint or as developed, show the public interest to be sufficiently \"specific and substantial\" to authorize a proceeding by the Commission is a question subject to judicial review. Federal Trade Comm'n v. Klesner, \n280 \nU.S. 19\n. See also Federal Trade Comm'n v. Keppel & Bro., Inc., \n291 \nU.S. 304\n; Federal Trade Comm'n v. Royal Milling Co., \n288 \nU.S. 212\n.\n\nIn the Klesner case, two District of Columbia retailers, with a long history of acrimonious personal and business relations, were both operating stores called the \"Shade Shop.\" This Court held that the public interest merely in resolving their private unfair competition dispute would not justify the Commission in issuing a complaint. The courts of law are open to competitors for the settlement of their private legal rights, one against the other. The Board, under a mandate from Congress, is charged with the protection of the public interest as affected by practices of carriers in the field of air transportation. In exercising our function of review of the Board's jurisdiction to protect the public interest by a proceeding which may be generated from facts also giving rise to a private dispute, we must take account of the significant differences between 5 and 411. Section 5 is concerned with purely private business enterprises which cover the full spectrum of economic activity. On the \n\n[351 \nU.S. 79, 84]\n\u00a0\n other hand, the air carriers here conduct their business under a regulated system of limited competition. The business so conducted is of especial and essential concern to the public, as is true of all common carriers and public utilities. Finally, Congress has committed the regulation of this industry to an administrative agency of special competence that deals only with the problems of the industry.\n\nThe practices of the competitors here clashed in a field where Congress was specifically concerned to protect the public interest. Demonstrated confusion of the public as to the origin of major air transportation services may be of obvious national public concern. The criteria which the Board employed to determine whether the confusion here created a problem of concern to the public are contained in the following quotation from its report:\n\n\". . . the record is convincing that the public interest requires this action in order to prevent further public confusion between respondent and intervenor due to similarity of names. The maintenance of high standards in dealing with the public is expected of common carriers, and the public has a right to be free of the inconveniences which flow from confusion between carriers engaging in the transportation of persons by air. The speed of air travel may well be diminished when passengers check in for flights with the wrong carrier, or attempt to retrieve baggage from the wrong carrier, or attempt to purchase transportation from the wrong carrier, or direct their inquiries to the wrong carrier. Friends, relatives or business associates planning to meet passengers or seeking information on delayed arrivals are subject to annoyance or worse when confused as to the carrier involved. The proper handling of complaints from members of the public is impeded \n\n[351 \nU.S. 79, 85]\n\u00a0\n by confusion as to the carrier to whom the complaint should be presented. The transportation itself may differ from what the confused purchaser had anticipated (e. g., in terms of equipment), even though the time and place of arrival may be about the same. It is obvious that public confusion between air carriers operating between the same cities is adverse to the public interest . . . .\" Docket Nos. 5774 and 5928 (Nov. 4, 1953), 12-13 (mimeo).\n\n\n Under 411 it is the Board that speaks in the public interest. We do not sit to determine independently what is the public interest in matters of this kind, committed as they are to the judgment of the Board. We decide only whether, in determining what is the public interest, the Board has stayed within its jurisdiction and applied criteria appropriate to that determination. The Board has done that in the instant case. Considerations of the high standards required of common carriers in dealing with the public, convenience of the traveling public, speed and efficiency in air transport, and protection of reliance on a carrier's equipment are all criteria which the Board in its judgment may properly employ to determine whether the public interest justifies use of its powers under 411.\n\nIt is argued that respondent's use of the name \"North American\" cannot amount to an unfair or deceptive practice or an unfair method of competition authorizing the Board's order within 411. \"Unfair or deceptive practices or unfair methods of competition,\" as used in 411, are broader concepts than the common-law idea of unfair competition. See Federal Trade Comm'n v. Keppel & Bro., Inc., supra; Federal Trade Comm'n v. Raladam Co., \n283 \nU.S. 643, 648\n. The section is concerned not with punishment of wrongdoing or protection of injured competitors, but rather with protection of the public interest. See Federal Trade Comm'n v. Klesner, supra, at 27-28. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 79, 86]\n\u00a0\n The courts have held, in construing 5 of the Trade Commission Act, that the use of a trade name that is similar to that of a competitor, which has the capacity to confuse or deceive the public, may be prohibited by the Commission. Federal Trade Comm'n v. Algoma Lumber Co., \n291 \nU.S. 67\n; Juvenile Shoe Co. v. Federal Trade Comm'n, 289 F. 57. And see Pep Boys - Manny, Moe & Jack, Inc. v. Federal Trade Comm'n, 122 F.2d 158, where the confusing name was not that of any competitor. The Board found that respondent knowingly adopted a trade name that might well cause confusion. But it made no findings that the use of the name was intentionally deceptive or fraudulent or that the competitor, American Airlines, was injured thereby. Such findings are not required of the Trade Commission under 5, and there is no reason to require them of the Civil Aeronautics Board under 411. Federal Trade Comm'n v. Algoma Lumber Co., supra, at 81; Eugene Dietzgen Co. v. Federal Trade Comm'n, 142 F.2d 321, 327; D. D. D. Corp. v. Federal Trade Comm'n, 125 F.2d 679, 682; Gimbel Bros., Inc. v. Federal Trade Comm'n, 116 F.2d 578, 579; Federal Trade Comm'n v. Balme, 23 F.2d 615, 621. See also S. Rep. No. 221, 75th Cong., 1st Sess. 2.\n\nThe Board had jurisdiction to inquire into the methods of competition presented here, and its evidentiary findings concerned confusion of the type which can support a finding of violation of 411. The judgment of the Court of Appeals must therefore be reversed. However, since we do not understand the court to have decided whether the Board's findings were supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole, the case is remanded to the Court of Appeals for further proceedings in the light of this opinion.\n\n   Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] See Hearings before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce on S. 3659, 75th Cong., 3d Sess. 5; 83 Cong. Rec. 6726; Hearings before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce on S. 2 and S. 1760, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., Pt. 1, 74. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 79, 87]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom MR. JUSTICE REED concurs, dissenting.\n\nThe Court decides that a finding of \"substantial public confusion\" resulting from respondent carrier's use of the name \"North American\" constitutes a violation of 411 of the Civil Aeronautics Act, 52 Stat. 1003, as amended, 66 Stat. 628, 49 U.S.C. 491.\n\nIf the Court held that the public confusion must be substantial enough to impair - or imminently threaten to impair - the efficiency of air service, I would agree. That construction would give practical content to the phrase \"substantial public confusion.\" The Court, however, does not require a Board finding that the confusion has diminished the efficiency of air service. There is, indeed, no such finding by the Board in this case. There is only a naked finding of \"substantial public confusion\" and that such confusion is \"likely to continue.\" There is no finding that any flight was delayed because a passenger was confused; there is no finding that any passenger missed his plane because of checking in at the wrong ticket counter; there is no finding that a confused passenger boarded the wrong plane.\n\nThe Board conceded that its order requiring respondent to cease and desist from using the name \"North American\" was \"a serious sanction which necessarily involves disturbance and loss to the carrier. . . . The maintenance of high standards in dealing with the public is expected of common carriers, and the public has a right to be free of the inconveniences which flow from confusion between carriers engaging in the transportation of persons by air. The speed of air travel may well be diminished when passengers check in for flights with the wrong carrier, or attempt to retrieve baggage from the wrong carrier, or attempt to purchase transportation from the wrong carrier, \n\n[351 \nU.S. 79, 88]\n\u00a0\n or direct their inquiries to the wrong carrier.\" Docket Nos. 5774 and 5928 (Nov. 4, 1953), 12-13 (mimeo). (Italics added.)\n\nI would not permit the Board to find a violation of 411 so easily. We should require a finding that the confusion has actually caused some impairment of air service or that at least there is an imminent threat of such impairment. Certainly the type of confusion found here \"may well\" diminish the speed of air travel - if it grows to such major proportions that flights are delayed and passengers begin missing flights or boarding the wrong planes. But it is mere conjecture that will ever happen as a result of respondent's use of the name \"North American.\" The type and extent of public confusion found by the Board here would probably also be found if the Board conducted a similar inquiry into passenger confusion between Pan-American and American Airlines. It would also be surprising if the Board could not find similar confusion between Eastern and Northeast Airlines, Western and Northwest Airlines, or, if the Board had jurisdiction in the railroad industry, among Northern Pacific, Union Pacific, Western Pacific and Southern Pacific. As the dissenting member of the Board said:\n\n\"Since American Airlines, Inc., carries approximately 5 1\/2 million passengers each year over its system, I am not impressed with the fact that witnesses in this case (principally those employed by American Airlines itself) have testified that some confusion has existed between the services offered by American, on the one hand, and North American on the other. On the contrary, I would be greatly surprised, (in view of the several million phone calls and other communications which American Airlines receives every year over and above those received from passengers which it actually carries) if there were not some demonstrable public confusion between American \n\n[351 \nU.S. 79, 89]\n\u00a0\n Airlines and the respondent in this case.\" Id., at 1-2 (dissenting opinion).\n\n\n The Court relies on the cases arising under 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 38 Stat. 719, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 45. Federal Trade Comm'n v. Algoma Lumber Co., \n291 \nU.S. 67\n; Juvenile Shoe Co. v. Federal Trade Comm'n, 289 F. 57; Pep Boys v. Federal Trade Comm'n, 122 F.2d 158. Those cases are quite different. In each the Commission made more than a bald finding of \"substantial public confusion.\" It found, in the Algoma Lumber case, that a substantial number of purchasers had been misled into buying something other than what they thought they were buying. \n291 \nU.S., at 72\n. In the Juvenile Shoe case, the competitor took a name so similar (\"Juvenile Shoe Corporation\" and \"Juvenile Shoe Company, Inc.\") that confusion in the public mind was \"inevitable.\" 289 F., at 58. And the Commission made a finding that the use of the word \"Juvenile\" caused confusion and led purchasers to believe that the goods of one company were the goods of the other company. Id., at 59. In the Pep Boys case, the court approved the following test: \". . . whether the natural and probable result of the use by petitioner of the name . . . makes the average purchaser unwittingly, under ordinary conditions purchase that which he did not intend to buy.\" 122 F.2d ___, at 161.\n\nThere are no similar findings in the instant case. There is no finding here that a passenger bought a North American ticket and flew North American under the mistaken belief that he was flying American. There is no finding that any passenger missed a plane because of the confusion. If passengers mistakenly bought North American service, believing it to be American, a finding of unfair or deceptive practices or unfair methods of competition under 411 would be justified. That is a type of public \n\n[351 \nU.S. 79, 90]\n\u00a0\n confusion quite different from the confusion found in this case - reporting to the wrong ticket counter or attempting to retrieve baggage from the wrong carrier. By analogy to the 5 cases, we have here a situation where a few prospective purchasers walked into the wrong store, but never made any purchases there.\n\nI would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 79, 91]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","1":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nARCHAWSKI v. HANIOTI(1956)\nNo. 351\nArgued: March 5, 1956Decided: April 9, 1956\n\n\n\n\n A libel in admiralty alleged that petitioners paid moneys to respondent for transportation to Europe on respondent's vessel, and that respondent breached the contract by abandonment of the voyage. The libel further alleged that respondent wrongfully appropriated the passage money to his own use and committed other fraudulent acts. Held: The cause of action alleged was within the admiralty jurisdiction of the Federal District Court. Pp. 532-536.\n\n (a) The essential character of the libel as a claim for breach of a maritime contract was not altered by the allegations of wrongfulness and fraud. Pp. 534-535.\n\n\n (b) So long as the claim asserted arises out of a maritime contract, the admiralty court has jurisdiction over it. P. 535.\n\n\n (c) Admiralty has jurisdiction even where a libel reads like indebitatus assumpsit at common law, provided that the unjust enrichment arose out of the breach of a maritime contract. Pp. 535-536.\n\n\n 223 F.2d 406, reversed and remanded.\n\nHarry D. Graham argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioners.\n\nIsrael Convisser argued the cause and filed a brief for respondent.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe sole question in the case is whether the cause of action alleged comes within the admiralty jurisdiction of the District Court. The District Court held that this was an action on a maritime contract, within the admiralty jurisdiction, 129 F. Supp. 410. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the suit was in the nature of the \n\n[350 \nU.S. 532, 533]\n\u00a0\n old common law indebitatus assumpsit for money had and received, based upon the wrongful withholding of money. 223 F.2d 406. The case is here on a petition for certiorari which we granted, \n350 \nU.S. 872\n, because of the seeming conflict of that ruling with Krauss Bros. Co. v. Dimon S. S. Corp., \n290 \nU.S. 117, 124\n.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nThe libel alleges that respondent, doing business in his own and in various trade names, owned and controlled a passenger vessel, known as the City of Athens, and held out that vessel as a common carrier of passengers for hire, and that petitioners paid moneys for passage upon the vessel, scheduled for July 15, 1947, to Europe. A contract for the transportation of passengers is a maritime contract within admiralty jurisdiction.\n2\n The Moses Taylor, 4 Wall. 411. The allegations so far mentioned are plainly sufficient to establish such a contract. The libel goes on to allege a breach of that contract through an abandonment of the voyage. If this were all, it would be plain that petitioners stated a claim for breach of a maritime contract. But the libel further alleges that the sums paid by petitioners as passage money were \"wrongfully and deliberately\" applied by respondent to his own use and benefit \"in reckless disregard of his obligations to refund \n\n[350 \nU.S. 532, 534]\n\u00a0\n the same\" and that respondent \"has secreted himself away and manipulated his assets . . . for the purpose of defrauding\" petitioners. Then follow allegations of certain fraudulent acts and transactions.\n\nThe allegations of wrongfulness and fraud do not alter the essential character of the libel. For the ancient admiralty teaching is that, \"The rules of pleading in the admiralty are exceedingly simple and free from technical requirements.\" Dupont de Nemours & Co. v. Vance, 19 How. 162, 171-172. And see 2 Benedict, American Admiralty (6th ed. 1940), 223, 237. Though these particular allegations of the libel sound in fraud or in the wrongful withholding of moneys, it is plain in the context that the obligation to pay the moneys arose because of a breach of the contract to transport passengers. Lawyers speak of the obligation in terms of indebitatus assumpsit, a concept whose tortuous development gave expression to \"the ethical character of the law.\" See Ames. The History of Assumpsit, 2 Harv. L. Rev. 1, 53, 58 (1888). As Mr. Justice Holmes once put it, \"An obligation to pay money generally is enforced by an action of assumpsit and to that extent is referred to a contract even though it be one existing only by fiction of law.\" Thomas v. Matthiessen, \n232 \nU.S. 221, 235\n.\n\nThe fiction sometimes distorted the law. A line of authorities emerged to the effect that admiralty had no jurisdiction to grant relief in such cases \"because the implied promise to repay the moneys which cannot in good conscience be retained - necessary to support the action for money had and received - is not a maritime contract.\"\n3\n United Transp. & L. Co. v. New York & B. T. Line, 185 F. 386, 391. Yet that duty to pay is often referable, \n\n[350 \nU.S. 532, 535]\n\u00a0\n as here, to the breach of a maritime contract. As Mr. Justice Stone said in Krauss Bros. Co. v. Dimon S. S. Corp., supra, at 124:\n\n \". . . Even under the common law form of action for  money had and received there could be no recovery  without proof of the breach of the contract involved  in demanding the payment, and the basis of recovery  there, as in admiralty, is the violation of some term  of the contract of affreightment, whether by failure  to carry or by exaction of freight which the contract  did not authorize.\"\n\n\n The truth is that in a case such as the present one there is neither an actual promise to repay the passage moneys nor a second contract. The problem is to prevent unjust enrichment from a maritime contract. See Morrison, The Remedial Powers of the Admiralty, 43 Yale L. J. 1. 27 (1933). A court that prevents a maritime contract from being exploited in that way does not reach beyond the domain of maritime affairs. We conclude that, so long as the claim asserted arises out of a maritime contract, the admiralty court has jurisdiction over it.\n\nThe philosophy of indebitatus assumpsit is, indeed, not wholly foreign to admiralty. Analogous conceptions of rights based on quasi-contract are found in admiralty. One who saves property at sea has the right to an award of salvage, regardless of any agreement between him and the owner. See Mason v. Ship Blaireau, 2 Cranch 240, 266; The Sabine, \n101 \nU.S. 384, 390\n; 1 Benedict, supra, 117 et seq. Likewise, where cargo is jettisoned, the owner becomes entitled to a contribution in general average from the owners of other cargo which was saved without the aid of any agreement. See Barnard v. Adams, 10 How. 270, 303-304; Star of Hope, 9 Wall. 203, 228-230; 1 Benedict, supra, 98. Other examples could be given. See Chandler, Quasi Contractual Relief \n\n[350 \nU.S. 532, 536]\n\u00a0\n in Admiralty, 27 Mich. L. Rev. 23 (1928). Rights which admiralty recognizes as serving the ends of justice are often indistinguishable from ordinary quasi-contractual rights created to prevent unjust enrichment. How far the concept of quasi-contracts may be applied in admiralty it is unnecessary to decide. It is sufficient this day to hold that admiralty has jurisdiction, even where the libel reads like indebitatus assumpsit at common law, provided that the unjust enrichment arose as a result of the breach of a maritime contract. Such is the case here.\n\nThe judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the Court of Appeals for proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n\n   Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] There is also an apparent conflict with Sword Line v. United States, 228 F.2d 344, 346, decided, after we granted certiorari, by a different panel of the Second Circuit from the one which sat in the instant case.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The Court in New Jersey Steam Navigation Company v. Merchants' Bank, 6 How. 344, 392, stated that in determining admiralty jurisdiction the inquiry is \"into the nature and subject-matter of the contract, - whether it was a maritime contract, and the service a maritime service, to be performed upon the sea, or upon waters within the ebb and flow of the tide. And, again, whether the service was to be substantially performed upon the sea, or tide-waters, although it had commenced and had terminated beyond the reach of the tide; if it was, then jurisdiction has always been maintained.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] And see Israel v.

ARMSTRONG(1956)\nNo. 38\nArgued: November 15, 1955Decided: April 9, 1956\n\n\n\n\n Petitioner, a resident of Florida, obtained there a divorce from his wife, who had separated from him and gone to Ohio, where she had established a residence. The service of process on her was constructive only, she did not appear, and the Florida court decreed that \"no award of alimony be made\" to her. Later, the wife sued in Ohio for divorce and alimony, and petitioner appeared and set up the Florida divorce. The Ohio court denied a divorce because of the prior Florida decree, but granted the wife alimony. Held: The Florida court did not adjudicate the wife's right to alimony, and the Ohio court therefore did not fail to give full faith and credit to the Florida decree. Pp. 568-572.\n\n 162 Ohio St. 406, 123 N. E. 2d 267, affirmed.\n\nRobert N. Gorman argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief were James N. Hengelbrok and Julius R. Samuels.\n\nWalter K. Sibbald argued the cause and filed a brief for Armstrong, respondent.\n\nMR. JUSTICE MINTON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe petitioner, while residing in Dade County, Florida, filed a suit for divorce from his wife, who had separated from him and gone to Ohio, where she had established her residence. The wife was not personally served, nor did she appear in person or by attorney in the Florida suit. Service on her was constructive only. A divorce decree was granted petitioner by the Florida court, and he contends that that court also denied alimony to the respondent.\n\nLater, the respondent wife instituted a suit in Ohio for divorce and for alimony. The petitioner appeared and \n\n[350 \nU.S. 568, 569]\n\u00a0\n set up the divorce obtained in Florida. The Ohio court found that the respondent had established grounds for divorce in Ohio but denied the divorce because Florida had already decreed a divorce to the petitioner. The Ohio court proceeded to pass on the question of alimony and granted the wife alimony, taking into account the total property owned by the petitioner. The petitioner appealed to the Court of Appeals, 99 Ohio App. 7, 130 N. E. 2d 710, and then to the Supreme Court of Ohio, which affirmed the judgments of the lower courts. 162 Ohio St. 406, 123 N. E. 2d 267. Petitioner argued and contends here that the Ohio courts have denied full faith and credit to the Florida decree. We granted certiorari. \n349 \nU.S. 915\n.\n\nThe sole question presented by the petition for certiorari was whether the Ohio courts were required to give full faith and credit to the ex parte Florida divorce decree, which petitioner alleges not only granted him a divorce but also decreed that the wife was not entitled to alimony. As we interpret the Florida decree, however, the Florida court did not purport to adjudicate the absent wife's right to alimony. The Ohio courts, therefore, in awarding alimony to the wife, did not in fact fail to give full faith and credit to the Florida decree. Accordingly, we do not reach the constitutional question sought to be presented. But even if there is doubt as to the meaning of the Florida decree, we should construe its action as a refusal to pass on the question of alimony and thus avoid the constitutional question as to its power to do so.\n\nThe Florida court found that Mrs. Armstrong \"has not come into this court in good faith or made any claim to the equitable conscience of the court and has made no showing of any need on her part for alimony. It is, therefore, specifically decreed that no award of alimony be made to the defendant . . . .\" Taken literally, that language means only that, for the reasons it gave, the \n\n[350 \nU.S. 568, 570]\n\u00a0\n court would refrain from making an affirmative award of alimony to the wife, not that it adjudicated in favor of the husband that his wife was not entitled to alimony. The husband's bill of complaint did not ask for greater relief. It offered to show that Mrs. Armstrong's interest in jointly held property was \"ample to support the defendant and that she has no further need of alimony.\" The purpose of this offer, however, was revealed by the next sentence of the complaint: \"Nevertheless the plaintiff hereby offers to do equity and to abide by such orders or decrees, with reference to the settlement of the property affairs, as to this court may be deemed equitable.\" Thus the husband did not seek a decree holding the wife not entitled to alimony but rather merely submitted to the court's jurisdiction to condition its grant of divorce to him upon an award of alimony to his wife. The prayer for relief was fully satisfied by the decision that protection of the absent wife did not require the court to fix alimony before granting the divorce.\n\nThe Florida master's report is confirmatory of the limited scope of the decree. The master stated that \"the question of the wife's alimony, if any, cannot be determined at this stage of the proceeding.\" pointing out that most of the marital property was in the wife's possession in Ohio and was the subject matter of litigation pending there. He accordingly found that \"the defendant is not entitled to receive alimony . . . under the facts and circumstances presented in this case\" and recommended \"that no award of alimony be made.\" The master's recommendation meant no more than that the question of alimony should not be decided because the wife had in her possession property adequate to meet her immediate needs, and the unresolved litigation made it impossible to determine her future needs. Presumably, the court's decree meant no more when it adopted in terms the master's recommendation that \"no award of alimony be \n\n[350 \nU.S. 568, 571]\n\u00a0\n made.\" Like the master's report, the decree expressly recognized that the parties' property rights depended upon the outcome of the pending litigation in Ohio and that the wife had not shown any need for alimony.\n\nWhen the Florida court said, \"it is, therefore, specifically decreed that no award of alimony be made to the defendant,\" it recognized that no issue of alimony should be decided by it. The court simply said that no award of alimony be made - a purely negative assertion that it would not pass on the question.\n\nIt is true that the decree \"that no award of alimony be made\" was followed in the same sentence by a declaration, based on the court's and master's view of Florida property law, quieting title in the husband to certain Florida real property. At most, however, the fact that both matters were dealt with in a single sentence suggests only that the court might have reserved alimony out of that specific property had it concluded that such action was necessary to protect the wife's interests. That it did not do so is consistent with our conclusion that the Florida court did no more than refrain from awarding alimony at that time.\n\nThere was a valid decree in Florida dissolving the bonds of matrimony. There was no decree as to alimony. Ohio had personal service on both parties in a suit for divorce and alimony brought there by Mrs. Armstrong. The court denied her a decree of divorce because Florida had already dissolved the bonds of matrimony. The Ohio court found that, but for the decree in Florida, Mrs. Armstrong had established grounds for divorce in the Ohio suit. It considered that the matter before it was not a division of property, but an application for alimony, and it proceeded to hear evidence on that basis and finally entered a personal judgment against the defendant husband for alimony. The Ohio court, which had complete jurisdiction of both parties and the cause of action, entered \n\n[350 \nU.S. 568, 572]\n\u00a0\n a decree as to alimony only, which decree seems clearly authorized by the Ohio cases. Slapp v. Slapp, 143 Ohio St. 105, 54 N. E. 2d 153; Cox v. Cox, 19 Ohio St. 502. The Florida judgment was given full faith and credit by Ohio as far as the judgment in Florida went, and no other questions are presented here.\n\nThe judgment is\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER, joining the opinion of the Court.\n\nIt is, of course, desirable to have a Court opinion, if one can be achieved without straining one's conscience. I am sufficiently in agreement with MR. JUSTICE MINTON'S construction of the Florida decree to be able to join him.\n\nOn my study of the record, I would dismiss the writ as improvidently granted. And for these reasons. After a case has been heard on the merits, it is to be disposed of on the precise issue that full study of the case discloses, and not on the basis of the preliminary examination of the questions that were urged in the petition for certiorari. Due regard for the working of the certiorari system requires this. In view of the fact that about 1,300 applications were made last Term for leave to be heard (and this is a fair average of the volume of the Court's business), determination during this sifting process of the jurisdictional merits in all these 1,300 cases can hardly be expected. Theory and practice alike reject any such notion. The inevitably cursory consideration that is normally given in a case on the preliminary round precludes the assumption that a tentative finding of a federal question will survive the thorough study of the record which consideration of a case on the merits implies. Therefore, it is that cases have again and again been dismissed for want of jurisdiction, i. e., a substantial federal question was found wanting; on the contrary, it became \n\n[350 \nU.S. 568, 573]\n\u00a0\n clear that the state court judgment rested on an adequate state ground.\n\nThe petition for writ of certiorari in this case vigorously argued that\n\n \"The sole question is whether the courts of Ohio, under Article IV of the Constitution of the United States, are compelled to give full faith and credit to the entire decree, granting a divorce, and denying alimony, rendered by the court in Florida, the matrimonial domicile of the parties, following the decision of Thompson v. Thompson, \n226 \nU.S. 551\n.\"\n\n\n The references to the Florida decree in the opinion of the Ohio Supreme Court - the two documents are hardly to be deemed conspicuously lucid - warranted, without more, a belief that the case did present the question formulated by petitioner. Such a question would, no doubt, raise an important problem in the construction of the Full Faith and Credit Clause.\n\nBut the course of the oral argument, for such is one of its functions, and an exacting scrutiny of the record, for such is the requirement of plenary consideration of a case, put in a very different light the decree of the Florida court and thereby the significance of the litigation in Ohio.\n\nA study of the Florida decree, a portion of which is set out in the margin,\n1\n in conjunction with Florida case law\n2\n\u00a0\n\n[350 \nU.S. 568, 574]\n\u00a0\n demonstrates, I believe, that Florida expressly disavowed any adjudication regarding claims to and in property situated in Ohio, the very properties which are the subject matter of the challenged Ohio decree.\n\nThus, the sole question that survives is the power of Ohio, as a matter of its own policy, to define rights in property situated in Ohio in the circumstances of this case. A question of due process might be raised, though not successfully. (Both the real property and securities which had their locus in Ohio were subject to Ohio's control in that both items constituted \"property within the State.\" Pennington v. Fourth National Bank, \n243 \nU.S. 269, 271\n.) In any event, it was not raised, and the claim under the Full Faith and Credit Clause has evaporated, because Ohio merely dealt with property within its borders which Florida had not purported to affect.\n\nOf course we have to go through all this reasoning to determine whether a substantial federal question was raised by reason of Ohio's disregard of Florida's decree. The Court not infrequently is required to find its way through a tangled or confused record in order to determine whether a state court judgment turned on a state ground or on a federal ground. In short, the Court has jurisdiction to decide whether it has jurisdiction. But when adequate analysis discloses that a state judgment amply rests on a state ground, we are barred from proceeding to the merits of the alleged federal question. The appropriate disposition is to dismiss the case for want of jurisdiction.\n\n[For concurring opinion of MR. JUSTICE BLACK, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS and MR. JUSTICE CLARK, see next page.]\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"This court takes recognition of the fact that litigation is now pending in the state of Ohio relative to the recovery of . . . stocks and bonds as well as the settlement of other matters concerning property rights between the parties.

JUSTICE CLARK join, concurring.\n\nThe opinion of the Court takes the position that the Florida court did not adjudicate Mrs. Armstrong's right to alimony. We cannot agree. In the husband's Florida complaint he alleged that his wife's property was \"ample to support the defendant and that she has no further need of alimony or property settlement.\" The Florida court expressly held that it had jurisdiction over both parties and over the subject matter of the complaint. It then proceeded to find that the wife was at fault in leaving her husband and the \"matrimonial domicile.\" The court even suggested that Mrs. Armstrong was guilty of a criminal act in taking some of her husband's money and securities to Ohio. The decree continued: \"This court, therefore, finds the defendant has not come into this court in good faith or made any claim to the equitable conscience of the court and has made no showing of any need on her part for alimony. It is, therefore, specifically decreed that no award of alimony be made to the defendant . . . .\" (Emphasis added.) This was plainly a denial of alimony, not on the ground that the court was leaving the matter open but because the judge thought the wife should not have alimony.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nWe agree with the majority that the Ohio decree was an alimony judgment and not a division of property. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 568, 576]\n\u00a0\n Thus in our view there is a direct conflict between that decree and the decree of the Florida court denying alimony to the wife. We therefore reach the constitutional question whether the Ohio court was justified in denying full faith and credit to the Florida decree.\n\nWe believe that Ohio was not compelled to give full faith and credit to the Florida decree denying alimony to Mrs. Armstrong. Our view is based on the absence of power in the Florida court to render a personal judgment against Mrs. Armstrong depriving her of all right to alimony although she was a nonresident of Florida, had not been personally served with process in that State, and had not appeared as a party. It has been the constitutional rule in this country at least since Pennoyer v. Neff, \n95 \nU.S. 714\n, decided in 1878, that nonresidents cannot be subjected to personal judgments without such service or appearance. We held in Estin v. Estin, \n334 \nU.S. 541\n, that an alimony judgment was this kind of \"personal judgment.\" See also Kreiger v. Kreiger, \n334 \nU.S. 555\n; Barber v. Barber, 21 How. 582, 588; Barrett v. Failing, \n111 \nU.S. 523, 525\n. The Estin case was much like this one. There, after the wife had obtained a separation and permanent alimony decree in New York, the husband went to Nevada and obtained a divorce. In accord with our previous holding in Williams v. North Carolina, \n317 \nU.S. 287\n, we held that the Nevada divorce was valid and must be given full faith and credit by New York even though rendered without personal service on the wife. It was argued that New York also had to recognize Nevada's rule of law that the dissolution of a marriage put an end to a support order. We held, however, that Nevada could not adjudicate rights of the wife under the New York judgment because she had not been personally served with process and did not appear in the Nevada proceedings. \n334 \nU.S., at 547\n-549. The considerations supporting that holding are \n\n[350 \nU.S. 568, 577]\n\u00a0\n applicable here. The fact that Mrs. Estin's claim to support had been reduced to judgment prior to divorce while Mrs. Armstrong's had not is not a meaningful distinction. Mrs. Armstrong's right to support before judgment, like Mrs. Estin's right to support after judgment, is the kind of personal right which cannot be adjudicated without personal service. Cf. May v. Anderson, \n345 \nU.S. 528\n.\n\nThe husband here seeks to distinguish the Estin case on the ground that there the husband left the \"matrimonial domicile\" and established a residence elsewhere, while here the husband kept his domicile in Florida and the wife fled from him. He argues, as the Florida court held, that it was impossible as a matter of law for Mrs. Armstrong to obtain a new domicile separate and apart from that of her husband. He bases this argument on the Florida court's finding on ex parte evidence that Florida, where the couple had resided during a considerable part of their marriage, was the \"matrimonial domicile,\" and that the wife had left her home in Florida without cause. On this premise, the Florida court held that she \"did not have the right to separate and claim a separate legal domicile and in truth and in fact, her domicile was that of her husband.\" The fiction that a woman cannot have a separate \"domicile\" from that of her husband is a relic of the old discredited idea that women must always play a subordinate role in society; it does not justify a departure from settled constitutional principles. The concept of \"matrimonial domicile\" was expressly repudiated in both the Williams cases.\n2\n Yet the Court is asked to say here that a State's power over \n\n[350 \nU.S. 568, 578]\n\u00a0\n an alimony case is to depend on which spouse is to blame in leaving the other. We adhere to what was said in the first Williams case: \"the question as to where the fault lies has no relevancy to the existence of state power in such circumstances.\" \n317 \nU.S., at 300\n.\n\nRelying on Milliken v. Meyer, \n311 \nU.S. 457\n, the husband further contends that regardless of \"matrimonial domicile\" personal service was unnecessary because Mrs. Armstrong was actually domiciled in Florida at the time the Florida action was brought. The Florida court did find she was domiciled there, but that was in an uncontested proceeding. This finding was open to challenge in Ohio. Williams v. North Carolina, \n325 \nU.S. 226\n. The issue was tried in Ohio with both parties present, and the trial court expressly found that Mrs. Armstrong had returned to Ohio and was a \"resident\" there within the meaning of the Ohio divorce statute at the time the Florida divorce proceedings were instituted. See Page's Ohio Rev. Code Ann., 1954, 3105.03. This statute has been uniformly interpreted by the Ohio courts to require residence accompanied by an intention to make the State of Ohio a permanent home. See, e. g., Saalfeld v. Saalfeld, 86 Ohio App. 225, 89 N. E. 2d 165. We would accept the Ohio court's finding that Mrs. Armstrong was such a resident of Ohio when the Florida suit was brought as amply supported by evidence in the record. Consequently the husband's reliance on Milliken v. Meyer is misplaced.\n\nThere was nothing novel in our holding in Estin v. Estin that a State where one of the parties to a marriage is domiciled can dissolve the marriage without personal service but that it cannot render a personal decree granting or denying alimony. The distinction between a decree which grants a divorce and one which grants a personal money judgment was recognized and the reasons for the distinction were stated by this Court in Pennoyer v. Neff, \n\n[350 \nU.S. 568, 579]\n\u00a0\n \n95 \nU.S. 714\n.\n3\n The state courts have long recognized the rule that a court lacking personal jurisdiction over a husband cannot render a valid alimony judgment against him.\n4\n We see no reason why a court lacking personal jurisdiction \n\n[350 \nU.S. 568, 580]\n\u00a0\n over a wife should be allowed to render a valid judgment denying alimony to her.\n5\n Personal jurisdiction is as necessary to protect a wife's interests as it is to protect a husband's. It is an essential to this kind of determination. Not long after Pennoyer v. Neff was decided, this Court upheld the validity of a legislative divorce which was granted without notice, service of process or a hearing of any kind, judicial or otherwise. Maynard v. Hill, \n125 \nU.S. 190\n.\n6\n But legislative divorces attempting to create or destroy financial obligations incident to marriage have not been sustained by the courts.\n7\n Thus the different treatment Estin v. Estin accorded to alimony and divorce is well grounded in the judicial and legislative history of our country.\n\nIt is argued that this case is controlled by Thompson v. Thompson, \n226 \nU.S. 551\n. That case, however, was decided before the Williams cases, the Estin and Kreiger cases, and May v. Anderson. It relied, moreover, on the case of Atherton v. Atherton, \n181 \nU.S. 155\n, which in holding that an ex parte divorce was entitled to full faith and credit itself quoted extensively from authorities recognizing that such a divorce may be binding \"so far as related to the dissolution of the marriage, though not as to other parts of the decree, such as an order for the payment of money by the husband.\" \n181 \nU.S., at 166\n. The \n\n[350 \nU.S. 568, 581]\n\u00a0\n Thompson case stands alone in the United States Reports in supporting the proposition that a valid ex parte divorce in one State cuts off alimony rights in another.\n8\n To the extent that the Thompson decision can be considered as in any way inconsistent with Pennoyer v. Neff and Estin v. Estin, the Thompson case should no longer be considered to be the law.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons we concur with the Court in affirming the judgment of the Supreme Court of Ohio.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER'S separate opinion takes the position that \"Ohio merely dealt with property within its borders which Florida had not purported to affect.\" But the Florida decree stated that Mrs. Armstrong \"is hereby directed and specifically ordered to return the said stock certificates and bonds to the plaintiff within fifteen (15) days . . . .\" These were the very stocks which the Ohio court ordered Mr. Armstrong to transfer to Mrs. Armstrong as alimony.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Williams v. North Carolina, \n317 \nU.S. 287, 325\n U.S. 226. In the latter case the Court said: \"In view of Williams v. North Carolina, supra, the jurisdictional requirement of domicil is freed from confusing refinements about `matrimonial domicile' . . . and the like.\" \n325 \nU.S., at 230\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] \". . . we do not mean to assert, by any thing we have said, that a State may not authorize proceedings to determine the status of one of its citizens towards a non-resident, which would be binding within the State, though made without service of process or personal notice to the non-resident. . . . The State, for example, has absolute right to prescribe the conditions upon which the marriage relation between its own citizens shall be created, and the causes for which it may be dissolved. One of the parties guilty of acts for which, by the law of the State, a dissolution may be granted, may have removed to a State where no dissolution is permitted. The complaining party would, therefore, fail if a divorce were sought in the State of the defendant; and if application could not be made to the tribunals of the complainant's domicile in such case, and proceedings be there instituted without personal service of process or personal notice to the offending party, the injured citizen would be without redress.\" Pennoyer v. Neff, \n95 \nU.S., at 734\n-735.\n\nAs early as 1832 the distinction received recognition in a state court. Harding v. Alden, 9 Greenl. (Me.) 140. There the court said:\n\n\"In giving effect here to the divorce decreed in Rhode Island, we would wish to be understood, that the grounds upon which we place our decision, is limited to the dissolution of the marriage. In the libel, alimony was prayed for; and certain personal property, then in the possession of the wife, was decreed to her. Had the court awarded her a gross sum, or a weekly or an annual allowance, to be paid by the husband, and the courts of this or any other State had been resorted to to enforce it, a different question would be presented . . . .\" 9 Greenl.

WISCONSIN BOARD(1956)\nNo. 530\nArgued: Decided: June 4, 1956\n\n\n\n\n An employer which was subject to the National Labor Relations Act filed a complaint with the Wisconsin Employment Relations Board charging appellant union and others with committing unfair labor practices within the meaning of the Wisconsin Employment Peace Act, which practices were also unfair labor practices under the National Labor Relations Act, as amended. The employer alleged that, during a strike, members of the union had engaged in mass picketing, thereby obstructing ingress to and egress from the employer's plant; interfered with the free and uninterrupted use of public highways; prevented persons who desired to be employed from entering the plant; coerced employees who desired to work, and threatened them and their families with physical injury. The State Board found the allegations to be true and issued an order directing the union and certain of its members to cease all such activities. This order was enforced by a Wisconsin State Court. Held: The order of the State Board is valid and the judgment of the State Court enforcing it is affirmed. Pp. 267-275.\n\n (a) Section 8 (b) (1) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, is not the exclusive method of controlling violence even against employees, much less violence interfering with others approaching an area where a strike is in progress; and the Federal Act does not so occupy the field as to prevent a State from enjoining such violence. Pp. 271-273.\n\n\n (b) The fact that a union commits a federal unfair labor practice while engaging in violent conduct does not prevent a State from taking steps to stop the violence. P. 274.\n\n\n (c) A different result is not required by the fact that the State acted under a state labor-relations statute, rather than under a general state law against violence and coercion, nor by the fact that the State has chosen to entrust its power to a labor board. Pp. 273-275.\n\n\n 269 Wis. 578, 70 N. W. 2d 191, affirmed. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 266, 267]\n\u00a0\n\n\nKurt L. Hanslowe argued the cause for appellant. With him on the brief were Harold A. Cranefield, Max Raskin and Redmond H. Roche, Jr.\n\nBeatrice Lampert, Assistant Attorney General of Wisconsin, argued the cause for the Wisconsin Employment Relations Board, appellee. With her on the brief were Vernon W. Thomson, Attorney General, and Stewart G. Honeck, Deputy Attorney General.\n\nJerome Powell argued the cause for the Kohler Company, appellee. With him on the brief were John C. Gall, John F. Lane, William F. Howe and Lyman C. Conger.\n\nBriefs of amici curiae urging affirmance were filed by John Ben Shepperd, Attorney General, and Burnell Waldrep, Philip Sanders and John Atchison, Assistant Attorneys General, for the State of Texas, and E. R. Callister, Attorney General, and Raymond W. Gee, Assistant Attorney General, for the State of Utah, and Eugene Cook, Attorney General, for the State of Georgia.\n\nMR. JUSTICE REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis case, as stated in the brief for the United Automobile, Aircraft and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, presents the question whether or not a State may enjoin through its labor statute, the Wisconsin Employment Peace Act, union conduct of a kind which may be an unfair labor practice under the National Labor Relations Act, as amended.\n1\n\u00a0\n\n[351 \nU.S. 266, 268]\n\u00a0\n\n\nAppellant concedes that a State may punish violence arising in labor relation controversies under its generally applicable criminal statutes. It does not admit or deny the charged violence. The union considers the coercion immaterial in this case. Its position is that a State may not exercise this police power through an agency that is concerned only with labor relations. The argument is that a State Board will use this power to stop force and violence in order to further state labor policy, thus creating a conflict with the federal policy as developed by the National Labor Relations Board. The union argues that Wisconsin has no jurisdiction to enjoin the alleged conduct under its labor act because such conduct would be an unfair labor practice under the National Labor Relations Act.\n\nThis controversy arose out of the failure of appellant and the Kohler Company to reach an accord concerning a new collective-bargaining agreement. As the parties were unable to agree, Kohler's production workers struck and picketed the premises of the company. Ten days later Kohler filed a complaint with the Wisconsin Employment Relations Board charging appellant and others with committing unfair labor practices within the meaning of the Wisconsin Employment Peace Act.\n2\n It was alleged that appellant's members had engaged in mass picketing, thereby obstructing ingress to and egress from the Kohler plant; interfered with the free and uninterrupted \n\n[351 \nU.S. 266, 269]\n\u00a0\n use of public ways; prevented persons desiring to be employed by Kohler from entering the plant; and coerced employees who desired to work, and threatened them and their families with physical injury. The State Board found the allegations to be true and issued an order that directed the union and certain of its members to cease all such activities. The order appears below.\n3\n\u00a0\n\n[351 \nU.S. 266, 270]\n\u00a0\n Without change of substance it was enforced by a Wisconsin Circuit Court, and the State Supreme Court affirmed that judgment. 269 Wis. 578, 70 N. W. 2d 191. As the appeal raised an important question of federalism, we noted probable jurisdiction. \n350 \nU.S. 957\n.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nThe Kohler Company is subject to the National Labor Relations Act. It seems agreed, and we think correctly in view of the findings of fact, that the alleged conduct of the union in coercing employees in the exercise of their rights is a violation of 8 (b) (1) of that Act.\n5\n Since \n\n[351 \nU.S. 266, 271]\n\u00a0\n there is power under the Act to protect employees against violence from labor organizations by assuring their right to refrain from concerted labor activities, the National Labor Board might have issued an order similar to that of the State Board.\n6\n The provisions of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, cover the labor relations of the Kohler Company. Labor Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., \n301 \nU.S. 1, 31\n. These provisions may be assumed to include the coercion not only of strikers but also of other persons seeking employment with the plant.\n7\n\u00a0\n\nBy virtue of the Commerce Clause, Congress has power to regulate all labor controversies in or affecting interstate commerce, such as are here involved. If the congressional enactment occupies the filed, its control by the Supremacy Clause supersedes or, in the current phrase, pre-empts state power. Kelly v. Washington, \n302 \nU.S. 1, 9\n. In the 1935 Act, 10 (a), the Board was empowered to prevent unfair labor practices. By 10 (a) this power was made \"exclusive.\" 49 Stat. 449, 453, 29 U.S.C. 160. In the Taft-Hartley amendments of 1947, the word \"exclusive\" was omitted but the phrase, \"shall not be affected by any other means of adjustment or prevention that has been or may be established by agreement, code, law, or otherwise,\" was re-enacted without significant change. The omission was explained in the Conference Report.\n8\n\u00a0\n\n[351 \nU.S. 266, 272]\n\u00a0\n\n\nYet under the 1935 Wagner Act this Court ruled that Wisconsin, under its same Labor Peace Act, could enjoin union conduct of the kind here involved. Allen-Bradley Local v. Wisconsin Board, \n315 \nU.S. 740\n. At that time, however, the federal Act made no provision for enjoining union activities. With the passage of the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947, the Congress recognized that labor unions also might commit unfair labor practices to the detriment of employees, and prohibited, among other practices, coercion of employees who wish to refrain from striking. See n. 5, supra. Appellant urges that this amendment eliminated the State's power to control the activities now under consideration through state labor statutes.\n\nIt seems obvious that 8 (b) (1) was not to be the exclusive method of controlling violence even against employees, much less violence interfering with others approaching an area where a strike was in progress.\n9\n No one suggests that such violence is beyond state criminal power. The Act does not have such regulatory pervasiveness. The state interest in law and order precludes such interpretation. Senator Taft explained that the federal \n\n[351 \nU.S. 266, 273]\n\u00a0\n prohibition against union violence would allow state action.\n10\n\u00a0\n\nAppellant is of the view that such references were \"to the general state criminal law against violence and coercion, not to state labor relations statutes.\" But this cannot be correct since Allen-Bradley Local v. Wisconsin Board, the leading case dealing with violence under this same Wisconsin statute, was well known to Congress.\n11\n\u00a0\n\n[351 \nU.S. 266, 274]\n\u00a0\n The fact that the Labor Management Relations Act covered union unfair practices for the first time does not make the Allen-Bradley case obsolete. Orders which originate in state boards and become effective through the state judiciary should give more careful protection to the rights of labor than the purely judicial orders of a court.\n\nThere is no reason to re-examine the opinions in which this Court has dealt with problems involving federal-state jurisdiction over industrial controversies. They have been adequately summarized in Weber v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., \n348 \nU.S. 468, 474\n-477. As a general matter we have held that a State may not, in the furtherance of its public policy, enjoin conduct \"which has been made an `unfair labor practice' under the federal statutes.\" Id., at 475, and cases cited. But our post-Taft-Hartley opinions have made it clear that this general rule does not take from the States power to prevent mass picketing, violence, and overt threats of violence.\n12\n The dominant interest of the State in preventing violence and property damage cannot be questioned. It is a matter of genuine local concern. Nor should the fact that a union commits a federal unfair labor practice while engaging in violent conduct prevent States from taking steps to stop the violence. This conclusion has been explicit in the opinions cited in note 12.\n\nThe States are the natural guardians of the public against violence. It is the local communities that suffer \n\n[351 \nU.S. 266, 275]\n\u00a0\n most from the fear and loss occasioned by coercion and destruction. We would not interpret an act of Congress to leave them powerless to avert such emergencies without compelling directions to that effect.\n\nWe hold that Wisconsin may enjoin the violent union conduct here involved. The fact that Wisconsin has chosen to entrust its power to a labor board is of no concern to this Court.\n13\n\u00a0\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The question presented is narrowed by appellant in another paragraph to apply only to instances, as here, where the National Board has asserted jurisdiction over certain other labor practices arising from the same employer-union relationship. These proceedings include a plea by the employer that the state-enjoined union conduct constitutes a defense to a union charge filed with the Board. Appellant also asserted that the State should act only after the Board has passed upon the pending union complaint. In view of our disposition of this appeal, we do not consider these narrower issues material.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Wisconsin Statutes, 1953, c. 111, p. 1903. 111.04, p. 1905: \"111.04 Rights of employes.

So far as the fourteen individuals are concerned, their status as employees of the company was not affected. \"We agree with the statement of the United States as amicus curiae that the federal Act was not designed to preclude a State from enacting legislation limited to the prohibition or regulation of this type of employee or union activity.

Zook, \n336 \nU.S. 725\n, is an example. But the instances are few and far between.\n\nOf course, where the States and the Federal Government regulate the same act, but each with a different sanction, both often survive. United Workers v. Laburnum Corp., \n347 \nU.S. 656\n, is a recent example. We there allowed a common-law tort action for damages to be enforced in a state court for the same acts that could have been the basis for administrative relief under the federal Act. But the present case is not that case. Here the State has prescribed an administrative remedy that duplicates the administrative remedy prescribed by Congress. Each reaches the same identical conduct. We disallowed that duplication of remedy in Garner v. Teamsters Union, \n346 \nU.S. 485\n. In that case we held that a state court could not enjoin action which was subject to an unfair labor proceeding under the federal Act. And see Weber v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., \n348 \nU.S. 468\n. Today we depart from Garner and allow a state board to enjoin action \n\n[351 \nU.S. 266, 276]\n\u00a0\n which is subject to an unfair labor proceeding before the federal board. We sanction a precise duplication of remedies which is pregnant with potentialities of clashes and conflicts.\n*\n\u00a0\n\nOf course the States may control violence. They may make arrests and invoke their criminal law to the hilt. They transgress only when they allow their administrative agencies or their courts to enjoin the conduct that Congress has authorized the federal agency to enjoin. We retreat from Garner and open the door to unseemly conflicts between state and federal agencies when we sustain what Wisconsin has done here.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Allen-Bradley Local v. Wisconsin Board, \n315 \nU.S. 740\n, is not in point because the federal Act at that time made no provision for enjoining union activities. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 266, 277]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","4":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBANK OF AMERICA v. PARNELL(1956)\nNo. 21\nArgued: October 18, 1956Decided: November 13, 1956\n\n\n\n\n Alleging diversity of citizenship, petitioner, a bank in California, sued in a Federal District Court in Pennsylvania to recover the value of certain bonds alleged to have been converted in Pennsylvania. They were bearer bonds of the Home Owners' Loan Corporation, guaranteed by the United States, maturing in 1952 but called for redemption in 1944. They disappeared from petitioner's possession in 1944, and respondent Parnell, acting for one Rocco, presented them in 1948 to respondent bank in Pennsylvania, which collected the proceeds and paid them to Parnell, who paid them to Rocco. On the theory that state law governed, the District Court instructed the jury that respondents had the burden of showing that they took the bonds in good faith, without knowledge or notice of defect in title. Verdicts and judgments were for petitioner; but the Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that, under federal law, the bonds were not \"overdue\" when presented to respondent bank and petitioner had the burden of showing notice and lack of good faith on the part of respondents. Held: The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the case is remanded to that Court for further proceedings. Pp. 30-34.\n\n (a) This litigation is purely between private parties, it does not touch the rights and duties of the United States, and the issues of burden of proof and good faith are governed by the law of Pennsylvania, where the transactions took place.

Pp. 32-34.\n\n\n (b) That the floating of securities by the United States might be adversely affected by the local rule of a particular State regarding the liability of a converter is too speculative and remote a possibility to justify the application of federal law to transactions essentially of local concern.

First National Bank in Indiana, also on certiorari to the same court.\n\nErwin N. Griswold argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief were Robert L. Kirkpatrick and John G. Buchanan.\n\nEdward Dumbauld argued the cause and filed a brief for respondent in No. 21.\n\nHarvey A. Miller, Jr. argued the cause for respondent in No. 22. With him on the brief were Harvey A. Miller and J. Lee Miller.\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nPetitioner, alleging diversity of citizenship, brought suit in the District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania alleging that in September and October 1948 two individual defendants, Parnell and Rocco, and two corporate defendants, the First National Bank in Indiana and the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, had converted 73 Home Owners' Loan Corporation bonds which belonged to petitioner. Only Parnell and the First National Bank are respondents here, since the Federal Reserve Bank was dismissed, on its motion, after petitioner had presented its case in the District Court, and since Rocco did not appeal from the District Court's judgment.\n\nAt the trial it appeared that these bonds were bearer bonds with payment guaranteed by the United States. They carried interest coupons calling for semi-annual payment. They were due to mature May 1, 1952, but pursuant to their terms, had been called on or about May 1, 1944. On May 2, 1944, the bonds disappeared \n\n[352 \nU.S. 29, 31]\n\u00a0\n while petitioner was getting them ready for presentation to the Federal Reserve Bank for payment. In 1948 they were presented to the First National Bank for payment by Parnell on behalf of Rocco. The First National Bank forwarded them to the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. It cashed them and paid the First National Bank, which issued cashier's checks to Parnell. Parnell then turned the proceeds over to Rocco less a fee - there was conflicting testimony as to whether the fee was nominal or substantial.\n\nThe principal issue at the trial was whether the respondents took the bonds in good faith, without knowledge or notice of the defect in title. On this issue the trial judge charged:\n\n \"As I have indicated, however, in the case - and if you find in this case that the plaintiff owned these bonds, that they were stolen from it - then the burden of proof so far as this plaintiff is concerned is to show that fact, that these bonds were owned by it, that they were lost by it in the manner as shown by its evidence. Then the two defendants, Parnell and the bank, not claiming to be owners for value, but as conduits for redemption, must come forward and they then have the burden of showing that they acted innocently, honestly, and in good faith. . . .\"\n\n\n The jury brought in verdicts for petitioner against both respondents. On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, the seven circuit judges sitting en banc, reversed, with three judges dissenting. It held that the District Court had erred in treating the case as an ordinary diversity case and in regarding state law as governing the rights of the parties and the burden of proof. 226 F.2d 297. It considered our decision in Clearfield Trust Co. v. United States, \n318 \nU.S. 363\n, controlling and held that federal law placed the burden of proof on petitioner \n\n[352 \nU.S. 29, 32]\n\u00a0\n to show notice and lack of good faith on the part of respondents. The court further found that there was no evidence of bad faith by the First National Bank since the bonds were not \"overdue\" as a matter of federal law when presented to it and therefore directed entry of judgment for it. The court found that there was evidence of bad faith on the part of Parnell but ordered a new trial because of the erroneous instructions.\n\nThe dissenters agreed in applying the doctrine of the Clearfield Trust case to determine the nature of the contract and the rights and duties of the United States as a party but not the rights of private transferees among themselves. They, like the majority, looked to federal law to determine whether the bonds were \"overdue paper\" when presented to the First National Bank. They concluded that since the respondent bank knew of the call, as to it, the bonds became demand paper and that the bank took the paper an unreasonable length of time after maturity, as advanced by the call.\n\nIn the view of the dissenters, state law was controlling with respect to proof of good faith and the burden thereon. They found that state law placed the burden of proof on respondents to demonstrate their good faith, and that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's verdict that the burden of proving good faith had not been sustained even if, with respect to the respondent bank, the bonds were not to be regarded as demand paper taken an unreasonable time after maturity, as advanced by the call.\n\nPetitioner sought a writ of certiorari to review the judgments of the Court of Appeals. Because the determination of the applicable law raised an important issue of federal-state relations, we granted certiorari. \n350 \nU.S. 963\n.\n\nThe District Court in this suit, based on diversity jurisdiction, for the conversion in Pennsylvania of pieces of \n\n[352 \nU.S. 29, 33]\n\u00a0\n paper of defined value, deemed itself a court of Pennsylvania in which, in view of the nature of the claim, Pennsylvania law would govern. See Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, \n326 \nU.S. 99, 108\n. But respondents claim, and the Court of Appeals sustained them, that the decision in Clearfield Trust Co. v. United States, \n318 \nU.S. 363\n, compels the application of federal law to the entire case. The Court of Appeals misconceived the nature of this litigation in holding that the Clearfield Trust case controlled. In that case we held that a suit by the United States to recover on an express guaranty of prior endorsements on a Government check with a forged endorsement was governed by federal law. The basis for this decision was stated with unclouded explicitness:\n\n\"The issuance of commercial paper by the United States is on a vast scale and transactions in that paper from issuance to payment will commonly occur in several states. The application of state law, even without the conflict of laws rules of the forum, would subject the rights and duties of the United States to exceptional uncertainty.\" \n318 \nU.S., at 367\n.\n\n\n Securities issued by the Government generate immediate interests of the Government. These were dealt with in Clearfield Trust and in National Metropolitan Bank v. United States, \n323 \nU.S. 454\n. But they also radiate interests in transactions between private parties. The present litigation is purely between private parties and does not touch the rights and duties of the United States. The only possible interest of the United States in a situation like the one here, exclusively involving the transfer of Government paper between private persons, is that the floating of securities of the United States might somehow or other be adversely affected by the local rule of a particular State regarding the liability of a converter. This is far too speculative, far too remote a possibility to justify \n\n[352 \nU.S. 29, 34]\n\u00a0\n the application of federal law to transactions essentially of local concern.\n\nWe do not mean to imply that litigation with respect to Government paper necessarily precludes the presence of a federal interest, to be governed by federal law, in all situations merely because it is a suit between private parties, or that it is beyond the range of federal legislation to deal comprehensively with Government paper. We do not of course foreclose such judicial or legislative action in appropriate situations by concluding that this controversy over burden of proof and good faith represents too essentially a private transaction not to be dealt with by the local law of Pennsylvania where the transactions took place. Federal law of course governs the interpretation of the nature of the rights and obligations created by the Government bonds themselves. A decision with respect to the \"overdueness\" of the bonds is therefore a matter of federal law, which, in view of our holding, we need not elucidate.\n\nThis conclusion requires reversal of the judgments of the Court of Appeals but not reinstatement of the judgments of the District Court. The Court of Appeals did not originally consider all the points raised by respondents. Moreover, since the Court of Appeals misconceived the applicable law, it is for that court to review the judgments of the District Court in the light of the controlling state law. The Court of Appeals has not decided what the governing state law on burden of proof is, and it is the court which should so decide. Likewise, if state law casts the burden on respondents to demonstrate their good faith, it is for the Court of Appeals to assess the evidence in light of that standard.\n\nThe judgments of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit are therefore reversed and the cases are remanded to that court for proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n\n    Reversed and remanded. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 29, 35]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE BLACK and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, dissenting.\n\nWe believe that the \"federal law merchant,\" which Clearfield Trust Co. v. United States, \n318 \nU.S. 363, 367\n, held applicable to transactions in the commercial paper of the United States, should be applicable to all transactions in that paper. Indeed the Court said in National Metropolitan Bank v. United States, \n323 \nU.S. 454, 456\n, that \"legal questions involved in controversies over such commercial papers are to be resolved by the application of federal rather than local law.\" Not until today has a distinction been drawn between suits by the United States on that paper and suits by other parties to it. But the Court does not stop there. Because this is \"essentially a private transaction,\" it is to be governed by local law. Yet the nature of the rights and obligations created by commercial paper of the United States Government is said to be controlled by federal law. Thus, federal law is to govern some portion of a dispute between private parties, while that portion of the dispute which is \"essentially of local concern\" is to be governed by local law. The uncertainties which inhere in such a dichotomy are obvious. Cf. Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, \n244 \nU.S. 205\n; Davis v. Department of Labor, \n317 \nU.S. 249\n.\n\nThe virtue of a uniform law governing bonds, notes, and other paper issued by the United States is that it provides a certain and definite guide to the rights of all parties rather than subjecting them to the vagaries of the laws of many States. The business of the United States will go on without that uniformity. But the policy surrounding our choice of law is concerned with the convenience, certainty, and definiteness in having one set of rules governing the rights of all parties to government paper, as contrasted to multiple rules. If the rule of the Clearfield Trust case is to be abandoned as to some parties, it should be abandoned as to all and we should start afresh on this problem. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 29, 36]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","5":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBERNHARDT v. POLYGRAPHIC CO.(1956)\nNo. 49\nArgued: December 5, 1955Decided: January 16, 1956\n\n\n\n\n Petitioner's action against respondent in a Vermont state court, for damages for the discharge of petitioner under an employment contract, was removed to the Federal District Court on grounds of diversity of citizenship. The contract had been made in New York, where both parties resided at the time, and provided that the parties would submit any dispute to arbitration under New York law; but petitioner had later become a resident of Vermont, where he was to perform his duties. Respondent's motion for a stay of the proceedings so that the controversy could go to arbitration in New York was denied by the District Court, which ruled that the arbitration provision of the contract was governed by Vermont law and that, under Vermont law, the agreement to arbitrate was revocable any time before an award was actually made. The Court of Appeals reversed. Held: The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded to the District Court. Pp. 199-205.\n\n 1. The provision of 3 of the United States Arbitration Act for stay of the trial of an action until arbitration has been had does not apply to all arbitration agreements but only to those covered by 1 and 2 of the Act (those relating to maritime transactions and those involving interstate or foreign commerce), and there is no showing that the contract here involved is in either of those classes. Pp. 200-202.\n\n\n 2. The differences between arbitration and judicial determination of a controversy substantially affect the cause of action arising under state law and make the doctrine of Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, \n304 \nU.S. 64\n, applicable. Pp. 202-204.\n\n\n 3. If in this case arbitration could not be compelled in the Vermont state courts, it should not be compelled in the Federal District Court. Pp. 204-205.\n\n\n 4.

On remand of the cause to the District Court, there will be open for consideration the question whether New York arbitration \n\n[350 \nU.S. 198, 199]\n\u00a0\n law should be applied to the enforcement of the contract - a question of conflict of laws governed by Vermont law and on which it is not clear that the District Court ruled. P. 205.\n\n\n 218 F.2d 948, reversed and remanded.\n\nManfred W. Ehrich, Jr. and Eugene V. Clark argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioner.\n\nJoseph A. McNamara and Guy M. Page, Jr. argued the cause for respondent. On the brief were Guy M. Page and Guy M. Page, Jr.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis suit, removed from a Vermont court to the District Court on grounds of diversity of citizenship, was brought for damages for the discharge of petitioner under an employment contract. At the time the contract was made petitioner was a resident of New York. Respondent is a New York corporation. The contract was made in New York. Petitioner later became a resident of Vermont, where he was to perform his duties under the contract, and asserts his rights there.\n\nThe contract contains a provision that in case of any dispute the parties will submit the matter to arbitration under New York law by the American Arbitration Association, whose determination \"shall be final and absolute.\" After the case had been removed to the District Court, respondent moved for a stay of the proceedings so that the controversy could go to arbitration in New York. The motion alleged that the law of New York governs the question whether the arbitration provision of the contract is binding.\n\nThe District Court ruled that under Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, \n304 \nU.S. 64\n, the arbitration provision of the contract was governed by Vermont law and that the law of Vermont makes revocable an agreement to arbitrate \n\n[350 \nU.S. 198, 200]\n\u00a0\n at any time before an award is actually made. The District Court therefore denied the stay, 122 F. Supp. 733. The Court of Appeals reversed, 218 F.2d 948. The case is here on a petition for certiorari which we granted, \n349 \nU.S. 943\n, because of the doubtful application by the Court of Appeals of Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, supra.\n\nA question under the United States Arbitration Act, 43 Stat. 883, as amended, 61 Stat. 669, 9 U.S.C. 1-3, lies at the threshold of the case. Section 2 of that Act makes \"valid, irrevocable, and enforceable\" provisions for arbitration in certain classes of contracts;\n1\n and 3 provides for a stay of actions in the federal courts of issues referable to arbitration under those contracts.\n2\n Section 2 makes \"valid, irrevocable, and enforceable\" only two types of contracts: those relating to a maritime transaction and those involving commerce. No maritime transaction is involved here. Nor does this contract evidence \"a transaction involving commerce\" within the meaning of 2 of the Act. There is no showing that petitioner \n\n[350 \nU.S. 198, 201]\n\u00a0\n while performing his duties under the employment contract was working \"in\" commerce, was producing goods for commerce, or was engaging in activity that affected commerce, within the meaning of our decisions.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nThe Court of Appeals went on to hold that in any event 3 of the Act stands on its own footing. It concluded that while 2 makes enforceable arbitration agreements in maritime transactions and in transactions involving commerce, 3 covers all arbitration agreements even though they do not involve maritime transactions or transactions in commerce. We disagree with that reading of the Act. Sections 1, 2, and 3 are integral parts of a whole. To be sure, 3 does not repeat the words \"maritime transaction\" or \"transaction involving commerce,\" used in 1 and 2. But 1 and 2 define the field in which Congress was legislating. Since 3 is a part of the regulatory scheme, we can only assume that the \"agreement in writing\" for arbitration referred to in 3 is the kind of agreement which 1 and 2 have brought under federal regulation. There is no intimation or suggestion in the Committee Reports that 1 and 2 cover a narrower field than 3. On the contrary, S. Rep. No. 536, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 2, states that 1 defines the contracts to which \"the bill will be applicable\". And H. R. Rep. No. 96, 68th Cong., 1st \n\n[350 \nU.S. 198, 202]\n\u00a0\n Sess., p. 1, states that one foundation of the new regulating measure is \"the Federal control over interstate commerce and over admiralty.\" If respondent's contention is correct, a constitutional question might be presented. Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins indicated that Congress does not have the constitutional authority to make the law that is applicable to controversies in diversity of citizenship cases. Shanferoke Coal & Supply Corp. v. Westchester Service Corp., \n293 \nU.S. 449\n, applied the Federal Act in a diversity case. But that decision antedated Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins; and the Court did not consider the larger question presented here - that is, whether arbitration touched on substantive rights, which Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins held were governed by local law, or was a mere form of procedure within the power of the federal courts or Congress to prescribe. Our view, as will be developed, is that 3, so read, would invade the local law field. We therefore read 3 narrowly to avoid that issue. Federal Trade Commission v. American Tobacco Co., \n264 \nU.S. 298, 307\n. We conclude that the stay provided in 3 reaches only those contracts covered by 1 and 2.\n\nThe question remains whether, apart from the Federal Act, a provision of a contract providing for arbitration is enforceable in a diversity case.\n\nThe Court of Appeals, in disagreeing with the District Court as to the effect of an arbitration agreement under Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, followed its earlier decision of Murray Oil Products Co. v. Mitsui & Co., 146 F.2d 381, 383, which held that, \"Arbitration is merely a form of trial, to be adopted in the action itself, in place of the trial at common law: it is like a reference to a master, or an `advisory trial' under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure . . . .\"\n\nWe disagree with that conclusion. We deal here with a right to recover that owes its existence to one of the States, not to the United States. The federal court enforces \n\n[350 \nU.S. 198, 203]\n\u00a0\n the state-created right by rules of procedure which it has acquired from the Federal Government and which therefore are not identical with those of the state courts. Yet, in spite of that difference in procedure, the federal court enforcing a state-created right in a diversity case is, as we said in Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, \n326 \nU.S. 99, 108\n, in substance \"only another court of the State.\" The federal court therefore may not \"substantially affect the enforcement of the right as given by the State.\" Id., 109. If the federal court allows arbitration where the state court would disallow it, the outcome of litigation might depend on the courthouse where suit is brought. For the remedy by arbitration, whatever its merits or shortcomings, substantially affects the cause of action created by the State. The nature of the tribunal where suits are tried is an important part of the parcel of rights behind a cause of action. The change from a court of law to an arbitration panel may make a radical difference in ultimate result. Arbitration carries no right to trial by jury that is guaranteed both by the Seventh Amendment and by Ch. 1, Art. 12th, of the Vermont Constitution. Arbitrators do not have the benefit of judicial instruction on the law; they need not give their reasons for their results; the record of their proceedings is not as complete as it is in a court trial; and judicial review of an award is more limited than judicial review of a trial - all as discussed in Wilko v. Swan, \n346 \nU.S. 427, 435\n-438.\n4\n We said in the \n\n[350 \nU.S. 198, 204]\n\u00a0\n York case that \"The nub of the policy that underlies Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins is that for the same transaction the accident of a suit by a non-resident litigant in a federal court instead of in a State court a block away should not lead to a substantially different result.\" \n326 \nU.S., at 109\n. There would in our judgment be a resultant discrimination if the parties suing on a Vermont cause of action in the federal court were remitted to arbitration, while those suing in the Vermont court could not be.\n\nThe District Court found that if the parties were in a Vermont court, the agreement to submit to arbitration would not be binding and could be revoked at any time before an award was made. He gave as his authority Mead's Admx. v. Owen, 83 Vt. 132, 135, 74 A. 1058, 1059, and Sartwell v. Sowles, 72 Vt. 270, 277, 48 A. 11, 14, decided by the Supreme Court of Vermont. In the Owen case the court, in speaking of an agreement to arbitrate, held that \". . . either party may revoke the submission at any time before the publication of an award.\" 83 Vt., at 135, 74 A., at 1059. That case was decided in 1910. But it was agreed on oral argument that there is no later authority from the Vermont courts, that no fracture in the rules announced in those cases has appeared in subsequent rulings or dicta, and that no legislative movement is under way in Vermont to change the result of those cases. Since the federal judge making those findings is from the Vermont bar, we give special weight to his statement of what the Vermont law is. See \n\n[350 \nU.S. 198, 205]\n\u00a0\n MacGregor v. State Mutual Co., \n315 \nU.S. 280\n; Hillsborough v. Cromwell, \n326 \nU.S. 620, 630\n; Steele v. General Mills, \n329 \nU.S. 433, 439\n. We agree with him that if arbitration could not be compelled in the Vermont courts, it should not be compelled in the Federal District Court. Were the question in doubt or deserving further canvass, we would of course remand the case to the Court of Appeals to pass on this question of Vermont law. But, as we have indicated, there appears to be no confusion in the Vermont decisions, no developing line of authorities that casts a shadow over the established ones, no dicta, doubts or ambiguities in the opinions of Vermont judges on the question, no legislative development that promises to undermine the judicial rule. We see no reason, therefore, to remand the case to the Court of Appeals to pass on this question of local law.\n\nRespondent argues that since the contract was made in New York and the parties contracted for arbitration under New York law, New York arbitration law should be applied to the enforcement of the contract. A question of conflict of laws is tendered, a question that is also governed by Vermont law. See Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Co., \n313 \nU.S. 487\n. It is not clear to some of us that the District Court ruled on that question. We mention it explicitly so that it will be open for consideration on remand of the cause to the District Court.\n\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded to the District Court for proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n\n   Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 2 provides:\n\n\"A written provision in any maritime transaction or a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction, or the refusal to perform the whole or any part thereof, or an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration an existing controversy arising out of such a contract, transaction, or refusal, shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Section 3 provides:\n\n\"If any suit or proceeding be brought in any of the courts of the United States upon any issue referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing for such arbitration, the court in which such suit is pending, upon being satisfied that the issue involved in such suit or proceeding is referable to arbitration under such an agreement, shall on application of one of the parties stay the trial of the action until such arbitration has been had in accordance with the terms of the agreement, providing the applicant for the stay is not in default in proceeding with such arbitration.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Section 1 defines \"commerce\" as:\n\n\". . . commerce among the several States or with foreign nations, or in any Territory of the United States or in the District of Columbia, or between any such Territory and another, or between any such Territory and any State or foreign nation, or between the District of Columbia and any State or Territory or foreign nation, but nothing herein contained shall apply to contracts of employment of seamen, railroad employees, or any other class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce.\"\n\n\n Since no transaction involving commerce appears to be involved here, we do not reach the further question whether in any event petitioner would be included in \"any other class of workers\" within the exceptions of 1 of the Act.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Whether the arbitrators misconstrued a contract is not open to judicial review.

JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, concurring.\n\nIt is my view that the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be reversed and the case remanded to that court and not to the District Court.\n\nThis action was brought in the Bennington County Court of the State of Vermont by petitioner, a citizen of \n\n[350 \nU.S. 198, 206]\n\u00a0\n Vermont, against respondent, a corporation of the State of New York. Respondent removed the case to the United States District Court for the District of Vermont. The subject matter of the litigation is a contract made between the parties in New York, and the sole basis of the jurisdiction of the District Court is diversity of citizenship. Not only was the contract made in New York, but the parties agreed to the following provision in it:\n\n \"Fourteenth: The parties hereto do hereby stipulate and agree that it is their intention and covenant that this agreement and performance hereunder and all suits and special proceedings hereunder be construed in accordance with and under and pursuant to the laws of the State of New York and that in any action special proceeding or other proceeding that may be brought arising out of, in connection with or by reason of this agreement, the laws of the State of New York shall be applicable and shall govern to the exclusion of the law of any other forum, without regard to the jurisdiction in which any action or special proceeding may be instituted.\"\n\n\n Respondent invoked another provision of the contract whereby disputes under the agreement were to be submitted to arbitration subject to the regulations of the American Arbitration Association and the pertinent provisions of the New York Arbitration Act. It did so by a motion to stay the proceeding in the District Court pending arbitration.\n\nThe District Court denied the stay because, on its reading of the Vermont cases, Vermont law, while recognizing the binding force of such an agreement by way of a suit for damages, does not allow specific performance or a stay pending arbitration. It rested on a decision rendered by the Supreme Court of Vermont in a bill for an accounting \n\n[350 \nU.S. 198, 207]\n\u00a0\n evidently between two Vermonters and relating wholly to a Vermont transaction, i.e., a controversy about personal property on a Vermont farm. Mead's Admx. v. Owen, 83 Vt. 132, 74 A. 1058.\n1\n This case was decided in 1910 and, in turn, relied on Aspinwall v. Tousey, 2 Tyler (Vt.) 328, decided in 1803, authorizing revocation of a submission to arbitration at any time before the publication of an award.\n\nThe Court of Appeals found it unnecessary to consider what the Vermont law was today, for it held that the arbitration provision did not concern a matter of \"substantive\" law, for which, in this diversity case, Vermont law would be controlling on the United States District Court sitting in Vermont. It held that the arbitration provision fell within the law of \"procedure\" governing an action in the federal court, whatever the source of the jurisdiction. So holding, the Court of Appeals found 3 of the United States Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. 3, applicable and, accordingly, directed the District Court to heed that Act and allow the matter to go to arbitration. 218 F.2d 948.\n\nThis Court explained in Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, \n326 \nU.S. 99\n, why the categories of \"substance\" and \"procedure\" are, in relation to the application of the doctrine of Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, \n304 \nU.S. 64\n, less than self-defining. They are delusive. The intrinsic content of what is thought to be conveyed by those terms in the particular context of a particular litigation becomes the essential inquiry. This mode of approaching the problem has had several applications since the York decision. I agree with the Court's opinion that the differences between arbitral and judicial determination of a controversy under a contract sufficiently go to the merits of the \n\n[350 \nU.S. 198, 208]\n\u00a0\n outcome, and not merely because of the contingencies of different individuals passing on the same question, to make the matter one of \"substance\" in the sense relevant for Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins. In view of the ground that was taken in that case for its decision, it would raise a serious question of constitutional law whether Congress could subject to arbitration litigation in the federal courts which is there solely because it is \"between Citizens of different States,\" U.S. Const., Art. III, 2, in disregard of the law of the State in which a federal court is sitting. Since the United States Arbitration Act of 1925 does not obviously apply to diversity cases, in the light of its terms and the relevant interpretive materials, avoidance of the constitutional question is for me sufficiently compelling to lead to a construction of the Act as not applicable to diversity cases.\n2\n Of course this implies no opinion on the constitutional question that would be presented were Congress specifically to make the Arbitration Act applicable in such cases. Furthermore, because the Act is not here applicable, I abstain from any consideration of the scope of its provisions in cases which are in federal courts on a jurisdictional basis other than diversity of citizenship.\n\nVermont law regarding such an arbitration agreement as the one before us, therefore, becomes decisive of the litigation. But what is Vermont law? One of the difficulties, of course, resulting from Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, is that it is not always easy and sometimes difficult to ascertain what the governing state law is. The essence of the doctrine of that case is that the difficulties of ascertaining state law are fraught with less mischief than disregard of the basic nature of diversity jurisdiction, namely, the enforcement of state-created rights and state \n\n[350 \nU.S. 198, 209]\n\u00a0\n policies going to the heart of those rights. If Judge Gibson's statement of what is the contemporary Vermont law relevant to the arbitration provision now before him were determinative, that would be that. But the defendant is entitled to have the view of the Court of Appeals on Vermont law and cannot, under the Act of Congress, be foreclosed by the District Court's interpretation.\n\nAs long as there is diversity jurisdiction, \"estimates\" are necessarily often all that federal courts can make in ascertaining what the state court would rule to be its law.\n3\n See Pomerantz v. Clark, 101 F. Supp. 341. This Court ought not to by-pass the Court of Appeals on an issue which, if the Court of Appeals had made a different estimate from the District Court's, of contemporaneous Vermont law regarding such a contract as the one before us, this Court, one can confidently say, would not have set its view of Vermont law against that of the Court of Appeals. For the mere fact that Vermont in 1910 restated its old law against denying equitable relief for breach of a promise to arbitrate a contract made under such Vermont law, is hardly a conclusive ground for attributing to the Vermont Supreme Court application of this equitable doctrine in 1956 to a contract made in New York with explicit agreement by the parties that the law of New York which allows such a stay as was here sought, New York Civil Practice Act, 1451, should govern. Cf. Brown v. Perry, 104 Vt. 66, 156 A. 910. Law does change with times and circumstances, and not merely through legislative reforms.\n4\n It is also to be noted that \n\n[350 \nU.S. 198, 210]\n\u00a0\n law is not restricted to what is found in Law Reports, or otherwise written. See Nashville, C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Browning, \n310 \nU.S. 362, 369\n. The Supreme Court of Vermont last spoke on this matter in 1910. The doctrine that it referred to was not a peculiar indigenous Vermont rule. The attitude reflected by that decision nearly half a century ago was the current traditional judicial hostility against ousting courts, as the phrase ran, of their jurisdiction. See the adverse comments of Judge Hough in United States Asphalt Refining Co. v. Trinidad Lake Petroleum Co., Ltd., 222F. 1006, against what he assumed to be the law in the federal courts, and compare with the shift in judicial attitude reflected by the reservation of this \n\n[350 \nU.S. 198, 211]\n\u00a0\n question in Mr. Justice Brandeis' opinion for the Court in Red Cross Line v. Atlantic Fruit Co., \n264 \nU.S. 109\n.\n5\n To be sure, a vigorous legislative movement got under way in the 1920's expressive of a broadened outlook of view on this subject. But courts do not always wait for legislation to find a judicial doctrine outmoded. Only last Term, although we had no statute governing an adjudication, we found significance in a relevant body of enactments elsewhere: \"A steady legislative trend, presumably manifesting a strong social policy, properly makes demands on the judicial process.\" National City Bank of New York v. Republic of China, \n348 \nU.S. 356, 360\n.\n\nSurely in the light of all that has happened since 1910 in the general field of the law of arbitration, it is not for us to assume that the Court of Appeals, if it had that question for consideration, could not have found that the law of Vermont today does not require disregard of a provision \n\n[350 \nU.S. 198, 212]\n\u00a0\n of a contract made in New York, with a purposeful desire to have the law of New York govern, to accomplish a result that today may be deemed to be a general doctrine of the law. Of course, if the Court of Appeals, versed in the general jurisprudence of Vermont and having among its members a Vermont lawyer, should find that the Vermont court would, despite the New York incidents of the contract, apply Vermont law and that it is the habit of the Vermont court to adhere to its precedents and to leave changes to the legislature, it would not be for the federal court to gainsay that policy. I am not suggesting what the Court of Appeals' answer to these questions would be, still less what it should be. I do maintain that the defendant does have the right to have the judgment of the Court of Appeals on that question and that it is not for us to deny him that right.\n\nI would remand the case to the Court of Appeals for its determination of Vermont law on matters which the basis of its decision heretofore rendered it needless to consider.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, concurring.\n\nI concur in the opinion of the Court except insofar as it undertakes to review and affirm the District Court's interpretation of Vermont law. I agree with MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER that the review of questions of state law should ordinarily be left to the Courts of Appeals and would remand the case to the Court of Appeals for that purpose.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The court also cited Sartwell v. Sowles, 72 Vt. 270, 48 A. 11.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Shanferoke Coal & Supply Corp. v. Westchester Service Corp., \n293 \nU.S. 449\n, was a diversity case wherein 3 of the Arbitration Act was applied. But the case was pre-Erie, and the Court's attention was not directed toward the question.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] It is peculiarly true of the problem before us, that law is a prophecy \"of what the courts will do in fact.\" Holmes, The Path of the Law, in Collected Legal Papers, p. 173.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] That the Vermont Supreme Court does not obstinately adhere to its past decisions, that for it too law is living, is illustrated by the following instances: Capello's Administrator v. Aero Mayflower Transit Co., 116 Vt. 64, 68 A. 2d 913, overruling Ronan v. Turnbull \n\n[350 \nU.S. 198, 210]\n\u00a0\n Co., 99 Vt. 280, 287-288, 131 A. 788, 791-792 (proof that an automobile involved in an accident was owned by the defendant at the time of the accident does not make a prima facie case that the operator of the automobile was engaged in the defendant's service); Bartlett v. Bonazzi, 91 Vt. 192, 99 A. 886, overruling Fisher v. Brown, 1 Tyler (Vt.) 387 (action for deceit will not lie for seller's fraudulent misrepresentations concerning his financial position which induced buyer to extend credit); State v. Pianfetti, 79 Vt. 236, 65 A. 84, overruling State v. Kittle, 2 Tyler (Vt.) 471 (jury verdict of guilty on one of four counts in an indictment operated as an acquittal on the other three counts); Perry v. Shumway, 73 Vt. 191, 50 A. 1069, overruling Hartland v. Hackett, 57 Vt. 92 (the issuing of an extent against a delinquent tax collector constitutes an election of remedies which bars an action on the collector's bond); State v. Burpee, 65 Vt. 1, 25 A. 964, overruling State v. Croteau, 23 Vt. 14 (in a criminal trial all questions of law as well as fact are for the jury); Woodrow v. O'Conner, 28 Vt. 776, and Bagley v. Wiswall, Brayton 23, overruling Drake v. Collins, 1 Tyler (Vt.) 79 (an arbitration note is void for want of consideration). See also Grenier v. Alta Crest Farms, Inc., 115 Vt. 324, 58 A. 2d 884, deciding that the character of the employee right created by the Vermont Workmen's Compensation Act is not the same as the character of the right which existed at common law. The opinion draws upon the recorded attitude of other jurisdictions to justify its departure from the contrary theory which it had set forth in Kelley v. Hoosac Lumber Co., 96 Vt. 153, 118 A. 520.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Judge Hough, in 1915, stated:\n\n\"It has never been denied that the hostility of English-speaking courts to arbitration contracts probably originated (as Lord Campbell said in Scott v. Avery, 4 H. L. Cas. 811) - `in the contests of the courts of ancient times for extension of jurisdiction - all of them being opposed to anything that would altogether deprive every one of them of jurisdiction.'\n\n\n\"A more unworthy genesis cannot be imagined. Since (at the latest) the time of Lord Kenyon, it has been customary to stand rather upon the antiquity of the rule than upon its excellence or reason . . . .\" 222 F., at 1007.\n\n\n\"I think the decisions cited show beyond question that the Supreme Court has laid down the rule that such a complete ouster of jurisdiction as is shown by the clause quoted [the arbitration clause] . . . is void in a federal forum.\" 222 F., at 1012.\n\n\n On the other hand, in 1924 this Court observed in Red Cross Line: \"we have no occasion to consider whether the unwillingness of the federal courts to give full effect to executory agreements for arbitration can be justified.\" \n264 \nU.S., at 125\n.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BURTON, dissenting.\n\nWhether or not 3 of the Federal Arbitration Act is applicable to this contract, the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be affirmed.\n\nAssuming the validity of the arbitration clause in the New York contract here involved. I regard the procedure \n\n[350 \nU.S. 198, 213]\n\u00a0\n which it prescribes as a permissible \"form of trial.\" See Murray Oil Products Co. v. Mitsui & Co., 146 F.2d 381. Accordingly, the United States District Court for the District of Vermont may stay its own proceedings to await completion of the arbitration proceedings, although a state court of Vermont would not do likewise. I do not interpret Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, \n304 \nU.S. 64\n, or Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, \n326 \nU.S. 99\n, as requiring the contrary. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 198, 214]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","6":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBERRA v. UNITED STATES(1956)\nNo. 60\nArgued: March 26, 1956Decided: April 30, 1956\n\n\n\n\n Petitioner was indicted for wilfully attempting to evade federal income taxes by filing with the Collector \"false and fraudulent\" tax returns in violation of 26 U.S.C. (1952 ed.) 145 (b). This, it is here assumed, is also a violation of 26 U.S.C. (1952 ed.) 3616 (a), the penalty for the violation of which is lesser than for a violation of 145 (b). Petitioner was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment greater than the maximum possible had the conviction been under 3616 (a).

With him on the brief were Solicitor General Sobeloff, Acting Assistant Attorney General Rice, Joseph M. Howard and Dickinson Thatcher. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 131, 132]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nPetitioner was charged, in a three-count indictment, with wilfully attempting to evade federal income taxes for 1951, 1952, and 1953 by filing with the Collector \"false and fraudulent\" tax returns, \"in violation of Section 145 (b), Title 26, United States Code.\"\n1\n That section of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, 53 Stat. 63, provided:\n\n\"Any person . . . who willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any tax imposed by this chapter or the payment thereof, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a felony and, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than $10,000, or imprisoned for not more than five years, or both, together with the costs of prosecution.\"\n\n\n Section 3616 (a) of the 1939 Code, 53 Stat. 440, also made it a crime for any person to deliver to the Collector \"any false or fraudulent list, return, account, or statement, with intent to defeat or evade the valuation, enumeration, or assessment intended to be made . . . .\" The penalty for violation of 3616 (a), however, was a fine of not more than $1,000, or imprisonment not exceeding one year, or both, together with the costs of prosecution.\n\nAt the close of the trial judge's charge to the jury, petitioner asked that the jury be instructed with respect to each count that a verdict of guilty of the \"lesser crime\" under 3616 (a) would be permissible.\n2\n No motions \n\n[351 \nU.S. 131, 133]\n\u00a0\n addressed to the validity of the indictment, judgment of conviction, or sentence under 145 (b) were made before, during, or after trial, and we read the requested instruction as aimed at leaving to the jury the question of whether the defendant should be convicted under 145 (b) or 3616 (a), if the jury found him guilty. The instruction was refused, and, after conviction, petitioner was sentenced to four years' imprisonment on each count, the sentences to run concurrently. Thus petitioner has been sentenced to imprisonment greater than the maximum possible had the conviction been under 3616 (a) alone. The Court of Appeals affirmed, 221 F.2d 590, and we granted certiorari, \n350 \nU.S. 910\n, limited to the question of whether it was error for the trial judge to refuse to give the requested instruction.\n\nThe Court of Appeals, in affirming the conviction, held that 3616 (a) did not apply to income tax returns, and that any instruction relating to that section would therefore have been irrelevant under the evidence in this case.\n3\n Both parties agree, however, that 3616 (a) was applicable to income tax returns, and we shall assume, arguendo, the correctness of that interpretation of the statute.\n\nRule 31 (c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that a defendant may be found guilty of an \n\n[351 \nU.S. 131, 134]\n\u00a0\n offense \"necessarily included in the offense charged.\"\n4\n In a case where some of the elements of the crime charged themselves constitute a lesser crime, the defendant, if the evidence justified it, would no doubt be entitled to an instruction which would permit a finding of guilt of the lesser offense. See Stevenson v. United States, \n162 \nU.S. 313\n. But this is not such a case. For here the method of evasion charged was the filing of a false return, and it is apparent that the facts necessary to prove that petitioner \"willfully\" attempted to evade taxes by filing a false return ( 145 (b)) were identical with those required to prove that he delivered a false return with \"intent\" to evade taxes ( 3616 (a)). In this instance 145 (b) and 3616 (a) covered precisely the same ground.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nPetitioner contends that he was nevertheless entitled to the requested instruction. He argues that since there was no difference in the proof required to establish violations of 145 (b) and 3616 (a), the indictment must be taken as charging violations of both sections, and the jury under Rule 31 (c) should have been permitted to make the choice between the two crimes. We do not agree.\n\nThe role of the jury in a federal criminal case is to decide only the issues of fact, taking the law as given by the court. Sparf v. United States, \n156 \nU.S. 51, 102\n. Certainly Rule 31 (c) was never intended to change this traditional function of the jury.\n6\n Here, whether \n\n[351 \nU.S. 131, 135]\n\u00a0\n 145 (b) or 3616 (a) be deemed to govern, the factual issues to be submitted to the jury were the same; the instruction requested by petitioner would not have added any other such issue for the jury's determination.\n7\n When the jury resolved those issues against petitioner, its function was exhausted, since there is here no statutory provision giving to the jury the right to determine the punishment to be imposed after the determination of guilt.\n8\n Whatever other questions might have been raised as to the validity of petitioner's conviction and sentence, because of the assumed overlapping of 145 (b) and 3616 (a), were questions of law for the court. No such questions are presented here.\n\nThe only question before us is whether the jury should have been allowed to decide whether it would apply 3616 (a) rather than 145 (b), and that we hold was not for the jury. It was, therefore, not error to refuse the requested instruction.\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] This case arises under the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. The sections involved have been changed in the 1954 Code; see 7201, 7207, 68A Stat. 851, 853.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] \"Defendant's Requested Instruction No. 12. \"Under the law you may find the defendant guilty of a lesser crime than the crime charged in each count of the income tax indictment. \"The statute upon which the lesser crime is based, omitting that \n\n[351 \nU.S. 131, 133]\n\u00a0\n part of the act which does not apply in this case, reads as follows: \"Whenever any person . . . delivers or discloses to a collector . . . any false or fraudulent . . . return . . . with intent to defeat or evade the . . . assessment intended to be made, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. \"Under Count I if you find and believe form the evidence that the defendant delivered, caused to be delivered or disclosed to the Collector of Internal Revenue for the First Collection District of Missouri, a false income tax return with intent to defeat or evade the assessment intended to be made, you will find him guilty of this lesser crime.\" (This paragraph was repeated for Counts II and III.)\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] In so holding the Court of Appeals followed its earlier decision in Dillon v. United States, 218 F.2d 97.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] \"Rule 31. VERDICT . . . (c) CONVICTION OF LESS OFFENSE. The defendant may be found guilty of an offense necessarily included in the offense charged or of an attempt to commit either the offense charged or an offense necessarily included therein if the attempt is an offense.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Compare 7207 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, under which the wilful filing of a false return no longer requires the element of an \"intent to defeat or evade\" taxes, as was so under the former 3616 (a).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The Notes of the Advisory Committee state that Rule 31 (c) \"is a restatement of existing law.\" The preceding \"lesser offense\" statutes \n\n[351 \nU.S. 131, 135]\n\u00a0\n were Act of June 1, 1872, 17 Stat. 196; R.

In violation of Section 145 (b), Title 26, United States Code.\" Section 145 (b) provides that:\n\n\"any person who willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any tax imposed by this chapter . . . shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a felony and, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than $10,000, or imprisoned for not more than five years, or both, together with the costs of prosecution.\" (Emphasis added.)\n1\n\u00a0\n\n\n The offense charged in the indictment, filing a fraudulent return, could be held to be proscribed by 145 (b) because of the phrase \"in any manner.\" But certainly it falls squarely within the specific language of 26 U.S.C. 3616 (a), which provides that any person who\n\n\"Delivers or discloses to the collector or deputy any false or fraudulent list, return, account, or statement, with intent to defeat or evade the . . . assessment intended to be made . . . shall be fined not exceeding $1,000, or be imprisoned not exceeding one year, or both, at the discretion of the court, with costs of prosecution.\" (Emphasis added.)\n2\n\u00a0\n\n\n At an appropriate time the petitioner asked the trial judge to charge the jury that if the allegations of the indictment had been proven they should find the petitioner guilty of a misdemeanor under 3616 (a). Although 3616 (a) unambiguously makes the conduct charged a misdemeanor punishable by no more than one year in prison, the trial judge apparently felt that he was compelled to treat the offense as a felony because of the statement in the indictment that the conduct charged \n\n[351 \nU.S. 131, 137]\n\u00a0\n was \"In violation of Section 145 (b) . . . .\"\n3\n The judge not only refused the requested instruction, but after the jury returned a verdict of guilty, he sentenced petitioner to serve four years in prison on each of the three counts, the sentences to run concurrently.\n\nRegardless of whether it was error to refuse the requested instruction, the record raises a serious question as to whether the four-year sentence on each count was lawfully imposed. The Court's opinion takes the position that no proper challenges to the sentence under the felony statute were raised below and hence that \"No such questions are presented here.\"\n4\n In my judgment the requested instruction was adequate to call the trial judge's attention to petitioner's contention that the offense charged was not a felony but a misdemeanor. But even if the question should have been raised again when the judge announced the sentence, \"Plain errors or defects affecting substantial rights may be noticed although they were not brought to the attention of the court.\" Fed. Rules Crim. Proc., 52 (b). See also Wiborg v. United States, \n163 \nU.S. 632, 658\n. Since I think petitioner is right in saying the offense charged was only a misdemeanor, \n\n[351 \nU.S. 131, 138]\n\u00a0\n I think we should correct the plain error of the trial judge in sentencing petitioner under the felony statute.\n\nThe Government admits here and the Court assumes that filing a false and fraudulent income tax return is both a misdemeanor under 3616 (a) and a felony under 145 (b). The Government argues that the action of the trial judge must be upheld because \"the Government may choose to invoke either applicable law,\" and \"the prosecution may be for a felony even though the Government could have elected to prosecute for a misdemeanor.\" Election by the Government of course means election by a prosecuting attorney or the Attorney General.\n5\n I object to any such interpretation of 145 and 3616. I think we should construe these sections so as not to place control over the liberty of citizens in the unreviewable discretion of one individual - a result which seems to me to be wholly incompatible with our system of justice. Since Congress has specifically made the conduct charged in the indictment a misdemeanor, I would not permit prosecution for a felony under the broad language of 145 (b). Criminal statutes, which forfeit life, liberty or property, should be construed narrowly, not broadly.\n\nSo far as I know, this Court has never approved the argument the Government makes here. It certainly did not do so in United States v. Beacon Brass Co., \n344 \nU.S. 43\n, \n\n[351 \nU.S. 131, 139]\n\u00a0\n upon which the Government seems to rely. In that case the Court said:\n\n \"We have before us two statutes, each of which proscribes conduct not covered by the other, but which overlap in a narrow area illustrated by the instant case. At least where different proof is required for each offense, a single act or transaction may violate more than one criminal statute. . . .\" \n344 \nU.S., at 45\n.\n\n\n Here, however, under the Court's opinion and the Government's argument, two statutes proscribe identical conduct and no \"different proof\" was required to convict petitioner of the felony than would have been required to convict him of the misdemeanor. The Government's whole argument rests on the stark premise that Congress has left to the district attorney or the Attorney General the power to say whether the judge and jury must punish identical conduct as a felony or as a misdemeanor.\n\nA basic principle of our criminal law is that the Government only prosecutes people for crimes under statutes passed by Congress which fairly and clearly define the conduct made criminal and the punishment which can be administered.\n6\n This basic principle is flouted if either of these statutes can be selected as the controlling law at the whim of the prosecuting attorney or the Attorney General. \"For, the very idea that one man may be compelled to hold his life, or the means of living, or any material right essential to the enjoyment of life, at the mere will of another, seems to be intolerable in any country where freedom prevails, as being the essence of slavery itself.\" Yick Wo v. Hopkins, \n118 \nU.S. 356, 370\n. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 131, 140]\n\u00a0\n\n\nA congressional delegation of such vast power to the prosecuting department would raise serious constitutional questions. Of course it is true that under our system Congress may vest the judge and jury with broad power to say how much punishment shall be imposed for a particular offense. But it is quite different to vest such powers in a prosecuting attorney. A judge and jury act under procedural rules carefully prescribed to protect the liberty of the individual. Their judgments and verdicts are reached after a public trial in which a defendant has the right to be represented by an attorney. No such protections are thrown around decisions by a prosecuting attorney. Substitution of the prosecutor's caprice for the adjudicatory process is an action I am not willing to attribute to Congress in the absence of clear command. Our system of justice rests on the conception of impersonality in the criminal law. This great protection to freedom is lost if the Government is right in its contention here. See dissenting opinion in Rosenberg v. United States, \n346 \nU.S. 273, 306\n.\n\nThe Government's contention here also challenges our concept that all people must be treated alike under the law. This principle means that no different or higher punishment should be imposed upon one than upon another if the offense and the circumstances are the same. It is true that there may be differences due to different appraisals given the circumstances of different cases by different judges and juries. But in these cases the discretion in regard to conviction and punishment for crime is exercised by the judge and jury in their constitutional capacities in the administration of justice.\n\nI would reverse this case or at least remand for resentencing under the misdemeanor statute, 3616 (a).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Internal Revenue Code of 1939, 53 Stat. 63. Cf. 7201, Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 68A Stat. 851.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Internal Revenue Code of 1939, 53 Stat. 440.

Rules Crim. Proc., 7 (c), which provides in part that: \"The indictment . . . shall state for each count the official or customary citation of the statute . . . which the defendant is alleged therein to have violated. Error in the citation or its omission shall not be ground for dismissal of the indictment . . . or for reversal of a conviction if the error or omission did not mislead the defendant to his prejudice.\" Cf. Cole v. Arkansas, \n333 \nU.S. 196\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Apparently the Court means by this to leave open to petitioner the opportunity to challenge his sentence by a motion to correct it under 28 U.S.C. 2255. Of course I agree that a motion under that section would be appropriate, but I think petitioner is entitled to have it settled now.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] This would always follow where an information is used. And where there is an indictment by grand jury of course the indictment is drawn by the prosecuting attorney, since grand juries normally are not familiar with the applicable statutes. Thus where a prosecuting officer seeks an indictment under a statute making an attempt to evade taxes in any manner a felony, it would be a rare grand juror indeed who would be sufficiently familiar with the Internal Revenue Code to suggest that it might be better to bring the indictment under 3616 (a).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] See, e. g., International Harvester Co. v.

CUTTER LABORATORIES(1956)\nNo. 92\nArgued: April 26, 1956Decided: June 4, 1956\n\n\n\n\n A corporation manufacturing pharmaceutical and biological products in California discharged an employee on the grounds that she was an active member of the Communist Party and had falsified her application for employment. Her union sought her reinstatement before an arbitration board pursuant to a valid collective-bargaining agreement which authorized discharge for \"just cause\" only. Finding that she was an active member of the Communist Party and had falsified her application for employment, but that these grounds for discharge had been waived by the employer and that she actually was discharged for union activities, the board ordered her reinstatement. The lower California courts affirmed this order; but the Supreme Court of California reversed. Certiorari was granted by this Court on a petition contending that the decision and opinion violated the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. Upon an analysis of the record, however, it appeared that the Supreme Court of California construed the term \"just cause\" to embrace membership in the Communist Party and refused to apply a doctrine of waiver. Held: The decision involves only California's construction of a local contract under local law; no substantial federal question is presented; and the writ of certiorari is dismissed. Pp. 293-300.\n\n (a) This Court reviews judgments, not statements in opinions; and it will not pass on federal questions discussed in the opinion of a state court where it appears that the judgment rests on adequate state grounds. Pp. 297-298.\n\n\n (b) The scope of review of the findings of the arbitration board under the California Arbitration Act is a matter exclusively for the courts of that State. P. 298.\n\n\n (c) The Supreme Court of California construed the term \"just cause\" to embrace membership in the Communist Party and refused to apply a doctrine of waiver. Pp. 298-299.\n\n\n (d) Such a decision involves only California's construction of a local contract under local law, and no substantial federal question is presented. P. 299.\n\n\n Writ of certiorari dismissed. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 292, 293]\n\u00a0\n\n\nJoseph Forer argued the cause for petitioners. On the brief were Bertram Edises, A. L. Wirin and Abraham Glasser.\n\nGardiner Johnson and Thomas E. Stanton, Jr. argued the cause and filed a brief for respondent.\n\nBriefs of amici curiae urging reversal were filed by Edward J. Ennis for the American Civil Liberties Union, and Charles R. Garry for the National Lawyers Guild, San Francisco Chapter.\n\nLambert H. Miller filed a brief for the National Association of Manufacturers of the United States, as amicus curiae, urging affirmance.\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nIn 1949 Mrs. Doris Walker was discharged from her job at Cutter Laboratories, a manufacturer of pharmaceutical and biological products, on the claimed grounds that she was an active member of the Communist Party and had falsified her application for employment there.\n1\n\u00a0\n\n[351 \nU.S. 292, 294]\n\u00a0\n Petitioner, Bio-Lab Union of Local 225, United Office & Professional Workers of America, sought reinstatement for Mrs. Walker before an Arbitration Board pursuant to a valid collective-bargaining agreement which authorized \n\n[351 \nU.S. 292, 295]\n\u00a0\n discharge for \"just cause\" only. The Board determined that she had been discharged for union activity and, by a vote of 2 to 1, ordered her reinstatement. The Superior Court of San Francisco County confirmed the award and ordered it enforced. On appeal, the District Court of Appeal affirmed. The Supreme Court of California, however, reversed. 43 Cal. 2d 788, 278 P.2d 905. Petitioners contend that the decision and opinion below violate constitutional principles embraced in the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. We granted certiorari, \n350 \nU.S. 816\n. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 292, 296]\n\u00a0\n\n\nBefore Mrs. Walker applied for a job at the Cutter plant, she had graduated from law school, worked for three years as an attorney for the Office of Price Administration and in private practice, and had been discharged for union activity from jobs in three different canneries. All of these facts, she readily admitted to the Board, were concealed or misrepresented by her in the Cutter employment application in 1946. In addition, she admitted that she had falsely stated that she had been employed as a file clerk in 1939 by one John Trippe, attorney. She told the Board that no such person or employment had existed. The character references she listed had been warned by her of the omissions and falsifications in her application and at her request they did not disclose her true background to Cutter. These falsifications and omissions were not discovered until after she had been employed as a label clerk by the Cutter plant and the \"probationary period\" had expired.\n\nThe Arbitration Board found that Mrs. Walker had played an active role in union activities at the Cutter plant. In 1947 she became a shop chairman and a member of the executive board of the Local. The following year she was elected chief shop steward, and her activities were extended to all manufacturing departments of the Laboratory. She became president of the Local in the spring of 1949, and was holding that office at the time of her discharge. The Board also found that Mrs. Walker was a member of the Communist Party during the period of her employment. Cutter had investigated her in 1947 and 1949 and had discovered evidence of Communist Party membership and also that she had falsified her employment application. The Board's finding of Communist Party membership was based on evidence uncovered in the Cutter investigations plus Mrs. Walker's \n\n[351 \nU.S. 292, 297]\n\u00a0\n refusal to answer questions relating to membership and the Union's offer to stipulate that the company could reasonably have concluded that she was a Communist.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nThe Board took the \"view of the record\" that Cutter honestly believed that Mrs. Walker had falsified her application and was a member of the Party. But it held that, \"while an employer may have sufficient grounds for a discharge,\" he \"should not be entitled to carry mutually known grounds for discharge in his hip pocket indefinitely for future convenient use.\" It found Cutter's grounds to be \"stale\" and concluded that Mrs. Walker was unjustly discharged and that this action of Cutter \"interfered with, restrained and coerced an employee because of participation as an officer and negotiator on behalf of the Union in a wage negotiation.\"\n\nThe majority opinion of the Supreme Court of California contains broad statements to the effect that specific performance of the arbitration award would violate the public policy of the State. Petitioner's constitutional arguments are based on the belief that these statements establish the ground on which the judgment below was based, and that therefore the decision below not only establishes a conclusive presumption of advocacy of violence from the mere fact of membership in the Communist Party, but renders unenforceable substantially all contracts entered into by members of the Party.\n\nThis Court, however, reviews judgments, not statements in opinions. Herb v. Pitcairn, \n324 \nU.S. 117, 125\n-126; Morrison v. Watson, \n154 \nU.S. 111, 115\n. See also \n\n[351 \nU.S. 292, 298]\n\u00a0\n Williams v. Norris, 12 Wheat. 117, 118, 120. At times, the atmosphere in which an opinion is written may become so surcharged that unnecessarily broad statements are made. In such a case, it is our duty to look beyond the broad sweep of the language and determine for ourselves precisely the ground on which the judgment rests. This means no more than that we should not pass on federal questions discussed in the opinion where it appears that the judgment rests on adequate state grounds. Herb v. Pitcairn, supra; Williams v. Kaiser, \n323 \nU.S. 471, 477\n.\n\nIt is significant that the Supreme Court of California did not limit itself to a discussion of the application of the California public policy. It also subjected the findings of the Arbitration Board to a scrutinizing review. Of course, the scope of review of such findings under the California Arbitration Act is a matter exclusively for the courts of that State, and is not our concern. Allen Bradley Local v. Labor Board, \n315 \nU.S. 740, 747\n.\n\nFirst, the court determined that, since Mrs. Walker was a continuing member of the Communist Party, the doctrine of waiver could not be applied to this ground for discharge. The court noted that Mrs. Walker had remained a member of the Party \"on an active and devoted basis even at the time of the board hearings.\"\n3\n 43 Cal. 2d, at 807, 278 P.2d, at 916.\n\nSecond, it is clear that the individual parties might have agreed that the circumstance of Communist Party membership would constitute \"just cause\" under the contract, and no federal question would thereby be raised. It is implicit in the Arbitration Board's opinion that this \n\n[351 \nU.S. 292, 299]\n\u00a0\n was a reasonable construction of the contract, but since it applied a doctrine of waiver, no explicit findings on this point were made. But, as we read the opinion of the Supreme Court of California, after concluding that waiver could not be applied to the facts of this case, it decided that the \"just cause\" provision of the contract permitted discharge on the ground of Communist Party membership, and that Mrs. Walker was discharged on that ground. The court stated, \"The contract between Cutter Laboratories and the Bio-Lab Union cannot be construed, and will not be enforced, to protect activities by a Communist on behalf of her party whether in the guise of unionism or otherwise.\" 43 Cal. 2d, at 809, 278 P.2d ___, at 917. At another point, the court noted that \"an entirely adequate ground [Party membership] for refusing to employ her (whether by original refusal to hire or by discharge) was a continuing one which was available to the employer at any time during its existence.\" 43 Cal. 2d, at 807, 278 P.2d, at 916. In this connection, it might also be noted that the court below discussed the history of the clause in the contract which prohibited discrimination \"because of race, color, creed, national origin, religious belief, or Union affiliation.\" At one time the word \"political\" as well as \"religious belief\" was included in the provision, but, by negotiation, it was deleted.\n\nWe believe that the Supreme Court of California construed the term \"just cause\" to embrace membership in the Communist Party, and refused to apply a doctrine of waiver. As such, the decision involves only California's construction of a local contract under local law, and therefore no substantial federal question is presented. Moreover, even if the State Court's opinion be considered ambiguous, we should choose the interpretation which does not face us with a constitutional question. See \n\n[351 \nU.S. 292, 300]\n\u00a0\n Stembridge v. Georgia, \n343 \nU.S. 541, 547\n, and cases cited. Cf. United States v. Rumely, \n345 \nU.S. 41\n. It follows that the writ must be\n\n      Dismissed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE REED would affirm the judgment below.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] At the time of discharge a written notice was read to Mrs. Walker by a company official in the presence of another company official, an assistant shop steward of the union and a company stenographer. The notice read as follows: \"Mrs. Walker: \"As you are aware, the company has known for some time that when you applied for work with Cutter Laboratories on October 4, 1946, you made a number of false representations on your `Application for Employment.' \"As we know now, you falsified the statement of your education so as to conceal the fact that you had completed a law school course at the University of California's School of Jurisprudence at Berkeley in May, 1942. You concealed the facts that you received the degree of Bachelor of Laws in May, 1942, and that you were admitted to the State Bar of California on December 8, 1942. You concealed that since that date you have at all times been admitted and entitled to practice as an attorney before all of the Courts of California. \"We know now that by falsification of the name of a previous \n\n[351 \nU.S. 292, 294]\n\u00a0\n employer, you concealed the fact that from June, 1942 to February, 1944 you were employed by the Federal Government's Office of Price Administration, including employment as an Enforcement Attorney at a salary of about $3,200.00 a year. \"We know now that you deliberately concealed from us that from February 1944 to December, 1945 you were employed as an attorney by Gladstein, Grossman, Sawyer and Edises, a well-known firm of lawyers specializing in labor cases. \"You know that a few weeks ago the `Labor Herald,' the official CIO newspaper, stated that the National Labor Relations Board had sustained a cannery firm that had discharged you for refusing to answer whether or not you were a Communist. \"We have checked the records. We know now that you deliberately concealed that in 1946, just before you applied for work here, you were employed by a series of canneries and had been discharged by them. \"Ordinarily, an employee of the Company would be discharged immediately for falsifying material facts on an `Application for Employment.' Because you were an officer of the Union we kept you on the pay roll rather than open ourselves to a charge of persecuting a union officer. We have given your case careful consideration because we know very well that no matter how strong the case against you there will be a claim of discrimination because of union activities. \"Because no employer wants to become involved in a dispute of that kind we have been patient and deliberate in our consideration of your misconduct. \"On October 1, 1948, when you testified under oath before a Trial Examiner of the National Labor Relations Board, you refused to answer the question as to whether or not you were a member of the Communist Party. \"You refused to answer under oath the question as to whether or not you were or had been a member of the Federal Workers' Branch No. 3 of the Communist Party. \"You refused to testify under oath whether or not you were or had been a member of the South Side Professional Club of the Communist Party. \"We are convinced now, that you were and still are a member of \n\n[351 \nU.S. 292, 295]\n\u00a0\n the Communist Party, that you were a member of the Federal Workers' Branch No. 3 of the Communist Party, and that you were a member of the South Side Professional Club of the Communist Party. \"Our recent investigation of your past record has uncovered previously unknown conduct that goes far beyond a mere concealment of material facts. We have just completed a thorough investigation and have a full report upon your past activities. We realize now the importance of the facts that you concealed from us. We realize the full implications of your falsification and misrepresentations. A follow-up and investigation of the `Labor Heralds' recent revelations has uncovered a situation far more grave than we expected. \"We are convinced now that for a number of years, you have been and still are a member of the Communist Party. We are convinced beyond any question that for a number of years you have participated actively in the Communist Party's activities. \"The nature of our company's business requires more than the usual precaution against sabotage and subversion. Upon a disclosure that any employee is a member of the Communist Party, or has participated in other subversive or revolutionary activity, we conceive it to be the responsibility of management to take action. \"Confronted with such a situation, any inclination to be lenient or to grant a union official special consideration is out. In the face of your record there is no alternative open to us except to terminate your services at once. Accordingly, you are notified now that you are discharged for the causes mentioned. You will be paid the full amount due to you promptly.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Since the Board was authorized to inquire into the reasons for her discharge and the questions were, as it ruled, relevant to the issue, it could draw such inferences as were warranted. In this respect the case is unlike Slochower v. Board of Education, \n350 \nU.S. 551\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] While the court also spoke of its public policy in reaching this conclusion, its reasoning outlined above amply supports its conclusion.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE BLACK concur, dissenting.\n\n  I believe, with all deference, that the decision of the Court abuses the rule that we will not undertake to review a decision of a state court that rests on an independent state ground. No independent state ground is present in this case. Rather, it is easily demonstrated, I think, that the decision of the Supreme Court of California squarely and directly raises an important question under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\n\nAt times we have ambiguous opinions that make us unsure of the precise grounds of the decision of the state court. In this case, however, we are left in no doubt. The arbitrators found that the employer discharged this worker because of her labor union activities, using the charge of Communism as a mere pretext. The Supreme Court of California went on no such ground. It is clear from a reading of its opinion (43 Cal. 2d 788, 278 P.2d 905), that it approved the employer's discharge of this worker because she was a Communist. The tactics of Communists and the dangers of Communism make up a total of 11 pages of the 21-page majority opinion of the Supreme Court. Among other things, the Supreme Court of California said:\n\n\"From the array of congressional and legislative findings which have been quoted above, if not from the common knowledge of mankind, it must be accepted as conclusively established that a member of the Communist Party cannot be loyal to his private employer as against \n\n[351 \nU.S. 292, 301]\n\u00a0\n any directive of his Communist master.\" 43 Cal. 2d, at 806, 278 P.2d, at 916. It went on to hold that \"acts of sabotage by Communists are reasonably to be expected at any time such acts may be directed by the party leader\" (43 Cal. 2d, at 807, 278 P.2d, at 916) and that an employer has the \"right to discharge employees who upon the established facts are dedicated to be disloyal to him, to be likewise disloyal to the American labor union they may purport to serve, and who constitute a continuing risk to both the employing company and the public depending upon the company's products.\" 43 Cal. 2d, at 807, 278 P.2d, at 917.\n\n\n The arbitrators found that any grievance against Doris Walker was a stale one, the employer having known all her Communist activities for two years. The Superior Court upheld that finding. The District Court of Appeal ruled that the employer \"sat back for two and a half years\" and then used her Communist activities as an excuse for injuring the union in its lawful labor activity. 266 P.2d 92, 100. But the Supreme Court held that she was discharged not for her \"labor union activities\" but for her \"Communist Party activities.\" 43 Cal. 2d, at 808, 278 P.2d, at 917. It said that the fact that the employer, knowing all the facts, did nothing for two years was irrelevant, since it was against the \"public policy\" of California to conclude that there was a waiver by the failure to discharge a Communist. 43 Cal. 2d, at 806, 278 P.2d, at 916. It is plain, therefore, that the judgment of the Supreme Court of California sustains a discharge of this worker because she was a Communist.\n\nThe Court says that the parties to a collective-bargaining agreement may make Communist Party membership \"just cause\" for discharge of an employee, that discharge for that reason is merely a matter of contract between the union on the one hand and the employer on the other, and that when the contract is enforced no federal right is \n\n[351 \nU.S. 292, 302]\n\u00a0\n infringed. I disagree with that doctrine. It is a dangerous innovation to meet the exigencies of the present case. It violates First Amendment guarantees of citizens who are workers in our industrial plants.\n\nI can better illustrate my difficulty by a hypothetical case. A union enters into a collective-bargaining agreement with an employer that allows any employee who is a Republican to be discharged for \"just cause.\" Employers can, of course, hire whom they choose, arranging for an all-Democratic labor force if they desire.\n*\n But the courts may not be implicated in such a discriminatory scheme. Once the courts put their imprimatur on such a contract, government, speaking through the judicial branch, acts. Shelley v. Kraemer, \n334 \nU.S. 1\n; Barrows v. Jackson, \n346 \nU.S. 249\n. And it is governmental action that the Constitution controls. Certainly neither a State nor the Federal Government could adopt a political test for workers in defense plants or other factories. It is elementary that freedom of political thought is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment against interference by the States (De Jonge v. Oregon, \n299 \nU.S. 353, 364\n-365) and against federal regimentation by the First Amendment.\n\nGovernment may not favor one political group over another. Government may not disqualify one political group from employment. And if the courts lend their support to any such discriminatory program, Shelley v. Kraemer, supra, teaches that the Government has thrown \n\n[351 \nU.S. 292, 303]\n\u00a0\n its weight behind an unconstitutional scheme to discriminate against citizens by reason of their political ideology. That cannot be done in America, unless we forsake our Bill of Rights.\n\nIt has hitherto been assumed that Communists, except and unless they violate laws, are entitled to the same civil rights as other citizens. In 1937, Chief Justice Hughes wrote to that effect for a unanimous Court in De Jonge v. Oregon, supra. That decision held that a State could not punish Communists for having a public meeting to discuss a matter of public concern. Chief Justice Hughes said that First Amendment rights might be abused \"to incite to violence and crime.\" \n299 \nU.S., at 364\n. But he went on to say, \"The people through their legislatures may protect themselves against that abuse. But the legislative intervention can find constitutional justification only by dealing with the abuse. The rights themselves must not be curtailed. The greater the importance of safeguarding the community from incitements to the overthrow of our institutions by force and violence, the more imperative is the need to preserve inviolate the constitutional rights of free speech, free press and free assembly in order to maintain the opportunity for free political discussion, to the end that government may be responsive to the will of the people and that changes, if desired, may be obtained by peaceful means. Therein lies the security of the Republic, the very foundation of constitutional government.\" Id., at 364-365.\n\nCutter Laboratories is an important pharmaceutical factory. It may need special protection. It may need to establish safeguards against sabotage and adulteration. It may need special screening of its employees. But there is not a word in the present record indicating that it needs protection against Doris Walker. She has no criminal record. She is guilty of no adulteration, no \n\n[351 \nU.S. 292, 304]\n\u00a0\n act of sabotage. The factory in question has not been plagued with any such problem. It is only the fear that Doris Walker might at a future time engage in sabotage that is made the excuse for her discharge. I do not think we can hold consistently with our Bill of Rights that Communists can be proscribed from making a living on the assumption that wherever they work the incidence of sabotage rises or that the danger from Communist employees is too great for critical industry to bear.\n\nThe blunt truth is that Doris Walker is not discharged for misconduct but either because of her legitimate labor union activities or because of her political ideology or belief. Belief cannot be penalized consistently with the First Amendment. As Mr. Justice Roberts wrote for a unanimous Court in Cantwell v. Connecticut, \n310 \nU.S. 296, 303\n-304, the First Amendment \"embraces two concepts, - freedom to believe and freedom to act. The first is absolute but, in the nature of things, the second cannot be. Conduct remains subject to regulation for the protection of society.\" The Court today allows belief, not conduct, to be regulated. We sanction a flagrant violation of the First Amendment when we allow California, acting through her highest court, to sustain Mrs. Walker's discharge because of her belief.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] A union has no such liberty if it operates with the sanction of the State or the Federal Government behind it. It is then the agency by which governmental policy is expressed and may not make discriminations that the Government may not make. See Steele v. Louisville & N. R.

CHASE NATIONAL BANK(1956)\nNo. 24\nArgued: Decided: November 19, 1956\n\n\n\n\n In an action brought by a trustee in New York state courts for a construction of the indenture and for an accounting, the Alien Property Custodian, later succeeded by the Attorney General of the United States, intervened and, in effect, tendered his claim to the entire property, by virtue of a vesting order issued under 5 of the Trading with the Enemy Act, as amended. The state courts denied such relief, and no review was sought here. The Attorney General subsequently amended the vesting order and brought suit in the New York state courts, praying that the principal of the trust be transferred to him. The state courts denied the relief. Held: Principles of res judicata bar the present suit. Pp. 37-39.\n\n 286 App. Div. 808, 143 N. Y. S. 2d 623, affirmed.\n\nGeorge B. Searls argued the cause for petitioner. With him on a brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Townsend and James D. Hill. Simon E. Sobeloff, then Solicitor General, was also on a brief with Mr. Townsend, Mr. Hill and Mr. Searls.\n\nThomas A. Ryan argued the cause and filed a brief for the Chase National Bank of New York, Trustee, respondent.\n\nSamuel Anatole Lourie argued the cause and filed a brief for Schaefer et al., respondents.\n\nArthur J. O'Leary argued the cause for Schwarzburger et al., respondents. With him on the brief was Kenneth J. Mullane. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 36, 37]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe question in the case is whether petitioner, by virtue of a vesting order issued under 5 of the Trading with the Enemy Act, as amended, 40 Stat. 411, 50 U.S.C. App. 5, is entitled to the res of a trust established in 1928 by one Cobb and administered by respondent under an indenture. The trust was created for the benefit of the descendants of Bruno Reinicke who, by reason of his powers over the trust and his ownership of the right of reversion, was the real settlor.\n\nIn 1945, when this Nation was at war with Germany, the Alien Property Custodian issued an order vesting \"all right, title, interest and claim of any kind or character whatsoever\" of the beneficiaries of the trust, declaring that they were nationals of Germany. Subsequently the Custodian (for whom the Attorney General was later substituted) intervened in an action brought by the trustee in the New York courts for a construction of the indenture and for an accounting. Relief sought by that intervention was that the income of the trust be paid to the Attorney General and that the powers reserved to the settlor be held to have passed by virtue of the vesting order to the Attorney General. We are also advised by the report of the case in the Court of Appeals that the Attorney General also claimed that, if the vesting order had not transferred the settlor's powers to the Attorney General, \"then the trust had failed and all of the trust property should pass to the Attorney General under the vesting order as being property of alien enemies.\" Chase National Bank v. McGrath, 301 N. Y. 602, 603-604, 93 N. E. 2d 495.\n\nThe New York Supreme Court denied the relief asked by the Attorney General, holding he was not entitled to the income of the trust, that he had not succeeded to the powers of the settlor, and that those powers were vested \n\n[352 \nU.S. 36, 38]\n\u00a0\n in the trustee as long as the settlor was barred from asserting them. On appeal the Appellate Division affirmed. Chase National Bank v. McGrath, 276 App. Div. 831, 93 N. Y. S. 2d 724. The Court of Appeals in turn affirmed. Chase National Bank v. McGrath, 301 N. Y. 602, 93 N. E. 2d 495. No review of that order was sought here.\n\nSome years passed, when, in 1953, the Attorney General amended the vesting order by undertaking to appropriate \"all property in the possession, custody or control\" of the trustee.\n*\n In a suit in the New York courts he asked, among other things, that the principal of the trust be transferred to him. The Supreme Court of New York denied the relief. The Appellate Division affirmed without opinion. Chase National Bank v. Reinicke, 286 App. Div. 808, 143 N. Y. S. 2d 623. The Court of Appeals denied leave to appeal. Chase National Bank v. Reinicke, 309 N. Y. 1030, 129 N. E. 2d 790. The case is here on certiorari. \n350 \nU.S. 964\n.\n\nWe do not reach the several questions presented under the Trading with the Enemy Act for we are of the view that the principles of res judicata require an affirmance. In the first litigation, the Attorney General sought to reach the equitable interests in the trust and the powers of the settlor. When the Attorney General now seeks the entire bundle of rights, he is claiming for the most part what was denied him in the first suit. That is not all. In the first suit he claimed that if he were denied the \n\n[352 \nU.S. 36, 39]\n\u00a0\n powers which the settlor had over the trust, the trust must fail and all the trust property must be transferred to him. In other words, the Attorney General tendered in the first suit his claim to the entire property. Cf. Young v. Higbee Co., \n324 \nU.S. 204, 208\n-209. Under familiar principles of res judicata, the claim so tendered may not be relitigated. Cromwell v. County of sac, \n94 \nU.S. 351, 352\n; Tait v. Western Maryland R. Co., \n289 \nU.S. 620, 623\n. If he was not content with the first ruling, his remedy was by certiorari to this Court. Angel v. Bullington, \n330 \nU.S. 183, 189\n. Having failed to seek and obtain that review, he is barred from relitigating the issues tendered in the first suit.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE CLARK and MR. JUSTICE HARLAN took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] The state of war between this country and Germany was declared ended by the Joint Resolution of October 19, 1951, 65 Stat. 451.

The provision of 236 (c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 that the decision of a special inquiry officer excluding an alien from admission into the United States \"shall be final unless reversed on appeal to the Attorney General\" refers only to administrative finality, and it does not limit challenges of such decisions to habeas corpus proceedings. Pp. 184-185.\n\n\n 3. The conclusion here reached is in full accord with reports made to Congress by those sponsoring and managing the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 on the floor of each house of Congress.

Whether an alien seeks judicial review of an exclusion order by a habeas corpus proceeding or by an action for a declaratory judgment, the scope of the review is that of existing law.

With him on the brief was Jack Wasserman. David Carliner entered an appearance for respondent. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 180, 181]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nIn Shaughnessy v. Pedreiro, \n349 \nU.S. 48\n (1955), we held that an alien, ordered deported by the Attorney General under the provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, might test the legality of such order in a declaratory judgment action brought under 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act, 60 Stat. 243, 5 U.S.C. 1009. The sole question to be determined here is whether the legality of an exclusion order entered under the relevant provisions of the same 1952 Act must be challenged by habeas corpus, or whether it may also be reviewed by an action for declaratory judgment under 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act. The Court of Appeals held the latter to be an appropriate remedy. 97 U.S. App. D.C. 25, 227 F.2d 40. We granted certiorari, \n351 \nU.S. 905\n, because of the importance of the question in the administration of the immigration law. We conclude that either remedy is available in seeking review of such orders. This makes it unnecessary for us to pass upon other questions raised by the parties.\n\nShung, a Chinese alien, presented himself at San Francisco on November 28, 1947, claiming admission to the United States under the provisions of the War Brides Act of December 28, 1945, 59 Stat. 659, 8 U.S.C. (1946 ed.) 232. He testified under oath that he was the blood son of an American citizen who served in the United States armed forces during World War II. In January 1948 and again in February 1949, Boards of Special Inquiry held Shung inadmissible on the ground that he had not established the alleged relationship. The Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed. Shung first sought judicial review of this order by a declaratory judgment action instituted before the effective date of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. His complaint was dismissed on the ground that the order was valid. Tom We Shung v. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 180, 182]\n\u00a0\n McGrath, 103 F. Supp. 507, aff'd sub nom. Tom We shung v. Brownell, 93 U.S. App. D.C. 32, 207 F.2d 132. We vacated the judgment and remanded the cause to the District Court with directions to dismiss it for lack of jurisdiction, \n346 \nU.S. 906\n, on the authority of Heikkila v. Barber, \n345 \nU.S. 229\n (1953), which held that habeas corpus was the only available remedy for testing deportation orders under the Immigration Act of 1917. After the passage of the 1952 Act, Shung filed this suit seeking review of his exclusion by a declaratory judgment action. He asserts that our ruling in Pedreiro permitting deportation orders under the 1952 Act to be challenged by declaratory action requires a similar result as to exclusion orders. However, the Government contends that the Pedreiro rule does not apply in exclusion cases because of the basic differences between those actions and deportation cases. The Government also urges that the language, statutory structure, and legislative history of the 1952 Act support its contention.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nAt the outset the Government contends that constitutionally an alien seeking initial admission into the United States is in a different position from that of a resident alien against whom deportation proceedings are instituted.\n1\n This, it contends, precludes general judicial review. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 180, 183]\n\u00a0\n Shung admits these substantive differences but counters that such a distinction should be without significance when all that is involved is the form of judicial action available, not the scope of review. We do not believe that the constitutional status of the parties requires that the form of judicial action be strait-jacketed. Nor should the fact that in one action the burden is on the alien while in the other it must be met by the Government afford basis for discrimination. Admittedly, excluded aliens may test the order of their exclusion by habeas corpus. Citizenship claimants who hold \"certificates of identity\" are required by 360 (c) of the 1952 Act\n2\n to test the validity of their exclusion by habeas corpus only. Respondent here neither claims citizenship nor did he hold a certificate of identity, and 360 (c) has no bearing on this case. For a habeas corpus proceeding the alien must be detained or at the least be in technical custody, as the Government puts it. On the other hand, a declaratory judgment action requires no such basis and the odium of arrest and detention is not present. It does not follow that the absence of this condition would enlarge the permissible scope of review traditionally permitted in exclusion cases. The substantive law governing such actions would remain the rule of decision on the merits but the form of action would be by declaratory \n\n[352 \nU.S. 180, 184]\n\u00a0\n judgment rather than habeas corpus.\n3\n We conclude that unless the 1952 Act is to the contrary, exclusion orders may be challenged either by habeas corpus or by declaratory judgment action.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nThe Government insists that Congress has limited such challenges to habeas corpus actions by certain language in the 1952 Act. It argues that the finality clause of the Act with respect to exclusion\n4\n limits judicial review to habeas corpus only. The gist of that clause as to deportation cases is that \"the decision of the Attorney General shall be final,\"\n5\n while in exclusion proceedings \"the decision of a special inquiry officer [is] final unless reversed on appeal to the Attorney General.\" The Government reasons that the latter clause limits review to administrative appeal to the Attorney General and that no other form of review was intended, aside from habeas corpus, to test the alien's exclusion. It points to exceptions that even withhold administrative review in certain classes of cases as bolstering its position. It is true that subsections (b) and (d) of 236 of the 1952 Act deny any administrative \n\n[352 \nU.S. 180, 185]\n\u00a0\n appeal on temporary exclusion in security cases as well as in those where the alien suffers a medical affliction of certain types. But to darken the meaning of the word \"final\" as used by Congress by giving it chameleonic characteristics is to indulge in choplogic. In fact, the regulations of the Attorney General seem to give \"final\" the same connotation with respect to deportation as does the Act with respect to exclusion. See 8 CFR, Rev. 1952, 242.61 (e). Furthermore, as we pointed out in Pedreiro, such a \"cutting off\" of judicial review \"would run counter to 10 and 12 of the Administrative Procedure Act.\" \n349 \nU.S., at 51\n. \"Exemptions from the . . . Administrative Procedure Act are not lightly to be presumed,\" Marcello v. Bonds, \n349 \nU.S. 302, 310\n (1955), and unless made by clear language or supersedure the expanded mode of review granted by that Act cannot be modified. We therefore conclude that the finality provision of the 1952 Act in regard to exclusion refers only to administrative finality.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nThe Government also points to certain testimony at hearings on the bill, as well as statements made on the floor in debate at the time of passage of the 1952 Act, as supporting its position. We believe, however, that Senate Report No. 1137, 82d Cong., 2d Sess.,\n6\n and the statement of the managers on the part of the House which accompanied \n\n[352 \nU.S. 180, 186]\n\u00a0\n the Conference Report,\n7\n reflect the intention of the Congress in this regard. The Senate Report, after reciting that a provision limiting \"judicial review only through the writ of habeas corpus\" had been stricken from the bill, stated that such action was not intended to \"expand [the scope of] judicial review in immigration cases beyond that under existing law.\" (Emphasis supplied.) The House managers reported that after careful consideration of \"the problem of judicial review\" they were satisfied that the \"procedures provided in the bill . . . remain within the framework and the pattern of the Administrative Procedure Act. The safeguard of judicial procedure is afforded the alien in both exclusion and deportation proceedings.\" We believe that our interpretation of the Act is in full accord with these significant reports made by those sponsoring and managing the legislation on the floor of each house of the Congress.\n\nIt may be that habeas corpus is a far more expeditious remedy than that of declaratory judgment, as the experience of Shung may indicate.\n8\n But that fact may be weighed by the alien against the necessity of arrest and detention after which he may make his choice of the form of action he wishes to use in challenging his exclusion. In either case, the scope of the review is that of existing law.\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Since Ekiu v. United States, \n142 \nU.S. 651\n (1892), this Court has held that in exclusion cases involving initial entry \"the decisions of executive or administrative officers, acting within powers expressly conferred by Congress, are due process of law.\" At p. 660. Nevertheless, due process has been held in cases similar in facts to the one here involved to include a fair hearing as well as conformity to statutory grounds.

Similar relief was requested by respondent in a petition for rehearing, denied in \n350 \nU.S. 943\n. Rule 58 (4) bars consecutive and out-of-time petitions for rehearing. The Boudoin case, however, concerned a motion to recall a judgment that asked for almost identical relief. Yet, if it had been considered a petition for rehearing, it was filed out of time. The grant of the motion in the Boudoin case shows that Rule 58 (4) does not prohibit motions to correct this kind of error.\n\nCompare as to mootness, Bakery Drivers Union v.

JUSTICE BLACK, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, and MR. JUSTICE CLARK join, dissenting.\n\nIn the interest of fairness we would not remand this case to the Court of Appeals. Cahill brought this action under the Federal Employer's Liability Act\n1\n to recover for injuries sustained while working as a railroad brakeman. He was hurt on a busy highway which had railroad tracks running down its center. While flagging traffic behind a train stalled on these tracks Cahill was struck by a truck which started up suddenly. His complaint charged that the railroad was negligent in sending him to work in such a dangerous place without proper \n\n[351 \nU.S. 183, 185]\n\u00a0\n warning or instructions. The jury found for Cahill and awarded him damages. The railroad asked the Court of Appeals to reverse Cahill's judgment on two grounds: (1) there was insufficient evidence to permit submission of the case to the jury; (2) the trial judge erroneously admitted evidence of prior accidents at the scene of Cahill's injury offered to show the railroad's negligence in failing to warn him of dangers such as had brought about those accidents.\n\nThe Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that there was not sufficient evidence to support the verdict. 224 F.2d 637. Having taken this action the Court of Appeals expressly stated that it did not find it necessary to pass on the alleged error in admitting the evidence of prior accidents. Cahill then asked us for certiorari. On November 21, 1955, we granted his petition and reversed the Court of Appeals' judgment, thereby reinstating the judgment of the District Court. \n350 \nU.S. 898\n. MR. JUSTICE REED dissented. MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, MR. JUSTICE BURTON, and MR. JUSTICE HARLAN expressed the view that certiorari should have been denied; they did not participate in the decision on the merits.\n2\n In a timely petition for rehearing the railroad called our attention to the fact that its objection to the evidence of prior accidents had never been passed on by the Court of Appeals, urging that we reconsider our judgment and modify it to the extent necessary to remand the cause to the Court of Appeals to pass on the question it had left undecided. This Court denied the petition for rehearing. \n350 \nU.S. 943\n.\n\nThe railroad's present \"motion to recall\" presents precisely the same contention which was raised in its petition \n\n[351 \nU.S. 183, 186]\n\u00a0\n for rehearing. We are asked once more to remand the case to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit for that court to determine whether there was error in admitting the evidence of prior accidents. Thus the \"motion to recall\" turns out to be a petition for rehearing of a former petition for rehearing. Or in somewhat plainer language, the motion to recall turns out to be a second petition for rehearing. But Rule 58 (4) of this Court declares that: \"Consecutive petitions for rehearings, and petitions for rehearing that are out of time under this rule, will not be received.\" What is in fact a second petition for rehearing should not be received simply because it is labeled a \"motion to recall.\"\n\nThere can be no possible doubt that a proper way to raise the sort of question here presented is by filing a petition for rehearing. Our records are filled with proof of this. The latest example is our action in Union Trust Co. v. Eastern Air Lines, Inc., \n350 \nU.S. 962\n, decided February 27, 1956. We granted relief in that case of precisely the same kind that the railroad here asked us to grant in its petition for rehearing and asks us again to grant in its \"motion to recall.\" There is nothing new about granting the relief here requested in response to a petition for rehearing. Upon one occasion Mr. Justice Bradley, speaking from the bench, said:\n\n \"It ought to be understood, or at least believed, whether it is true or not, that this Court, being a Court of last resort, gives great consideration to cases of importance and involving consequences like this, and there should be a finality somewhere. This custom of making motions for a rehearing is not a custom to be encouraged. It prevails in some States as a matter of ordinary practice to grant a rehearing on a mere application for it, but that practice we do not consider a legitimate one in this Court. It is \n\n[351 \nU.S. 183, 187]\n\u00a0\n possible that in the haste of examining cases before us, we sometimes overlook something, and then we are willing to have that pointed out, but to consider that this Court will reexamine the matter and change its judgment on a case, it seems to me, is not taking a proper view of the functions of this Court. . . .\"\n3\n\u00a0\n\n\n This was an early recognition of the appropriateness of a motion for rehearing to raise points that have been overlooked. Thus, assuming that the point raised here was overlooked originally, it was correctly raised in the first petition for rehearing and that should end the matter if this Court's Rule 58 (4) is to be followed.\n\nMr. Justice Bradley dealt with the problem of successive petitions for rehearing in Williams v. Conger, \n131 \nU.S. 390\n. There the litigant claimed that a clerical error had been made in an opinion. A rehearing was asked on that ground but was denied. The Court concluded that \"no modification of the judgment was required, and no rehearing was necessary or called for. . . .\" \n131 \nU.S., at 391\n. Later the same request was again made. Mr. Justice Bradley, speaking for the Court, expressed its strong lack of patience at the \"persistent renewal of the application . . . especially upon the same reasons once overruled . . . .\" Ibid. One would judge from the tone of the opinion in that case that the Court would not have reached a different result had the second motion for rehearing been labeled a \"motion to recall the judgment.\" \n\n[351 \nU.S. 183, 188]\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur action in Boudoin v. Lykes Bros. S. S. Co., \n350 \nU.S. 811\n, does not justify the Court in granting this motion to rehear a petition for rehearing formerly denied. In that case Boudoin appealed from a judgment of the District Court in his favor, claiming: (a) the amount of damages awarded him was inadequate; and (b) the term of maintenance determined by the trial court was insufficient and should be extended and increased. The Court of Appeals undercut both of these alleged errors by holding that Boudoin was entitled to recover nothing at all. We reversed. \n348 \nU.S. 336\n. Boudoin filed no petition for rehearing. He did ask us to amend our judgment so that the Court of Appeals could adjudicate the question of the amount of damages and we granted that motion. But our action there is not comparable to the action requested here. Had we denied Boudoin's motion and had he filed a later motion of the same kind I suppose we would not have considered it a second time. But here the Court is asked to review its judgment of reversal a second time. The substance of the pleadings and not their labels should govern our action. We should not grant what is in effect a second petition for rehearing unless the Court is willing to admit that it is refusing to give the rule against successive petitions for rehearing its literal meaning. There are strong arguments for allowing a second petition for rehearing where a rigid application of this rule would cause manifest injustice. Cf. Hormel v. Helvering, \n312 \nU.S. 552, 556\n-559. But this is no such case.\n\nWe have never held that in every instance where the Court of Appeals has failed to decide a point, we must remand the cause to that Court. Such a rigid rule would be most undesirable and would bring about interminable delays with most unjust results. In Delk v. St. Louis & S. F. R. Co., \n220 \nU.S. 580\n, a suit for injuries under the Safety Appliance Act, this Court, after reversing the \n\n[351 \nU.S. 183, 189]\n\u00a0\n Court of Appeals on one question, went on to decide a second question which the Court of Appeals had expressly left undecided. Mr. Justice Harlan, speaking for the Court, said: \"As the case is here upon certiorari to review the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals, this court has the entire record before it with the power to review the action of that court as well as direct such disposition of the case as that court might have done . . . .\" \n220 \nU.S., at 588\n.\n4\n More recently in O'Leary v. Brown-Pacific-Maxon, Inc., \n340 \nU.S. 504\n, this Court again decided a question left undecided by the Court of Appeals. MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, speaking for the Court, said: \"In this instance, however, we have a slim record and the relevant standard is not difficult to apply; and we think the litigation had better terminate now. Accordingly we have ourselves examined the record to assess the sufficiency of the evidence.\" \n340 \nU.S., at 508\n. At least where there are unsubstantial points left undecided below this Court should not remand the case for consideration of those points.\n\nCertainly there is no error asserted here that justifies sending this case back to the Court of Appeals. The error claimed relates to the admissibility of evidence concerning prior accidents. Cahill's case against the railroad was based in large part on the failure to give him proper instructions before sending him to work in a dangerous place when he had never done such work before. This made the railroad's knowledge of the danger of highway traffic at that location highly relevant in proving the railroad negligent. What better proof could there \n\n[351 \nU.S. 183, 190]\n\u00a0\n be than the fact that the railroad knew there had been repeated accidents at the same location of the kind that brought about Cahill's injury? No fair system of evidence would exclude such testimony when issues are raised like those involved here. As Mr. Justice Field, speaking for the Court, said in District of Columbia v. Armes, \n107 \nU.S. 519, 525\n: \"The frequency of accidents at a particular place would seem to be good evidence of its dangerous character, - at least, it is some evidence to that effect.\"\n5\n\u00a0\n\nWe are told in this case that the railroad has already paid the judgment. For all we know that judgment was paid directly to Cahill. It is the general rule that voluntary payment of a judgment amounts to accord and satisfaction. Thorp v. Bonnifield, \n177 \nU.S. 15, 18\n-19. Payment under duress is of course a different matter. We do not know whether this judgment was paid under duress. It is true there is a statement in respondent's brief that it informed petitioner of its intention to pursue whatever remedies it had notwithstanding payment of the judgment. And the brief also states that the District Court declined to agree to a stay of execution. This statement is certainly not sufficient to show the kind of duress that ought to justify setting aside the payment of a judgment.\n6\n Even if the facts alleged were sufficient, \n\n[351 \nU.S. 183, 191]\n\u00a0\n the question should be tried as one of fact before this Court takes the drastic action of trying to make a plaintiff pay back money that he has received under an order of this Court. Dakota County v. Glidden, \n113 \nU.S. 222\n.\n7\n If such summary action as here requested can be taken with reference to a judgment paid only a few days ago, why could it not be taken with reference to a judgment paid a year ago?\n8\n Yet the Court, without investigating these problems, summarily grants the motion to recall and remands the case to the Court of Appeals.\n\nI think the Court should deny this motion.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 35 Stat. 65, as amended, 45 U.S.C. 51 et seq.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See Carter v.

With him on the brief were Solicitor General Sobeloff, Assistant Attorney General Olney, Beatrice Rosenberg and Richard J. Blanchard.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n18 U.S.C. 401 (2) empowers a court of the United States to punish as contempt \"Misbehavior of any of its \n\n[350 \nU.S. 399, 400]\n\u00a0\n officers in their official transactions . . . .\"\n1\n Petitioner, a lawyer, sent a questionnaire to a District of Columbia grand jury. For this, the District Court found petitioner guilty of contempt and fined him $100. 122 F. Supp. 388. In so doing the court held that within the meaning of the statute petitioner was one \"of its officers\" and that sending the questionnaire was \"misbehavior\" in an \"official transaction.\" The Court of Appeals affirmed, Circuit Judge Fahy dissenting. 96 U.S. App. D.C. 30, 223 F.2d 322. The construction of the statute raised such important questions that we granted certiorari. \n350 \nU.S. 817\n. A rather detailed statement of the facts, which are not in dispute, will point up the broad scope given the statute in sustaining this conviction.\n\nA District of Columbia grand jury returned an indictment against Ben Gold, charging him with having filed a false non-Communist affidavit in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1001. Petitioner promptly appeared as his attorney. Shortly thereafter the same grand jury summoned two of Mr. Gold's associates, commanding them to appear and produce documents. Petitioner appeared for them and moved to quash and vacate the subpoenas. On the same day or the next, petitioner mailed from New York identical letters and questionnaires to all members of the grand jury who were employees of the Federal Government. In the letters petitioner told the grand jurors that as Mr. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 399, 401]\n\u00a0\n Gold's attorney he was trying to learn the effect of the Government's loyalty program on federal employee jurors. Explaining that he wanted no information concerning proceedings or deliberations of the grand jury, he asked the jurors to answer his questions on the ground that it was their duty as citizens \"to help enlighten the court on an issue which affects the liberty of a citizen on trial in a criminal case.\" All of the questions were directed toward learning whether the government employee jurors might be influenced by bias or fear to indict persons charged with having had some association with the Communist Party. On the basis of these facts, the District Court ordered petitioner to appear and show cause why he should not be adjudged guilty of contempt under 18 U.S.C. 401 (2).\n\nPetitioner appeared and answered the charges. He admitted the facts just stated but denied that his conduct constituted contempt within the meaning of the statute. His answer set out the following additional facts which are not disputed:\n\nPrior to the return of the indictment against Mr. Gold in the District of Columbia, two federal grand juries in New York had investigated this same alleged offense but returned no indictment. Immediately after Mr. Gold was arraigned in the District of Columbia Court, petitioner learned from a roster of the grand jury obtained from the clerk that 13 members of the grand jury - a majority - were government employees. Petitioner decided to make a motion challenging the legal qualifications of the government employee jurors. He concluded that this could be done under Rule 6 (b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, relying in part on this Court's statement in Dennis v. United States, \n339 \nU.S. 162, 171\n-172, that \"Preservation of the opportunity to \n\n[350 \nU.S. 399, 402]\n\u00a0\n prove actual bias is a guarantee of a defendant's right to an impartial jury.\"\n\nPetitioner was also led to believe that it would be necessary to obtain statements from the grand jurors because of the Government's brief and the court's holding in Emspak v. United States, 91 U.S. App. D.C. 378, 203 F.2d 54. There the Government successfully contested Emspak's efforts to show that federal employee grand jurors were biased and should not have served by arguing that \"there is not the slightest indication in the long motion and offer of proof that an attempt has been made to interview a single one of the persons.\" The Government also argued there that it was the defendant's duty to make his own investigation of bias instead of calling on the court to make it for him. The petitioner was also influenced by what had taken place in connection with an investigation of bias of government employees in another case in the District of Columbia. There a district judge had held that the defendant Weinberg was not entitled to a hearing as to bias of government employees as grand jurors unless the defendant had himself first undertaken to contact the jurors to ascertain from them the existence of bias. The district judge had stated that there was \"nothing to prevent counsel, if he sees fit, contacting those 15 members [of the grand jury] and inquiring only of one subject, whether or not they had any personal bias toward\" the defendant. After this statement counsel for Weinberg had sent a letter and questionnaire to all the government employee members of the grand jury. Petitioner consulted with Weinberg's lawyers who told him they had sent the letters and questionnaires without the prior knowledge or authority of the district judge, that their action was later made known to him, and that no suggestion of criticism was made either by the judge or by the Government. Petitioner then mailed substantially the \n\n[350 \nU.S. 399, 403]\n\u00a0\n same letter and questionnaire sent by Weinberg's counsel to the government employees on the grand jury that had indicted his client, Gold.\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing undisputed facts the district judge found petitioner guilty of contempt. He concluded that petitioner's act in sending the questionnaires was an impropriety but went on to say: \"There seems to be reason to believe respondent may have misconceived the proprieties. What he did was open. There was no opprobrious personal approach to jurors. There is indication respondent may have believed he had a right to propound the questions at the time he did, notwithstanding this Court is of opinion he had not.\" 122 F. Supp., at 389.\n\nThe contempt section here relied on derives from the Contempt Act of March 2, 1831. 4 Stat. 487. In Nye v. United States, \n313 \nU.S. 33\n, we reviewed the history of the 1831 Act and found that its purpose was greatly to limit the contempt power of federal courts.\n2\n For this reason we gave the provision of the Contempt Act then under consideration a narrow construction. Even though we recognized that Nye was guilty of \"highly reprehensible\" conduct, we held that he could not be punished summarily for contempt but must be \"afforded the normal safeguards surrounding criminal prosecutions.\" Id., at 52, 53. Some time after the Nye case we considered In re Michael, \n326 \nU.S. 224\n. There a trustee in bankruptcy had been adjudged guilty of contempt. The Government \n\n[350 \nU.S. 399, 404]\n\u00a0\n argued that he was guilty of misbehavior as an officer of the court in an official transaction under the same section involved here. Again we pointed out that the 1831 Act \"represented a deliberate Congressional purpose drastically to curtail the range of conduct which courts could punish as contempt.\" We there construed the Act as embodying a congressional plan to limit the contempt power to \"the least possible power adequate to the end proposed.\" See Anderson v. Dunn, 6 Wheat. 204, 231. We added, \"The exercise by federal courts of any broader contempt power than this would permit too great inroads on the procedural safeguards of the Bill of Rights, since contempts are summary in their nature, and leave determination of guilt to a judge rather than a jury. It is in this Constitutional setting that we must resolve the issues here raised.\" \n326 \nU.S., at 227\n. We consider the judicial power here in that same setting. Cf. United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, \n350 \nU.S. 11, 15\n-16.\n\nPetitioner contends that his conduct was not \"misbehavior\" within the meaning of the Act, but was a good faith attempt to discharge his duties as counsel for a defendant in a criminal case. We find it unnecessary to decide this but it is not out of place to say that no statute or rule of court specifically prohibits conduct such as petitioner's. Petitioner also contends that sending the questionnaire was not an \"official transaction\" within the meaning of the Act. However, if we assumed that a lawyer in ordinary practice is an \"official\" or \"officer\" of the court it would be hard to draw any line between \"official\" and \"unofficial\" transactions. Indeed there is plausibility in the implication of the Court of Appeals that if lawyers are covered by this section of the Act they are engaged in official transactions whenever engaged in the \"practice of the profession.\" But we find it unnecessary to decide when a lawyer is engaged in an \"official \n\n[350 \nU.S. 399, 405]\n\u00a0\n transaction\" for we hold that a lawyer is not a court \"officer\" within the meaning of 401 (2).\n\nIt has been stated many times that lawyers are \"officers of the court.\" One of the most frequently repeated statements to this effect appears in Ex parte Garland, 4 Wall. 333, 378. The Court pointed out there, however, that an attorney was not an \"officer\" within the ordinary meaning of that term. Certainly nothing that was said in Ex parte Garland or in any other case decided by this Court places attorneys in the same category as marshals, bailiffs, court clerks or judges. Unlike these officials a lawyer is engaged in a private profession, important though it be to our system of justice. In general he makes his own decisions, follows his own best judgment, collects his own fees and runs his own business. The word \"officer\" as it has always been applied to lawyers conveys quite a different meaning from the word \"officer\" as applied to people serving as officers within the conventional meaning of that term.\n3\n Cf. Labor Board v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co., \n350 \nU.S. 264\n. We see no reason why the category of \"officers\" subject to summary jurisdiction of a court under 401 (2) should be expanded beyond the group of persons who serve as conventional court officers and are regularly treated as such in the laws. See 28 U.S.C. 601-963.\n\nThere are strong reasons why attorneys should not be considered \"officers\" under 401 (2). As we pointed out in the Nye case, the 1831 Act was promptly passed by the Congress after the impeachment proceedings against \n\n[350 \nU.S. 399, 406]\n\u00a0\n Judge Peck failed by a senatorial vote of 22 to 21. Judge Peck had sent a lawyer to jail and had taken away his right to practice as punishment for an alleged contempt. The contempt consisted of published criticism of Judge Peck's opinion in a case in which the convicted lawyer had appeared as counsel; he was also counsel in other pending cases involving similar issues. Those directing the impeachment proceedings, who later brought about the passage of the 1831 Act, expressed deep concern lest lawyers continue to be subjected to summary trials by judges without the safeguards of juries and regular court procedure. Congressman James Buchanan who made the last argument against Judge Peck stated:\n\n\"But what is the process in the case of contempts? Without either an information or an indictment, but merely on a simple rule to show cause, drawn up in any form the judge may think proper, a man is put upon his trial for an infamous offence, involving in its punishment the loss both of liberty and property. He is deprived both of petit jury and grand jury, and is tried by an angry adversary prepared to sacrifice him and his rights on the altar of his own vengeance.\n\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \"I may be wrong, but I hold it to be the imperative duty of an attorney to protect the interests of his client out of court as well as in court.\"\n4\n\u00a0\n\n\n Again Mr. Buchanan said:\n\n\"I believe that I have as good a right to the exercise of my profession, as the mechanic has to follow his \n\n[350 \nU.S. 399, 407]\n\u00a0\n trade, or the merchant to engage in the pursuits of commerce. . . . The public have almost as deep an interest in the independence of the bar as of the bench.\"\n5\n\u00a0\n\n\n Such statements by the same man who reported the 1831 Act to the House of Representatives almost immediately after Judge Peck's acquittal are completely inconsistent with a purpose to treat lawyers as \"officers of the court\" subject to summary punishment. We cannot hold that lawyers are subject to the precise kind of summary contempt power that the Act was designedly drawn to bar judges from exercising. Section 2 of that Act made ample provision for punishing corrupt efforts to influence, intimidate or impede juries.\n6\n And Congress expressly provided that prosecution therefor be by indictment. Substantially the same provision has been a part of our law ever since. 18 U.S.C. 1503. See also Fed. Rules Crim. Proc. 7 (a). Of course it does not cover this case because there is no charge that petitioner attempted improperly to influence the jury or violate 1503 in any other way. Had there been such a charge petitioner would have been entitled to a trial by jury after indictment by grand jury. We hold that a lawyer is not the \n\n[350 \nU.S. 399, 408]\n\u00a0\n kind of \"officer\" who can be summarily tried for contempt under 18 U.S.C. 401 (2).\n7\n The judgment of the Court of Appeals must therefore be reversed.\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE REED concurs in the judgment solely on the ground that the circumstances leading to the enactment of this statute dictate the Court's otherwise unique reading of the term \"officers of the court.\"\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 401 in its entirety provides:\n\n\"A court of the United States shall have power to punish by fine or imprisonment, at its discretion, such contempt of its authority, and none other, as -\n\n\n\"(1) Misbehavior of any person in its presence or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice;\n\n\n\"(2) Misbehavior of any of its officers in their official transactions;\n\n\n\"(3) Disobedience or resistance to its lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] For a discussion of the 1831 Act and the narrow limits of the contempt power in general, see Frankfurter and Landis, Power of Congress over Procedure in Criminal Contempts in \"Inferior\" Federal Courts - A Study in Separation of Powers, 37 Harv.

The Court there held that an attorney could not be disbarred solely on a showing of a contempt committed before another court. The Court did use broad language there as to the power of courts to punish attorneys as officers of courts for misbehavior in the practice of the profession. The statements in Ex parte Bradley went so far as to say that lawyers became subject to the summary jurisdiction of courts \"for the commission of any other act of official or personal dishonesty and oppression.\" Id., at 374. However questionable those statements may be, they were not made, as the Court pointed out, with respect to a court's power to punish contempts. The Court was referring to the generally exercised powers of courts in that day to discipline attorneys. As said by the Court later in Ex parte Robinson, 19 Wall. 505, 512, \"The power to disbar an attorney proceeds upon very different grounds\" from those which support a court's power to punish for contempt. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 399, 409]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","12":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCITIES SERVICE GAS PRODUCING COMPANY v.

JUSTICE BURTON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis is a multiple claims action in which the District Court entered a judgment disposing of but one claim. Pursuant to Rule 54 (b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, as amended in 1946,\n1\n that court expressly determined that there was no just reason for delay and expressly directed the entry of judgment. Thereupon, an appeal was taken to the Court of Appeals, and the issue before us is whether the latter court has jurisdiction to entertain that appeal under 28 U.S.C. 1291,\n2\n although an unadjudicated counterclaim awaits disposition in the District Court. The issue is comparable to that decided in Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Mackey, ante, at 427, except that here the unadjudicated claim is a counterclaim arising in part out of the same transactions and occurrences as the adjudicated claim. By applying the reasoning used in the Sears case, we reach a like conclusion here and uphold the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals.\n\nWhile the counterclaim arises in part out of the same transactions as does the adjudicated claim, it was filed long after the principal proceeding was begun, and is in the nature of an action ancillary to the principal proceeding and bears a separate case number. Upon request of both parties, the District Court has removed the counterclaim from the trial calendar, without prejudice to either party, leaving it subject to reinstatement for trial at any time by order of the court upon its own initiative, or upon request of either party after reasonable notice. A brief review of the entire proceedings and a disclosure of its subject matter throws light on the relationship between the adjudicated claim and the counterclaim. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 445, 447]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn 1927, petitioner, The Cold Metal Process Company, an Ohio corporation, and United Engineering & Foundry Company, a Pennsylvania corporation, entered into a contract for the purpose of securing a patent in the name of Cold Metal relating to a certain type of steel rolling mill and of granting to United an exclusive license to make, use and sell mills under such patent. To that end, the parties contributed claims under their respective patent applications and it was agreed that the license should be granted when the patent was issued. The parties also agreed to try, by negotiation, to determine the amount of the payment by United for the license. If the parties could not agree on that point, the subject was to be submitted to arbitration in a manner specified in the contract.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nIn 1930, the patent was issued but Cold Metal refused to treat the 1927 contract as conferring an exclusive license on United. Cold Metal maintained that United was not a licensee until the amount due Cold Metal had been determined and paid. United, on the other hand, treated the contract as an enforceable exclusive license under which the license fee was to be determined later.\n\nAfter litigation not now material,\n4\n Cold Metal, in 1934, instituted the present proceeding, Equity No. 2991, against United in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. Cold Metal asked (1) for an injunction restraining United from prosecuting certain suits, pending in Ohio and elsewhere, founded upon United's claim of exclusive rights under the patent, and (2) for determination of the amount to be paid by United under the 1927 contract. The court declined to issue a preliminary injunction, 9 F. Supp. 994, but Cold Metal appealed from such denial and, in 1935, obtained \n\n[351 \nU.S. 445, 448]\n\u00a0\n a reversal directing the injunction to be issued, 79 F.2d 666.\n\nIn 1936, Cold Metal, in line with the foregoing results, filed a supplemental complaint asking that the 1927 contract be \"cancelled, revoked and annulled\" and that United be enjoined from further operations under the patent. However, in 1938, the District Court, after trial, held the contract valid and enforceable, and directed an accounting before a master. 83 F. Supp. 914.\n\nCold Metal appealed but, in 1939, the Court of Appeals reversed its 1935 decision and largely sustained United's position. It ordered that the injunction against United's infringement suits be dissolved and held that the 1927 contract created a valid and enforceable exclusive license in favor of United. It also stated that the master could determine, from an \"understanding\" between the parties as shown by the record, the amount due from United under the 1927 contract. 107 F.2d 27.\n\nIn 1941, United asked leave to file an amended answer and counterclaim, complaining that Cold Metal's recent acts were inconsistent with the 1939 judgment of the Court of Appeals. In 1942, the District Court denied that motion on the ground that it could carry out only the existing mandate of the Court of Appeals. 43 F. Supp. 375. It suggested, however, that the injunction sought by United in its counterclaim should be the subject matter of another action, and that United could assert, before the master, Cold Metal's breaches of the 1927 contract. In 1943, the District Court modified its 1938 decree to make it conform to the Court of Appeals' order of 1939. It also appointed a master to determine not only the amount due Cold Metal from United for its past operations, but the payments to be made on licensed mills in the future.\n\nIn 1949, United refilled its claims as an \"Ancillary Cross Complaint\" in Civil Action No. 7744. United sought, \n\n[351 \nU.S. 445, 449]\n\u00a0\n inter alia, (1) to enjoin the prosecution of infringement suits by Cold Metal against parties using mills under licenses granted by United, (2) to require Cold Metal to account for any funds it had collected for the use of such mills within the field of United's exclusive license, and (3) to set off those funds from any payment or royalty that might be due from United to Cold Metal under the 1927 contract. In 1950, the District Court dismissed the cross complaint on the ground that it was not ancillary to Equity No. 2991. 92 F. Supp. 596. However, in 1951, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court. It held that United's cross complaint was, in reality, a counterclaim, ancillary to Equity No. 2991, and, therefore, within the jurisdiction of the District Court. 190 F.2d 217. The Court of Appeals reviewed the previous course of the proceedings and pointed out that the claims now made by United in this counterclaim are entirely dependent upon the 1939 decision of that court, 107 F.2d 27, which upheld the validity of United's exclusive license.\n\nInto this situation, in 1954, came the master's report on the accounting in Equity No. 2991. It listed the licensed mills, fixed the compensation payable under the 1927 contract, and found that United's license had existed from 1930 to 1947 and that United's customers were duly licensed to use the patented mills. It also held that certain United mills were exempt from royalty, that Cold Metal had failed to respect the license or to perform all of its obligations under the 1927 contract, but that United owed Cold Metal a substantial sum under it.\n\nIn 1955, the District Court approved the master's report in all respects and entered judgment against United for $387,650, with interest at 6% from the date of filing of the report. Both parties appealed. Cold Metal at once moved to dismiss United's appeal on the ground that the District Court had not made the certification required by Rule 54 (b). With permission of the Court of Appeals, \n\n[351 \nU.S. 445, 450]\n\u00a0\n the District Court then amended its judgment to add such certification.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nAgain both parties appealed. Again Cold Metal moved to dismiss United's appeal from the amended judgment because the Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction to entertain it. This time the motion was denied with a per curiam opinion in which the Court of Appeals said \"We think the determination made under the circumstances of this case is the very kind of thing Rule 54 (b) was written to provide for. We see no violation of discretion on the part of the district judge in entering it.\" 221 F.2d 115.\n\nAccordingly, on October 3, 1955, in the Court of Appeals, the parties argued their respective appeals on their merits in Equity No. 2991. However, before any decision was rendered on the merits, we granted certiorari upon Cold Metal's petition questioning the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals to entertain the appeal. \n350 \nU.S. 819\n. We agree with the Court of Appeals that \n\n[351 \nU.S. 445, 451]\n\u00a0\n this is the very kind of case for which amended Rule 54 (b) was designed. The appealability of the adjudicated claim is upheld so that the merits of the existing judgment may be determined at this stage of the proceedings.\n\nPrior to the promulgation of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in 1939, it may well have been true that the Court of Appeals would not, at this stage, have had jurisdiction over United's appeal. Under the single judicial unit theory of finality which was then recognized, the Court of Appeals would have been without jurisdiction until United's counterclaim also had been decided by the District Court. That would have been so even if the counterclaim did not arise out of the same transaction and occurrence as Cold Metal's claim.\n6\n However, as stated in Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Mackey, ante, Rule 54 (b), in its original form, modified the judicial unit theory in respect to multiple claims actions. Accordingly, under that rule, it is likely that if United's counterclaim qualified as \"permissive,\"\n7\n rather than as \"compulsory,\"\n8\n the Court of Appeals would have had jurisdiction to entertain \n\n[351 \nU.S. 445, 452]\n\u00a0\n the appeal now before us.\n9\n This conclusion follows from the fact that the test of appealability under the original rule was whether the adjudicated claims were separate from, and independent of, the unadjudicated claims. See Reeves v. Beardall, \n316 \nU.S. 283\n.\n\nHowever, as set forth in Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Mackey, ante, that test led to uncertainty, of which the present case might have been an example.\n10\n The amended rule overcomes that difficulty and, under its terms, we need not decide whether United's counterclaim is compulsory or permissive. The amended rule, in contrast to the rule in its original form, treats counterclaims, whether compulsory or permissive, like other multiple claims. It provides that \"When more than one claim for relief is presented in an action, whether as a claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim, the [district] court may direct the entry of a final judgment upon one or more but less than all of the claims . . . .\" (Emphasis supplied.) Counterclaims and cross-claims are thus equated with the others. See Bendix Aviation Corp. v. Glass, 195 F.2d 267 (C. A. 3d Cir.). Therefore, under the amended rule, the relationship of the adjudicated claims to the unadjudicated claims is one of the factors which the District Court can consider in the exercise of its discretion. If the District Court certifies a final order on a claim which arises out of the same transaction and occurrence as pending claims, and the Court of Appeals is satisfied that there has been no abuse of discretion, the order is appealable.\n\nThe reasoning and the result in Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Mackey, ante, is dispositive of this case. The order appealed from finally adjudicates Cold Metal's claim for relief, and the Court of Appeals has held that the trial \n\n[351 \nU.S. 445, 453]\n\u00a0\n court did not abuse its discretion in certifying the absence of just reasons for delay. That this order is appealable at a time when it would not have been appealable prior to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, or under Rule 54 (b) in its original form, does not mean that Rule 54 (b), as amended, is invalid. It applies only to a final decision of one or more claims for relief. The amended rule meets the needs and problems of modern judicial administration by adjusting the unit for appeal to fit multiple claims actions, while retaining a right of judicial review over the discretion exercised by the District Court in determining when there is no just reason for delay. This does not impair the statutory concept of finality embraced in 1291, and, as held in Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Mackey, ante, is within the rulemaking power of this Court.\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n [For opinion of MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, joined by MR.

YOUNG(1956)\nNo. 442\nArgued: March 6, 1956Decided: June 11, 1956\n\n\n\n\n The Act of August 26, 1950, gave to the heads of certain departments and agencies of the Government summary suspension and unreviewable dismissal powers over their civilian employees, when deemed necessary \"in the interest of the national security,\" and its provisions were extended to \"all other departments and agencies of the Government\" by Executive Order No. 10450. Petitioner, a preference-eligible veteran under the Veterans' Preference Act, was summarily suspended from his classified civil service position as a food and drug inspector for the Department of Health, Education and Welfare on charges of close association with alleged Communists and an allegedly subversive organization. Later, he was dismissed on the ground that his continued employment was not \"clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\" His appeal to the Civil Service Commission under the Veterans' Preference Act was denied on the ground that that Act was inapplicable to such discharges. Held: His discharge was not authorized by the 1950 Act and hence it violated the Veterans' Preference Act. Pp. 538-558.\n\n 1. The 1950 Act authorizes a dismissal only upon a determination that it is \"necessary or advisable in the interest of the national security.\" Such a determination requires an evaluation of the risk to the \"national security\" that the employee's retention would create, which depends not only upon the character of the employee and the likelihood of his misconducting himself but also upon the nature of the position he occupies and its relationship to the \"national security.\" P. 542.\n\n\n 2. The 1950 Act is not the only, nor even the primary, source of authority to dismiss government employees, and the question in this case is not whether an employee can be dismissed on such grounds but only the extent to which the summary procedures authorized by the 1950 Act are available in such a case. Pp. 543-544.\n\n\n 3. This depends on the meaning of the term \"national security,\" as used in the 1950 Act. Pp. 542-544. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 536, 537]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n 4. The term \"national security\" is not defined in that Act, but it is clear from the statute as a whole that it was intended to comprehend only those activities of the Government that are directly concerned with the protection of the Nation from internal subversion or foreign aggression, and not those which contribute to the strength of the Nation only through their impact on the general welfare. Pp. 544-548.\n\n\n 5. This conclusion is supported by the legislative history of the Act. Pp. 548-551.\n\n\n 6. A condition precedent to the exercise of the dismissal authority conferred by the 1950 Act is a determination by the agency head that the position occupied is one affected with the \"national security,\" as that term is used in the Act. P. 551.\n\n\n 7. No determination was made that petitioner's position was one in which he could adversely affect the \"national security,\" as that term is used in the Act. Pp. 551-558.\n\n\n (a) Executive Order No. 10450 treats an adverse determination as to the loyalty of an employee as satisfying the statute, irrespective of the character of his job or the effect his continued employment might have upon the \"national security,\" Pp. 551-556.\n\n\n (b) The failure of the Executive Order to state explicitly what was meant is the fault of the Government, and any ambiguities should be resolved against the Government. P. 556.\n\n\n (c) From the Secretary's determination that petitioner's employment was not \"clearly consistent with the interests of national security,\" in the light of the Executive Order, it may be assumed only that the Secretary found the charges to be true and that they created reasonable doubt as to petitioner's loyalty. Pp. 556-557.\n\n\n 96 U.S. App. D.C. 379, 226 F.2d 337, reversed and remanded.\n\nDavid I. Shapiro argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief were James H. Heller and Osmond K.

Slade and Benjamin Forman. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 536, 538]\n\u00a0\n\n\nOpinion of the Court by MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, announced by MR. JUSTICE BURTON.\n\nThis case presents the question of the meaning of the term \"national security\" as used in the Act of August 26, 1950, giving to the heads of certain departments and agencies of the Government summary suspension and unreviewable dismissal powers over their civilian employees, when deemed necessary \"in the interest of the national security of the United States.\"\n1\n\u00a0\n\n[351 \nU.S. 536, 539]\n\u00a0\n\n\nPetitioner, a preference-eligible veteran under 2 of the Veterans' Preference Act of 1944, 58 Stat. 387, as amended, 5 U.S.C. 851, held a position in the classified civil service as a food and drug inspector for the New York \n\n[351 \nU.S. 536, 540]\n\u00a0\n District of the Food and Drug Administration, Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. In November 1953, he was suspended without pay from his position, pending investigation to determine whether his employment should be terminated. He was given a written statement of charges alleging that he had \"a close association with individuals reliably reported to be Communists\" and that he had maintained a \"sympathetic association\" with, had contributed funds and services to, and had attended social gatherings of an allegedly subversive organization.\n\nAlthough afforded an opportunity to do so, petitioner declined to answer the charges or to request a hearing, as he had the right to do. Thereafter, the Secretary of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, after \"a study of all the documents in [petitioner's] case,\" determined that petitioner's continued employment was not \"clearly consistent with the interests of national security\" and ordered the termination of his employment. Petitioner appealed his discharge to the Civil Service Commission, which declined to accept the appeal on the ground that the Veterans' Preference Act, under which petitioner claimed the right of appeal, was inapplicable to such discharges.\n\nPetitioner thereafter brought an action in the District Court for the District of Columbia seeking a declaratory judgment that his discharge was invalid and that the Civil Service Commission had improperly refused to entertain his appeal, and an order requiring his reinstatement in his former position. The District Court granted the respondents' motion for judgment on the pleadings and dismissed the complaint. 125 F. Supp. 284. The \n\n[351 \nU.S. 536, 541]\n\u00a0\n Court of Appeals, with one judge dissenting, affirmed. 96 U.S. App. D.C. 379, 226 F.2d 337. Because of the importance of the questions involved in the field of Government employment, we granted certiorari. \n350 \nU.S. 900\n.\n\nSection 14 of the Veterans' Preference Act, 58 Stat. 390, as amended, 5 U.S.C. 863, provides that preference eligibles may be discharged only \"for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service\" and, among other procedural rights, \"shall have the right to appeal to the Civil Service Commission,\" whose decision is made binding on the employing agency. Respondents concede that petitioner's discharge was invalid if that Act is controlling. They contend, however, as was held by the courts below, that petitioner's discharge was authorized by the Act of August 26, 1950, supra, which eliminates the right of appeal to the Civil Service Commission. Thus the sole question for decision is whether petitioner's discharge was authorized by the 1950 Act.\n\nThe 1950 Act provides in material part that, notwithstanding any other personnel laws, the head of any agency to which the Act applies\n\n\"may, in his absolute discretion and when deemed necessary in the interest of national security, suspend, without pay, any civilian officer or employee of [his agency] . . . . The agency head concerned may, following such investigation and review as he deems necessary, terminate the employment of such suspended civilian officer or employee whenever he shall determine such termination necessary or advisable in the interest of the national security of the United States, and such determination by the agency head concerned shall be conclusive and final: . . . .\"\n\n\n The Act was expressly made applicable only to the Departments of State, Commerce, Justice, Defense, Army, \n\n[351 \nU.S. 536, 542]\n\u00a0\n Navy, and Air Force, the Coast Guard, the Atomic Energy Commission, the National Security Resources Board, and the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics. Section 3 of the Act provides, however, that the Act may be extended \"to such other departments and agencies of the Government as the President may, from time to time, deem necessary in the best interests of national security,\" and the President has extended the Act under this authority \"to all other departments and agencies of the Government.\"\n2\n While the validity of this extension of the Act depends upon questions which are in many respects common to those determining the validity of the Secretary's exercise of the authority thereby extended to her,\n3\n we will restrict our consideration to the latter issue and assume, for purposes of this decision, that the Act has validly been extended to apply to the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.\n\nThe Act authorizes dismissals only upon a determination by the Secretary that the dismissal is \"necessary or advisable in the interest of the national security.\" That determination requires an evaluation of the risk of injury to the \"national security\" that the employee's retention would create, which in turn would seem necessarily to be a function, not only of the character of the employee and the likelihood of his misconducting himself, but also of the nature of the position he occupies and its relationship to the \"national security.\" That is, it must be determined whether the position is one in which the employee's misconduct would affect the \"national security.\" That, of course, would not be necessary if \"national security\" were \n\n[351 \nU.S. 536, 543]\n\u00a0\n used in the Act in a sense so broad as to be involved in all activities of the Government, for then the relationship to the \"national security\" would follow from the very fact of employment. For the reasons set forth below, however, we conclude (1) that the term \"national security\" is used in the Act in a definite and limited sense and relates only to those activities which are directly concerned with the Nation's safety, as distinguished from the general welfare; and (2) that no determination has been made that petitioner's position was affected with the \"national security,\" as that term is used in the Act. It follows that his dismissal was not authorized by the 1950 Act and hence violated the Veterans' Preference Act.\n\n\nI.\n\n\nIn interpreting the 1950 Act, it is important to note that that Act is not the only, nor even the primary, source of authority to dismiss Government employees. The general personnel laws - the Lloyd-LaFollette\n4\n and Veterans' Preference Acts\n5\n - authorize dismissals for \"such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service,\" and the ground which we conclude was the basis for petitioner's discharge here - a reasonable doubt as to his loyalty - was recognized as a \"cause\" for dismissal under those procedures as early as 1942.\n6\n Indeed, the President's so-called Loyalty Program, Exec.

Reg. 1935, which prescribed an absolute standard of loyalty to be met by all employees regardless of position, had been established pursuant to that general authority three years prior to the 1950 Act and remained in \n\n[351 \nU.S. 536, 544]\n\u00a0\n effect for nearly three years after its passage.\n7\n Thus there was no want of substantive authority to dismiss employees on loyalty grounds, and the question for decision here is not whether an employee can be dismissed on such grounds but only the extent to which the summary procedures authorized by the 1950 Act are available in such a case.\n\nAs noted above, the issue turns on the meaning of \"national security,\" as used in the Act. While that term is not defined in the Act, we think it clear from the statute as a whole that that term was intended to comprehend only those activities of the Government that are directly concerned with the protection of the Nation from internal subversion or foreign aggression, and not those which contribute to the strength of the Nation only through their impact on the general welfare.\n\nVirtually conclusive of this narrow meaning of \"national security\" is the fact that, had Congress intended the term in a sense broad enough to include all activities of the Government, it would have granted the power to terminate employment \"in the interest of the national security\" to all agencies of the Government. Instead, Congress specified 11 named agencies to which the Act should apply, the character of which reveals, without doubt, a purpose to single out those agencies which are directly concerned with the national defense and which have custody over information the compromise of which might endanger the country's security, the so-called \"sensitive\" agencies. Thus, of the 11 named agencies, 8 are concerned with military operations or weapons development, and the other 3, with international \n\n[351 \nU.S. 536, 545]\n\u00a0\n relations, internal security, and the stock-piling of strategic materials. Nor is this conclusion vitiated by the grant of authority to the President, in 3 of the Act, to extend the Act to such other agencies as he \"may, from time to time, deem necessary in the best interests of national security.\" Rather, the character of the named agencies indicates the character of the determination required to be made to effect such an extension. Aware of the difficulties of attempting an exclusive enumeration and of the undesirability of a rigid classification in the face of changing circumstances, Congress simply enumerated those agencies which it determined to be affected with the \"national security\" and authorized the President, by making a similar determination, to add any other agencies which were, or became, \"sensitive.\" That it was contemplated that this power would be exercised \"from time to time\" confirms the purpose to allow for changing circumstances and to require a selective judgment, necessarily implying that the standard to be applied is a less than all-inclusive one.\n\nThe limitation of the Act to the enumerated agencies is particularly significant in the light of the fact that Exec. Order No. 9835, establishing the Loyalty Program, was in full effect at the time of the consideration and passage of the Act. In that Order, the President had expressed his view that it was of \"vital importance\" that all employees of the Government be of \"complete and unswerving loyalty\" and had prescribed a minimum loyalty standard to be applied to all employees under the normal civil service procedures. Had Congress considered the objective of insuring the \"unswerving loyalty\" of all employees, regardless of position, as a matter of \"national security\" to be effectuated by the summary procedures authorized by the Act, rather than simply a desirable personnel policy to be implemented under the normal civil service procedures, it surely would not \n\n[351 \nU.S. 536, 546]\n\u00a0\n have limited the Act to selected agencies. Presumably, therefore, Congress meant something more by the \"interest of the national security\" than the general interest the Nation has in the loyalty of even \"non-sensitive\" employees.\n\nWe can find no justification for rejecting this implication of the limited purpose of the Act or for inferring the unlimited power contended for by the Government. Where applicable, the Act authorizes the agency head summarily to suspend an employee pending investigation and, after charges and a hearing, finally to terminate his employment, such termination not being subject to appeal. There is an obvious justification for the summary suspension power where the employee occupies a \"sensitive\" position in which he could cause serious damage to the national security during the delay incident to an investigation and the preparation of charges. Likewise, there is a reasonable basis for the view that an agency head who must bear the responsibility for the protection of classified information committed to his custody should have the final say in deciding whether to repose his trust in an employee who has access to such information. On the other hand, it is difficult to justify summary suspensions and unreviewable dismissals on loyalty grounds of employees who are not in \"sensitive\" positions and who are thus not situated where they could bring about any discernible adverse effects on the Nation's security. In the absence of an immediate threat of harm to the \"national security,\" the normal dismissal procedures seem fully adequate and the justification for summary powers disappears. Indeed, in view of the stigma attached to persons dismissed on loyalty grounds, the need for procedural safeguards seems even greater than in other cases, and we will not lightly assume that Congress intended to take away those safeguards in the absence of \n\n[351 \nU.S. 536, 547]\n\u00a0\n some overriding necessity, such as exists in the case of employees handling defense secrets.\n\nThe 1950 Act itself reflects Congress' concern for the procedural rights of employees and its desire to limit the unreviewable dismissal power to the minimum scope necessary to the purpose of protecting activities affected with the \"national security.\" A proviso to 1 of the Act provides that a dismissal by one agency under the power granted by the Act \"shall not affect the right of such officer or employee to seek or accept employment in any other department or agency of the Government,\" if the Civil Service Commission determines that the employee is eligible for such other employment. That is, the unreviewable dismissal power was to be used only for the limited purpose of removing the employee from the position in which his presence had been determined to endanger the \"national security\"; it could affect his right to employment in other agencies only if the Civil Service Commission, after review, refused to clear him for such employment. This effort to preserve the employee's procedural rights to the maximum extent possible hardly seems consistent with an intent to define the scope of the dismissal power in terms of the indefinite and virtually unlimited meaning for which the respondents contend.\n\nMoreover, if Congress intended the term to have such a broad meaning that all positions in the Government could be said to be affected with the \"national security,\" the result would be that the 1950 Act, though in form but an exception to the general personnel laws, could be utilized effectively to supersede those laws. For why could it not be said that national security in that sense requires not merely loyal and trustworthy employees but also those that are industrious and efficient? The relationship of the job to the national security being the same, its demonstrated inadequate performance because \n\n[351 \nU.S. 536, 548]\n\u00a0\n of inefficiency or incompetence would seem to present a surer threat to national security, in the sense of the general welfare, than a mere doubt as to the employee's loyalty.\n\nFinally, the conclusion we draw from the face of the Act that \"national security\" was used in a limited and definite sense is amply supported by the legislative history of the Act.\n\nIn the first place, it was constantly emphasized that the bill, first introduced as S. 1561 in the 80th Congress and passed as H. R. 7439 in the 81st Congress, was intended to apply, or to be extended, only to \"sensitive\" agencies, a term used to imply a close and immediate concern with the defense of the Nation.\n8\n Thus the Senate Committee on Armed Services, in reporting out S. 1561, stated:\n\n \"This bill provides authority to terminate employment of indiscreet or disloyal employees who are employed in areas of the Government which are sensitive from the standpoint of national security.\n\n\n .   .  .  .   .\n\n\n \"[Section 3 will permit] the President to determine additional sensitive areas and include such \n\n[351 \nU.S. 536, 549]\n\u00a0\n areas in the scope of the authorities contained in this bill.\n\n\n .  .   .  .  .\n\n\n \"Insofar as the [addition of 3] is concerned, it was recognized by all witnesses that there were other sensitive areas within the various departments of the Government which are now, or might in the future become, deeply involved in national security. . . . In view . . . of the fact that there are now and will be in the future other sensitive areas of equal importance to the national security, it is believed that the President should have authority to make a finding concerning such areas and by Executive action place those areas under the authorities contained in this act.\"\n9\n\u00a0\n\n\n The House Committee on Post Office and Civil Service reported that \"The provisions of the bill extend only to departments and agencies which are concerned with vital matters affecting the national security of our Nation.\"\n10\n The committee reports on H. R. 7439 in the next Congress similarly referred to the bill as granting the dismissal power only to the heads of the \"sensitive\" agencies.\n11\n While these references relate primarily to the agencies to be covered by the Act, rather than to the exercise of the power within an agency, the standard for both is the same - in the \"interests of the national security\" - and the statements thus clearly indicate the restricted sense in which \"national security\" was used. In short, \"national security\" is affected only by \"sensitive\" activities. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 536, 550]\n\u00a0\n\n\nSecondly, the history makes clear that the Act was intended to authorize the suspension and dismissal only of persons in sensitive positions. Throughout the hearings, committee reports, and debates, the bill was described as being designed to provide for the dismissal of \"security risks.\"\n12\n In turn, the examples given of what might be a \"security risk\" always entailed employees having access to classified materials; they were security risks because of the risk they posed of intentional or inadvertent disclosure of confidential information.\n13\n Mr. Larkin, a representative of the Department of Defense, which Department had requested and drafted the bill, made this consideration more explicit:\n\n \"They are security risks because of their access to confidential and classified material. . . . But if they do not have classified material, why, there is no notion that they are security risks to the United States. They are security risks to the extent of having access to classified material.\"\n14\n\u00a0\n\n\n \"A person is accused of being disloyal, but is cleared by the loyalty board, because there is not \n\n[351 \nU.S. 536, 551]\n\u00a0\n enough evidence against him. If that person is not in a sensitive job, it is not of any further concern to us. We are willing to take the view, that while we might have misgivings about his loyalty, he cannot prejudice our security because he does not have access to any of the classified or top secret material.\"\n15\n\u00a0\n\n\n It is clear, therefore, both from the face of the Act and the legislative history, that \"national security\" was not used in the Act in an all-inclusive sense, but was intended to refer only to the protection of \"sensitive\" activities. It follows that an employee can be dismissed \"in the interest of the national security\" under the Act only if he occupies a \"sensitive\" position, and thus that a condition precedent to the exercise of the dismissal authority is a determination by the agency head that the position occupied is one affected with the \"national security.\" We now turn to an examination of the Secretary's action to show that no such determination was made as to the position occupied by petitioner.\n\n\nII.\n\n\nThe Secretary's action in dismissing the petitioner was expressly taken pursuant to Exec. Order No. 10450, 18 Fed. Reg. 2489,\n16\n promulgated in April 1953 to provide uniform standards and procedures for the exercise by agency heads of the suspension and dismissal powers under the 1950 Act. That Order prescribes as the standard for dismissal, and the dismissal notice given to petitioner contained, a determination by the Secretary that the employee's retention in employment \"is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\"\n17\n\u00a0\n\n[351 \nU.S. 536, 552]\n\u00a0\n Despite this verbal formula, however, it is our view that the Executive Order does not in fact require the agency head to make any determination whatever on the relationship of the employee's retention to the \"national security\" if the charges against him are within the categories of the charges against petitioner - that is, charges which reflect on the employee's loyalty. Rather, as we read the Order, it enjoins upon the agency heads the duty of discharging any employee of doubtful loyalty, irrespective of the character of his job and its relationship to the \"national security.\" That is, the Executive Order deems an adverse determination as to loyalty to satisfy the requirements of the statute without more.\n\nThe opening preamble to the Order recites, among other things, that \"the interests of the national security require\" that \"all\" Government employees be persons \"of complete and unswerving loyalty.\" It would seem to follow that an employee's retention cannot be \"clearly consistent\" with the \"interests of the national security\" as thus defined unless he is \"clearly\" loyal - that is, unless there is no doubt as to his loyalty. And 8 (a) indicates that that is in fact what was intended by the Order. That section provides that the investigation of an employee pursuant to the Order shall be designed to develop information \"as to whether . . . [his employment] is \n\n[351 \nU.S. 536, 553]\n\u00a0\n clearly consistent with the interests of the national security,\" and prescribes certain categories of facts to which \"such\" information shall relate. The first category, 8 (a) (1), includes non loyalty-oriented facts which, in general, might reflect upon the employee's reliability, trustworthiness, or susceptibility to coercion, such as dishonesty, drunkenness, sexual perversion, mental defects, or other reasons to believe that he is subject to influence or coercion. Section 8 (a) (1) expressly provides, however that such facts are relevant only \"depending on the relation of the Government employment to the national security.\" The remaining categories include facts which, in general, reflect upon the employee's \"loyalty,\" such as acts of espionage, advocacy of violent overthrow of the Government, sympathetic association with persons who so advocate, or sympathetic association with subversive organizations. 8 (a) (2)-(8). Significantly, there is wholly absent from these categories - under which the charges against petitioner were expressly framed - any qualification making their relevance dependent upon the relationship of the employee's position to the national security. The inference we draw is that in such cases the relationship to the national security is irrelevant, and that an adverse \"loyalty\" determination is sufficient ex proprio vigore to require discharge.\n\nArguably, this inference can be avoided on the ground that 8 (a) relates only to the scope of information to be developed in the investigation and not to the evaluation of it by the agency head. That is, while loyalty information is to be developed in all cases regardless of the nature of the employment, that does not mean that the agency head should not consider the nature of the employment in determining whether the derogatory information is sufficient to make the employee's continued employment not \"clearly consistent\" with the \"national security.\" No doubt that is true to the extent \n\n[351 \nU.S. 536, 554]\n\u00a0\n that the greater the sensitivity of the position the smaller may be the doubts that would justify termination; the Order undoubtedly leaves it open to an agency head to apply a stricter standard in some cases than in others, depending on the nature of the employment. On the other hand, by making loyalty information relevant in all cases, regardless of the nature of the job, 8 (a) seems strongly to imply that there is a minimum standard of loyalty that must be met by all employees. It would follow that the agency head may terminate employment in cases where that minimum standard is not met without making any independent determination of the potential impact of the person's employment on the national security.\n\nOther provisions of the Order confirm the inferences that may be drawn from 8 (a). Thus 3 (b) directs each agency head to designate as \"sensitive\" those positions in his agency \"the occupant of which could bring about, by virtue of the nature of the position, a material adverse effect on the national security.\" By definition, therefore, some employees are admittedly not in a position to bring about such an effect. Nevertheless, the Order makes this distinction relevant only for purposes of determining the scope of the investigation to be conducted, not for purposes of limiting the dismissal power to such \"sensitive\" positions. Section 3 (a) is more explicit. That provides that the appointment of all employees shall be made subject to an investigation the scope of which shall depend upon the degree of adverse effect on the national security the occupant of the position could bring about, but which \"in no event\" is to be less than a prescribed minimum. But the sole purpose of such an investigation is to provide a basis for a \"clearly consistent\" determination. Thus the requirement of a minimum investigation of all persons appointed implies \n\n[351 \nU.S. 536, 555]\n\u00a0\n that an adverse \"clearly consistent\" determination may be made as to any such employee, regardless of the potential adverse effect he could cause to the national security. Finally, the second \"Whereas\" clause of the preamble recites as a justification for the Order that \"all persons . . . privileged to be employed . . . [by the Government should] be adjudged by mutually consistent and no less than minimum standards,\" thus implying that the Order prescribes minimum standards that all employees must meet irrespective of the character of the positions held, one of which is the \"complete and unswerving loyalty\" standard recited in the first \"Whereas\" clause of the preamble.\n\nConfirmation of this reading of the Order is found in its history. Exec. Order No. 9835, supra, as amended by Exec. Order No. 10241, 16 Fed. Reg. 3690, had established the Loyalty Program under which all employees, regardless of their position, were made subject to discharge if there was a \"reasonable doubt\" as to their loyalty. That Order was expressly revoked by 12 of the present Executive Order. There is no indication, however, that it was intended thereby to limit the scope of the persons subject to a loyalty standard. And any such implication is negatived by the remarkable similarity in the preambles to the two Orders and in the kinds of information considered to be relevant to the ultimate determinations.\n18\n In short, all employees were still to be subject to at least a minimum loyalty standard, though under \n\n[351 \nU.S. 536, 556]\n\u00a0\n new procedures which do not afford a right to appeal to the Civil Service Commission.\n\nWe therefore interpret the Executive Order as meaning that, when \"loyalty\" charges are involved, an employee may be dismissed regardless of the character of his position in the Government service, and that the agency head need make no evaluation as to the effect which continuance of his employment might have upon the \"national security.\" We recognize that this interpretation of the Order rests upon a chain of inferences drawn from less than explicit provisions. But the Order was promulgated to guide the agency heads in the exercise of the dismissal power, and its failure to state explicitly what determinations are required leaves no choice to the agency heads but to follow the most reasonable inferences to be drawn. Moreover, whatever the practical reasons that may have dictated the awkward form of the Order, its failure to state explicitly what was meant is the fault of the Government. Any ambiguities should therefore be resolved against the Government, and we will not burden the employee with the assumption that an agency head, in stating no more than the formal conclusion that retention of the employee is not \"clearly consistent with the interests of national security,\" has made any subsidiary determinations not clearly required by the Executive Order.\n\nFrom the Secretary's determination that petitioner's employment was not \"clearly consistent with the interests of national security,\" therefore, it may be assumed only that the Secretary found the charges to be true and that they created a reasonable doubt as to petitioner's loyalty. No other subsidiary finding may be inferred, however, for, under the Executive Order as we have interpreted it, no \n\n[351 \nU.S. 536, 557]\n\u00a0\n other finding was required to support the Secretary's action.\n19\n\u00a0\n\nFrom our holdings (1) that not all positions in the Government are affected with the \"national security\" as that term is used in the 1950 Act, and (2) that no determination has been made that petitioner's position was one in which he could adversely affect the \"national security,\" it necessarily follows that petitioner's discharge was not authorized by the 1950 Act. In reaching this conclusion, we are not confronted with the problem of reviewing the Secretary's exercise of discretion, since the basis for our decision is simply that the standard prescribed by the Executive Order and applied by the Secretary is not in conformity with the Act.\n20\n Since petitioner's discharge \n\n[351 \nU.S. 536, 558]\n\u00a0\n was not authorized by the 1950 Act and hence violated the Veterans' Preference Act, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n    Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n [For dissenting opinion of MR.

(a) The appointment of each civilian officer or employee in any department or agency of the Government shall be made subject to investigation. The scope of the investigation shall be determined in the first instance according to the degree of adverse effect the occupant of the position sought to be filled could bring about, by virtue of the nature of the position, on the national security, but in no event shall the investigation include less than a national agency check (including a check of the fingerprint files of the Federal Bureau of Investigation), and written inquiries to appropriate local law-enforcement agencies, former employers and supervisors, references, and schools attended by the person under investigation: Provided, that upon request of the head of the department or agency concerned, the Civil Service Commission may, in its discretion, authorize such less \n\n[351 \nU.S. 536, 560]\n\u00a0\n investigation as may meet the requirements of the national security with respect to per-diem, intermittent, temporary, or seasonal employees, or aliens employed outside the United States. Should there develop at any stage of investigation information indicating that the employment of any such person may not be clearly consistent with the interests of the national security, there shall be conducted with respect to such person a full field investigation, or such less investigation as shall be sufficient to enable the head of the department or agency concerned to determine whether retention of such person is clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\n\n(b) The head of any department or agency shall designate, or cause to be designated, any position within his department or agency the occupant of which could bring about, by virtue of the nature of the position, a material adverse effect on the national security as a sensitive position.

Whenever there is developed or received by any department or agency information indicating that the retention in employment of any officer or employee of the Government may not be clearly consistent with the interests of the national security, such information shall be forwarded to the head of the employing department or agency or his representative, who, after such investigation as may be appropriate, shall review, or cause to be reviewed, and, where necessary, re-adjudicate, or cause to be re-adjudicated, in accordance with the said act of August 26, 1950, the case of such officer or employee.\n\nSEC. 6. Should there develop at any stage of investigation information indicating that the employment of any officer or employee of the Government may not be clearly consistent with the interests of the national security, the head of the department or agency concerned or his representative shall immediately suspend the employment of the person involved if he deems such suspension necessary in the interests of the national security and, following such investigation and review as he deems necessary, the head of the department or agency concerned shall terminate the employment of such suspended officer or employee whenever he shall determine such termination necessary or advisable in the interests of the national security, in accordance with the said act of August 26, 1950.\n\nSEC. 7.

At various times since 1942, similar summary dismissal statutes, of limited duration, had been enacted, but these had been limited to the obviously \"sensitive\" military departments, 56 Stat. 1053, 63 Stat. 1023, and the State Department, 60 Stat. 458. The 1950 Act, introduced at the request of the Department of Defense, was designed to make the authority permanent, include several other \"sensitive\" agencies, and afford greater flexibility by permitting the President to extend the Act to other agencies which became \"sensitive.\" H.

He is, by his conduct, a bad security risk and should be discharged.\" 96 Cong. Rec. 10017.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] Hearings, House Committee on Post Office and Civil Service, on H. R. 7439, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., p. 67.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] Id., at p. 72.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] The relevant portions of the Executive Order, as it stood at the time of petitioner's suspension and discharge, are printed in the Appendix, post, p. 558.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] Section 6 of the Order, which formally prescribes the standards for \"termination,\" in terms adopts the very language of the statute, \"necessary or advisable in the interests of the national security.\" Section 7, however, provides that a suspended employee \"shall not be reinstated\" unless the agency head determines that reinstatement is \"clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\" Since nonreinstatement of a suspended employee is equivalent to the termination of his employment, it is apparent that the \"clearly consistent\" standard of 7 is the controlling one. See also 2, 8, and 3 (a). In the view we take of the case, we need not determine whether the \"clearly consistent\" standard is, as petitioner contends, a more onerous one than the \"necessary or advisable\" standard.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] Executive Order No. 9835 recited that it was \"of vital importance\" that all employees be of \"complete and unswerving loyalty\"; Exec. Order No. 10450 recites that \"the interests of the national security require\" that all employees be of \"complete and unswerving loyalty.\" Executive Order No. 9835 listed six factors to be considered \"in connection with the determination of disloyalty\" (Pt. V, 2); these are repeated in substantially identical form in 8 (a) (2), \n\n[351 \nU.S. 536, 556]\n\u00a0\n (4), (5), (6), and (7) of Exec. Order No. 10450 as \"information as to whether . . . [the employee's retention] is clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 19\n] That the Secretary similarly interpreted the Executive Order and did not in fact determine that petitioner's job was a \"sensitive\" one is confirmed by the respondents' concession that petitioner \"did not have access to Government secrets or classified material and was not in a position to influence policy against the interests of the Government.\" Respondents' Brief, pp. 3-4; Record, p. 40.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 20\n] No contention is made that the Executive Order might be sustained under the President's executive power even though in violation of the Veterans' Preference Act. There is no basis for such an argument in any event, for it is clear from the face of the Executive Order that the President did not intend to override statutory limitations on the dismissal of employees, and promulgated the Order solely as an implementation of the 1950 Act. Thus 6 of the Order purports to authorize dismissals only \"in accordance with the said Act of August 26, 1950,\" and similar references are made in 4, 5, and 7. This explicit limitation in the substantive provisions of the Order is of course not weakened by the inclusion of the \"Constitution,\" as well as the 1950 and other Acts, in the omnibus list of authorities recited in the Preamble to the Order; it is from the Constitution that the President derives any authority to implement the 1950 Act at all. When the President expressly confines his action to the limits of statutory authority, the validity of the action must be determined solely by the congressional limitations which the President sought to respect, whatever might be the result were the President ever to assert his independent power against that of Congress.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] After the date of petitioner's discharge, this paragraph was amended, by Exec. Order No. 10548, Aug. 2, 1954, 19 Fed. Reg. 4871, to read: \"(iv) Any illness, including any mental condition, of a nature which in the opinion of competent medical authority may cause significant defect in the judgment or reliability of the employee, with due regard to the transient or continuing effect of the illness and the medical findings in such case.\"\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK, with whom MR. JUSTICE REED and MR. JUSTICE MINTON join, dissenting.\n\nBelieving that the Court should not strike down the President's Executive Order on employee security by an interpretation that admittedly \"rests upon a chain of inferences,\" we cannot agree to the judgment of reversal. In our opinion, the clear purpose of the Congress in enacting the Summary Suspension Act, 64 Stat. 476, is frustrated, and the Court's opinion raises a serious question of presidential power under Article II of the Constitution which it leaves entirely undecided.\n\nPetitioner, a food and drug inspector employed in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, was charged with having \"established and . . . continued a close association with individuals reliably reported to be Communists.\" It was further charged that he had \"maintained a continued and sympathetic association with the Nature Friends of America, which organization\" is on the Attorney General's list; and \"by [his] own admission, donated funds\" to that group, contributed services to it and attended social gatherings of the same. Petitioner did not answer the charges but replied that they constituted an invasion of his private rights of association. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 536, 566]\n\u00a0\n Although advised that he could have a hearing, he requested none, and was thereafter dismissed. The Secretary made a formal determination that petitioner's continued employment was not \"clearly consistent with the interests of the national security,\" a determination entrusted to her by the Suspension Act. Although \"such determination by the agency head concerned shall be conclusive and final\" under the Act, the Court, by its interpretation, finds \"that not all positions in the Government are affected with the `national security' as that term is used . . . and that no determination has been made that petitioner's position was one in which he could adversely affect the `national security.'\" It, therefore, strikes down the President's Executive Order because \"the standard prescribed by [it] and applied by the Secretary is not in conformity with the Act.\" This compels the restoration of the petitioner to Government service. We cannot agree.\n\nWe have read the Act over and over again, but find no ground on which to infer such an interpretation. It flies directly in the face of the language of the Act and the legislative history. The plain words of 1 make the Act applicable to \"any civilian officer or employee,\" not, as the majority would have it, \"any civilian officer or employee in a sensitive position.\" The Court would require not only a finding that a particular person is subversive, but also that he occupies a sensitive job. Obviously this might leave the Government honeycombed with subversive employees.\n\nAlthough the Court assumes the validity of the President's action under 3 extending the coverage of the Act to all Government agencies, the reasoning of the opinion makes that extension a fortiori unauthorized. The limitation the Court imposes deprives the extension of any force, despite the fact that 3 has no limiting words whatever. And this is done in the face of legislative history \n\n[351 \nU.S. 536, 567]\n\u00a0\n showing that Congress clearly contemplated that the coverage might be extended without limitation \"to such other departments and agencies of the Government\" that the President thought advisable. Senator Byrd commented, \"Section 3 gives the President the right to classify every agency as a sensitive agency . . . . He could take the whole Government.\" And Senator Chapman remarked, \"I do not see why the whole Government is not sensitive as far as that is concerned.\" Hearings before the Senate Committee on Armed Services, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., on H. R. 7439, pp. 15-16. Also, Congressman Holifield, during debates in the House, stated that the Act \"applies potentially to every executive agency, not only the sensitive ones . . . . There is no distinction made in the bill between so-called sensitive employees, that is, employees who have access to confidential and secret information, and the regular employees.\" 96 Cong. Rec. 10023-10024.\n\nThe President believed that the national security required the extension of the coverage of the Act to all employees. That was his judgment, not ours. He was given that power, not us. By this action the Court so interprets the Act as to intrude itself into presidential policy making. The Court should not do this, especially where Congress has ratified the President's action. As required by the Act, the Executive Order was reported to the Congress and soon thereafter it came up for discussion and action in both the House and the Senate. It was the sense of the Congress at that time that the Order properly carried out the standards of the Act and was in all respects an expression of the congressional will. 99 Cong. Rec. 4511-4543, 5818-5990. In addition, Congress has made appropriations each subsequent year for investigations, etc., under its provisions. This in itself \"stands as confirmation and ratification of the action of the Chief \n\n[351 \nU.S. 536, 568]\n\u00a0\n Executive.\" Fleming v. Mohawk Wrecking & Lumber Co., \n331 \nU.S. 111, 116\n.\n\nThe President having extended the coverage of the Act to the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, it became the duty of the Secretary to dismiss any employee whenever she deemed it \"necessary or advisable in the interests of national security.\" She made such a finding. It is implicit in her order of dismissal. Her \"evaluation as to the effect which continuance of [petitioner's] employment might have upon the `national security'\" has been made. She decided that he should be dismissed. Under the Act this determination is \"conclusive and final.\"\n\nThere is still another reason why we should sustain the President's Executive Order. By striking it down, the Court raises a question as to the constitutional power of the President to authorize dismissal of executive employees whose further employment he believes to be inconsistent with national security. This power might arise from the grant of executive power in Article II of the Constitution, and not from the Congress. The opinion of the majority avoids this important point which must be faced by any decision holding an Executive Order inoperative.\n*\n It is the policy of the Court to avoid constitutional \n\n[351 \nU.S. 536, 569]\n\u00a0\n question where possible, Peters v. Hobby, \n349 \nU.S. 331, 338\n, not to create them.\n\nWe believe the Court's order has stricken down the most effective weapon against subversive activity available to the Government. It is not realistic to say that the Government can be protected merely by applying the Act to sensitive jobs. One never knows just which job is sensitive. The janitor might prove to be in as important a spot security-wise as the top employee in the building. The Congress decided that the most effective way to protect the Government was through the procedures laid down in the Act. The President implemented its purposes by requiring that Government employment be \"clearly consistent\" with the national security. The President's standard is \"complete and unswerving loyalty\" not only in sensitive places but throughout the Government. The President requires, and every employee should give, no less. This is all that the Act and the Order require. They should not be subverted by the technical interpretation the majority places on them today. We would affirm.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] The majority excuses its failure to pass on this question by saying that no contention was made that the President's Order might be sustained under his executive powers. We cannot agree. The Government specifically asserted that \"if Congress had meant to prohibit the President from acting in this respect under [the Act] a serious question as to the validity of that enactment would arise.\" It devoted eight pages of its brief to this point. Furthermore, the Court of Appeals noted that if it \"thought the President's Order inconsistent with the act . . . [it] would have to decide the constitutional question thus presented.\" 96 U.S. App. D.C. 379, 382, 226 F.2d 337, 340. As further justification, the majority contends that the President acted here only under the directions of the Act. In answer, we need quote only the enacting clause of the President's \n\n[351 \nU.S. 536, 569]\n\u00a0\n Order: \"Now, therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and statutes of the United States . . . and as President of the United States.\" Executive Order No. 10450, 18 Fed. Reg. 2489. In issuing the Order, the President invoked all of his powers, and since his Order is voided by the majority as not being in conformity with the Act, the question of the scope of his other constitutional or statutory powers is presented. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 536, 570]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","15":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOLLINS v.

He was a resident of California and was covered by the California Workmen's Compensation Act. The bus line operated exclusively in interstate commerce and was not insured in Arizona.

Franks argued the cause and filed a brief for the Industrial Commission of Arizona, respondent.\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nAdolphus Henry Collins was killed in an accident near Ehrenburg, Arizona, on September 30, 1953. The accident resulted from the blowout of a tire on an American Buslines' vehicle which Collins was driving on a regular run from Phoenix to Los Angeles. Collins had been employed as a bus driver for American since 1944. He had done his driving on various routes in the Southwest, and from 1952 until the time of his death he was regularly employed on the Los Angeles to Phoenix and return route. He and his wife and minor child - the petitioners in this proceeding - made their home in Los Angeles, California, \n\n[350 \nU.S. 528, 529]\n\u00a0\n in which State Collins was covered by workmen's compensation.\n\nPetitioners applied on October 14, 1953, to the Industrial Commission of Arizona for compensation in accordance with the terms of the Arizona Workmen's Compensation Act. In an award dated November 30, 1953, that agency made, inter alia, the following findings:\n\n  \"That the defendant employer maintained workmen's  compensation coverage in the State of California  and that payroll premium on the said Adolphus  Henry Collins was reported to the State of California.  That no reporting of such was made at any time to  the Industrial Commission of Arizona.\n\n\n  \"That the said Adolphus Henry Collins, at the  time of his death, was not regularly employed in  the State of Arizona as said term has been defined by  the Supreme Court of Arizona in the case of Industrial  Commission vs. Watson Brothers Transportation  Company, [75 Ariz. 357, 256 P.2d 730].\"\n*\n\u00a0\n\n\n  \"That the Industrial Commission of Arizona does  not have jurisdiction in the premises, and that  said . . . claim on file herein should be denied for  lack of jurisdiction.\"\n\n\n On certiorari to the Supreme Court of Arizona, the construction of the Arizona statute on which the Commission based its award was rejected, but its disposition of petitioners' claim was affirmed. After concluding that American Buslines \"operated exclusively in interstate \n\n[350 \nU.S. 528, 530]\n\u00a0\n commerce,\" the court held that the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution precluded recovery under the Arizona Workmen's Compensation Act because Collins was covered by the California statute, and to require his interstate employer to insure also in Arizona would place an undue burden on interstate commerce. 79 Ariz. 220, 286 P.2d 214. We granted certiorari because of the important federal question thus presented. \n350 \nU.S. 931\n.\n\nThe only respondent here is the Arizona Industrial Commission. It is not at all clear from the record before us what the interest of the state agency is in this litigation. If the employer were actively before the Court, it could claim, we assume, that an award in the circumstances of the present case burdens the interstate commerce in that the consequences of such an award would be to require it in the future to obtain insurance sufficiently comprehensive to cover potential awards in the various States through which it passes. The apparent interest of the Commission is different, namely, that as a result of an award in this case, interstate carriers will seek insurance from a single private insurance carrier capable of giving coverage in all States through which they run. The desire by interstate carriers for such insurance will cause a defection from the state compensation fund, and it is this potential defection which leads to the Commission's claim that the Arizona Act cannot be applicable in an interstate situation. But this asserted burden upon interstate commerce - the disadvantageous effect upon the state compensation fund - is too intangible and elusive to be deemed a constitutionally disallowable burden.\n\nWe have been advised, however, that American Buslines has been a non-participating defendant throughout this litigation; that it is in receivership in Nebraska; that an order has been issued by the Nebraska court barring \n\n[350 \nU.S. 528, 531]\n\u00a0\n claims against it except in that court; and that petitioners' claim is against the state compensation fund, administered by the Industrial Commission, which will in a separate proceeding be put to such recourse as it may have against American Buslines. This is not controverted. The Commission, therefore, appears to have an immediate interest of the same character and extent that American Buslines would have were it here. Thus, the Commission can invoke the employer's claim under the Commerce Clause. But that claim - of an increased insurance burden imposed as a practical matter upon an interstate carrier - while perhaps less tenuous than the defection argument directly pertinent to the Commission's case, is hardly more substantial. Whatever dollars-and-cents burden an eventual judgment for claimants in the position of petitioners may cast either upon a carrier or the State's fund is insufficient, compared with the interest of the State in affording remedies for injuries committed within its boundaries, see Carroll v. Lanza, \n349 \nU.S. 408\n, to dislodge state power. The State's power is not dislodged so long as the Federal Government has not taken over the field of remedies for injuries of employees on interstate buses as it has done in the case of employees of interstate railroad carriers. New York Central R. Co. v. Winfield, \n244 \nU.S. 147\n.\n\nThe court below and the Commission here rely on Southern Pacific Co. v. Arizona, \n325 \nU.S. 761\n. It is too slender a reed. Two less similar situations, in which shelter from an exercise of state power is sought under the Commerce Clause, would be difficult to find than that presented by the circumstances of this case, compared with the circumstances of the Southern Pacific case.\n\nThe judgment of the Supreme Court of Arizona is reversed, and the case is remanded to that court for further proceedings.\n\n    Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Section 56-928 of the Arizona Code Annotated, 1939 (Cum.

The options were nontransferable and were contingent upon continued employment. After some time had elapsed and the value of the shares had increased, the employee exercised the options and purchased the stock at less than the then current market price. For some of the shares, he gave the employer a promissory note for the option price; but the shares were not delivered until the notes were paid in cash, when the value of the shares had increased. Held: Under the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, as amended, the resulting gain to the employee was taxable as income received at the time he exercised the option and purchased the stock, and his taxable gain should be measured as of the time when the options were exercised and not as of the time when they were granted. Pp. 244-250.\n\n (a) In defining \"gross income\" as broadly as it did in 22 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, as amended, Congress intended to tax all gains except those specifically exempted.

JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis case involves the federal income tax liability of respondent LoBue for the years 1946 and 1947. From 1941 to 1947 LoBue was manager of the New York Sales Division of the Michigan Chemical Corporation, a producer and distributor of chemical supplies. In 1944 the company adopted a stock option plan making 10,000 shares of its common stock available for distribution to key employees at $5 per share over a 3-year period. LoBue and a number of other employees were notified that they had been tentatively chosen to be recipients of nontransferable stock options contingent upon their continued employment. LoBue's notice told him: \"You may be assigned a greater or less amount of stock based entirely upon your individual results and that of the entire organization.\" About 6 months later he was notified that he had been definitely awarded an option to buy 150 shares of stock in recognition of his \"contribution and efforts in making the operation of the Company successful.\" As to future allotments he was told \"It is up to you to justify your participation in the plan during the next two years.\" \n\n[351 \nU.S. 243, 245]\n\u00a0\n\n\nLoBue's work was so satisfactory that the company in the course of 3 years delivered to him 3 stock options covering 340 shares. He exercised all these $5 per share options in 1946 and in 1947,\n1\n paying the company only $1,700 for stock having a market value when delivered of $9,930. Thus, at the end of these transactions, LoBue's employer was worth $8,230 less to its stockholders and LoBue was worth $8,230 more than before.\n2\n The company deducted this sum as an expense in its 1946 and 1947 tax returns but LoBue did not report any part of it as income. Viewing the gain to LoBue as compensation for personal services the Commissioner levied a deficiency assessment against him, relying on 22 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, 53 Stat. 9, as amended, 53 Stat. 574, which defines gross income as including \"gains, profits, and income derived from . . . compensation for personal service . . . of whatever kind and in whatever form paid . . . .\"\n\nLoBue petitioned the Tax Court to redetermine the deficiency, urging that \"The said options were not intended by the Corporation or the petitioner to constitute additional compensation but were granted to permit the petitioner to acquire a proprietary interest in the Corporation and to provide him with the interest in the successful operation of the Corporation deriving from an ownership interest.\" The Tax Court held that LoBue had a taxable gain if the options were intended as compensation but not if the options were designed to provide him with \"a proprietary interest in the business.\" Finding after hearings \n\n[351 \nU.S. 243, 246]\n\u00a0\n that the options were granted to give LoBue \"a proprietary interest in the corporation, and not as compensation for services\" the Tax Court held for LoBue. 22 T. C. 440, 443. Relying on this finding the Court of Appeals affirmed, saying: \"This was a factual issue which it was the peculiar responsibility of the Tax Court to resolve. From our examination of the evidence we cannot say that its finding was clearly erroneous.\" 223 F.2d 367, 371. Disputes over the taxability of stock option transactions such as this are longstanding.\n3\n We granted certiorari to consider whether the Tax Court and the Court of Appeals had given 22 (a) too narrow an interpretation. \n350 \nU.S. 893\n.\n\nWe have repeatedly held that in defining \"gross income\" as broadly as it did in 22 (a) Congress intended to \"tax all gains except those specifically exempted.\" See, e. g., Commissioner v. Glenshaw Glass Co., \n348 \nU.S. 426, 429\n-430. The only exemption Congress provided from this very comprehensive definition of taxable income that could possibly have application here is the gift exemption of 22 (b) (3). But there was not the slightest indication of the kind of detached and disinterested generosity which might evidence a \"gift\" in the statutory sense. These transfers of stock bore none of the earmarks of a gift. They were made by a company engaged in operating a business for profit, and the Tax Court found that the stock option plan was designed to achieve more profitable operations by providing the employees \"with an incentive to promote the growth of the company by permitting them to participate in its success.\" 22 T. C., at 445. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 243, 247]\n\u00a0\n Under these circumstances the Tax Court and the Court of Appeals properly refrained from treating this transfer as a gift. The company was not giving something away for nothing.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nSince the employer's transfer of stock to its employee LoBue for much less than the stock's value was not a gift, it seems impossible to say that it was not compensation. The Tax Court held there was no taxable income, however, on the ground that one purpose of the employer was to confer a \"proprietary interest.\"\n5\n But there is not a word in 22 (a) which indicates that its broad coverage should be narrowed because of an employer's intention to enlist more efficient service from his employees by making them part proprietors of his business. In our view there is no statutory basis for the test established by the courts below. When assets are transferred by an employer to an employee to secure better services they are plainly compensation. It makes no difference that the compensation is paid in stock rather than in money. Section 22 (a) taxes income derived from compensation \"in whatever form paid.\" And in another stock option case we said that 22 (a) \"is broad enough to include in taxable income any economic or financial benefit conferred on the employee as compensation, whatever the form or mode by which it is effected.\" Commissioner v. Smith, \n324 \nU.S. 177, 181\n. LoBue received a very substantial economic and financial benefit from his employer prompted by the employer's desire to get better work from him. This is \"compensation for personal service\" within the meaning of 22 (a). \n\n[351 \nU.S. 243, 248]\n\u00a0\n\n\nLoBue nonetheless argues that we should treat this transaction as a mere purchase of a proprietary interest on which no taxable gain was \"realized\" in the year of purchase. It is true that our taxing system has ordinarily treated an arm's length purchase of property even at a bargain price as giving rise to no taxable gain in the year of purchase. See Palmer v. Commissioner, \n302 \nU.S. 63, 69\n. But that is not to say that when a transfer which is in reality compensation is given the form of a purchase the Government cannot tax the gain under 22 (a). The transaction here was unlike a mere purchase. It was not an arm's length transaction between strangers. Instead it was an arrangement by which an employer transferred valuable property to his employees in recognition of their services. We hold that LoBue realized taxable gain when he purchased the stock.\n6\n\u00a0\n\nA question remains as to the time when the gain on the shares should be measured. LoBue gave his employer promissory notes for the option price of the first 300 shares but the shares were not delivered until the notes were paid in cash.\n7\n The market value of the shares was lower when the notes were given than when the cash was paid. The Commissioner measured the taxable gain by the market value of the shares when the cash was paid. LoBue contends that this was wrong, and that the gain \n\n[351 \nU.S. 243, 249]\n\u00a0\n should be measured either when the options were granted or when the notes were given.\n\nIt is of course possible for the recipient of a stock option to realize an immediate taxable gain. See Commissioner v. Smith, \n324 \nU.S. 177, 181\n-182. The option might have a readily ascertainable market value and the recipient might be free to sell his option. But this is not such a case. These three options were not transferable\n8\n and LoBue's right to buy stock under them was contingent upon his remaining an employee of the company until they were exercised. Moreover, the uniform Treasury practice since 1923 has been to measure the compensation to employees given stock options subject to contingencies of this sort by the difference between the option price and the market value of the shares at the time the option is exercised.\n9\n We relied in part upon this practice in Commissioner v. Smith, \n324 \nU.S. 177, 324\n U.S. 695. And in its 1950 Act affording limited tax benefits for \"restricted stock option plans\" Congress adopted the same kind of standard for measurement of gains. 130A, Internal Revenue Code of 1939, as amended, 64 Stat. 942. And see 421, Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 68A Stat. 142. Under these circumstances there is no reason for departing from the Treasury practice. The taxable gain to LoBue should be measured as of the time the options were exercised and not the time they were granted. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 243, 250]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt is possible that a bona fide delivery of a binding promissory note could mark the completion of the stock purchase and that gain should be measured as of that date. Since neither the Tax Court nor the Court of Appeals passed on this question the judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the Court of Appeals with instructions to remand the case to the Tax Court for further proceedings.\n\n    Reversed and remanded.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER and MR. JUSTICE CLARK, concurring.\n\nWe join in the judgment of the Court and in its opinion on the main issue. However, the time when LoBue acquired the interest on which he is taxed was not in issue either before the Tax Court or the Court of Appeals. In the circumstances of this case, there certainly is no reason for departing from the general rule whereby this Court abstains from passing on such an issue in a tax case when raised here for the first time. See Helvering v. Minnesota Tea Co., \n296 \nU.S. 378, 380\n; Helvering v. Tex-Penn Co., \n300 \nU.S. 481, 498\n.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] There may be some question as to whether the first option was exercised in 1945 or 1946.

JUSTICE BURTON joins, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\nIn my view, the taxable event was the grant of each option, not its exercise. When the respondent received an unconditional option to buy stock at less than the market price, he received an asset of substantial and immediately realizable value, at least equal to the then-existing spread between the option price and the market price. It was at that time that the corporation conferred a benefit upon him. At the exercise of the option, the corporation \"gave\" the respondent nothing; it simply satisfied a previously-created legal obligation. That transaction, \n\n[351 \nU.S. 243, 251]\n\u00a0\n by which the respondent merely converted his asset from an option into stock, should be of no consequence for tax purposes. The option should be taxable as income when given, and any subsequent gain through appreciation of the stock, whether realized by sale of the option, if transferable, or by sale of the stock acquired by its exercise, is attributable to the sale of a capital asset and, if the other requirements are satisfied, should be taxed as a capital gain.\n1\n Any other result makes the division of the total gains between ordinary income (compensation) and capital gain (sale of an asset) dependent solely upon the fortuitous circumstance of when the employee exercises his option.\n2\n\u00a0\n\n[351 \nU.S. 243, 252]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe last two options granted to respondent were unconditional and immediately exercisable, and thus present no further problems. The first option, however, was granted under somewhat different circumstances. Respondent was notified in January 1945 that 150 shares had been \"allotted\" to him, but he was given no right to purchase them until June 30, 1945, and his right to do so then was expressly made contingent upon his still being employed at that date. His right to purchase the first allotment of stock was thus not vested until he satisfied the stated condition, and it was not until then that he could be said to have received income, the measure of which should be the value of the option on that date.\n\nAccordingly, while I concur in the reversal of the judgment below and in the remand to the Tax Court, I would hold the granting of the options to be the taxable events and would measure the income by the value of the options when granted.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Commissioner v. Smith, \n324 \nU.S. 177, 324\n U.S. 695, does not require an opposite result. In that case Smith's employer, Western, had undertaken the management of a reorganized corporation, Hawley, under a contract by which Western was to receive as compensation for its managerial services a specified amount of stock in Hawley if it was successful in reducing Hawley's indebtedness by a stated amount. Western, in turn, gave Smith, who was active in the Hawley reorganization, an option to buy, at the then-existing market price, a fixed share of any Hawley stock received under the management contract. The management contract was successfully performed, and a part of the Hawley stock received by Western - the value of which was of course substantially enhanced by the performance of the contract - was sold to Smith at the option price. Under the peculiar facts of that case - more analogous to an assignment to an employee of a share in the anticipated proceeds of a contract than to the usual employee stock option plan - the Tax Court's finding that the gain that would accrue to Smith upon the successful performance of the management contract was intended as \"compensation\" to him for his services was no doubt amply justified. But as the Court expressly stated in upholding that finding: \"It of course does not follow that in other circumstances not here present the option itself, rather than the proceeds of its exercise, could not be found to be the only intended compensation.\" Id., at p. 182.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Suppose two employees are given unconditional options to buy stock at $5, the current market value. The first exercises the option immediately and sells the stock a year later at $15. The second \n\n[351 \nU.S. 243, 252]\n\u00a0\n holds the option for a year, exercises it, and sells the stock immediately at $15. Admittedly the $10 gain would be taxed to the first as capital gain; under the Court's view, it would be taxed to the second as ordinary income because it is \"compensation\" for services. I fail to see how the gain can be any more \"compensation\" to one than it is to the other. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 243, 253]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","17":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOMMISSIONER v. SOUTHWEST EXPL. CO.(1956)\nNo. 286\nArgued: Decided: February 27, 1956\n\n\n\n\n A drilling company contracted to develop certain oil deposits lying off the coast of California by slant drilling from sites located on the property of adjacent upland owners. State law permitted such offshore oil to be extracted only by drilling from upland drill sites or filled lands, and no filled lands were available. The drilling company agreed to pay the upland owners 24 1\/2% of the net profits for the use of their land. Held: Under the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, the upland owners, not the drilling company, were entitled to take the statutory depletion allowance on this share of the profits. Pp. 309-317.\n\n (a) The right to depletion is determined by whether or not the taxpayer has an economic interest, i. e., an interest in the oil in place and income derived solely from production. Pp. 313-315.\n\n\n (b) Since the uplands were essential to any production from the offshore oil deposits, agreement of the upland owners to let their land be used for drilling in return for a share of the net profits gave them the requisite economic interest. Pp. 315-316.\n\n\n (c) Their income was dependent entirely on production, and the value of their interest decreased with each barrel of oil produced. P. 316.\n\n\n (d) Where, as here, a party essential to the drilling for and extraction of oil has made an indispensable contribution of the use of real property adjacent to the oil deposits in return for a share in the net profits from the production of oil, that party has an economic interest which entitles him to depletion on the income thus received. Pp. 316-317.\n\n\n 220 F.2d 58, reversed.\n\n 132 Ct. Cl. 427, 132 F. Supp. 718, affirmed.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Together with No. 287, United States v.

Joseph D. Peeler entered an appearance for respondent.\n\nHarry R. Horrow argued the cause for respondent in No. 287. With him on the brief was Francis R. Kirkham.\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe Southwest Exploration Co., respondent in No. 286, contracted to develop certain oil deposits lying off the coast of California by whipstock drilling from sites located on the property of adjacent upland owners. Southwest agreed to pay to such owners 24 1\/2% of the net profits for the use of their land. Both Southwest and the upland owners sought to take the statutory depletion allowance of 27 1\/2% on this share of the profits. The Tax Court decided that Southwest was entitled to the depletion allowance, 18 T. C. 961, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed, 220 F.2d 58. In the other case, the Court of Claims held that one of the upland owners, Huntington Beach Co., respondent in No. 287, was entitled to the depletion allowance on its share of the net income, 132 Ct. Cl. 427, 132 F. Supp. 718. We granted certiorari in both cases, \n350 \nU.S. 818\n, because both the drilling company and the upland owners cannot be entitled to depletion on the same income. We agree with the Court of Claims.\n1\n\u00a0\n\n[350 \nU.S. 308, 310]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe California State Lands Act of 1938 provided that the State's offshore oil might be extracted only from wells drilled on filled lands or slant drilled from upland drill sites to the submerged oil deposits.\n2\n Other provisions of the same statute required that \"derricks, machinery, and any and all other surface structures, equipment, and appliances\" be located only on filled lands or uplands. It was further provided that the state commission might require each prospective bidder for such a state lease to furnish, as a condition precedent to consideration of his bid, satisfactory evidence of \"present ability to furnish all necessary sites and rights of way for all operations contemplated under the provisions of the proposed lease.\"\n3\n\u00a0\n\nIn 1938 California published notice of its intention to receive bids for the lease of certain oil lands pursuant to this statute. At the time Southwest - a corporation organized in 1933 but completely inactive until the transaction at issue here - did not own, lease, operate or control any of the uplands adjacent to the area of oil deposits. It is agreed that there were no filled lands available. Southwest entered into three agreements with the upland owners, and was granted the right of ingress to and egress from the designated uplands and the right to construct, use and maintain all equipment necessary for drilling on the same lands. The upland owners reserved to themselves the right to give easements or subsurface well crossings in the uplands, except that they would not allow such easements for the purpose of drilling into the offshore oil deposits while Southwest retained an interest granted to it by state easement. Southwest's rights were expressly subject to all rights previously granted by the upland owners. The agreements defined \"net profits\" \n\n[350 \nU.S. 308, 311]\n\u00a0\n and provided that Southwest would pay a total of 24 1\/2% of its net profits from extraction and sale of oil to the upland owners.\n4\n It was also provided that the upland owners did not acquire a share in the lease or oil deposit by virtue of the last agreement and that it was not the intention of the parties to create a partnership relationship.\n\nAs a result of these agreements, the upland owners endorsed Southwest's bid for a lease submitted to the State of California. Southwest, as the only bidder, was granted \"Easement No. 392\" by the State in consideration of the \"royalty to be paid, the covenants to be performed, and the conditions to be observed by the Grantee.\" One such condition was that set out in paragraph (1):\n\n\"That each well drilled pursuant to the terms of this agreement shall be slant drilled from the uplands to and into the subsurface of the State lands. Derricks, machinery, and any and all other surface structures, equipment and appliances shall be located only upon the uplands and all surface operations shall be conducted therefrom.\"\n\n\n The agreement further provided that, if Southwest should \"default in the performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants and stipulations hereof,\" the State might re-enter, cancel the agreement or close down wells not being operated according to the agreement.\n\nThe wells drilled pursuant to this lease have produced oil continuously since 1939. In No. 286, Southwest Exploration Co., the tax years 1939 through 1945 are involved. If Southwest may claim the depletion allowance \n\n[350 \nU.S. 308, 312]\n\u00a0\n on the upland owner's share of the profits during this period, its tax liability is reduced by approximately $175,000. In No. 287, Huntington Beach Co., the upland owner is claiming a tax refund of $135,000 for the year 1948 alone.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nAn allowance for depletion has been recognized in our revenue laws since 1913. It is based on the theory that the extraction of minerals gradually exhausts the capital investment in the mineral deposit. Presently, the depletion allowance is a fixed percentage of gross income which Congress allows to be excluded; this exclusion is designed to permit a recoupment of the owner's capital investment in the minerals so that when the minerals are exhausted, the owner's capital is unimpaired. The present allowance, however, bears little relationship to the capital investment, and the taxpayer is not limited to a recoupment of his original investment. The allowance continues so long as minerals are extracted, and even though no money was actually invested in the deposit. The depletion allowance in the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 is solely a matter of congressional grace; it is limited to 27 1\/2% of gross income from the property after excluding from gross income \"any rents or royalties\" paid by the taxpayer with respect to the property.\n6\n\u00a0\n\n[350 \nU.S. 308, 313]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe complexities of oil operations and risks incident to prospecting have led to intricate, multiparty transactions, so that it is often difficult to determine which parties are entitled to a part of the allowance. The statute merely provides in 23 (m) that in the case of leases the depletion allowance should be \"equitably apportioned between the lessor and lessee.\"\n\nIn determining which parties are entitled to depletion on oil and gas income, this Court has relied on two interrelated concepts which were first formulated in Palmer v. Bender, \n287 \nU.S. 551\n. There, the taxpayer, a lessee of certain oil and gas properties, had transferred his interest in these properties to two oil companies in return for a cash bonus, a future payment to be made \"out of one-half of the first oil produced and saved,\" and an additional royalty of one-eighth of the oil produced and saved. In \n\n[350 \nU.S. 308, 314]\n\u00a0\n upholding the taxpayer's right to depletion on all such income, the Court based its decision on the grounds that a taxpayer is entitled to depletion where he has: (1) \"acquired, by investment, any interest in the oil in place,\" and (2) secured by legal relationship \"income derived from the extraction of the oil, to which he must look for a return of his capital.\" \n287 \nU.S., at 557\n.\n\nThese two factors, usually considered together, constitute the requirement of \"an economic interest.\" This Court has found the requisite interest in the oil in place to have been retained by the assignor of an oil lease, Thomas v. Perkins, \n301 \nU.S. 655\n, the lessor of oil properties for a share of net profits, Kirby Petroleum Co. v. Commissioner, \n326 \nU.S. 599\n, and the grantor of oil lands considered as an assignor of drilling rights, Burton-Sutton Oil Co. v. Commissioner, \n328 \nU.S. 25\n. The Court found no such interest in the case of a processor of natural gas who had only contracted to buy gas after extraction. Helvering v. Bankline Oil Co., \n303 \nU.S. 362\n, and in the case of a former stockholder who had traded his shares in a corporation which owned oil leases for a share of net income from production of the leased wells. Helvering v. O'Donnell, \n303 \nU.S. 370\n.\n\nThe second factor has been interpreted to mean that the taxpayer must look solely to the extraction of oil or gas for a return of his capital, and depletion has been denied where the payments were not dependent on production, Helvering v. Elbe Oil Land Co., \n303 \nU.S. 372\n, or where payments might have been made from a sale of any part of the fee interest as well as from production. Anderson v. Helvering, \n310 \nU.S. 404\n. It is not seriously disputed here that this requirement has been met. The problem revolves around the requirement of an interest in the oil in place.\n\nIt is to be noted that in each of the prior cases where the taxpayer has had a sufficient economic interest to \n\n[350 \nU.S. 308, 315]\n\u00a0\n entitle him to depletion, he has once had at least a fee or leasehold in the oil-producing properties themselves. No prior depletion case decided by this Court has presented a situation analogous to that here, where a fee owner of adjoining lands necessary to the extraction of oil is claiming a depletion allowance.\n\nSouthwest contends that there can be no economic interest separate from the right to enter and drill for oil on the land itself. Since the upland owners did not themselves have the right to drill for offshore oil, it is argued that respondent - who has the sole right to drill - has the sole economic interest. It is true that the exclusive right to drill was granted to Southwest, and it is also true that the agreements expressly create no interest in the oil in the upland owners. But the tax law deals in economic realities, not legal abstractions, and upon closer analysis it becomes clear that these factors do not preclude an economic interest in the upland owners.\n\nSouthwest's right to drill was clearly a conditional rather than an absolute grant. Without the prior agreements with the upland owners, Southwest could not even have qualified as a bidder for a state lease. Permission to use the upland sites was the express condition precedent to the State's consideration of Southwest's bid, and it was one of the express conditions on which \"Easement No. 392\" was granted to Southwest. For a default in that condition the State retained the right to re-enter or to cancel the lease. Thus it is seen that the upland owners have played a vital role at each successive stage of the proceedings. Without their participation there could have been no bid, no lease, no wells and no production.\n\nBut Southwest contends that the upland owners here contributed merely property which was useful but not necessary to the drilling operation. The facts are to the contrary. State law required that the wells be drilled either on the uplands or on filled lands, and there were \n\n[350 \nU.S. 308, 316]\n\u00a0\n no filled lands available. By hindsight Southwest now suggests that it might have constructed a drilling island which might have been considered as filled land under the statute. Then, too, perhaps the State itself might have changed the law or condemned the uplands under existing law. But none of these possibilities occurred. The fact is that the drilling arrangement was achieved and oil produced in the only way that it could have been, consistent with state law and the express requirements of the State's lease.\n\nRecognizing that the law of depletion requires an economic rather than a legal interest in the oil in place, we may proceed to the question of whether the upland owners had such an economic interest here. We find that they did. Proximity to the offshore oil deposits and effect of the state law combined to make the upland owners essential parties to any drilling operations. This controlling position greatly enhanced the value of their land when extraction of oil from the State's offshore fields became a possibility. The owners might have realized this value by selling their interest for a stated sum and no problem of depletion would have been presented. But instead they chose to contribute the use of their land in return for rental based on a share of net profits. This contribution was an investment in the oil in place sufficient to establish their economic interest. Their income was dependent entirely on production, and the value of their interest decreased with each barrel of oil produced. No more is required by any of the earlier cases.\n\nSouthwest contends, finally, that if depletion is allowed to the upland owners in this case, it would be difficult to limit the principle in instances of strangers \"disassociated from the lease\" who may have contributed an essential facility to the drilling operation in return for a share of the net profits. But those problems are not before us in this case where the upland owners could hardly be said \n\n[350 \nU.S. 308, 317]\n\u00a0\n to be \"disassociated from the lease.\" We decide only that where, in the circumstances of this case, a party essential to the drilling for and extraction of oil has made an indispensable contribution of the use of real property adjacent to the oil deposits in return for a share in the net profits from the production of oil, that party has an economic interest which entitles him to depletion on the income thus received.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons the judgment in No. 286, as to Southwest Exploration Company, is reversed and that in No. 287, as to Huntington Beach Company, is affirmed.\n\n    No. 286, Reversed.\n\n\n    No. 287, Affirmed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE DOUGLAS dissents.\n\nMR.

While the appeal was pending, petitioner filed a motion for leave to adduce additional evidence pursuant to 14 (a) of the Act, alleging inter alia that evidence which became available to petitioner subsequent to the administrative proceeding would establish that the testimony of three of the Attorney General's witnesses on which the Board relied was perjurious. The Government did not deny petitioner's allegations. The Court of Appeals denied the motion, upheld the constitutionality of the Act, and affirmed the Board's order. Both the Government and the Court of Appeals deemed the innocent testimony sufficient to sustain the Board's conclusion. Held: The Court of Appeals erred in refusing to return the case to the Board for consideration of the new evidence proffered by petitioner's motion and affidavit. Pp. 116-125.\n\n (a) The case must be decided on the nonconstitutional issue, if the record calls for it, without reaching constitutional problems.

JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis case is here to review the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia affirming an order of the Subversive Activities Control Board that petitioner register with the Attorney General as a \"Communist-action\" organization, as required by the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950, Title I of the Internal Security Act of 1950, 64 Stat. 987. That Act sets forth a comprehensive plan for regulation of \"Communist-action\" organizations.\n1\n Section 2 of the Act describes a \n\n[351 \nU.S. 115, 117]\n\u00a0\n world Communist movement directed from abroad and designed to overthrow the Government of the United States by any means available, including violence. Section 7 requires all Communist-action organizations to register as such with the Attorney General. If the Attorney General has reason to believe that an organization, which has not registered, is a Communist-action organization, he is required by 13 (a) to bring a proceeding to determine that fact before the Subversive Activities Control Board, a five-man board appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate and created for the purpose of holding hearings and making such determinations. Section 13 (e) lays down certain standards for judgment by the Board.\n\nIf the Board finds that an organization is a Communist-action organization, it enters an order requiring the organization to register with the Attorney General. 13 (g). Section 14 provides the right to file a petition for review of Board action in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, with opportunity for review by this Court upon certiorari. Once an organization registers or there is outstanding a final order of the Board requiring it to register, several consequences follow with respect to the \n\n[351 \nU.S. 115, 118]\n\u00a0\n organization and its members, but these need not now be detailed. See 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 15, 22, 25.\n\nProceeding under 13 (a) of this statute, the Attorney General, on November 22, 1950, petitioned the Board for an order directing petitioner to register pursuant to 7 of the Act. Petitioner sought unsuccessfully by numerous motions before the Board and by proceedings in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia - one case is reported at 96 F. Supp. 47 - to attack the validity of, and to abort, the hearing. The hearing began on April 23, 1951, before three members of the Board, later reduced to two, sitting as a hearing panel, and it terminated on July 1, 1952. Proposed findings of fact and briefs were filed by both parties, and oral argument was held before the hearing panel in August 1952. In October 1952 the hearing panel issued a recommended decision that the Board order petitioner to register as a Communist-action organization. Exceptions to the panel's findings were filed by both parties, and oral argument was held before the Board in January 1953. The Board filed its report, which occupies 251 pages of the record in this case, on April 20, 1953.\n\nIn its report the Board found that there existed a world Communist movement, substantially as described in 2 of the Act, organized and directed by a foreign government. The Board detailed the history of the Communist Party of the United States and its close relation to the world Communist movement. It then set forth illustrative evidence and made findings with respect to the statutory criteria of 13 (e) of the Act, which required the Board to consider \"the extent to which\" the organization met them.\n2\n The Board found that the conditions \n\n[351 \nU.S. 115, 119]\n\u00a0\n set forth in each of the paragraphs were applicable to petitioner. On the basis of these findings the Board concluded that petitioner was a Communist-action organization, as defined by 3, and ordered it to register as such with the Attorney General.\n\nPetitioner brought this order to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia for review. While the case was pending, it filed a motion, supported by affidavit, \n\n[351 \nU.S. 115, 120]\n\u00a0\n for leave to adduce additional evidence pursuant to 14 (a) of the Act.\n3\n The basis of the motion was that the additional material evidence became available to the petitioner subsequent to the administrative proceeding and that this evidence would\n\n\"establish that the testimony of three of the witnesses for the Attorney General, on which [the Board] relied extensively and heavily in making findings which are of key importance to the order now under review, was false. . . . In summary, this evidence will establish that Crouch, Johnson and Matusow, all professional informers heretofore employed by the Department of Justice as witnesses in numerous proceedings, have committed perjury, are completely untrustworthy and should be accorded no credence; that at least two of them are now being investigated for perjury by the Department of Justice, and that because their character as professional perjurors [sic] has now been conclusively and publicly demonstrated, the Attorney General has ceased to employ any of them as witnesses.\"\n\n\n Petitioner listed a number of witnesses whom it proposed to call to substantiate its claim and also set forth a detailed affidavit in support of its allegations. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 115, 121]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Government did not deny these allegations. It filed a \"Memorandum in Opposition to Motion for Leave to Adduce Additional Evidence,\" signed by the General Counsel to the Board and by officials of the Department of Justice. The memorandum asserted that the hearing should not be reopened for the receipt of evidence merely questioning, as it claimed, the credibility of some witnesses, but not any fact at issue, and it maintained that the findings of the Board were amply supported by evidence apart from the testimony of the three witnesses sought to be discredited. On December 23, 1954, this motion was formally denied by the Court of Appeals without opinion. In its full opinion on the merits, filed the same day, however, the Court of Appeals supported its rejection of petitioner's motion:\n\n \"The Party attacks the credibility of the witnesses presented by the Government. In this connection it stresses that some of these witnesses . . . were under charges of false swearing. Full opportunity for cross examination of these witnesses was afforded at the hearing before the Board, and full opportunity was also afforded for the presentation of rebuttal testimony. The evaluation of credibility is primarily a matter for the trier of the facts, and a reviewing court cannot disturb that evaluation unless a manifest error has been made. Moreover the testimony of the witnesses against whom charges are said to have been made was consistent with and supported by masses of other evidence. . . .\" 96 U.S. App. D.C. 66, 100, 223 F.2d 531, 565.\n\n\n The Court of Appeals affirmed the order of the Board. It sustained 13 (e) against the contention that its standards were vague and irrational. It held that the findings of the Board had been established by a preponderance of the evidence, except that it struck, as not being \n\n[351 \nU.S. 115, 122]\n\u00a0\n supported by a preponderance of the evidence, the finding that the secret practices were undertaken for the purpose of promoting the objectives, and concealing the true nature, of petitioner; and it also struck the finding in connection with reporting to a foreign government because the record supported only a finding of reporting by Party leaders \"upon occasion,\" not a finding which implied a constant, systematic reporting. The court, however, found that the Board's conclusion was supported by the basic findings which it had affirmed. With respect to petitioner's other attacks on the constitutional validity of the statute, the court found it necessary to consider some of the so-called \"sanction\" sections, 5, 6, 10, 11, 22, and 25, as well as 7, the registration section. It held that they were all constitutional and therefore affirmed the order of the Board.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nThe challenge to the Act on which the order was based plainly raises constitutional questions appropriate for this Court's consideration, and so we brought the case here. \n349 \nU.S. 943\n. At the threshold we are, however, confronted by a particular claim that the Court of Appeals erred in refusing to return the case to the Board for consideration of the new evidence proffered by petitioner's motion and affidavit. This non-constitutional issue must be met at the outset, because the case must be decided on a non-constitutional issue, if the record calls for it, without reaching constitutional problems. Peters v. Hobby, \n349 \nU.S. 331\n.\n\nIn considering this non-constitutional issue raised by denial of petitioner's motion, we must avoid any intimation \n\n[351 \nU.S. 115, 123]\n\u00a0\n with respect to the other issues raised by petitioner. We do not so intimate by concluding that the testimony of the three witnesses, against whom the uncontested challenge of perjury was made, was not inconsequential in relation to the issues on which the Board had to pass. No doubt a large part of the record consisted of documentary evidence. However, not only was the human testimony significant but the documentary evidence was also linked to the activities of the petitioner and to the ultimate finding of the Board by human testimony, and such testimony was in part that of these three witnesses. The facts bearing on the issue are not in controversy. The direct testimony of witness Crouch occupied 387 pages of the typewritten transcript; that of Johnson, 163 pages; and that of Matusow, 118 pages. The annotated report of the Board, in which citations to the evidence were made to illustrate the support for its findings, contained 36 references to the testimony of Crouch, 25 references to the testimony of Johnson, and 24 references to the testimony of Matusow. These references were made in support of every finding under the eight criteria of 13 (e) and it is also not to be assumed that the evidence given by these three witnesses played no role in the Board's findings of fact even when not specifically cited.\n5\n Testimony, for example, directed toward proving \n\n[351 \nU.S. 115, 124]\n\u00a0\n that the Communist Party of the United States was an agency utilized by a foreign government to undermine the loyalty of the armed forces, and to be in a position to paralyze shipping and prevent transportation of soldiers and war supplies through the Panama Canal, Hawaii, and the ports of San Francisco and New York in time of war, cannot be deemed insignificant in such a determination as that which the Board made in this proceeding.\n\nThis is a proceeding under an Act which Congress conceived necessary for \"the security of the United States and to the existence of free American institutions . . . .\" 64 Stat., at 989. The untainted administration of justice is certainly one of the most cherished aspects of our institutions. Its observance is one of our proudest boasts. This Court is charged with supervisory functions in relation to proceedings in the federal courts. See McNabb v. United States, \n318 \nU.S. 332\n. Therefore, fastidious regard for the honor of the administration of justice requires the Court to make certain that the doing of justice be made so manifest that only irrational or perverse claims of its disregard can be asserted.\n\nWhen uncontested challenge is made that a finding of subversive design by petitioner was in part the product of three perjurious witnesses, it does not remove the taint for a reviewing court to find that there is ample innocent testimony to support the Board's findings. If these witnesses in fact committed perjury in testifying in other cases on subject matter substantially like that of their testimony in the present proceedings, their testimony in this proceeding is inevitably discredited and the Board's determination must duly take this fact into account. We \n\n[351 \nU.S. 115, 125]\n\u00a0\n cannot pass upon a record containing such challenged testimony. We find it necessary to dispose of the case on the grounds we do, not in order to avoid a constitutional adjudication but because the fair administration of justice requires it. Since reversal is thus demanded, however, we do not reach the constitutional issues.\n\nThe basis for challenging the testimony was not in existence when the proceedings were concluded before the Board. Petitioner should therefore be given leave to make its allegations before the Board in a proceeding under 14 (a) of the Act. The issue on which the case must be returned to the Board lies within a narrow compass and the Board has ample scope of discretion in passing upon petitioner's motion. The purpose of this remand, as is its reason, is to make certain that the Board bases its findings upon untainted evidence. To that end it may hold a hearing to ascertain the truth of petitioner's allegations, and if the testimony of the three witnesses is discredited, it must not leave that testimony part of the record. Alternatively, the Board may choose to assume the truth of petitioner's allegations and, without further hearing, expunge the testimony of these witnesses from the record. In either event, the Board must then reconsider its original determination in the light of the record as freed from the challenge that now beclouds it.\n\nThe case is reversed and remanded for proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n\n   Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] A \"Communist-action\" organization is defined in 3 of the Act as: \"(a) any organization in the United States (other than a diplomatic representative or mission of a foreign government accredited \n\n[351 \nU.S. 115, 117]\n\u00a0\n as such by the Department of State) which (i) is substantially directed, dominated, or controlled by the foreign government or foreign organization controlling the world Communist movement referred to in section 2 of this title, and (ii) operates primarily to advance the objectives of such world Communist movement as referred to in section 2 of this title; and \"(b) any section, branch, fraction, or cell of any organization defined in subparagraph (a) of this paragraph which has not complied with the registration requirements of this title.\" 64 Stat., at 989. The Act also defines and regulates \"Communist-front\" organizations, but these sections of the Act are not involved in the present proceeding.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] \"In determining whether any organization is a `Communist-action organization,' the Board shall take into consideration - \"(1) the extent to which its policies are formulated and carried out and its activities performed, pursuant to directives or to effectuate \n\n[351 \nU.S. 115, 119]\n\u00a0\n the policies of the foreign government or foreign organization in which is vested, or under the domination or control of which is exercised, the direction and control of the world Communist movement referred to in section 2 of this title; and \"(2) the extent to which its views and policies do not deviate from those of such foreign government or foreign organization; and \"(3) the extent to which it receives financial or other aid, directly or indirectly, from or at the direction of such foreign government or foreign organization; and \"(4) the extent to which it sends members or representatives to any foreign country for instruction or training in the principles, policies, strategy, or tactics of such world Communist movement; and \"(5) the extent to which it reports to such foreign government or foreign organization or to its representatives; and \"(6) the extent to which its principal leaders or a substantial number of its members are subject to or recognize the disciplinary power of such foreign government or foreign organization or its representatives; and \"(7) the extent to which, for the purpose of concealing foreign direction, domination, or control, or of expediting or promoting its objectives, (i) it fails to disclose, or resists efforts to obtain information as to, its membership (by keeping membership lists in code, by instructing members to refuse to acknowledge membership, or by any other method); (ii) its members refuse to acknowledge membership therein; (iii) it fails to disclose, or resists efforts to obtain information as to, records other than membership lists; (iv) its meetings are secret; and (v) it otherwise operates on a secret basis; and \"(8) the extent to which its principal leaders or a substantial number of its members consider the allegiance they owe to the United States as subordinate to their obligations to such foreign government or foreign organization.\" 64 Stat., at 999-1000.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Section 14 (a) of the Act provides: \". . .

The Board may modify its findings as to the facts, by reason of the additional evidence so taken, and it shall file such modified or new findings, which, if supported by the preponderance of the evidence shall be conclusive, and its recommendations, if any, with respect to action in the matter under consideration. . . .\" 64 Stat., at 1001-1002.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Judge Bazelon dissented on the ground that the registration provision violated the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination because it compelled the person signing it to identify himself as a Communist Party functionary and because it compelled a listing of officers and members. 96 U.S. App. D.C., at 111, 223 F.2d, at 576.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] In this connection the following statement of the Board in its report should be noted: \"In making our findings herein, we have considered and weighed all the evidence of record. In weighing [the Attorney General's] evidence, we have considered that certain of [his] witnesses fall into the category of `informers' and we have scrutinized their testimony accordingly; we have considered and resolved the inconsistencies in the testimony of certain of [the Attorney General's] witnesses; we have considered the testimony of [the Attorney General's] witnesses against the background of their various organizational positions and activities in the CPUSA which afforded the \n\n[351 \nU.S. 115, 124]\n\u00a0\n sources of their knowledge; and we have had the benefit of the Panel's observation of their demeanor while testifying. Viewing these considerations in the light of the whole record, we find no basis for disregarding the substance of their testimony.\"\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK, with whom MR. JUSTICE REED and MR. JUSTICE MINTON join, dissenting.\n\nOn November 22, 1950, the Attorney General petitioned the Subversive Activities Control Board for an order directing the Communist Party to register as a Communist-action organization, pursuant to the provisions of \n\n[351 \nU.S. 115, 126]\n\u00a0\n the Internal Security Act of 1950. On April 20, 1953, the Board unanimously directed the Communist Party to register, finding \"upon the overwhelming weight of the evidence . . . [the Communist Party] is substantially directed, dominated, and controlled by the Soviet Union . . . and . . . operates primarily to advance the objectives of such world Communist movement.\"\n\nNearly two years later, while the matter was before the Court of Appeals, the Communist Party filed a motion for leave to adduce additional evidence under 14 (a) of the Internal Security Act. The \"new evidence\" attacked the credibility of witnesses Crouch, Johnson, and Matusow, 3 of the 22 witnesses for the Government. The motion charged that Crouch and Johnson had perjured themselves in their testimony in such other cases as United States v. Kuzma, United States v. Bridges, In re Burck, and United States v. Weinberg. It also charged that Matusow had recanted his testimony in Communist cases and was writing a book entitled \"Blacklisting (or Blackmailing) Was My Business.\"\n\nThe Board opposed the motion, stating that the testimony of the three witnesses could \"be ignored in toto and the ultimate determination . . . will remain amply supported by evidence both testimonial and documentary in character. . . . The [Communist Party] would still be found a Communist-action organization by overwhelming evidence.\"\n\nThe Court of Appeals denied the motion without opinion. However, in its opinion on the merits, the court pointed out that similar attacks had been made on the credibility of these as well as other witnesses before the Board. For example, in 194 pages of cross-examination before the Board, the Party charged that witness Johnson had committed perjury in Pennsylvania v. Nelson, In re Yanish, In re Dmytryshyn, United States v. Eisler, and in testimony before the Un-American Activities Committee. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 115, 127]\n\u00a0\n The 112-page cross-examination of Matusow likewise was largely devoted to charges of perjury before various boards and committees. Crouch was cross-examined for 810 pages, practically all of which was devoted to an attack on his credibility through his testimony in other proceedings. As the Court of Appeals concluded, \"Full opportunity for cross examination of these witnesses was afforded at the hearing before the Board, and full opportunity was also afforded for the presentation of rebuttal testimony. . . . Moreover the testimony of the witnesses against whom charges are said to have been made was consistent with and supported by masses of other evidence.\" 96 U.S. App. D.C., at 100, 223 F.2d, at 565. Not only did little of the cross-examination relate to the evidence offered on direct, but the Party introduced only three witnesses in rebuttal and none refuted any specific testimony of the witnesses now challenged. The Court of Appeals affirmed the issuance of the order by the Board.\n\nThe Communist Party brought the case here on April 13, 1955, by petition for certiorari. The relative unimportance of this motion in the eyes of the Party is shown by the fact that its 131-page petition devotes but 2 pages to a discussion of this point. The Party's brief devotes only 4 1\/2 of its 270 pages to the motion. Still the Court now says the Court of Appeals \"erred\" in its denial of the motion and remands the case directly to the Board for it to determine again the credibility of these three witnesses. It refuses to pass on the important questions relating to the constitutionality of the Internal Security Act of 1950, a bulwark of the congressional program to combat the menace of world Communism. Believing that the Court here disregards its plain responsibility and duty to decide these important constitutional questions, I cannot join in its action. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 115, 128]\n\u00a0\n\n\nI have not found any case in the history of the Court where important constitutional issues have been avoided on such a pretext. Certainly Peters v. Hobby, \n349 \nU.S. 331\n, is no authority for this action, since that case could be and was finally disposed of without reaching the constitutional issues. Here the case will be finally decided only after our decision on the constitutional questions. The action today is taken merely for delay and can result only in the Board reaffirming the action. In fact it so advised the Court of Appeals and that court found that all of the testimony of the questionable witnesses was supported by \"masses of other evidence.\"\n\nThe allegations of the motion itself are entirely inadequate in that they point to no particular testimony before the Board as being false. There is no offer to disprove any testimony given, and no fact at issue in the proceeding is controverted. As to Crouch and Johnson, the motion merely cites additional cases in which it is alleged that their testimony was conflicting. These allegations are purely cumulative of the witnesses' cross-examination before the Board. With regard to Matusow, the motion mentions only newspaper reports and a press release referring to the statements of certain persons that Matusow had told them that he had lied. Ignoring the obvious inadequacy of this allegation, we may take judicial notice of the two cases where Matusow submitted affidavits stating that he had lied during the trial, United States v. Jencks and United States v. Flynn. In the Jencks case, the trial judge concluded that Matusow had been paid by a Communist source to recant and that his original testimony was true. The motion based entirely on Matusow's recantation was denied. This was affirmed by the Court of Appeals, Jencks v. United States, 226 F.2d 540, cert. granted, \n350 \nU.S. 980\n. In the Flynn case, 130 F. Supp. 412, the trial judge denied a similar motion as to 11 of the \n\n[351 \nU.S. 115, 129]\n\u00a0\n 13 defendants. Two of the defendants in Flynn were granted a new trial only because Matusow had testified specifically to private conversations with these defendants which demonstrated their advocacy of the forcible overthrow of the Government. Matusow's general testimony against other defendants was not disturbed. These cases make it clear that, except for the special circumstances of two defendants in the Flynn case, the lower courts have not granted new trials in criminal proceedings despite the retraction by Matusow of specific sworn testimony given at the trials. See also United States v. Parker, 103 F.2d 857.\n1\n But these were criminal cases where proof of guilt must be beyond a reasonable doubt. Here, only a preponderance of the evidence is required.\n\nMotions to adduce additional evidence under 14 (a) are similar to motions to adduce evidence under 10 (e) of the NLRA and the scope of our review is the same. Such motions are addressed to the sound discretion of the Courts of Appeals. In order to reverse we must find more than that the court below erred, because it \"must not only have been in error but must also have abused its judicial discretion.\" Labor Board v. Indiana & M. Electric Co., \n318 \nU.S. 9, 16\n. In this case the motion itself was wholly inadequate and even if the testimony of all three challenged witnesses were omitted from the record the result could not have been different. There is no reasonable basis on which we could say that the Court of Appeals has abused its discretion.\n\nI abhor the use of perjured testimony as much as anyone, but we must recognize that never before have mere allegations of perjury, so flimsily supported, been considered grounds for reopening a proceeding or granting \n\n[351 \nU.S. 115, 130]\n\u00a0\n a new trial.\n2\n The Communist Party makes no claim that the Government knowingly used false testimony, and it is far too realistic to contend that the Board's action will be any different on remand. The only purpose of this procedural maneuver is to gain additional time before the order to register can become effective. This proceeding has dragged out for many years now, and the function of the Board remains suspended and the congressional purpose frustrated at a most critical time in world history.\n\nIronically enough, we are returning the case to a Board whose very existence is challenged on constitutional grounds. We are asking the Board to pass on the credibility of witnesses after we have refused to say whether it has the power to do so. The constitutional questions are fairly presented here for our decision. If all or any part of the Act is unconstitutional, it should be declared so on the record before us. If not, the Nation is entitled to effective operation of the statute deemed to be of vital importance to its well-being at the time it was passed by the Congress. I would decide the questions presented by this record.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Despite the direct allegations of perjury in this case, this Court refused to review the denial of the motion for a new trial. \n307 \nU.S. 642\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] In at least three cases this Term we declined to review state criminal convictions in which much stronger allegations of perjury were made.

UNITED STATES(1956)\nNo. 72\nArgued: Decided: March 5, 1956\n\n\n\n\n A defendant in a criminal case in a federal court may be required to stand trial and his conviction may be sustained where only hearsay evidence was presented to the grand jury which indicted him. Pp. 359-364.\n\n (a) An indictment based solely on hearsay evidence does not violate the provision of the Fifth Amendment that \"No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury . . . .\" Pp. 361-363.\n\n\n (b) In the exercise of its power to supervise the administration of justice in the federal courts, this Court declines to establish a rule permitting defendants in criminal cases to challenge indictments on the ground that they are not supported by adequate or competent evidence. Pp. 363-364.\n\n\n 221 F.2d 668, affirmed.\n\nOsmond K. Fraenkel and Morris Shilensky argued the cause for petitioner. With them on the brief were Joseph Leary Delaney and George Wolf.\n\nMarvin E. Frankel argued the cause for the United States. With him on the brief were Solicitor General Sobeloff, Assistant Attorney General Holland and Joseph M. Howard.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nWe granted certiorari in this case to consider a single question: \"May a defendant be required to stand trial and a conviction be sustained where only hearsay evidence was presented to the grand jury which indicated him?\" \n350 \nU.S. 819\n.\n\nPetitioner, Frank Costello, was indicated for wilfully attempting to evade payment of income taxes due the \n\n[350 \nU.S. 359, 360]\n\u00a0\n United States for the years 1947, 1948 and 1949.\n1\n The charge was that petitioner falsely and fraudulently reported less income than he and his wife actually received during the taxable years in question. Petitioner promptly filed a motion for inspection of the minutes of the grand jury and for a dismissal of the indictment. His motion was based on an affidavit stating that he was firmly convinced there could have been no legal or competent evidence before the grand jury which indicted him since he had reported all his income and paid all taxes due. The motion was denied. At the trial which followed the Government offered evidence designed to show increases in Costello's net worth in an attempt to prove that he had received more income during the years in question than he had reported.\n2\n To establish its case the Government called and examined 144 witnesses and introduced 368 exhibits. All of the testimony and documents related to business transactions and expenditures by petitioner and his wife. The prosecution concluded its case by calling three government agents. Their investigations had produced the evidence used against petitioner at the trial. They were allowed to summarize the vast amount of evidence already heard and to introduce computations showing, if correct, that petitioner and his wife had received far greater income than they had reported. We have held such summarizations admissible in a \"net worth\" case like this. United States v. Johnson, \n319 \nU.S. 503\n. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 359, 361]\n\u00a0\n\n\nCounsel for petitioner asked each government witness at the trial whether he had appeared before the grand jury which returned the indictment. This cross-examination developed the fact that the three investigating officers had been the only witnesses before the grand jury. After the Government concluded its case, petitioner again moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the only evidence before the grand jury was \"hearsay,\" since the three officers had no firsthand knowledge of the transactions upon which their computations were based. Nevertheless the trial court again refused to dismiss the indictment, and petitioner was convicted. The Court of Appeals affirmed,\n3\n holding that the indictment was valid even though the sole evidence before the grand jury was hearsay.\n4\n Petitioner here urges: (1) that an indictment based solely on hearsay evidence violates that part of the Fifth Amendment providing that \"No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury . . . .\" and (2) that if the Fifth Amendment does not invalidate an indictment based solely on hearsay we should now lay down such a rule for the guidance of federal courts. See McNabb v. United States, \n318 \nU.S. 332, 340\n-341.\n\nThe Fifth Amendment provides that federal prosecutions for capital or otherwise infamous crimes must be \n\n[350 \nU.S. 359, 362]\n\u00a0\n instituted by presentments or indictments of grand juries. But neither the Fifth Amendment nor any other constitutional provision prescribes the kind of evidence upon which grand juries must act. The grand jury is an English institution, brought to this country by the early colonists and incorporated in the Constitution by the Founders. There is every reason to believe that our constitutional grand jury was intended to operate substantially like its English progenitor. The basic purpose of the English grand jury was to provide a fair method for instituting criminal proceedings against persons believed to have committed crimes. Grand jurors were selected from the body of the people and their work was not hampered by rigid procedural or evidential rules. In fact, grand jurors could act on their own knowledge and were free to make their presentments or indictments on such information as they deemed satisfactory. Despite its broad power to institute criminal proceedings the grand jury grew in popular favor with the years. It acquired an independence in England free from control by the Crown or judges. Its adoption in our Constitution as the sole method for preferring charges in serious criminal cases shows the high place it held as an instrument of justice. And in this country as in England of old the grand jury has convened as a body of laymen, free from technical rules, acting in secret, pledged to indict no one because of prejudice and to free no one because of special favor. As late as 1927 an English historian could say that English grand juries were still free to act on their own knowledge if they pleased to do so.\n5\n And in 1852 Mr. Justice Nelson on circuit could say \"No case has been cited, nor have we been able to find any, furnishing an authority for looking into and revising the judgment of the grand jury upon the evidence, for the purpose of \n\n[350 \nU.S. 359, 363]\n\u00a0\n determining whether or not the finding was founded upon sufficient proof . . . .\" United States v. Reed, 27 Fed. Cas. 727, 738.\n6\n\u00a0\n\nIn Holt v. United States, \n218 \nU.S. 245\n, this Court had to decide whether an indictment should be quashed because supported in part by incompetent evidence. Aside from the incompetent evidence \"there was very little evidence against the accused.\" The Court refused to hold that such an indictment should be quashed, pointing out that \"The abuses of criminal practice would be enhanced if indictments could be upset on such a ground.\" \n218 \nU.S., at 248\n. The same thing is true where as here all the evidence before the grand jury was in the nature of \"hearsay.\" If indictments were to be held open to challenge on the ground that there was inadequate or incompetent evidence before the grand jury, the resulting delay would be great indeed. The result of such a rule would be that before trial on the merits a defendant could always insist on a kind of preliminary trial to determine the competency and adequacy of the evidence before the grand jury. This is not required by the Fifth Amendment. An indictment returned by a legally constituted and unbiased grand jury,\n7\n like an information drawn by the prosecutor, if valid on its face, is enough to call for trial of the charge on the merits. The Fifth Amendment requires nothing more.\n\nPetitioner urges that this Court should exercise its power to supervise the administration of justice in federal \n\n[350 \nU.S. 359, 364]\n\u00a0\n courts and establish a rule permitting defendants to challenge indictments on the ground that they are not supported by adequate or competent evidence. No persuasive reasons are advanced for establishing such a rule. It would run counter to the whole history of the grand jury institution, in which laymen conduct their inquiries unfettered by technical rules. Neither justice nor the concept of a fair trial requires such a change. In a trial on the merits, defendants are entitled to a strict observance of all the rules designed to bring about a fair verdict. Defendants are not entitled, however, to a rule which would result in interminable delay but add nothing to the assurance of a fair trial.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE CLARK and MR. JUSTICE HARLAN took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The indictment was based on 145 (b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. 53 Stat. 63. There was also a count in the indictment for the year 1946 but petitioner was found not guilty of this charge.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] For discussions of the \"net worth method,\" see Holland v.

In my view, however, this case does not justify the breadth of the declarations made by the Court. I assume that this Court would not preclude an examination of grand-jury action to ascertain the existence of bias or prejudice in an indictment. Likewise, it seems to me that if it is shown that the grand jury had before it no substantial or rationally persuasive evidence upon which to base its indictment, that indictment should be quashed. To hold a person to answer to such an empty indictment for a capital or otherwise infamous federal crime robs the Fifth Amendment of much of its protective value to the private citizen.\n\nHere, as in Holt v. United States, \n218 \nU.S. 245\n, substantial and rationally persuasive evidence apparently was presented to the grand jury. We may fairly assume that the evidence before that jury included much of the \n\n[350 \nU.S. 359, 365]\n\u00a0\n testimony later given at the trial by the three government agents who said that they had testified before the grand jury. At the trial, they summarized financial transactions of the accused about which they were not qualified to testify of their own knowledge. To use Justice Holmes' phrase in the Holt case, such testimony, standing alone, was \"incompetent by circumstances\" (supra, at 248), and yet it was rationally persuasive of the crime charged and provided a substantial basis for the indictment. At the trial, with preliminary testimony laying the foundation for it, the same testimony constituted an important part of the competent evidence upon which the conviction was obtained.\n\nTo sustain this indictment under the above circumstances is well enough, but I agree with Judge Learned Hand that \"if it appeared that no evidence had been offered that rationally established the facts, the indictment ought to be quashed; because then the grand jury would have in substance abdicated.\" 221 F.2d 668, 677. Accordingly, I concur in this judgment, but do so for the reasons stated in the opinion of the Court of Appeals and subject to the limitations there expressed. See also, Notes, 62 Harv. L.

TOWN OF SOMERS(1956)\nNo. 380\nArgued: March 29, 1956Decided: May 7, 1956\n\n\n\n\n Under Article VII-A, Title 3, of the New York Tax Law, a town proceeded to foreclose a lien for delinquent taxes on the real estate of a long-time resident. In accordance with the statute, the taxpayer was given no notice except by mail, posting notice at the post office and publication in two local newspapers. She filed no answer; judgment of foreclosure was entered; and a deed to her property was delivered to the town. A few days later, she was adjudged insane and committed to a hospital for the insane. Subsequently, appellant was appointed committee of her person and property, and he filed a motion in the trial court where the judgment of foreclosure had been entered to have the default opened, the judgment vacated and the deed set aside. He alleged that, prior to entry of the judgment of foreclosure, the taxpayer was well known by town officials to be financially able to meet her obligations but mentally incompetent to handle her affairs or to understand the meaning of any notice served upon her and that no attempt had been made to have a committee appointed for her person or property. Held: Assuming the truth of these allegations, the notice provided under the statute was inadequate as applied to this incompetent taxpayer, and the taking of her property would violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Pp. 142-147.\n\n (a) It appears that, in an action to set aside the deed (which is contemplated by the statute), only such irregularities as failure to observe the statutory procedure may be attacked. The state court has recognized the existence of equitable power to entertain a motion to open a default in an in rem tax proceeding, and the State Court of Appeals amended its remittitur in this case to disclose that a constitutional question was presented and necessarily decided on the appeal to that court. Therefore, the constitutional question is properly before this Court. Pp. 143-144.\n\n\n (b) Notice to a person known to be an incompetent and without the protection of a guardian does not measure up to the requirements of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Pp. 146-147.\n\n\n 308 N. Y. 798, 941, 125 N. E. 2d 862, 127 N. E. 2d 90, reversed and remanded. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 141, 142]\n\u00a0\n\n\nSamuel M. Sprafkin argued the cause for appellant. With him on the brief were Adolph I. King and Mandel Matthew Einhorn.\n\nOtto E. Koegel argued the cause and filed a brief for appellee.\n\nJohn R. Davison, Assistant Attorney General, argued the cause for the State of New York, as amicus curiae, urging affirmance. With him on the brief were Jacob K. Javits, Attorney General, and James O. Moore, Jr., Solicitor General.\n\nMR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe application of Article VII-A, Title 3, of the New York Tax Law to the mentally incompetent ward of appellant is challenged as being repugnant to the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThe statute, in 165 et seq., provides for the judicial foreclosure of tax liens on real property. The filing at the county clerk's office of a list of taxes delinquent more than four years constitutes the filing of a notice of lis pendens and of a complaint, and commences an action against the property. Provision is made for notice by publication, by posting, and by mailing. The prescribed notice is to the effect that, unless the amount of unpaid tax liens, together with interest and penalties which are a lien against the property, are paid within 7 weeks, or an answer interposed within 20 days thereafter, any person having the right to redeem or answer shall be forever foreclosed of all his right, title, and interest and equity of redemption in and to the delinquent property. Provision is made for entry of a judgment of foreclosure awarding possession of the property to the tax district \n\n[351 \nU.S. 141, 143]\n\u00a0\n and directing execution of a deed conveying an estate in fee simple absolute to the district. The provisions of Title 3 purport to be applicable to and valid and effective with respect to all defendants, even though one or more of them be infants, incompetents, absentees, or nonresidents of the State of New York.\n\nSection 165-h (7) makes the deed presumptive evidence of the regularity of the proceedings. After two years this presumption becomes conclusive. The Section further provides that no action to set aside the deed may be maintained unless commenced and a lis pendens notice filed prior to the time the presumption becomes conclusive.\n\nWe are met at the outset with the contention of appellee and the State of New York, amicus curiae, that an action, as distinguished from the motion in the original proceeding here utilized, was the exclusive remedy in this case. The statute itself contains no suggestion that a new action is the exclusive remedy; it merely limits the time within which an action may be brought to set aside the deed. The Second Department of the Appellate Division, which decided this case, has recognized the existence of equitable power to entertain a motion to open a default in an in rem tax proceeding.\n1\n If that were not enough, appellee, on oral argument, conceded that in an action of the sort contemplated by 165-h (7), the appellant would have been able to attack the deed only on the ground of alleged irregularities in the assessment and foreclosure proceedings. Although the Attorney General of New York has supported a contrary position, it was \n\n[351 \nU.S. 141, 144]\n\u00a0\n admitted at the argument that there was no decision to support his view. Our conclusion that the constitutional question was properly raised by appellant's motion is reinforced by the action of the Court of Appeals which amended its remittitur to disclose that a constitutional question was presented and necessarily decided on the appeal to that court. 308 N. Y. 941, 127 N. E. 2d 90. Manifestly, no constitutional question could have been reached if the Court of Appeals had been of the opinion that the appellant had pursued the wrong remedy.\n\nThis proceeding started on May 8, 1952. The Town of Somers instituted it to foreclose many tax liens, one of which was its lien against the parcel of real property owned by the incompetent. In compliance with the statute, notice was given to the incompetent taxpayer by mail, by posting a notice at the post office, and by publication in two local newspapers. No answer having been filed by the incompetent, judgment of foreclosure was entered on September 8, 1952, and on October 24, 1952, a deed to her property was delivered to the town. Five days later, on October 29, 1952, Nora Brainard was certified by the County Court as a person of unsound mind, and one week later, November 6, 1952, she was committed to the Harlem Valley State Hospital for the insane. Thereafter, on February 13, 1953, appellant filed bond pursuant to an order appointing him Committee of the person and property of the incompetent.\n\nSometime prior to September 22, 1953, the town offered the incompetent's property for sale at a minimum bid price of $6,500. The unpaid taxes, interest, penalties, costs of foreclosure, attorney's fees, and maintenance charges on the property to September 22, 1953, aggregated $480. On that date, appellant's attorney appeared before the Town Board and offered to repay the town the amount due on the property in consideration \n\n[351 \nU.S. 141, 145]\n\u00a0\n of its return to the incompetent's estate. The offer was refused.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nAppellant then filed a motion in the County Court of Westchester County, where the judgment of foreclosure had been entered, for an order to show cause why the default should not be opened, the judgment vacated and the deed set aside, and permission granted \"to answer or appear or otherwise move with respect to\" the notice of foreclosure. He alleged in a supporting affidavit that, although Nora Brainard's incompetency was known to the town officials, no guardian was appointed until shortly after the foreclosure. Appellant contended that the notice given to Nora Brainard, although in compliance with the statute, was inadequate in the case of a known incompetent, and, therefore, that the statute as applied was repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThe trial court, finding that the incompetent had not been deprived of her constitutional rights and that the statute is valid, denied the motion. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, one judge dissenting, affirmed on the ground that the rights of the parties are fixed after expiration of the 7 weeks and 20 days provided for redemption or answer in 165-a of the tax law. 283 App. Div. 883, 129 N. Y. S. 2d 537. The Court of Appeals, which, as noted before, certified that a question under the Fourteenth Amendment was raised and necessarily decided, likewise affirmed. 308 N. Y. 798, 125 N. E. 2d 862. We noted probable jurisdiction. \n350 \nU.S. 882\n.\n\nAt this stage of the proceedings we are bound, as were the courts below, to assume that the facts are as disclosed by the uncontroverted affidavits filed with appellant's motion for an order to show cause. From these it appears that Nora Brainard was a long-time resident of the Town \n\n[351 \nU.S. 141, 146]\n\u00a0\n of Somers in the State of New York, and a person of means at all times financially able to meet her obligations, owning four pieces of improved real property in addition to the home property which has been taken by foreclosure. She lived alone, however, and had no relative in the State of New York or any other person present or available to assist her or to act in her behalf in connection with her taxes, despite the fact that she was and for upwards of 15 years had been an incompetent. Although she was known by the officials and citizens of the Town of Somers to be a person without mental capacity to handle her affairs or to understand the meaning of any notice served upon her, no attempt was made to have a Committee appointed for her person or property until after entry of the judgment of foreclosure in this proceeding.\n\nAppellee argues that the Fourteenth Amendment does not require the State to take measures in giving notice to an incompetent beyond those deemed sufficient in the case of the ordinary taxpayer.\n\n \"An elementary and fundamental requirement of due process in any proceeding which is to be accorded finality is notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections. . . . [W]hen notice is a person's due, process which is a mere gesture is not due process. The means employed must be such as one desirous of actually informing the absentee might reasonably adopt to accomplish it.\" Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., \n339 \nU.S. 306, 314\n-315.\n\n\n Notice to a person known to be an incompetent who is without the protection of a guardian does not measure up to this requirement. Assuming the truth of the uncontradicted \n\n[351 \nU.S. 141, 147]\n\u00a0\n assertions, that the taxpayer Nora Brainard was wholly unable to understand the nature of the proceedings against her property (from which it must be inferred that she was unable to avail herself of the statutory procedure for redemption or answer), and that the town authorities knew her to be an unprotected incompetent, we must hold that compliance with the statute would not afford notice to the incompetent and that a taking under such circumstances would be without due process of law. The question was appropriately raised and the issue improperly decided against the appellant. The judgment must, therefore, be reversed and the cause remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n   Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Nelson v. City of New York, 283 App. Div. 722, 127 N. Y. S. 2d 854. A subsequent motion to open the default was denied, 284 App. Div. 894, 134 N. Y. S. 2d 597. That action was affirmed by the Court of Appeals, 309 N. Y. 94, 127 N. E. 2d 827, and the case is pending on appeal to this Court, No. 636, O. T. 1955.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Thereafter the town rescheduled the sale of the property at a minimum bid price of $3,500.\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER.\n\nIf the Court of Appeals saw the case as this Court sees it, reversal of its judgment, for the reasons given in the Court's opinion, would be required. My difficulty arises from the fact that this is so clear that I am compelled to wonder whether the New York Court of Appeals whose judges again and again have evinced due regard for due process would, by a summary disposition, sanction such a denial of due process. This Court has had frequent occasion to advert to the darkness which confronts us in trying to determine the meaning of state legislation and the scope of state remedies. This is particularly true when we are vouchsafed no light either from the Appellate Division or the Court of Appeals regarding the availability of subdivision 7 of 165-h of the New York Tax Law in a situation, like the present, so obviously calling for relief as a matter of due process. The uncertainties of state law are not removed by conflicting views expressed at the bar of this Court by New York counsel. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 141, 148]\n\u00a0\n\n\nNor is my difficulty dissipated by the amended remittitur of the New York Court of Appeals. It reads as follows:\n\n\"Upon the appeal herein there was presented and necessarily passed upon a question under the Constitution of the United States, viz., whether the taking by the Town of Somers, of the property here involved, was, on this record, a deprivation of due process and equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court of Appeals held that there was no denial of any constitutional right of the petitioner.\" 308 N. Y. 798, 125 N. E. 2d 862, as amended in 308 N. Y. 941, 127 N. E. 2d 90.\n\n\n To be sure, the Court of Appeals thus held \"that there was no denial of any constitutional right of the petitioner.\" But, as that court said, it was only answering the question that was before it, namely, whether \"on this record\" there was \"a deprivation of due process.\" The court may have reached the conclusion it did because, as a matter of state law, the only thing it deemed before it was a re-opening of the judgment of foreclosure under 165-a, and that remedy was barred by the statute of limitations. Since the State has power to put a time limit on the re-opening of the judgment of foreclosure under that provision, such action is not a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The amended remittitur, thus read, does not preclude a setting aside of the foreclosure deed in a separate proceeding in accordance with 165-h (7), on a recital of circumstances such as those which lead this Court to find a violation of due process.\n\nIf this hypothesis was in fact the basis of the judgment of the Court of Appeals, I assume it to be within the power of that court, when the case is returned, to allow full scope to state remedies still open to the petitioner. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 141, 149]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","21":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCZAPLICKI v. THE HOEGH SILVERCLOUD(1956)\nNo. 342\nArgued: April 24, 1956Decided: June 11, 1956\n\n\n\n\n Petitioner, a longshoreman, was injured in 1945 while working on a ship when steps built by a contractor collapsed, causing him to fall. Shortly thereafter, he elected to accept compensation under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, and an award was made by a Deputy Commissioner. Payments there-under were made by an insurer, which had insured both petitioner's employer and the contractor who had built the steps. In 1952, petitioner filed a libel against the ship, her owners, her operators and the contractor who had built the steps, claiming damages for his injuries on grounds of unseaworthiness and negligence. He also tried unsuccessfully to join the insurer as a party. Held:\n\n 1. An alleged procedural defect in the compensation award was not such as to prejudice petitioner or to deprive the Deputy Commissioner of jurisdiction to enter the award; and the award cannot now be set aside on that ground. Pp. 528-529.\n\n\n 2. Under 33 (b) of the Compensation Act, petitioner's acceptance of the award had the effect of assigning his rights of action against third parties to his employer, to whom the insurer was subrogated; but that did not preclude petitioner from bringing the libel in the circumstances of this case, because petitioner's rights were held by the insurer - the party most likely to suffer from enforcement of those rights. Pp. 529-532.\n\n\n  (a) Even after the assignment, petitioner had an interest in his right of action against third parties, since any recovery must be apportioned between the employee and the assignee under 33 (e). Pp. 530-531.\n\n\n  (b) Though 33 (d) gives the assignee control over enforcement of the employee's right of action against third parties, it should not be construed to enable the assignee to defeat the employee's interest in any possible recovery, where there is such a conflict of interests as exists in this case. Pp. 531-532.\n\n\n  (c) If the insurer is within the court's jurisdiction, it should be made a party to petitioner's suit. P. 532. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 525, 526]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n 3. Under 33 (a), petitioner's election to accept the compensation award instead of proceeding against third parties does not bar this suit in the circumstances of this case. Pp. 532-533.\n\n\n 4. Though the statutes of limitations that might have been applicable had run, petitioner was not necessarily barred by laches on the present record from bringing this suit. Pp. 533-534.\n\n\n  (a) Laches as a defense to an admiralty suit is not to be measured by strict application of statutes of limitations; it depends on the peculiar equitable circumstances of each case. P. 533.\n\n\n  (b) Since the District Court did not consider the defense of laches but dismissed the libel on other grounds, and the Court of Appeals held, on a record that was incomplete on the issue of laches, that it was barred solely because the statutes of limitations had run, the present record is inadequate to justify a holding that this libel is barred by laches. Pp. 533-534.\n\n\n  (c) The existence of laches is a question primarily addressed to the discretion of the trial court; and the case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings. P. 534.\n\n\n 223 F.2d 189, reversed and remanded.\n\nBernard Chazen argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief was Nathan Baker.\n\nJames M. Estabrook argued the cause for The Hoegh Silvercloud et al., respondents. With him on the brief was Francis X. Byrn.\n\nArthur J. Phelan argued the cause for the Hamilton Marine Contracting Co., Inc., respondent. On the brief was Raymond J. Scully.\n\nOpinion of the Court by MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, announced by MR. JUSTICE BURTON.\n\nCzaplicki was injured in 1945 while working as a longshoreman on the \"SS Hoegh Silvercloud,\" a vessel owned by the Norwegian Shipping and Trade Mission and operated by the Kerr Steamship Company. The injury occurred when some steps, constructed by the Hamilton \n\n[351 \nU.S. 525, 527]\n\u00a0\n Marine Contracting Company, gave way, causing Czaplicki to fall about five feet. At the time, Czaplicki was employed by the Northern Dock Company, which was insured for purposes of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act\n1\n by the Travelers Insurance Company. Travelers, which was also the insurer of the Hamilton Company, filed notice with the Compensation Commission that any compensation claim by Czaplicki would be controverted.\n2\n Three weeks after the accident, Czaplicki elected to accept compensation rather than proceed against any third parties, and, one day later, a formal compensation award was entered by a Deputy Commissioner. Payments under the award were made by Travelers.\n\nIn 1952, Czaplicki filed a libel against the vessel, her owners and operators, and the Hamilton Company, claiming damages for his injuries on grounds of unseaworthiness and negligence.\n3\n After various proceedings in the District Court for the Southern District of New York, the libel was dismissed as to all respondents,\n4\n on the ground that Czaplicki was not the proper party libelant, since his election to accept compensation under the award had \n\n[351 \nU.S. 525, 528]\n\u00a0\n operated, under 33 (b) and 33 (i),\n5\n as an assignment to Northern and its insurer, Travelers, of his rights of action against third parties. The District Court also overruled Czaplicki's contention that the compensation award was invalid because of alleged procedural defects,\n6\n and denied his motion to add Travelers \"as party libelant to sue in its behalf and as trustee for libelant,\" or simply to add Travelers as a party.\n7\n The District Court found it unnecessary, in light of this disposition of the case, to consider the defense of laches, which had been interposed by each respondent. The Court of Appeals, affirming the District Court, held the compensation award valid and the libel barred by laches; although it indicated some doubt as to the correctness of the District Court's decision on Czaplicki's right to maintain the suit, it did not pass on that question.\n8\n We granted certiorari, \n350 \nU.S. 872\n, because of the importance of these questions in the administration of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act.\n\n1. Czaplicki seeks to avoid the assignment question by attacking the compensation award itself, on the ground of asserted procedural defects.\n9\n However, we think that \n\n[351 \nU.S. 525, 529]\n\u00a0\n the award must be treated as a valid one. In the first place, the alleged irregularity could not have prejudiced Czaplicki, since it resulted from a failure to afford his employer a procedural benefit which, we assume arguendo, the statute gives. The defect, if any, is one of which only the employer could complain; Czaplicki, who has not been in any way harmed by it, cannot use it as a vehicle for setting aside the award. Secondly, the supposed defect cannot be used to attack collaterally an otherwise valid award. The statute provides a means for contesting action by the Deputy Commissioner in compensation award cases,\n10\n and unless that procedure is followed, the award becomes binding. In short, the defect was not one which would deprive the Deputy Commissioner of jurisdiction to enter an award.\n11\n\u00a0\n\n2. Under 33 (b) of the Compensation Act, Czaplicki's acceptance of the compensation award had the effect of assigning his rights of action against third parties to his employer, Northern. Travelers, as Northern's insurer, was in turn subrogated to all Northern's rights by 33 (i). Travelers, therefore, was the proper party to sue on those rights of action.\n12\n Travelers was also the insurer of \n\n[351 \nU.S. 525, 530]\n\u00a0\n Hamilton, one of the third parties subject to suit. Hamilton had constructed the steps on which the accident occurred, and might be held liable if its negligence was the cause of Czaplicki's injuries; it might also be subject to a claim over by Kerr or the Norwegian Trade Mission if either of them should be held liable. Cf. Ryan Stevedoring Co. v. Pan-Atlantic S. S. Corp., \n350 \nU.S. 124\n. The result is that Czaplicki's rights of action were held by the party most likely to suffer were the rights of action to be successfully enforced. In these circumstances, we cannot agree that Czaplicki is precluded by the assignment of his rights of action from enforcing those rights in an action brought by himself.\n\nAlthough 33 (b) assigns to the employer \"all right of the person entitled to compensation to recover damages\" against third parties when there has been acceptance of compensation under an award, this does not mean that the assignee is entitled to retain all damages in the event of a recovery against a third party. Instead, 33 (e) specifically apportions any such recovery between the assignee and the employee whose right of action it was originally, giving to the former an amount equal to the expenses incurred in enforcing the right, expenses of \n\n[351 \nU.S. 525, 531]\n\u00a0\n medical care for the employee, and any amounts paid and payable as compensation, and to the latter any balance remaining.\n13\n In a very real sense, therefore, the injured employee has an interest in his right of action even after it has been assigned. Normally, this interest will not be inconsistent with that of the assignee, for presumably the assignee will want to recoup the payments made to the employee. Since the assignee's right to recoup comes before the employee's interest, and because the assignee is likely to be in a better position to prosecute any claims against a third party, control over the right of action is given to the assignee, who can either institute proceedings for the recovery of damages against a third person, \"or may compromise with such third person either without or after instituting such proceeding.\" 33 (d), 33 U.S.C. 933 (d). In giving the assignee exclusive control over the right of action, however, we think that the statute presupposes that the assignee's interests will not be in conflict with those of the employee, and that through action of the assignee the employee will obtain his share of the proceeds of the right of action, if there is a recovery. Here, where there is such a conflict of interests, the inaction of the assignee operates to defeat the employee's interest in any possible recovery. Since an action by Travelers would, in effect, be an action against itself, Czaplicki is the only person with sufficient adverse interest to bring suit. In this circumstance, we think the statute should be construed to allow Czaplicki to enforce, in his own name, the rights of action that were his originally. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 525, 532]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe need not go so far as to say that by giving the employee an interest in the proceeds of a third-party action the statute places the assignee in the position of a fiduciary, cf. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co. v. United States, 152 F.2d 46, 48; all we hold is that, given the conflict of interests and inaction by the assignee, the employee should not be relegated to any rights he may have against the assignee, but can maintain the third-party action himself. In so holding, we recognize that one Court of Appeals has held otherwise under this same statute, see Hunt v. Bank Line, 35 F.2d 136, as have certain state courts under similar statutes, see Taylor v. New York Central R. Co., 294 N. Y. 397, 62 N. E. 2d 777; cf. Whalen v. Athol Mfg. Co., 242 Mass. 547, 136 N. E. 600. We think, however, that allowing suit by the employee in these circumstances is the proper way to ensure him the rights given by the Compensation Act.\n\nTravelers is, of course, a proper party to this suit, since any recovery must first go to reimburse it for amounts already paid out. If Travelers is subject to the court's jurisdiction\n14\n it should therefore be made a party, pursuant to Czaplicki's motion, assuming that there has been proper service of process.\n\n3. Respondents contend that since Czaplicki did not, under 33 (a), 33 U.S.C. 933 (a), elect to proceed against third parties, but rather chose to accept compensation, he can in no event revoke this election and maintain this suit. But, as this Court has already pointed out, \"election not to sue a third party and assignment of the cause of action are two sides of the same coin.\" American Stevedores, Inc. v. Porello, \n330 \nU.S. 446, 455\n. Czaplicki can bring this suit not because there has been no assignment, but because in the peculiar facts here there is no \n\n[351 \nU.S. 525, 533]\n\u00a0\n other procedure by which he can secure his statutory share in the proceeds, if any, of his right of action. For the same reason, we hold that the election to accept compensation, as a step toward the compensation award, does not bar this suit.\n\n4. The Court of Appeals found it unnecessary to consider whether Czaplicki could maintain this suit, because it was held barred in any event on account of laches. The only reason given for this holding was that both the New York and New Jersey statutes of limitations, the two that might be applicable, had run. It is well settled, however, that laches as a defense to an admiralty suit is not to be measured by strict application of statutes of limitations; instead, the rule is that \"the delay which will defeat such a suit must in every case depend on the peculiar equitable circumstances of that case.\" The Key City, 14 Wall. 653, 660. In cases where suit has been brought after some lapse of time, the question is whether it would be inequitable, because of the delay, to enforce the claim. Holmberg v. Armbrecht, \n327 \nU.S. 392, 396\n; Southern Pacific Co. v. Bogert, \n250 \nU.S. 483, 488\n-489. \"Where there has been no inexcusable delay in seeking a remedy and where no prejudice to the defendant has ensued from the mere passage of time, there should be no bar to relief.\" Gardner v. Panama R. Co., \n342 \nU.S. 29, 31\n. This does not mean, of course, that the state statutes of limitations are immaterial in determining whether laches is a bar, but it does mean that they are not conclusive, and that the determination should not be made without first considering all the circumstances bearing on the issue.\n\nIn this case, the District Court never passed on the defense of laches, which although properly put in issue was made irrelevant by the holding that, because of the statutory assignment of his right of action, Czaplicki could not maintain this action. Not only was there no decision on laches, but there was never an opportunity \n\n[351 \nU.S. 525, 534]\n\u00a0\n for Czaplicki to introduce evidence to justify the delay, since the suit was dismissed after preliminary hearings and argument on the issue of Czaplicki's \"standing.\"\n\nWhen the case reached the Court of Appeals, therefore, the record was incomplete on the issue of laches. There is nothing in the record to show that Czaplicki was given any more opportunity in the Court of Appeals to explain the delay than he had been given in the District Court.\n15\n The only \"finding\" made by the Court of Appeals\n16\n was that the running of the statutes of limitations constituted laches, and that, as we have stated, was insufficient. From all that appears, Czaplicki may have failed to bring suit earlier because he relied on the assignee of the right of action to enforce what was presumably an interest common to both of them. The record does not disclose when Czaplicki discovered the assignee's conflicting interest, or whether there has been unjustifiable delay since that discovery. Nor has there been opportunity to prove the statement, made in an affidavit to the District Court, that the delay has in no way prejudiced the respondents. These are questions on which the parties should have been allowed to present evidence. The present record is inadequate to justify a holding that this action was barred by laches.\n\nSince \"the existence of laches is a question primarily addressed to the discretion of the trial court,\" Gardner v. Panama R. Co., supra, at p. 30, we remand the case to the District Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n     Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 44 Stat. 1424, as amended, 52 Stat. 1164, 33 U.S.C. 901 et seq.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The only reason given for controverting the claim was: \"Injured is undecided whether or not to sue the 3rd party and reserves the right to controvert for such other reasons as may later appear.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] In 1946, petitioner sued the Kerr Company in the New Jersey state courts, but the suit was dismissed for improper service of process. He brought a second suit against the same company in the New York state courts, but that suit was subsequently discontinued in 1947 by his then attorney. Petitioner claims that the commencement and discontinuance of that suit were without his knowledge. Petitioner had retained his present attorney by October 4, 1948, but the present libel was not filed until 1952.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] 110 F. Supp. 933; 133 F.

Supp. 933.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] 133 F.

In this case, the award was entered only one day after the claim was filed, on the same day that notice was sent to the employer, and no hearing was ordered or held. None of the parties requested a hearing.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] 21, 33 U.S.C. 921.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] Czaplicki also contends that the award made by the Deputy Commissioner was \"little more than a temporary or interlocutory order,\" and should not be considered the kind of award which operates as an assignment. But the record indicates that what the Deputy Commissioner called an \"award\" was in effect just that, and was sufficient to call into play the assignment provisions of the Act.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Moses, \n287 \nU.S. 530\n, was an action at law brought under this Act, which had been made applicable as a workmen's compensation law in the District of Columbia. It was held \n\n[351 \nU.S. 525, 530]\n\u00a0\n that the employer was the proper party to bring the action. Since that case was decided, 33 (i) has been added to the Compensation Act, providing that \"the insurance carrier shall be subrogated to all the rights of the employer under this section.\" 52 Stat. 1168, 33 U.S.C. 933 (i). As noted in the Moses case, 287 U.S., at p. 542, n. 3, it has long been the admiralty rule that the insurer subrogated to the rights of the insured can sue in his own name. See, e. g., Liverpool & Great Western Steam Co. v. Phenix Ins. Co., \n129 \nU.S. 397, 462\n; The Potomac, \n105 \nU.S. 630, 634\n. Travelers was, therefore, the proper party libelant had it chosen to sue in this case. Cf. United States v. Aetna Cas. & Surety Co., \n338 \nU.S. 366, 380\n-381. Doleman v. Levine, \n295 \nU.S. 221\n, again an action at law, is not in point, since in that case, unlike the case at bar, there was no complete assignment of the employee's right of action.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] 33 U.S.C. 933 (e). The \"present value\" of amounts payable by the employer as future compensation and medical benefits is computed and retained by the employer \"as a trust fund to pay such compensation and the cost of such benefits as they become due.\" 33 (e) (D), 33 U.S.C. 933 (e) (D).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] Cf. Ettlinger v. Persian Rug & Carpet Co., 142 N. Y. 189, 36 N. E. 1055.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] In his petition for rehearing to the court below, Czaplicki asked for \"an opportunity to prove the facts which would negative laches,\" although he did not attempt to set forth the facts on which he expected to rely. The petition was denied without opinion.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] Cf. Admiralty Rules, No. 46 1\/2. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 525, 535]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, concurring.\n\nThe disposition of a case is of prime importance to the parties. How a result is reached concerns the rational development of law. I agree with the Court's disposition of this case, but I would dispose of the main issue - the nature of Czaplicki's interest that survives his acceptance of compensation under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, 44 Stat. 1424, as amended, 52 Stat. 1164, 33 U.S.C. 901 et seq. - on the basis of the analysis made in United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co. v. United States, 152 F.2d 46, 48. The reasoning of that case seems to me to carry out the scheme of the legislation with appropriate consistency.\n\n \"So far as concerns the tortfeasor's liability to the  employee beyond the amount of workmen's compensation,  no agreement between the tortfeasor and  the employer can prejudice the employee, because,  although it is true that, by accepting compensation,  the employee assigns his claim against the tortfeasor  to the employer or insurer, the assignee holds it for  the benefit of the employee so far as it is not necessary  for his own recoupment. The assignee is in  effect a trustee, and, although it is true that the  statute gives him power to compromise the whole  claim, he must not, in doing so, entirely disregard the  employee's interest.\" 152 F.2d 46, 48.\n\n\n Although this suit was brought directly against the tortfeasor, the Court directs that Travelers, the subrogee insurer, should be made a party. Since I deem the proper theory on which Czaplicki may recover despite his compensation award to be Travelers' fiduciary responsibility, I would direct reconstruction of this proceeding so that it should be against Travelers, while the vessel would be retained as a party. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 525, 536]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","22":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDARCY v. HANDY(1956)\nNo. 323\nArgued: Decided: June 11, 1956\n\n\n\n\n Petitioner, a state prisoner under a sentence of death for murder committed during the course of an armed robbery, brought a habeas corpus proceeding in a Federal District Court, claiming that his conviction was obtained in violation of his rights to due process of law as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. He charged that he was tried under prejudicial circumstances and improper influences in that an atmosphere of hysteria and prejudice prevailed at the state trial, including the prejudicial conduct and frequent presence in the courtroom of another judge of the same court, who recently had presided over a trial of two associates of petitioner which had resulted in a like conviction and sentence for the murder. Held: On the record in this case, petitioner was not denied due process of law. Pp. 455-467.\n\n (a) The burden was on petitioner to show such essential unfairness as vitiates his trial, and the burden must be sustained not as a matter of speculation but as a demonstrable reality. P. 462.\n\n\n (b) The most that petitioner has shown is that, in certain respects, opportunity for prejudice existed. P. 462.\n\n\n (c) The record does not support the claim that the news coverage of the crime and of the proceedings prior to petitioner's trial created such an atmosphere of hysteria and prejudice as precluded a fair trial. Pp. 463-464.\n\n\n (d) There is no merit in petitioner's claim that he was \"forced\" to trial immediately after the trial of his associates, or in his claim that the trial judge, sua sponte, should have changed the venue or continued the trial. P. 464.\n\n\n (e) On the record in this case, the other judge's presence and conduct on the bench and in the courtroom were not so prejudicial as to deny due process. Pp. 464-467.\n\n\n (f) Petitioner has not sustained the burden of showing that his trial was essentially unfair in a constitutional sense. P. 467.\n\n\n 224 F.2d 504, affirmed. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 454, 455]\n\u00a0\n\n\nCharles J. Margiotti argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief was Morton Witkin.\n\nFrank P. Lawley, Jr., Deputy Attorney General of Pennsylvania, argued the cause for respondents. With him on the brief were Herbert B. Cohen, Attorney General, and Donald W. Van Artsdalen.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BURTON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe question before us is whether the accused, who is under a sentence of death, imposed by a Pennsylvania court and jury for murder committed during the course of an armed robbery, was tried under such prejudicial circumstances and improper influences that he was denied the due process of law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. The charges in this federal habeas corpus proceeding are that an atmosphere of hysteria and prejudice prevailed at the state trial, including the prejudicial conduct and frequent presence in the courtroom of another judge of the same court, who recently had presided over a trial of two associates of petitioner and which had resulted in a like conviction and sentence for the murder committed. For the reasons hereafter stated, we agree with the considered judgments of the state court, Pennsylvania ex rel. Darcy v. Claudy, 367 Pa. 130, 79 A. 2d 785; the Federal District Court, 130 F. Supp. 270; and the Court of Appeals, 224 F.2d 504; holding that the accused was not denied due process of law.\n\nLate on December 22, 1947, petitioner Darcy and three associates, Foster, Zeitz and Capone, armed with revolvers, held up a tavern in Feasterville, near Doylestown, Bucks County, Pennsylvania.\n1\n During the robbery \n\n[351 \nU.S. 454, 456]\n\u00a0\n two patrons of the tavern were shot and severely wounded. As petitioner and his companions left the scene, Zeitz fired at and killed a bystander, William Kelly. About a half hour later, petitioner and his companions committed another armed robbery in which shots also were fired but no one was injured. Before 2 a. m., they were arrested by Philadelphia police. While in that custody, they voluntarily admitted their participation not only in the above robberies but in seven others committed since November 30. In these a total of seven persons had been shot or otherwise injured.\n\nOn January 5, 1948, petitioner and his three companions were brought to Bucks County, charged with the murder of William Kelly and committed, without bail, to await action by the grand jury. On February 10, all four being present and all but one being represented by counsel of his own choice, they were severally indicted for murder. The District Attorney moved for a continuance because Foster was without counsel, and because one prosecution witness was in a critical condition from the wound received at the time of the robbery. The continuance was granted. On March 1, counsel for petitioner and Capone moved for a severance and separate trials. Judge Keller of the nisi prius or trial court (Court of Oyer and Terminer and General Jail Delivery of Bucks County) suggested the advisability of a combination trial, but granted the motions when counsel insisted on their right to them. On March 3, Judge Boyer, of the same court, appointed two local attorneys to represent Foster.\n\nIn March, defense counsel were advised that the Foster-Zeitz case would be called first, petitioner's case the following week, and then Capone's case. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 454, 457]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWhen it became apparent that the Foster-Zeitz trial, which began May 24, would continue into the week of June 1, the court directed the sheriff's office to notify the prospective jurors who had been summoned for June 1 not to appear until June 7. They were so notified and, with one exception, did not appear for duty until the latter date. For the Foster-Zeitz and petitioner's trials, the prospective jurors waited outside the main courtroom, were called in individually and were subjected to a searching examination on voir dire. While neither Foster, Zeitz nor petitioner exercised all of his peremptory challenges, two extra venires were called in order to complete the two juries. No jurors sat in both cases. Once accepted, the respective juries were kept together during each trial under the supervision of court officials. The jurors were not permitted to see newspapers, listen to radios, or see television programs, and were kept free from any outside influence or contact.\n\nAt no time during either the Foster-Zeitz trial or petitioner's trial was the courtroom filled to capacity and at no time was there any need for the court to call for order. No outbursts, disturbances or untoward incidents occurred in the courtroom or elsewhere in the county.\n2\n The proceedings were reported daily in the press and, on occasion, by radio. The reporting was factual, with some editorials.\n3\n The news coverage diminished a few weeks after the robbery, increased and subsided again after the grand-jury proceedings, and increased just before the trials.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, the jury fixes the penalty for murder in the first degree.\n4\n No question was raised as to identity or as to petitioner's participation in the robbery. The strategy of the defense in both trials was to seek to keep the punishment down to life imprisonment. On Friday, \n\n[351 \nU.S. 454, 458]\n\u00a0\n June 4, the jury in the Foster-Zeitz trial returned a verdict of guilty and fixed the penalty at death. After receiving the verdict, the trial judge, Judge Boyer, was, on June 5, quoted in the local newspaper as having said to that jury:\n\n \"`I don't see how you could, under the evidence, have  reached any other verdict. Your verdict may have  a very wholesome effect on other young men in all  vicinities who may come to realize the seriousness of  the folly in which so many young men indulge in  these days. The only hope of stemming the tide of  such crime by youth is to enforce the law which you  have indicated by your decision.'\" 130 F. Supp.,  at 291-292.\n\n\n A few moments earlier, Judge Keller, in discharging the remainder of the May 24 panel, had, in the same courtroom, commended them for their satisfactory verdicts, the last one of which had been an acquittal on a charge of rape.\n\nOn Monday, June 7, petitioner's trial began. The court opened at 10 a.m., with both Judge Boyer and Judge Keller presiding. As usual, miscellaneous business, unrelated to the impending trial, was first disposed of by the court. Petitioner was then arraigned. He pleaded not guilty and, upon Judge Keller's direction, the selection of the jury was commenced. At various times during petitioner's trial, although it was presided over by Judge Keller, Judge Boyer was in attendance, sitting either on the bench with Judge Keller or in the courtroom within the enclosure reserved for attorneys, the parties and the press. In this connection, the Federal District Court found that -\n\n \"By long established tradition in Bucks County, each morning and afternoon at the opening of court both judges take the bench to entertain motions and \n\n[351 \nU.S. 454, 459]\n\u00a0\n other miscellaneous matters in the Criminal, Common Pleas - law and equity - and Orphans Court. Once this work is completed, one of the judges, if engaged in a trial in that court room, remains on the bench; the other judge leaving to perform duties in another court room or in chambers. The practice used in many Pennsylvania courts . . . was continued daily no matter what court was in session or the nature of the trial [but] not on June 4 when Judge Boyer charged the jury [trying Foster and Zeitz]; and . . . not on June 8 and 10.\n\n\n \"The criminal docket . . . a record of individual trials, shows both judges on the bench at 10:00 A.M. May 24 . . . 9:30 A.M. June 2 . . . 10:00 A.M. June 7 . . . . The court reporter's notes of testimony show only one instance of Judge Boyer taking any part whatsoever in the Darcy trial, i. e., during a sidebar discussion out of the hearing of the jury shortly after court convened on Saturday morning, June 12 . . . Under consideration was a difficult question of law on the admissibility of evidence of other offenses . . . in view of the Act of July 3, 1947, P. L. 1239, 19 P. S. Pa. 711 note. Judge Boyer indicated his thinking on the matter. Upon objection by counsel the discussion ended; Judge Keller ruled; Judge Boyer left the bench shortly after and did not return during the remainder of the trial. It may be that during the Foster-Zeitz trial Judge Keller shortly after 9:30 A. M. June 2 . . . listened to but did not express any opinion during a similar discussion.\n\n\n \"Honorable Hiram H. Keller . . . who presided . . . throughout the trial, has certified . . . that after the miscellaneous business was completed. `On several occasions . . . Judge Boyer remained for brief periods while evidence was presented \n\n[351 \nU.S. 454, 460]\n\u00a0\n . . .', and that with the exception of the incident [noted above], `At no other time, during the course of the trial, did Judge Boyer assist, volunteer to assist, or make any suggestions to or otherwise aid the undersigned in the trial of this case.'\n\n\n \"The District Attorney . . . testified, and we find as a fact, that Judge Boyer did not at any time during the Darcy trial assist, attempt to assist, make any suggestion to or in any other manner aid the Commonwealth in the prosecution of the case against David Darcy; that Judge Boyer did not pass any note or message of any kind to the District Attorney in connection with the trial for the use of the District Attorney or Judge Keller.\n\n\n \"On several occasions during the Darcy trial - not on Friday evening or during the charge of the court on Monday, June 14 - Judge Boyer sat for brief intervals on a chair just inside the court room door from the judges' chambers, apparently listening to the proceedings. . . .\n\n\n \"During the Darcy trial Judge Boyer did not at any time sit at or near the table reserved for the press; at or near the table reserved for the District Attorney; at no time did Judge Boyer sit on a chair next to or anywhere near a chair occupied by the District Attorney.\n\n\n \"Throughout the trial, the only chairs occupied by the District Attorney or his assistant were at the table reserved for that purpose, or in chairs immediately in front of the table reserved for the press.\n\n\n \"At no time other than that noted [above] did Judge Boyer take any part whatsoever in the proceedings of the Darcy trial.\" 130 F. Supp., at 296-297.\n\n\n On Monday, June 14, petitioner's case went to the jury. It returned a verdict of guilty and fixed the penalty at death. The subsequent proceedings in this case, extending \n\n[351 \nU.S. 454, 461]\n\u00a0\n over eight years, are summarized in the margin.\n5\n Those proceedings uniformly sustained the State, but we granted certiorari to review the charge now made by petitioner that he was denied due process. \n350 \nU.S. 872\n.\n\nPetitioner's charge is that (a) the news coverage of the robbery and of the proceedings prior to his trial, including the Foster-Zeitz trial and Judge Boyer's reported remarks to the jury in that case, created such an atmosphere of hysteria and prejudice that it prevented him from having a fair trial, (b) notwithstanding that he was granted a severance, he was forced to go to trial within one week of the trial of his companions, Foster and Zeitz, and (c) in the light of (a) and (b) above, Judge Boyer's presence and participation in petitioner's trial prevented him from \n\n[351 \nU.S. 454, 462]\n\u00a0\n being fairly tried since Judge Boyer, in effect, acted as an \"overseer judge\" and effectively guided and influenced petitioner's jury.\n\nPetitioner has been given ample opportunity to prove that he has been denied due process of law. While this Court stands ready to correct violations of constitutional rights, it also holds that \"it is not asking too much that the burden of showing essential unfairness be sustained by him who claims such injustice and seeks to have the result set aside, and that it be sustained not as a matter of speculation but as a demonstrable reality.\" Adams v. United States ex rel. McCann, \n317 \nU.S. 269, 281\n. See also, Buchalter v. New York, \n319 \nU.S. 427, 431\n; Stroble v. California, \n343 \nU.S. 181, 198\n. Justice Holmes, speaking for a unanimous Court in Holt v. United States, \n218 \nU.S. 245, 251\n, cautioned that \"If the mere opportunity for prejudice or corruption is to raise a presumption that they exist, it will be hard to maintain jury trial under the conditions of the present day.\"\n\nWe have examined petitioner's allegations, the testimony and documentary evidence in support thereof, and his arguments. We conclude that the most that has been shown is that, in certain respects, opportunity for prejudice existed. From this we are asked to infer that petitioner was prejudiced. The law recognizes that prejudice may infect any trial and provides protection against it. For example, provision is made for the voir dire examination and for challenges of jurors who indicate that they may be prejudiced. In addition, a substantial number of peremptory challenges is allowed. This gives to each party a large discretion to exclude jurors deemed objectionable for any reason or no reason. Another protection is available through the severance of the trials of the defendants and through continuances of the respective trials. Still another means of protection is that of a change of venue for proper cause. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 454, 463]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn the instant case, notwithstanding the fact that competent counsel for petitioner did not use all of his peremptory challenges after a searching examination of prospective jurors on voir dire, and did not seek a continuance of the trial or a change of venue, petitioner asks this Court, in effect, to infer that the news coverage of the robbery and proceedings prior to petitioner's trial, including the Foster-Zeitz trial, created such an atmosphere of prejudice and hysteria that it was impossible to draw a fair and impartial jury from the community or to hold a fair trial. The failure of petitioner's counsel to exhaust the means provided to prevent the drawing of an unfair trial jury from a community allegedly infected with hysteria and prejudice against petitioner, while not dispositive, is significant.\n6\n Here, the issue was not raised until almost three years after the trial, yet we are asked to read the news reports and the testimony as to other incidents and to find, contrary to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania and two federal courts, that these reports and incidents did create such an atmosphere that it infected the jurors and deprived petitioner of a fair trial on the evidence presented to them. We see no justification in the record to warrant our so finding.\n\nOn the other hand, the Federal District Court, familiar with the local conditions, has found, on the evidence before it, that petitioner's trial was conducted in a calm judicial manner, without any disturbances, and that the news coverage was \"factual, with an occasional descriptive word or phrase, and, on occasion, words of compassion or commendation.\" 130 F. Supp., at 286. It has found that counsel for petitioner conducted a thorough voir dire examination. In all, 49 persons were challenged for cause or excused - 14 for fixed opinion or bias. Petitioner used 10 of the 20 peremptory challenges allowed him, \n\n[351 \nU.S. 454, 464]\n\u00a0\n the Commonwealth only eight. The record shows that counsel for petitioner was informed almost three months before petitioner's trial that petitioner would be tried immediately after Foster and Zeitz, but he made no motion for a continuance\n7\n or for a change of venue. Of the prospective jurors called for service at petitioner's trial, only one was found to have attended the Foster Zeitz trial and that person was challenged for cause. There is nothing in the record to show, as a \"demonstrable reality,\" that petitioner was denied due process of law because of community hysteria and prejudice. The District Court's findings, sustained by the Court of Appeals and supported by the record, dispose of this aspect of the case.\n\nNor do we conclude that petitioner was prevented from obtaining a fair jury trial by reason of Judge Boyer's commendatory remarks to the Foster-Zeitz trial jury, reported in the local press two days before petitioner's trial. At most, petitioner has shown that this created a possible opportunity for prejudice. There is no merit in petitioner's claim that he was \"forced\" to trial immediately after the Foster-Zeitz trial or in his claim that the trial judge should have, sua sponte, changed the venue or continued the trial. See 130 F. Supp., at 292-295.\n\nPetitioner's remaining claim rests largely upon facts which the District Court has found against him. Petitioner alleges that, during the charge to the jury, Judge Boyer passed a note to the District Attorney, who immediately interposed an objection to Judge Keller's charge, and the latter allegedly corrected himself. Petitioner argues that the testimony of the District Attorney and his assistant that they had no recollection of such an incident is insufficient to offset the direct testimony of petitioner's \n\n[351 \nU.S. 454, 465]\n\u00a0\n witnesses that the incident did occur, that Judge Boyer did sit at the table reserved for the press, and that the District Attorney and his assistant sat immediately in front of Judge Boyer. The issue thus raised is largely one of credibility to be determined by the trier of the facts. Hawk v. Olson, \n326 \nU.S. 271, 279\n. The District Court's positive findings on this aspect of the case (at 458-460, supra) find support in the record. We are not justified in upsetting them.\n\nWe also are asked to find that the presence of Judge Boyer on the bench at the beginning of each session of the court, his remaining on the bench after the miscellaneous business was disposed of, and his presence thereafter in the courtroom created such a prejudicial effect upon the jury that it became impossible for it to return a fair verdict and penalty. Except for the one incident where Judge Boyer participated in a sidebar conference out of the hearing of the jury,\n8\n the District Court found that he did not participate in petitioner's trial. Petitioner's counsel objected to Judge Boyer's participation in the sidebar conference\n9\n and he left the bench shortly thereafter.\n\nPetitioner makes much of the fact that the majority opinion of the Court of Appeals states that Judge Boyer's conduct showed a \"striking manifestation of extraordinary interest in the proceedings,\" and that the jury knew who he was and it was \"very probable\" they knew that he had just completed the Foster-Zeitz trial. 224 F.2d, at 508. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 454, 466]\n\u00a0\n We agree with the Court of Appeals that petitioner attaches too much significance to Judge Boyer's conduct. Judge Boyer's presence on the bench, particularly in the light of the long-established practice for both judges to sit on the bench at the beginning of each session to dispose of miscellaneous business, did not amount to a denial of due process. Nor did his subsequent presence on the bench or in the courtroom make out a denial of due process. Under the cases cited earlier,\n10\n petitioner must show that he was prejudiced in some way by the judge's presence. Aside from the sidebar conference and the contested note-passing incident, petitioner relies upon Judge Boyer's statement to the Foster-Zeitz jury and his subsequent remarks made on June 11, in another case, in sentencing another Philadelphia youth, to show that Judge Boyer was \"hostile\" to petitioner and that the jury recognized such hostility. But the remarks on June 11 could not have prejudiced petitioner's jury since that jury had no access to any source of news that reported the incident. Petitioner, thus, is left with Judge Boyer's commendatory remark to the Foster-Zeitz trial jury. This, read in its proper context and examined in the light of Judge Keller's remarks made to the remainder of the jury panel, does not raise a substantial due process question. Petitioner seeks to have this Court speculate that the jurors knew that Judge Boyer had made this statement and that they were prejudiced by it or by Judge Boyer's presence. We can no more speculate on this aspect of the case than on the others. Petitioner's counsel must have been aware of Judge Boyer's statement and of its possible effect, if any, on the jury, and the possible effect of Judge Boyer's manifestation of interest. However, he took no action to prevent this possibility from infecting petitioner's trial. Accordingly, we may as well \n\n[351 \nU.S. 454, 467]\n\u00a0\n speculate that he did not deem it necessary to take any such action because the possibility of prejudice was too remote to justify it. It is not necessary for this Court to enter into such speculations. Petitioner has not sustained the burden resting upon him to show that his trial was essentially unfair in a constitutional sense and that the several courts which have reviewed it are all in error. The judgment of the Court of Appeals, therefore, is\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] This statement of facts and review of the relevant procedural steps in the case are taken largely from the opinion rendered in the instant case by the two judges constituting the United States District \n\n[351 \nU.S. 454, 456]\n\u00a0\n Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. 130 F.

Supp., at 296, n. 54.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] See cases cited at 462, supra.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, whom MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS join, dissenting.\n\nI would reverse the judgment below on the basis of Judge Boyer's conduct. The central facts against which this conduct must be viewed are that: (1) Zeitz, not petitioner, did the actual killing on which petitioner's trial was based, and (2) petitioner's participation in the robbery being uncontested, the only real issue at his trial was whether he should suffer the death penalty or life imprisonment, which, under the Pennsylvania statute, was a question for the jury. If these facts be kept in mind, I think that the Court, in holding that the case presents no violation of due process, has disposed of Judge Boyer's conduct too lightly.\n\nThe Court states that the general atmosphere of the trial was not prejudicial, that Judge Boyer's remarks to the Foster-Zeitz jury raise no substantial due process questions, and that we should not disturb the District Court's findings that the alleged note-passing incident did not occur and that Judge Boyer's participation in the trial was limited to the \"sidebar\" episode. Accepting this, as I do, it does not end the matter for me, for there still remain these undisputed facts, and the inferences which I think should be drawn from them: The crime was a particularly atrocious one, and Judge Boyer shared \n\n[351 \nU.S. 454, 468]\n\u00a0\n the community sense of outrage over it.\n1\n The trial took place in a small rural community of which Judge Boyer had been a respected member for many years, and he was presumably known to the jurors, at least by reputation. Judge Boyer, as it is fair to assume the jurors knew, had presided over the Foster-Zeitz trial in which the jury, three days before petitioner's trial began, had returned a death verdict against two of petitioner's associates in this crime.\n2\n Judge Boyer remained in the courtroom at petitioner's trial beyond the call of duty, and his presence there on some days after other matters had been disposed of was wholly unexplained. On such occasions he sat not with the ordinary spectators, but sometimes on the bench \n\n[351 \nU.S. 454, 469]\n\u00a0\n and other times within the bar in full view of the jury. The \"sidebar\" conference, in which Judge Boyer participated, was in sight of the jury. Judge Boyer was in the courtroom during the court's charge. From these admitted facts, I consider that the jury must have been conscious of the unusual interest which Judge Boyer had in the case, and that it might well have concluded that he felt the defendant should be dealt with severely.\n\nHaving regard to the character of the issue with which the jury was confronted, I think these undisputed facts, and the inferences which may be drawn from them, require us to hold that the petitioner has been denied due process. I cannot say that the support lent to the prosecution by Judge Boyer's manifest interest in the trial might not have tipped the scales with the jury in favor of a death verdict, and in a capital case I would resolve that doubt in favor of a new trial. The reasons for my conclusion are those which Judge Kalodner has well stated in his dissenting opinion in the Court of Appeals, 224 F.2d 504, 509. We should be especially scrupulous in seeing to it that the right to a fair trial has not been jeopardized by the conduct of a member of the judiciary.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In imposing sentence in a case tried during petitioner's trial, Judge Boyer said (as reported by a local newspaper the next day): \"We don't propose to nail all our property fast here in Bucks county just because thieves from Philadelphia want to pick up everything which isn't being watched. . . . What business did you have to come up here in the first place? . . . Have you heard what's going on downstairs [referring to petitioner's trial]? . . . Do you want to wind up like that? . . . We in Bucks county are tired of you Philadelphians who don't know how to behave. We have to bear the expense and we propose to stop it.\" Since petitioner's jury had no access to this newspaper, these statements could not have affected his trial. But they are indicative of Judge Boyer's sentiments, and of community reaction.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The local newspaper reported the following on the day after the Foster-Zeitz trial ended:  \"JUDGE BOYER PRAISES JURY FOR VERDICT CONDEMNING 2 KILLERS    TO ELECTRIC CHAIR  .  .  .  .  . \"`I don't see how you could, under the evidence, have reached any other verdict,' Judge Boyer said. \"`Your verdict may have a very wholesome effect on other young men in all vicinities who may come to realize the seriousness of the folly in which so many young men indulge these days. \"`The only hope of stemming the tide of such crime by youth is to enforce the law which you have indicated by your decision,' Judge Boyer said.\" \n\n[351 \nU.S. 454, 470]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","23":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDe SYLVA v.

Klein was with him on the motion for leave to filed this brief.\n\nOpinion of the Court by MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, announced by MR. JUSTICE BURTON.\n\nThe present Copyright Act\n1\n provides for a second 28-year copyright after the expiration of the original 28-year term, if application for renewal is made within one year before the expiration of the original term. This right to renew the copyright appears in 24 of the Act:\n\n \"And provided further, That in the case of any other copyrighted work, . . . the author of such work, if still living, or the widow, widower, or children of the author, if the author be not living, or if such author, widow, widower, or children be not living, then the author's executors, or in the absence of a will, his next of kin shall be entitled to a renewal and extension of the copyright in such work for a further term of twenty-eight years when application \n\n[351 \nU.S. 570, 572]\n\u00a0\n for such renewal and extension shall have been made to the copyright office and duly registered therein within one year prior to the expiration of the original term of copyright . . . .\"\n\n\n In this case, an author who secured original copyrights on numerous musical compositions died before the time to apply for renewals arose. He was survived by his widow and one illegitimate child, who are both still living. The question this case presents is whether that child is entitled to share in the copyrights which come up for renewal during the widow's lifetime.\n\nRespondent, the child's mother, brought this action on the child's behalf against the widow, who is the petitioner here, seeking a declaratory judgment that the child has an interest in the copyrights already renewed by the widow and those that will become renewable during her lifetime, and for an accounting of profits from such copyrights as have been already renewed. The District Court, holding that the child was within the meaning of the term \"children\" as used in the statute but that the renewal rights belonged exclusively to the widow, gave judgment for the widow. Agreeing with the District Court on the first point, the Court of Appeals reversed holding that on the author's death both widow and child shared in the renewal copyrights. 226 F.2d 623. Because of the great importance of these questions in the administration of the Copyright Act, we granted certiorari, \n350 \nU.S. 931\n.\n\nThe controversy centers around the words \"or the widow, widower, or children of the author, if the author be not living.\" Two questions are involved: (1) do the widow and children take as a class, or in order of enumeration, and (2) if they take as a class, does \"children\" include an illegitimate child. Strangely enough, these \n\n[351 \nU.S. 570, 573]\n\u00a0\n questions have never before been decided, although the statutory provisions involved have been part of the Act in their present form since 1870.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nThe widow first contends that, after the death of the author, she alone is entitled to renew copyrights during her lifetime, exclusive of any interest in \"children\" of the author. That is, she interprets the clause as providing for the passing of the renewal rights, on the death of the author, first to the widow, and then only after her death to the \"children\" of the author. If the word \"or\" which follows \"widower\" is to be read in its normal disjunctive sense, this is not an unreasonable interpretation of the statute, which might then well be read to mean that \"children\" are to renew only if there is no \"widow\" or \"widower.\" The statute is hardly unambiguous, however, and presents problems of interpretation not solved by literal application of words as they are \"normally\" used. The statute must be read as a whole, and putting each word in its proper context we are unable to say, as the widow contends we should, that the clear purport of the clause in question is the same as if it read \"or the widow, or widower, if the author be not living, or the children of the author, if the author, and widow or widower, be not living.\"\n\nWe start with the proposition that the word \"or\" is often used as a careless substitute for the word \"and\"; that is, it is often used in phrases where \"and\" would express the thought with greater clarity. That trouble with the word has been with us for a long time: see, e. g., United States v. Fisk, 3 Wall. 445. In this instance, we need look no further than the very next clause in this same section of the Copyright Act for an example of this careless usage: \". . . or if such author, widow, widower \n\n[351 \nU.S. 570, 574]\n\u00a0\n or children be not living, then the author's executors . . . .\" If the italicized \"or\" in that clause is read disjunctively, then the author's executors would be entitled to renew the copyright if any one of the persons named \"be not living.\" It is clear, however, that the executors do not succeed to the renewal interest unless all of the named persons are dead, since from the preceding clause it is at least made explicit that the \"widow, widower, or children of the author\" all come before the executors, after the author's death. The clause would be more accurate, therefore, were it to read \"author, widow or widower, and children.\" It is argued with some force, then, that if in the succeeding clause the \"or\" is to be read as meaning \"and\" in the same word grouping as is involved in the clause in question, it should be read that way in this clause as well. If this is done, it is then an easy step to read \"widow\" and \"children\" as succeeding to the renewal interest as a class, as the Court of Appeals held they did.\n\nThis Court has already traced the development of the renewal term in the several copyright statutes enacted in this country. See Fred Fisher Music Co. v. M. Witmark & Sons, \n318 \nU.S. 643\n, where it was held that the author, during his lifetime, could make a binding assignment of the expectancy in his future rights of renewal. The first federal statute, the Act of May 31, 1790, 1 Stat. 124, did not allow renewal by anyone except the author. In 1831, however, a new Act was passed, which for the first time gave to the author's family the right to renew after his death. Act of February 3, 1831, 4 Stat. 436. Section 2 of that Act provided:\n\n \"That if, at the expiration of the aforesaid term of years, such author . . . be still living, and a citizen . . . of the United States, or resident therein, or being dead, shall have left a widow, or child, or \n\n[351 \nU.S. 570, 575]\n\u00a0\n children, either or all then living, the same exclusive right shall be continued to such author . . ., or, if dead, then to such widow and child, or children, for the further term of fourteen years . . . .\" (Italics supplied.)\n\n\n It is significant that this statute, which instituted the present scheme of allowing a copyright to be renewed after the author's death, provided for the renewal interest in the \"widow and child, or children,\" rather than in the widow or children separately. Petitioner concedes that under this statute the widow and children took as a class. This statute marked a major development in this phase of copyright legislation and created a system which, in its basic form, has been continued even to the present statute.\n\nSection 88 of the Act of July 8, 1870, 16 Stat. 212, in consolidating the language of 2 of the 1831 Act, made one important change in the language of the renewal section: the right of renewal was given to the author's widow or children, rather than to the widow and children. The section read as follows:\n\n \"That the author, . . . . if he be still living and a citizen of the United States or resident therein, or his widow or children, if he be dead, shall have the same exclusive right continued for the further term of fourteen years . . . .\" (Italics supplied.)\n\n\n This section became 4954 of the Revised Statutes, and was amended in 1891, 26 Stat. 1107, by deleting the requirement that the author be a citizen or resident of the United States. The section was otherwise left intact. The present renewal provision appeared first as 23 of the Copyright Act of March 4, 1909, 35 Stat. 1080, and was continued without change in 17 U.S.C. 24.\n\nKnowing, as we do, that \"or\" can be ambiguous when used in such a context as this, it is difficult to say that \n\n[351 \nU.S. 570, 576]\n\u00a0\n the change made in the 1870 Copyright Act had the effect of changing, as petitioner contends it did, the children's interest from an interest shared with the widow to one which became effective only after her death. There is no legislative history, either when the 1870 Act was passed or in the subsequent sessions of Congress, to indicate that Congress in fact intended to change in this respect the existing scheme of distribution of the renewal rights. Rather, what scant material there is indicates that no substantial changes in the Act were intended.\n2\n It would not seem unlikely that the framers of the 1870 statute, interested in compressing the somewhat cumbersome phrasing of the prior Copyright Act, simply deleted the words \"and child\" with the thought that the remaining phrase \"or children\" expressed precisely the same result, leaving unaffected the rights of the author's children which had been the same for almost forty years.\n\nWe then come to the 1909 Copyright Act. By 23 of that Act, now 17 U.S.C. 24, there were added to those entitled to renewal rights after the author's death - the widow or children - the author's executors, or, in the absence of a will, his next of kin. Each of these named classes is separated in the statute by a condition precedent to the passing of the renewal rights, namely, that the persons named in the preceding class be deceased. As already noted, it is at least clear that, if the author and his widow have both died, survived by a child, that child is entitled to renew copyrights maturing during his lifetime. But if this interest were to take effect only after the death of the widow, it might be expected that the drafters of the Act would have separated \"widow or widower\" from \"children\" with the same condition precedent used in defining the succession of the other classes to the renewal rights, since it would in effect be placing the children \n\n[351 \nU.S. 570, 577]\n\u00a0\n in a class lower than that occupied by the widow or widower. Granting that the absence of this structure might simply have been due to carelessness in adding the new class to the prior renewal section, we think it may nevertheless be taken as some indication that the widow and children are to take the right to renew at the same time.\n\nThe Solicitor General has filed a helpful brief on behalf of the Register of Copyrights, as amicus curiae, in which the administrative practice of the Copyright Office is discussed. It appears that the Regulations issued under the 1909 Act, in force until 1948 (when new Regulations, not touching on this point, were issued), allowed the children of the author to apply for copyright renewals after the author's death along with the widow or widower - that is, the children were not treated as being entitled to renewal only after the death of the widow or widower.\n3\n The practice of the Copyright Office has been to register renewal claims by children during the lifetime of an author's widow or widower, although this practice, it is frankly admitted, is more the result of a decision that there is substantial doubt over the question, rather than the result of a confident interpretation of the statute as treating widows, widowers, and children as members of one class. Although we would ordinarily give weight to the interpretation \n\n[351 \nU.S. 570, 578]\n\u00a0\n of an ambiguous statute by the agency charged with its administration, cf. Mazer v. Stein, \n347 \nU.S. 201, 211\n-213, we think the Copyright Office's explanation of its practice deprives the practice of any force as an interpretation of the statute, and we therefore do not rely on it in this instance.\n\nPetitioner and several of the associations which have filed amicus briefs point out that the \"universal\" interpretation of 24 has been that children are entitled to renewal only after the death of the widow or widower. In light of the Copyright Office practice alone, that is obviously an overstatement. Nevertheless, had there been a long-standing consistent attitude by the specialists in this field of law, and a more adequate basis for it than exists here, we might hesitate to overturn what had come to be a generally accepted view of a statute having such important consequences. But we cannot escape the conclusion that, in this instance, any such reliance on that interpretation of the Act was misplaced: the statute is far from clear, the Copyright Office has recognized its ambiguity, renewal applications have for many years been filed by children before the death of the widow or widower, and more than one qualified commentator has either expressed doubt on the question or has concluded that the widow or widower and children take as a class.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nNor is it possible for us to say, as petitioner suggests, that the only way to satisfy the congressional purpose is to hold that, during her lifetime, the widow has exclusive renewal rights. Petitioner argues that the statute, contemplating the normal situation of a widow taking care \n\n[351 \nU.S. 570, 579]\n\u00a0\n of her children, gives the widow exclusive control of the copyright on the author's death, since she is presumably more capable of dealing with it and will more likely be in need of the copyright income. This branch of the argument, however, becomes very much diluted when it is observed that, if the deceased author be a woman, the statute disposes of the renewal rights in the same manner as if the author were a male. It is further argued that since the value of the copyright depends to an appreciable extent on the ability to convey clear publication rights, the statute should not be construed to diminish the value of the copyright by scattering its ownership, which might make it difficult to transfer clear title. One difficulty with this argument is that it ignores the 1831 statute, which, as petitioner recognizes, divided the ownership of the renewal rights between the surviving spouse of the author and his children. What we are asked to do is to avoid, on policy grounds, an interpretation of the successor statute which embodies the policy of the earlier Act, a policy which Congress saw fit to effectuate at least until 1870, and which, if changed then, was changed without any discernible display of dissatisfaction with that policy. This is not the type of case where we can use, as a guide to statutory interpretation, an unwillingness to attribute to Congress results which on their face are harsh, or present constitutional difficulties, or which are so extraordinary that clear, unambiguous wording is required. Cf. United States v. Minker, \n350 \nU.S. 179\n. In view of this explicit prior legislation, this Court should not transfuse the successor statute with a gloss of its own choosing, especially where the choice between the alternative policies is as close as this one.\n5\n\u00a0\n\n[351 \nU.S. 570, 580]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWhile the matter is far from clear, we think, on balance, the more likely meaning of the statute to be that adopted by the Court of Appeals, and we hold that, on the death of the author, the widow and children of the author succeed to the right of renewal as a class, and are each entitled to share in the renewal term of the copyright.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nWe come, then, to the question of whether an illegitimate child is included within the term \"children\" as used in 24. The scope of a federal right is, of course, a federal question, but that does not mean that its content is not to be determined by state, rather than federal law. Cf. Reconstruction Finance Corp. v. Beaver County, \n328 \nU.S. 204\n; Board of County Commissioners v. United States, \n308 \nU.S. 343, 351\n-352. This is especially true where a statute deals with a familial relationship; there is no federal law of domestic relations, which is primarily a matter of state concern.\n\nIf we look at the other persons who, under this section of the Copyright Act, are entitled to renew the copyright after the author's death, it is apparent that this is the general scheme of the statute. To decide who is the widow or widower of a deceased author, or who are his executors or next of kin, requires a reference to the law of the State which created those legal relationships. The word \"children,\" although it to some extent describes a purely physical relationship, also describes a legal status not unlike the others. To determine whether a child has been legally adopted, for example, requires a reference to state law. We think it proper, therefore, to \n\n[351 \nU.S. 570, 581]\n\u00a0\n draw on the ready-made body of state law to define the word \"children\" in 24. This does not mean that a State would be entitled to use the word \"children\" in a way entirely strange to those familiar with its ordinary usage, but at least to the extent that there are permissible variations in the ordinary concept of \"children\" we deem state law controlling. Cf. Seaboard Air Line Railway v. Kenney, \n240 \nU.S. 489\n.\n6\n\u00a0\n\nThis raises two questions: first, to what State do we look, and second, given a particular State, what part of that State's law defines the relationship. The answer to the first question, in this case, is not difficult, since it appears from the record that the only State concerned is California, and both parties have argued the case on that assumption. The second question, however, is less clear. An illegitimate child who is acknowledged by his father, by a writing signed in the presence of a witness, is entitled under 255 of the California Probate Code\n7\n to inherit his father's estate as well as his mother's. The District Court found that the child here was within the \n\n[351 \nU.S. 570, 582]\n\u00a0\n terms of that section. Under California law the child is not legitimate for all purposes, however; compliance with 230 of the Civil Code\n8\n is necessary for full legitimation, and there are no allegations in the complaint sufficient to bring the child within that section. Hence, we may take it that the child is not \"adopted\" in the sense that he is to be regarded as a legitimate child of the author.\n\nConsidering the purposes of 24 of the Copyright Act, we think it sufficient that the status of the child is that described by 255 of the California Probate Code. The evident purpose of 24 is to provide for the family of the author after his death. Since the author cannot assign his family's renewal rights, 24 takes the form of a compulsory bequest of the copyright to the designated persons. This is really a question of the descent of property, and we think the controlling question under state law should be whether the child would be an heir of the author. It is clear that under 255 the child is, at least to that extent, included within the term \"children.\"\n\nFinally, there remains the question of what are the respective rights of the widow and child in the copyright renewals, once it is accepted that they both succeed to the renewals as members of the same class. Since the parties have not argued this point, and neither court below has passed on it, we think it should not be decided at this time.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 61 Stat. 652, 17 U.S.C. 1 et seq.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See Cong. Globe, 41st Cong., 2d Sess. 2680, 2854 (1870).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] 37 CFR, 1938, 201.24 (a): \"Application for the renewal of a subsisting copyright may be filed within 1 year prior to the expiration of the existing term by: \"(1) The author of the work if still living; \"(2) The widow, widower, or children of the author if the author is not living; \"(3) The author's executor, if such author, widow, widower, or children be not living; \"(4) If the author, widow, widower, and children are all dead, and the author left no will, then the next of kin.\" See 48, Copyright Office Bulletin No. 15 (1913); 46, Copyright Office Bulletin No. 15 (1910).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] See, e. g., Chafee, Reflections on the Law of Copyright, 45 Col.

Rev. 712, 717; Tannenbaum, Practical Problems in Copyright, 7 Copyright Problems Analyzed (CCH) 7, 12 (1952). But see, e. g., Nicholson, A Manual of Copyright Practice, 195, 196; De Wolf, An Outline of Copyright Law, 66.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Petitioner also argues that since the statute does not specifically provide for an allocation, as between the widow or widower and children, of their respective interests in the renewal copyrights, it should not be read as providing for their succeeding to the renewal \n\n[351 \nU.S. 570, 581]\n\u00a0\n rights as a class. But neither did the 1831 Act provide for a division of the copyright between widow and child or children; nor does the present Act allocate the renewal rights as between those included in the term \"next of kin.\" The absence of such a provision, therefore, is not persuasive as an aid to interpretation of the statute.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Petitioner relies on McCool v. Smith, 1 Black 459, for the proposition that a general statutory reference to \"children\" means only legitimate children. The actual decision in that case, decided in 1862, concerned only the interpretation of a state statute, and we do not consider it controlling here. Cf. Hutchinson Investment Co. v. Caldwell, \n152 \nU.S. 65, 70\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] \"Every illegitimate child is an heir of his mother, and also of the person who, in writing, signed in the presence of a competent witness, acknowledges himself to be the father, and inherits his or her estate, in whole or in part, as the case may be, in the same manner as if he had been born in lawful wedlock; but he does not represent his father by inheriting any part of the estate of the father's kindred, either lineal or collateral, unless, before his death, his parents shall have intermarried, and his father, after such marriage, acknowledges him as his child, or adopts him into his family; in which case such child is deemed legitimate for all purposes of succession. An illegitimate child may represent his mother and may inherit any part of the estate of the mother's kindred, either lineal or collateral.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] \"The father of an illegitimate child, by publicly acknowledging it as his own, receiving it as such, with the consent of his wife, if he is married, into his family, and otherwise treating it as if it were a legitimate child, thereby adopts it as such; and such child is thereupon deemed for all purposes legitimate from the time of its birth. The foregoing provisions of this Chapter do not apply to such an adoption.\" \n\n[351 \nU.S. 570, 583]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom MR. JUSTICE BLACK joins, concurring.\n\nThe meaning of the word \"children\" as used in 24 of the Copyright Act is a federal question. Congress could of course give the word the meaning it has under the laws of the several States. See Hutchinson Investment Co. v. Caldwell, \n152 \nU.S. 65, 68\n-69; Poff v. Pennsylvania R. Co., \n327 \nU.S. 399, 401\n. But I would think the statutory policy of protecting dependents would be better served by uniformity, rather than by the diversity which would flow from incorporating into the Act the laws of forty-eight States. Cf. Clearfield Trust Co. v. United States, \n318 \nU.S. 363, 367\n; National Metropolitan Bank v. United States, \n323 \nU.S. 454, 456\n; Heiser v. Woodruff, \n327 \nU.S. 726, 732\n; United States v. Standard Oil Co., \n332 \nU.S. 301, 307\n.\n\nAn illegitimate child was given the benefits of the Federal Death Act by Middleton v. Luckenbach S. S. Co., 70 F.2d 326, 329-330, where the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit said:\n\n \"There is no right of inheritance involved here. It is a statute that confers recovery upon dependents, not for the benefit of an estate, but for those who by our standards are legally or morally entitled to support. Humane considerations and the realization that children are such no matter what their origin alone might compel us to the construction that, under present day conditions, our social attitude warrants a construction different from that of the early English view. The purpose and object of the statute is to continue the support of dependents after a casualty. To hold that these children or the parents do not come within the terms of the act would be to defeat the purposes of the act. The benefit conferred beyond being for such beneficiaries is for \n\n[351 \nU.S. 570, 584]\n\u00a0\n society's welfare in making provision for the support of those who might otherwise become dependent. The rule that a bastard is nullius filius applies only in cases of inheritance. Even in that situation we have made very considerable advances toward giving illegitimates the right of capacity to inherit by admitting them to possess inheritable blood.\"\n\n\n I would take the same approach here and, regardless of state law, hold that illegitimate children were \"children\" within the meaning of 24 of the Copyright Act, whether or not state law would allow them dependency benefits.\n\nWith this exception, I join in the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n\n[351 \nU.S. 570, 1]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","24":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDENVER & R.

The Rio Grande, considering itself aggrieved both because of the geographical limitations of the order and because joint rates were not established for all commodities, challenged the order in the Federal District Court in Colorado. The court set aside the order on the ground that there was no substantial evidence to support the Commission's finding that through routes were not in existence. Held: The Commission's conclusion that the through routes claimed were not in existence was supported by substantial evidence, and it was error for the Colorado District Court to set aside the Commission's finding and to remand the case to the Commission. Pp. 323-330.\n\n2. \nThe Union Pacific, considering itself aggrieved because the Commission's order required establishment of some through routes and joint rates, challenged the order in the Federal District Court in Nebraska.

Held: The judgment of the Nebraska District Court is affirmed insofar as it \n\n[351 \nU.S. 321, 322]\n\u00a0\n affirmed the order of the Commission, and is reversed insofar as it refused to enforce the Commission's order. Pp. 330-335.\n\n (a) The Commission cannot be deemed to have acted in excess of its authority in concluding, on the evidence before it, that through routes and joint rates on the specified commodities were needed to provide adequate and more economic transportation and were necessary in the public interest.

JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThese cases all involve the validity of a single order of the Interstate Commerce Commission establishing through railroad routes and prescribing joint through rates for carriage of certain goods over the routes. The Commission's order was made after lengthy hearings upon complaint of the Denver & Rio Grande Western Railroad Company. The Rio Grande's main line runs from Ogden, Salt Lake City, and Provo, Utah, across much of Colorado to Denver, Pueblo, and Trinidad. The chief controversy involved in this case is between the Rio Grande and the Union Pacific Railroad Company. The Union Pacific lines which are relevant here run from points in Washington and Oregon through Idaho, Utah, Wyoming, Colorado, Kansas, and Nebraska, going as far east as Omaha and Kansas City. The Union Pacific and Rio Grande connect at Ogden, Salt Lake City, and Provo, Utah, and at Denver, Colorado. The connection at Ogden is known \n\n[351 \nU.S. 321, 324]\n\u00a0\n as the Ogden Gateway, meaning the gateway between the northwestern states served by the Union Pacific and states to the south and east served by the Rio Grande. The Union Pacific has used its strategic position in the northwest territory in such a way that practically all traffic between the Northwest, Denver and points east and south of Denver goes over its lines. For this reason the Northwest is often referred to as \"closed door\" territory. This situation caused the Rio Grande to file its complaint with the Commission. It charged that the Union Pacific had agreements with other connecting railroads named defendants under which goods could be carried to and from the Northwest at joint through rates, but that the only way the Rio Grande could carry goods to and from this area was by exacting higher \"combination rates,\" which are the sum of local rates. These high rates practically bar the Rio Grande as a connecting carrier for through shipments to and from the Northwest. The Rio Grande asked the Commission to order the Union Pacific to establish and maintain for the future \"just, reasonable and non-discriminatory competitive joint through rates\" with the Rio Grande. It charged that the Union Pacific's failure to establish and maintain such rates violated 1 (4), 3, 15 (1), and 15 (3) of the Interstate Commerce Act.\n1\n Section 15 (1) authorizes the Commission to proscribe individual or joint rates or practices that are \"unjust or unreasonable or unjustly discriminatory or unduly preferential or prejudicial\" and to prescribe rates and practices that are \"just, fair, and reasonable.\" Section 15 (3) empowers the Commission to establish \n\n[351 \nU.S. 321, 325]\n\u00a0\n through routes and joint rates whenever deemed by the Commission \"to be necessary or desirable in the public interest.\" Section 15 (4), which is very important in this controversy, places restrictive conditions upon the Commission's power to establish through routes under 15 (3) when the establishment of a through route would require a railroad \"without its consent, to embrace in such route substantially less than the entire length of its railroad and of any intermediate railroad operated in conjunction and under a common management or control therewith, which lies between the termini of such proposed through route . . . .\"\n2\n This provision is generally referred to as a prohibition against making a railroad \"short-haul\" itself. Among other findings the Commission must make under 15 (4) before establishing a through route which requires a railroad to short-haul itself is that the new route \"is needed in order to provide adequate, and more efficient or more economic, transportation . . . .\"\n\nThe Rio Grande's petition before the Commission alleged that through routes with the Union Pacific already existed through the Ogden Gateway. It contended that they had been created and used by the Union Pacific. On this basis Rio Grande claimed that the restrictive conditions of 15 (4) did not apply and that the Commission need not concern itself with those conditions but should proceed to establish reasonable joint rates under 15 (3). After hearing much evidence the Commission rejected this contention and found that the through routes claimed by Rio Grande did not exist.\n3\n The Commission went on to find, however, that through routes should be established with reference to certain commodities such as fruits, \n\n[351 \nU.S. 321, 326]\n\u00a0\n perishable foods, and livestock in a limited geographical area. The Commission found in accordance with 15 (4) that these new routes were needed \"to provide adequate and more economic transportation . . . .\" It also found as required by 15 (3) that through routes and joint rates for the specified commodities were \"necessary and desirable in the public interest.\" 287 I. C. C. 611, 659.\n\nOn the basis of its findings the Commission ordered the Union Pacific to establish through routes for the specified commodities and to establish joint rates the same as applied on its own and other connecting lines. The Union Pacific considered itself aggrieved because the order required establishment of some through routes and joint rates. The Rio Grande considered itself aggrieved both because of the geographical limitations of the Commission's order and because joint rates were not established for all commodities. The Union Pacific challenged the ICC order in a three-judge United States District Court in Nebraska and the Rio Grande challenged it in a three-judge United States District Court in Colorado. See 28 U.S.C. 1336, 2284, 2321-2325. The Colorado court upset the order on a single ground. It held that there was no substantial evidence to support the finding that through routes were not in existence. Had the Commission found there were established through routes, the Colorado court reasoned, much broader relief for the Rio Grande might have been ordered, since the restrictions of 15 (4) would not have been applicable. Consequently the Colorado court remanded the case to the Commission for further consideration. 131 F. Supp. 372. The Nebraska court accepted the Commission's finding that no through routes were in existence. It then held that there was evidence before the Commission sufficient to support the finding under 15 (4) that through routes were needed \"in order to provide adequate and more economic transportation\" for specified commodities shipped from \n\n[351 \nU.S. 321, 327]\n\u00a0\n the Northwest to initial destination points on the Rio Grande for \"in-transit privileges incident to reshipment to points east of Denver . . . .\" 132 F. Supp. 72, 82. The Nebraska court declined, however, to sustain the Commission's action with reference to shipments not requiring such transit services. Both District Court decrees are now before us on direct appeal under 28 U.S.C. 1253 and 2101 (b). They were consolidated for oral argument and we treat them together here. It is convenient to take up first the Colorado court's holding.\n\nIn considering the question of through routes under 15 (4) we begin with our recent holdings and opinions in Thompson v. United States, \n343 \nU.S. 549\n; United States v. Great Northern R. Co., \n343 \nU.S. 562\n. We there emphasized the purpose of 15 (4) to bar the Commission from compelling railroads to establish through routes resulting in trunkline \"short-hauls\" without faithful observance of restrictive conditions imposed by that section. At the same time we recognized that Commission action is not necessary to the creation of through routes. We pointed out that a through route is ordinarily a voluntary arrangement, express or implied, between connecting carriers, and that the existence of such an arrangement depends on the circumstances of particular cases. We said in Thompson v. United States, supra, at 557, that \"In short, the test of the existence of a `through route' is whether the participating carriers hold themselves out as offering through transportation service.\" Findings of through routes can therefore be made on the basis of express agreements between carriers or on the basis of inferences drawn from continuous practices sufficient to show that through routes exist even though not provided for in formal contracts or tariffs. The question in each case is one of fact. Cf. Through Routes and Through Rates, 12 I. C. C. 163, 166-167. The Colorado court viewed the evidence here as showing beyond dispute the \n\n[351 \nU.S. 321, 328]\n\u00a0\n existence of through routes both by formal tariffs and by long railroad practices. Whether the evidence could have justified the Commission in finding the existence of through routes we need not determine. We are satisfied, however, that the evidence before the Commission did not compel it to make such a finding and that its conclusion that the through routes claimed were not in existence is supported by substantial evidence.\n\nThere was evidence that as early as 1897 the Union Pacific and lines it controlled did establish through routes to and from points in the \"closed\" northwest territory through the Ogden Gateway, and did establish joint through rates with the Rio Grande on the same basis as the joint through rates on Union Pacific's own lines. But these joint rates were canceled by Union Pacific in amended tariffs published between 1906 and 1912. Apparently there was no language in the published amended tariffs expressly and formally declaring that the through routes by way of the Ogden Gateway were also to be deemed closed. The amended tariffs, however, resulted in very high combination rates for northwest traffic transported by the Rio Grande. The effect of these high rates has been greatly to handicap if not actually to close the Rio Grande as an artery for through traffic between the Northwest, Denver and points south and east. Of course the effect of such rates might not be enough standing alone to show a voluntary abandonment of the through routes. See Virginian R. Co. v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 658, 666\n; Thompson v. United States, supra, at 556-558. At the same time it cannot be said that the Union Pacific's failure formally to declare the through routes abandoned in 1906 (when it canceled joint rates) automatically left the through routes in existence for 15 (4) purposes in 1949 when this litigation started. Cancellation of the rates in 1906 without formal cancellation \n\n[351 \nU.S. 321, 329]\n\u00a0\n of the routes is only a circumstance to be considered along with other circumstances in determining whether through routes now exist. The Colorado court relied on railroad practices as other circumstances which, considered with the failure expressly to abandon through routes, were sufficient to compel the Commission to hold that through routes did exist. We turn to that.\n\nAt best for the Rio Grande the evidence of railroad practices with reference to the continued existence of through routes showed the following. Despite the high combination rates a small number of shipments continue to trickle through the Ogden Gateway to and from the closed northwest territory. In 1948, which the Commission considered a representative year, a number of carload shipments moved on through bills of lading along the alleged through routes. But none of them coming from the Northwest went further than points on the Rio Grande in Colorado also served by the Union Pacific and connecting lines. There were a few shipments of various commodities from east and south of Denver which went by way of the Rio Grande through the Ogden Gateway. The total shipments over the alleged through routes, however, were no more than a fractional part of one percent of the traffic carried to and from the Northwest by way of the Union Pacific routes. It is also undisputed that through routes and joint rates exist for eastbound shipments of sheep and goats. During World War II some Army troop and supply trains moved over the Rio Grande on through bills of lading. In addition to the foregoing some traffic moved over the Rio Grande in 1949 when snow storms blocked the Union Pacific route through Wyoming. These movements were made under service orders of the Commission, which did not exercise its authority under 15 (4) to establish emergency through routes. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 321, 330]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Union Pacific produced evidence tending to show that there were no through routes. It quite plainly appears from the record that there has been a long-standing struggle between the Union Pacific and the Rio Grande over the efforts of the Union Pacific to keep the Ogden Gateway closed. We think the record supports the finding of the Commission that:\n\n\"There is no indication that any of the defendants has ever solicited any traffic from and to the areas here concerned for routing over a Rio Grande route by which a higher combination rate applied, or has ever used such a Rio Grande route except where called upon to do so by routing specified by the shipper or by a prior connecting carrier. In other words, so far as this record shows, `the carriers' course of business' has been and is to use the Union Pacific routes except where called upon to use the Rio Grande routes by force of shippers' or connecting carriers' routing. The whole course of conduct of the Union Pacific, so far as revealed, has been for many years and is now to guard jealously its long haul and not open commercially the Rio Grande routes on this traffic.\" 287 I. C. C., at 618.\n\n\n We adhere to the \"holding out\" test of the Thompson case. The evidence before the Commission was not such as to compel it to find that the Union Pacific held itself out as offering through service over the Rio Grande lines. It was error for the Colorado District Court to set aside the Commission's finding and to remand the case to the Commission. This brings us to a consideration of the Nebraska District Court's action.\n\nThe Commission required the Union Pacific to establish through routes and joint rates with the Rio Grande for the carriage of certain commodities including livestock, fresh fruits and vegetables, frozen foods, butter, and \n\n[351 \nU.S. 321, 331]\n\u00a0\n eggs.\n4\n The order rested on the Commission's conclusion that such through routes and joint rates were \"necessary and desirable in the public interest, in order to provide adequate and more economic transportation . . . .\" 287 I. C. C., at 659. This conclusion was based on findings from a vast amount of evidence both oral and written. The pertinent language of 15 (4) allows the Commission to establish through routes where \"needed in order to provide adequate, and more efficient or more economic, transportation.\" The dispute in the Nebraska court and here relates principally to the adequacy of the existing transportation services. The efficiency of Union Pacific services was established beyond dispute.\n\nSection 15 (4) empowers the Commission to consider the interests of shippers and the kind of services they get and need as well as the interests of carriers in determining whether additional routes should be established to provide \"adequate\" and \"more economic\" transportation service. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 321, 332]\n\u00a0\n We have held that in determining this question the Commission should look beyond the mere adequacy of the carrier's physical operations \"to the broader public interest which embraces service to shippers and the rates they pay.\" Pennsylvania R. Co. v. United States, \n323 \nU.S. 588, 591\n-593. The duty of the Commission, as we there stated, is to try to strike a fair balance in satisfying the needs of shippers, railroads, and the public. This of course calls for the Commission to exercise its informed judgment, having in mind its statutory obligation to develop, coordinate and preserve an adequate national transportation system.\n5\n This it did. Relying on our interpretation of 15 (4) in the Pennsylvania Railroad case, the Commission considered the various interests here. It found that: \"Because of their generally perishable nature, food articles . . . must be moved to market with expedition and care, and over as many routes as possible. This requires that many routes be open in order that unnecessary interruptions of the free flow of such commodities may be avoided and that as much flexibility as possible in the distribution process be permitted. A number of services, not only at origin and destination, but en route, which are not usually required in the movement of ordinary traffic, must be provided for these perishable and semiperishable commodities.\" 287 I. C. C., at 656. There are facilities along the Rio Grande route for feeding and grazing livestock in transit, and for partial unloading, storing or processing other shipments in transit. As a result shippers in the northwest territory were found to be \"debarred from effective participation in the widespread system developed for the marketing of such commodities\" and processors, shippers and dealers along the Rio Grande were found to be at a disadvantage in \n\n[351 \nU.S. 321, 333]\n\u00a0\n competing with those on the Union Pacific. For the specified commodities the Commission found the Union Pacific routes to be \"inadequate and less economical than are the Rio Grande routes.\"\n6\n The Nebraska District Court sustained the Commission's order with reference to shipments which required transit services on the Rio Grande. We agree with this portion of the holding. We cannot say that the Commission acted in excess of its authority in concluding, on the mass of evidence before it, that through routes and joint rates on the specified commodities were needed to provide adequate and more economic transportation and were necessary in the public interest.\n\nBut the scope of the Commission's order was cut down by the Nebraska court insofar as it established through routes and joint rates on shipments that did not require transit services such as we have mentioned. We disagree with the Nebraska District Court in this respect. The evidence showed and the Commission found that in marketing food and other perishable products it is a general practice among railroads to allow diversion of carloads in transit as markets are found and sales are made. The successful operation of this practice requires the existence of joint through rates to the final market, since diversion or reconsignment would often, as a practical matter, be unavailable to a shipper who is compelled to reconsign his goods at high combination rates. The Commission found that \"If a shipment reaches a point through which a combination of rates applies and the sale is lost, it is frequently necessary to dispose of the shipment at that point at a forced or distress price. Such points are called \n\n[351 \nU.S. 321, 334]\n\u00a0\n closed or pocket markets.\" 287 I. C. C., at 642. To illustrate its conclusion that combination rates result in inadequate transportation service in situations where shippers are compelled to reconsign, the Commission noted that: \"Idaho producers are in competition with shippers in other producing areas and find it difficult to compete on shipments routed over the Rio Grande via Ogden or Salt Lake City. One Idaho shipper has made few sales of potatoes in the Southwest in the last several years because of pocket markets there.\" 287 I. C. C., at 643. Pocket markets, of course, exist because reconsignment is possible only at high combination rates. We see no reason why a shipper's privilege to have his goods reconsigned at joint rates should not be considered on the same basis as transit services in determining the adequacy and economy of existing transportation. We think it was error for the Nebraska court to narrow the scope of the Commission's order by excluding shipments of commodities which so urgently need the advantage of reconsignment privileges at joint rates.\n\nMany other arguments are made against the Commission's order. It is pointed out, for example, that the Rio Grande road has more curves than the Union Pacific. Its grades are steeper. Consequently its traffic is sometimes slower. It is contended that the evidence as a whole is insufficient to justify the holding that the establishment of through routes will be of such great advantage to shippers and the public that the Union Pacific should be compelled to short-haul itself. We are not unmindful of the force of the arguments made by the Union Pacific and by those who have intervened on its side. It is entirely possible that the Commission could have made findings contrary to those it did make. But on the whole we are unable to say that the Commission did not strike a fair balance in finding that the evidence required the establishment of these through routes and joint rates. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 321, 335]\n\u00a0\n After consideration of all the contentions made, we hold that the Nebraska court should have sustained the Commission's order in full.\n7\n Since the Commission's order is justified under 15 (1), 15 (3) and 15 (4) we have no occasion to consider contentions raised under 3 (1) and 3 (4).\n\nThe judgment of the District Court of Colorado is reversed with directions to dismiss the bill. The judgment of the Nebraska District Court is affirmed insofar as it affirmed the order of the Commission, and is reversed insofar as the court refused to enforce the Commission's order.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 24 Stat. 379, 380, 384, as amended, 49 U.S.C. 1 (4), 3, 15 (1), 15 (3). Section 1 (4) makes it the duty of common carriers \"to establish reasonable through routes with other such carriers, and just and reasonable rates . . . .\" And 3 (4) enjoins carriers to \"afford all reasonable, proper, and equal facilities for the interchange of traffic\" without discrimination or undue prejudice.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 24 Stat. 384, as amended, 49 U.S.C. 15 (4).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Five Commissioners thought that through routes were in existence; five were of the opinion that they were not.

C., at 638.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] In reaching our conclusion we have not overlooked attacks on the breadth of the order with respect to marble, granite, and livestock shipments, nor challenges to that part of the order correcting discrimination in favor of the Bamberger Railroad.\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, dissenting.\n\nI agree with the Court that through routes were not in existence and that joint rates are therefore not empowered under 15 (3) of the Interstate Commerce Act. unqualified by 15 (4). 54 Stat. 898, 911-912, 49 U.S.C. 15 (3), (4). The controversy thus turns on the enforcement of congressional policy expressed as follows in 15 (4):\n\n  \"In establishing any such through route the Commission  shall not (except as provided in section 3,  and except where one of the carriers is a water line)  require any carrier by railroad, without its consent,  to embrace in such route substantially less than the  entire length of its railroad and of any intermediate  railroad operated in conjunction and under a common  management or control therewith, which lies between  the termini of such proposed through route, (a) unless \n\n[351 \nU.S. 321, 336]\n\u00a0\n  such inclusion of lines would make the through route  unreasonably long as compared with another practicable  through route which could otherwise be established,  or (b) unless the Commission finds that the  through route proposed to be established is needed  in order to provide adequate, and more efficient or  more economic, transportation: Provided, however,  That in prescribing through routes the Commission  shall, so far as is consistent with the public interest,  and subject to the foregoing limitations in clauses  (a) and (b), give reasonable preference to the carrier  by railroad which originates the traffic. . . .\"\n\n\n As is true so often in applying regulatory legislation, the general approach - that is, the starting point - may be determinative of the result. It makes a vital difference whether 15 (4) is deemed a restriction on the power of the Interstate Commerce Commission which is to be closely confined and sharply construed or whether it is deemed to express a legislative command which ought to be heeded and not slightingly enforced. The fact of the matter is that we are dealing with a provision of the law which the Commission has long considered undesirable from the point of view of a national railroad policy and whose repeal it has consistently urged upon Congress. (See the history set forth in Thompson v. United States, \n343 \nU.S. 549, 554\n-556.) Although Congress has, from the time of the Commission's creation and especially in recent years, relied on the Commission as its expert adviser on policy, and legislation has largely reflected the Commission's recommendations, the latter's persistence in recommending repeal of 15 (4) has been matched and overborne by the persistence of Congress in retaining it. Congress has emphatically made clear that in its view the national interest requires the protection of railroads against being short-hauled. Encouragement should not \n\n[351 \nU.S. 321, 337]\n\u00a0\n be given to disregard of that policy, even if such disregard occurs through inadequate observance attributable to an unconscious desire to restrict the scope of the statute. In short, when an order of the Commission is brought under judicial scrutiny, and challenge is made that the safeguards of 15 (4) have not been observed, it is the duty of this Court to apply the policy expressed by that section. If the requisite findings or conclusions are ambiguous or unclear, or the policy of the section is slighted, our duty demands remand to the Commission to dispel ambiguity or to secure clarity and obedience to the policy.\n\nIt is my view that, even though evidence may be found in the record to support a portion of the order, the Commission did not support the portion on that basis but, on the contrary, appears to have justified the whole order on considerations that collide with congressional policy. The proceedings should therefore be returned to the Commission and the order ought not to be sustained in whole or in part. I will summarize the reasons for this conclusion.\n\nThe Commission ordered the establishment of through routes and joint rates by the Union Pacific with the Rio Grande for shipments of livestock and certain perishable agricultural products originating in the northwest (excluded) territory and destined for that part of the United States which the Nebraska District Court roughly described as \"east of Denver.\"\n*\n 132 F. Supp. 72, 75, n. 1. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 321, 338]\n\u00a0\n Apparently, through routes and joint rates were already in existence for shipments via the Ogden Gateway between the northwest territory and intermediate points on the Rio Grande, originating or terminating at those intermediate points. Joint through rates, however, were not generally in effect over the Rio Grande to or from the Colorado or Utah common point territory (e. g., Denver, Colorado Springs, and Pueblo; Ogden, Salt Lake City, and Provo) of the Rio Grande and the Union Pacific and other defendants, or for transcontinental traffic between the northwest territory and points east of the Colorado common points. The Commission did not order through routes and joint rates to the Utah or Colorado common points or to a large area which is in fact east of Denver. (See description in footnote\n*\n.) Through routes and joint rates over the Rio Grande also were not ordered for westbound traffic to the northwest territory originating east of the Colorado common points, except for granite and marble monuments from origins in Vermont and Georgia. The Commission found that it was \"necessary and desirable in the public interest, in order to provide adequate and more economic transportation,\" 287 I. C. C. 611, 659, to establish the specified through routes and joint rates. The Commission gave this justification for its finding:\n\n \". . . The growth of our population and the development of the country have required a constantly expanding flow of diverse commodities. . . . Movements of transcontinental proportions are involved in important instances. . . . A complex but efficient marketing system has been evolved to provide as \n\n[351 \nU.S. 321, 339]\n\u00a0\n orderly a distribution of food commodities as possible. Adequate transportation facilities and services are required for the proper functioning of the system. Because of their generally perishable nature, [the enumerated] food articles . . . must be moved to market with expedition and care, and over as many routes as possible. This requires that many routes be open in order that unnecessary interruptions of the free flow of such commodities may be avoided and that as much flexibility as possible in the distribution process be permitted. A number of services, not only at origin and destination, but en route, which are not usually required in the movement of ordinary traffic, must be provided for these perishable and semiperishable commodities.\" 287 I. C. C., at 655-656.\n\n\n The Commission also found support for its conclusion that shippers of these products are debarred from participation in the widespread marketing system in the fact that \"in-transit\" privileges on the Rio Grande, such as stop-off for partial unloading or processing, or for grazing of cattle, are not available to shippers of these commodities from the northwest territory, except at the higher combination rates.\n\nThe Commission considered through routes and joint rates to points \"east of Denver\" as a unitary problem and saw no difference between shipments destined initially to intermediate points on the Rio Grande and shipments destined initially to points \"east of Denver.\" The Nebraska District Court, however, found nothing in the evidence to support a finding that the transportation service furnished by Union Pacific on through service between the northwest territory and points \"east of Denver\" was inadequate, and as to livestock this restriction was not contested by the Commission on this appeal. The Nebraska District Court, therefore, narrowed the order to \n\n[351 \nU.S. 321, 340]\n\u00a0\n require through routes and joint rates only for those car-loads originating in the northwest territory and consigned to initial destination points on the Rio Grande west of Denver, Pueblo, and Trinidad, Colorado, which require \"in-transit\" privileges incident to reshipment to points east of those places.\n\nThe Court, rejecting the narrowed construction by the Nebraska District Court, affirms the Commission's order as written. In doing so, however, it does not rely on the reasons given by the Commission in support of its conclusion, but rather it affirms on a different basis. How can we know whether, and to what extent, the Court's reasons influenced the Commission, or would influence it, in making its decision? The report certainly indicates that the Commission thought its own reasoning sufficient to support the whole order. Once the Commission's reasoning for a conclusion is found wanting, the conclusion is necessarily impaired. While the judgment of a lower court may be sustained by this Court on a ground other than that on which it was rested below, see Langnes v. Green, \n282 \nU.S. 531, 534\n-539; Helvering v. Gowran, \n302 \nU.S. 238, 245\n-247, the legal relation between the Commission and the courts is of a very different order from that of a lower court and a reviewing court. A Commission having defined and limited delegated power must justify the exercise of that power by findings that support it and by evidence that supports the findings. When regard is had for the complicated technical nature of the problems and the voluminousness of the records in the important cases that come before the Commission, a fair discharge of its functions precludes casting upon a reviewing court the task of quarrying though a record to find for itself adequate evidence to permit the effectuation of orders of the Commission.\n\nThe precise function of findings is to make practicable scrutiny by the courts in order to determine whether the \n\n[351 \nU.S. 321, 341]\n\u00a0\n Commission has kept within the bounds legislatively defined. To be sure, the Commission's findings are not binding in the sense that attack cannot be made on them for lack of evidence. ICC v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co., \n227 \nU.S. 88, 91\n-94. The Commission cannot - it has not purported to do so here - pass on to the Court an unanalyzed summary of a long proceeding and call it findings. While findings need not be formulated in an enumerated sequence, helpful as that would be, they must at least appear in a Commission's decision with unambiguous clarity, and they must be logically related to its conclusion. The justification the Commission has given cannot be rejected and a new justification found by the Court to satisfy the requirement of a foundation for judicial review. SEC v. Chenery Corp., \n318 \nU.S. 80, 92\n-95. After all, it is the Commission which Congress has established as the expert in this field.\n\nThe Commission treated the whole problem of joint rates alike, whether the shipment was initially destined for intermediate points on the Rio Grande or whether it was a through shipment. The Court now finds one justification, the inability to use available \"in-transit\" privileges of the Rio Grande, to support the order in the former situation, and another justification, elimination of \"pocket markets,\" to support the order in the latter situation. It does not rely on what appears to have been the principal, if not the only, reason which the Commission thought justified its whole order, the necessity for the specified products to be able to move to market \"over as many routes as possible.\" Indeed, that viewpoint of the Commission is directly contrary to the congressional policy expressed in 15 (4). The theory of that section is that products are not to be able to move to markets \"over as many routes as possible\" when that would involve short-hauling a carrier without its consent on the proposed through route, unless, among other things, the \n\n[351 \nU.S. 321, 342]\n\u00a0\n transportation already in existence is inadequate. To make available to shippers as many routes to market as possible is a policy which the Commission has long urged but which the Congress has resolutely rejected. To find inadequacy of service on a short-hauled carrier in that other routes are not made available would virtually nullify 15 (4).\n\nIt may well be that what are somewhat misleadingly called \"in-transit\" privileges justify joint through rates to shipments stopped at intermediate points on the Rio Grande for those privileges, and on similar reasoning joint through rates might be justified for shipments initially consigned to intermediate points on the Rio Grande and thereafter reconsigned to points \"east of Denver\" if the sale is lost, subject to findings being made concerning reconsignment privileges on the Rio Grande. In both situations it is a fiction to speak of a single shipment on which the Union Pacific would be short-hauled should the proposed through route go into effect. The situation involves two separate shipments for which, under normal railroad practice, only the rate of a single continuous shipment over the whole route is charged. On neither of these shipments is Union Pacific being short-hauled because it is capable of performing neither. In this sense, Union Pacific service is of course not \"adequate\"; it is non-existent. But the Commission did not found its order on such an analysis, and I cannot confidently surmise that it would have ordered the establishment of through routes and joint rates on this basis. Such a determination should be left for the Commission.\n\nThe Court also affirms that part of the Commission's order establishing through routes and joint rates for shipments destined initially to points \"east of Denver.\" It does so both with respect to the specified agricultural products and with respect to livestock, even though the Commission did not before us contest the Nebraska District \n\n[351 \nU.S. 321, 343]\n\u00a0\n Court's elimination of through routes and joint rates for livestock to points \"east of Denver\" for want of evidence to support a finding of inadequacy of service. This Court relies for support of this very important portion of the Commission's order on a few paragraphs of the Commission's report under the heading \"Proponents' Testimony\" where some testimony concerning \"pocket markets\" is set forth. The Commission in its \"General Discussion and Ultimate Fact Findings\" makes no reference to the \"pocket market\" problem as supporting its order. Indeed, the discussion of \"pocket markets\" seems related only to the refusal of the Union Pacific to establish joint through rates on shipments going through certain points even over its own lines (because the points involved are off the main line and substantial back hauls or out-of-line hauls are required), and has nothing at all to do with the Rio Grande. Moreover, the order requiring the Union Pacific to establish through routes with the Rio Grande prescribes that there be maintained over such routes only joint rates \"the same as those maintained and applied on like traffic from and to the same points over routes embracing the lines of the Union Pacific Railroad Company through Wyoming.\" From all that appears on the record before us, this could not affect the \"pocket markets\" complained of because at those points there are no joint through rates over the Union Pacific. Since the establishment of through routes and joint rates for shipments destined initially to points \"east of Denver\" appears to have no effect on \"pocket markets,\" it is difficult to understand how the \"pocket market\" situation can be used to justify the establishment of such routes and rates.\n\nThe upshot of all this is that after the Nebraska three-judge District Court disagreed about the justification for the order and the majority thought it could be saved by narrowing it, this Court reinstates the whole order, but on \n\n[351 \nU.S. 321, 344]\n\u00a0\n a different basis from that of the Commission, and with respect to a major portion of the order, it does so on a ground which appears to have no support in the Commission's findings. I do not say that no through routes or joint rates can be established through the Ogden Gateway. But I do believe that it is neither for the District Court nor for this Court to speculate what the Commission would have done if it were required to disregard some of its important views on policy, as this Court has disregarded them. I also believe that it is not our duty to find reasons to support the Commission's order which the Commission on full consideration did not summon to its support. This is a striking instance of a case requiring remand to the Commission for clarification and reconsideration of the basis for decision. See United States v. Chicago, M., St. P. & P. R. Co., \n294 \nU.S. 499, 510\n-511.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] It used the phrase to designate the points included in the order with respect to which through routes and joint rates were ordered established for livestock and certain agricultural commodities by the Union Pacific with the Rio Grande. The Commission in its order defined these points as: \"destinations in the United States south and east of a line drawn along the southern boundary of Kansas, thence the eastern boundary of Kansas to but not including Kansas City, thence immediately west of points on the Missouri River from Kansas City, Kans., to Omaha, \n\n[351 \nU.S. 321, 338]\n\u00a0\n Nebr., thence immediately north of points on the lines of the Union Pacific Railroad Company and the Chicago and North Western Railway Company from Omaha to Chicago, Ill., including destinations in the lower peninsula of Michigan and in Oklahoma and Texas . . . .\"\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, dissenting.\n\nI agree with the opinion of MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, except that I would consider an order of the Commission limited to establishing through routes and joint rates on shipments destined initially to intermediate points on the Rio Grande to be supported by the present findings. Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Nebraska District Court, which remanded the case to the Commission to allow it to determine whether such a limited order would be in the public interest and for any further proceedings not inconsistent with its opinion. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 321, 345]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","25":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDIXIE CARRIERS v. UNITED STATES(1956)\nNo. 233\nArgued: March 27, 1956Decided: April 23, 1956\n\n\n\n\n On shipments of sulphur from mines near Galveston, Tex., to Danville, Ill., the railroads have established a joint all-rail rate which is lower than both the combination all-rail rate and the combination rail-barge rate; but they have refused to establish a joint rail-barge rate between the same points. Held: Such refusal constitutes a discrimination in rates between connecting lines prohibited by 3 (4) of the Interstate Commerce Act, and it is the duty of the Commission under 307 (d) to establish through routes and joint rates for rail-barge transportation, in order to effectuate the National Transportation Policy that the Act be administered to preserve the \"inherent advantages\" of each form of transportation. Pp. 56-61.\n\n 129 F. Supp. 28, reversed.\n\nNuel D. Belnap argued the cause for appellants. With him on the brief were Donald Macleay and Francis W. McInerny.\n\nDaniel M. Friedman argued the cause for the United States, appellee. With him on the brief were Solicitor General Sobeloff and Assistant Attorney General Barnes.\n\nSamuel R. Howell argued the cause for the Interstate Commerce Commission, appellee. With him on the brief was Robert W. Ginnane.\n\nJohn A. Daily argued the cause for the New York Central Railroad Co. et al., appellees. With him on the brief was Robert D. Brooks.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nSulphur mined near Galveston, Texas, can be shipped to Danville, Illinois, either by rail or by barge and \n\n[351 \nU.S. 56, 57]\n\u00a0\n rail. If the sulphur goes by barge and rail, it is transported up the Mississippi via New Orleans to East St. Louis and then by rail to Danville. The total charge for that movement is $9.77 per ton.\n1\n The total of the various local rates for all-rail shipments from the mines to Danville is $11.68. But the railroads have established a joint all-rail rate\n2\n of $9.184 which is lower than both the combination all-rail rate and the combination rail-barge rate.\n\nAppellants, who are water carriers, requested the competing railroads to establish a joint rail-barge rate of $7.67 on sulphur from Galveston to Danville. The railroads refused. Appellants thereupon filed a complaint with the Interstate Commerce Commission, alleging that the existing rail-barge rates on sulphur were excessive and unreasonable, that through rail-barge routes and joint rates with reasonable differentials below the all-rail rates should be established, and that the refusal of the railroads to establish such joint rates discriminated against the barges as connecting carriers in violation of the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended by the Transportation Act of 1940.\n3\n Appellants requested the Commission to establish a through rail-barge route and a joint rate and suggested that the joint rate be fixed at $7.67. Appellants proposed that the Danville railroads receive $2.26 as a division of that rate, calculated to be the same as they receive from the all-rail rate from Galveston to Danville. Under the proposed rate, the cost of rail-barge \n\n[351 \nU.S. 56, 58]\n\u00a0\n shipments from the mines to Danville would be $9.17 as compared with the all-rail rate of $9.184.\n\nA Division of the Commission dismissed the complaint, one Commissioner dissenting. 287 I. C. C. 403. The Commission affirmed the Division, three Commissioners dissenting. 291 I. C. C. 422. A three-judge District Court sustained the Commission. 129 F. Supp. 28. The case is here on appeal, 28 U.S.C. 1253, 2101 (b), 2325.\n\nSection 3 (4) of the Act provides that \"All carriers subject to the provisions of this part . . . shall not discriminate in their rates, fares, and charges between connecting lines . . . .\" Section 3 (4) defines \"connecting line\" as including \"any common carrier by water subject to Part III.\" Appellants are common carriers by water within that definition. They maintain that it is unlawful under 3 (4) of the Act for a railroad to refuse to join in through routes and joint rates with a water carrier when it has already joined in such routes and rates with a connecting rail line. They further maintain that the power of the Commission under 307 (d)\n4\n to establish \n\n[351 \nU.S. 56, 59]\n\u00a0\n through routes and joint rates should have been exercised here.\n\nWe had a closely related question before us in Interstate Commerce Commission v. Mechling, \n330 \nU.S. 567\n. In that case we invalidated an order of the Commission which approved higher rail rates for the transportation of grain east of Chicago if it had arrived in Chicago by barge, rather than by rail. We reviewed the history of the Transportation Act of 1940 and concluded that that Act \"unequivocally required the Commission to fix rates which would preserve for shippers the inherent advantages of barge transportation: lower cost of equipment, operation, and therefore service.\" Id., at 575. We held that the discrimination which was outlawed applied to through rates as well as to ordinary rates.\n\nThe Mechling case involved an attempt to deprive water transportation of one of its \"inherent advantages,\" as that phrase is used in the preamble of the 1940 Act, by increasing the cost of barge service. The Commission's present decision achieves the same result through the device of a joint rate allowed carriers by rail but denied carriers by water. It was recognized in the debates on the bill that became the Transportation Act of 1940 that manipulation of rail rates downward might deprive water carriers of their \"inherent advantages\" and therefore violate the Act.\n5\n It was emphasized that one of the evils to be remedied was cutthroat competition, whereby strong rail carriers would reduce their rates, putting \n\n[351 \nU.S. 56, 60]\n\u00a0\n water carriers out of business.\n6\n There was recognition that for shippers to get the benefit of the \"inherent advantages\" of water transportation there frequently would have to be joint rail-barge rates.\n7\n Barge transportation frequently covers only one segment of the journey to market. The failure of the railroads to establish nondiscriminatory joint rates with barges might, therefore, seriously impair the development of barge service as a vital component of our national transportation system. Section 3 outlaws discrimination in all its forms. See New York v. United States, \n331 \nU.S. 284, 296\n. Where there is discrimination by the use of a joint rate to favor rail carriers over carriers by water and to deprive the latter of their \"inherent advantages,\" the Commission has a duty to end it under 307 (d). That subsection\n8\n makes it mandatory for the Commission to establish through routes and joint rates \"whenever deemed by it to be necessary or desirable in the public interest.\" The public interest, as defined in the Act, is the guide to the Commission's action. McLean Trucking Co. v. United \n\n[351 \nU.S. 56, 61]\n\u00a0\n States, \n321 \nU.S. 67, 82\n. The policy is to preserve all the \"inherent advantages\" of the water carriers.\n9\n That means that a joint barge-rail rate must be established when it appears, as here, that a joint rail rate discriminates against the water carriers. Otherwise a manipulated rate structure will take the business from the water carriers. In absence of the joint all-rail rate, the rail-barge combination rate for sulphur would be $1.91 per ton less than the all-rail combination rate between the same points. That differential reflects the lower cost of the barge segment of the journey. It is at once lost to shippers when joint rates are allowed rail carriers and withheld from the water carriers. To hold otherwise would be to sanction a rate structure which, through the use of discriminatory joint rates, denies shippers the \"inherent advantages\" of water transportation.\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The charge consists of rail and loading charges of $1.50 at Galveston, the barge rate of $5.32 to East St. Louis, and the local rail rate of $2.95 from East St. Louis to Danville.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] For a discussion of joint rates see St. Louis S. W. R. Co. v. United States, \n245 \nU.S. 136, 139\n, note 2; United States v. Great Northern R.

In the case of a through route, where one of the carriers is a common carrier by water, the Commission shall prescribe such reasonable differentials as it may find to be justified between all-rail rates and the joint rates in connection with such common carrier by water. . . .\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] There was the following colloquy during the debate in the Senate between Senator Wheeler who was in charge of the bill and Senator Norris (84 Cong. Rec. 5874): \"Mr. NORRIS. Suppose, however, this bill should become a law, and an article of freight were to be transported which admittedly could be carried by water better than by railroad, and suppose the railroad should undertake to reduce its rate down to the water rate: \n\n[351 \nU.S. 56, 60]\n\u00a0\n Would there be anything in the law to prevent the railroad from doing that? \"Mr. WHEELER. Of course there would be. \"Mr. NORRIS. Disastrous rates can be brought about by reducing them just as well as by increasing them, as a matter of fact. \"Mr. WHEELER. Exactly. \"Mr. NORRIS. And the water carrier ought to be protected on the freight that ought to be carried by water rather than on the railroad. \"Mr. WHEELER. It would be absolutely protected under this measure. \"Mr. NORRIS. That is what I want to see done. \"Mr. WHEELER. There is not any question about it. Under the rate-making provision and under the other provisions I have read, there is not any question about it.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Id., 5877.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Id., 5875.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Note 4, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] The Division of the Commission thought that regard for the \"inherent advantages\" of water transportation did not require it \"to force rail carriers, where they maintain a depressed rate to meet water competition, to further depress their earnings on the traffic in order to favor that same form of competition.\" 287 I. C. C., at 407. But part of that critical \"depressed rate\" - and the one most relevant here - is the $2.26 of the joint all-rail rate received by the East St. Louis-Danville rail carrier. For this same haul, the East St. Louis-Danville rail carrier receives $2.95 on the barge-rail rate. Yet on that haul the railroad has no competition from the water carriers. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 56, 62]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","26":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDOUD v.

Sarnow, Assistant Attorney General, was also on a Motion to Affirm.\n\nMR. JUSTICE MINTON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe appellants are a partnership and its agent, all residents of Illinois. The partnership was engaged exclusively in the business of selling and issuing money orders in the State of Illinois. This business activity was to be conducted through agents who are principally persons engaged in operating retail drug, hardware and grocery stores. Appellant Derrick, a drug store proprietor, contracted with the partnership to act as its agent for the sale of money orders which it issued. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 485, 486]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIllinois, by statute,\n1\n has sought to license and regulate community currency exchanges. Section 1 of the Community Currency Exchanges Act defines a community currency exchange as \"any person, firm, association, partnership or corporation, except banks incorporated under the laws of this State and National Banks organized pursuant to the laws of the United States, engaged . . . in the business or service of, and providing facilities for, cashing checks, drafts, money orders or any other evidences of money acceptable to such community currency exchange, for a fee or service charge or other consideration, or engaged in the business of selling or issuing money orders under his or their or its name, or any other money orders (other than United States Post Office money orders, American Express Company money order, Postal Telegraph Company money orders, or Western Union Telegraph Company money orders), or engaged in both such businesses, or engaged in performing any one or more of the foregoing services.\"\n2\n Subsequent sections of the Act provide for the licensing and comprehensive regulation of such businesses.\n\nAppellants brought this suit in the Northern District of Illinois seeking to enjoin the appellees, who are the Auditor of Public Accounts, the Attorney General of the State of Illinois and the State's Attorney of Cook County, Illinois, from enforcing the Community Currency Exchanges Act against them. Jurisdiction was asserted under 28 U.S.C. 1331. Appellants argued that a permanent injunction should be issued on the ground that the Act denied them equal protection of the laws in violation of 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution in that appellants are required to obtain a license and submit to regulation in the conduct \n\n[350 \nU.S. 485, 487]\n\u00a0\n of their money order business in the State while the American Express Company, which is engaged in the identical business activity in Illinois, is excepted from the operation of the Act. Since the complaint attacked the validity of a state statute under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution, the suit was tried before a three-judge District Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2281 and 2284.\n\nThe District Court heard the case at length and made findings of fact, the material portions of which we have set forth above. The District Court dismissed the complaint, holding that it lacked jurisdiction to determine the constitutional question presented in the absence of an authoritative determination by the Supreme Court of Illinois as to whether the exemption of the American Express Company from the terms of the Act is unconstitutional as applied to these appellants. 127 F. Supp. 853. We noted probable jurisdiction. \n350 \nU.S. 814\n.\n\nIt is clear that the District Court had jurisdiction to entertain appellants' complaint by virtue of the authority vested in it by 28 U.S.C. 2281 and 2284. This Court has never held that a district court is without jurisdiction to entertain a prayer for an injunction restraining the enforcement of a state statute on grounds of alleged repugnancy to the Federal Constitution simply because the state courts had not yet rendered a clear or definitive decision as to the meaning or federal constitutionality of the statute.\n\nWe hold that the District Court has jurisdiction of this cause. It was error to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction. The judgment of the District Court is vacated and the case is remanded to it.

Rutledge, acting under appointment by the Court, \n350 \nU.S. 900\n, argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioner.\n\nReeves Bowen, Assistant Attorney General of Florida, argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief was Richard W. Ervin, Attorney General. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 277, 278]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE BURTON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nIn this case our jurisdiction is questioned by the State of Florida because the judgment of the Supreme Court of that State, which we are asked to review and which was rendered without opinion, may have rested upon an adequate state ground. For the reasons hereafter stated, we find that to be true with the result that we have no jurisdiction to entertain this petition or to consider the merits of the federal questions suggested by petitioner. While we thus deem petitioner's allegations of fact as to the merits of this case to be irrelevant here, we imply nothing as to their truth or falsity, and we refrain from any discussion that depends upon or assumes their truth.\n\nIn 1945, petitioner Durley was convicted by a jury in the Criminal Court of Record for Polk County, Florida, on two informations. In each he was charged, in three counts, with stealing cattle.\n1\n In the first count of the first information it was charged that, on July 7, 1945, petitioner, with two others, stole two steers from a Mrs. Bronson; in the second count, two cows; and in the third count, one heifer. The three counts of the other information charged that the same men on July 29, 1945, stole from a Mr. Zipperer a cow and two heifers, each of the animals allegedly stolen being the subject of a separate count. Petitioner was sentenced to serve five years' imprisonment on each count, the terms to be served consecutively, thus making a total of 30 years.\n\nPetitioner did not appeal from his conviction but, in 1949, labeling his petition a writ of error coram nobis, he, \n\n[351 \nU.S. 277, 279]\n\u00a0\n pro se, unsuccessfully sought relief. In the same year, also pro se, he filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Supreme Court of Florida claiming that he was confined in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the Federal Constitution because he had been tried on informations rather than on indictments, that the verdict rested on perjured testimony,\n2\n and that he had been denied a hearing on his petition for a writ of error coram nobis. This petition for habeas corpus was denied by the Supreme Court of Florida, without opinion, on the ground that petitioner failed to show probable cause that he was held without lawful authority.\n\nIn 1952, with the aid of court-appointed counsel, petitioner filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in a Florida Circuit Court. There he claimed that the informations upon which he had been convicted charged the commission of only two, rather than six, offenses and that he already had served sufficient time to satisfy a ten-year sentence which would have been the maximum sentence permissible for two such offenses. Petitioner also charged that his imprisonment was in violation of his rights under the Constitution of the United States. A writ was issued, a return was filed, and the court heard argument of counsel for each side. The writ was quashed. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court of Florida, where his appeal was dismissed without opinion.\n\nIn 1955, petitioner, again pro se, instituted the present proceeding by filing in the Supreme Court of Florida another petition for a writ of habeas corpus. In it he claimed, inter alia, that his detention was an \"abuse of the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States . . .\" and that his consecutive \n\n[351 \nU.S. 277, 280]\n\u00a0\n sentences not only violated the Federal and State Constitutions, but were contrary to a recent decision of the Supreme Court of Florida, citing Hearn v. Florida, 55 So.2d 559. That petition was argued in the Supreme Court of Florida by counsel for the State, although neither petitioner nor his counsel was present. The petition was denied, without opinion, again on the ground that petitioner failed to show probable cause that he was held without lawful authority.\n\nA rehearing was denied but petitioner's application for a writ of certiorari was granted by this Court, \n350 \nU.S. 872\n, and counsel was appointed by this Court to represent him here, \n350 \nU.S. 900\n. The case was fully briefed and argued on the jurisdictional issue as well as on the merits.\n\nThe State of Florida has objected consistently to our entertaining jurisdiction of this proceeding. Its reason is that the Florida Supreme Court's denial of the 1955 petition for a writ of habeas corpus may have rested upon one or both of two adequate state grounds. Those grounds are (1) that, under Florida law, the issues presented in 1955 already had been rendered res judicata by the 1952 litigation, and (2) that, in any event, petitioner was precluded from raising the federal issues presented in 1955 because he had failed to raise them in comparable prior proceedings where he had a fair and adequate opportunity to do so.\n\nThe State's claim as to res judicata rests primarily upon Fla. Stat. Ann., 1943, 79.10, which provides that, while a judgment denying a petition for a writ of habeas corpus remains in force, no person \"shall be at liberty to obtain another habeas corpus for the same cause, or by any other proceeding to bring the same matter again in question except by a writ of error or by action of false imprisonment . . . .\" \n\n[351 \nU.S. 277, 281]\n\u00a0\n\n\nFlorida's other state ground is based upon its Supreme Court decisions, and particularly upon Washington v. Mayo, 77 So.2d 620, 621. It is there stated that \"The rule is clear that a convicted prisoner should not be heard to raise in a subsequent proceeding, whatever its nature, issues that were previously raised and determined, or that the prisoner had a fair and adequate opportunity to raise and have determined in earlier proceedings.\"\n\nIn the face of these expressions of the law of Florida, petitioner, in order to establish our jurisdiction, must demonstrate that neither of these state grounds can account for the decision below. \"Where the highest court of the state delivers no opinion and it appears that the judgment might have rested upon a nonfederal ground, this Court will not take jurisdiction to review the judgment.\" Stembridge v. Georgia, \n343 \nU.S. 541, 547\n.\n\n\"It is a well established principle of this Court that before we will review a decision of a state court it must affirmatively appear from the record that the federal question was presented to the highest court of the State having jurisdiction and that its decision of the federal question was necessary to its determination of the cause. Honeyman v. Hanan, \n300 \nU.S. 14, 18\n; Lynch v. New York, \n293 \nU.S. 52\n. And where the decision of the state court might have been either on a state ground or on a federal ground and the state ground is sufficient to sustain the judgment, the Court will not undertake to review it. Klinger v. Missouri, 13 Wall. 257, 263; Wood Mowing & Reaping Machine Co. v. Skinner, \n139 \nU.S. 293, 297\n; Allen v. Arguimbau, \n198 \nU.S. 149, 154\n-155; Lynch v. New York, supra. . . . But it is likewise well settled that if the independent [state] ground was not a substantial or sufficient one, `it will be presumed that the State court based its judgment on the law \n\n[351 \nU.S. 277, 282]\n\u00a0\n raising the Federal question, and this court will then take jurisdiction,' Klinger v. Missouri, supra, p. 263; Johnson v. Risk, \n137 \nU.S. 300, 307\n; Lawrence v. State Tax Commission, \n286 \nU.S. 276, 282\n-283.\" Williams v. Kaiser, \n323 \nU.S. 471, 477\n-478.\n\n\n While the federal questions relied upon by petitioner in 1955 are not set forth by him as clearly as they might be, we do not rely upon that inadequacy.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nPetitioner argues that 79.10 does not embody the traditionally broad doctrine of res judicata. He suggests that the statute bars only the relitigation of questions and matters that have been specifically presented and decided. By thus construing 79.10, he argues that none of the precise federal issues raised in the 1955 petition were sufficiently raised and considered under his previous petitions. However, the Supreme Court of Florida has treated 79.10 as applying the general rule of res judicata. See Florida ex rel. Cacciatore v. Drumbright, 116 Fla. 496, 156 So. 721; Florida ex rel. Williams v. Prescott, 110 Fla. 261, 148 So. 533; D'Alessandro v. Tippins, 102 Fla. 10, 137 So. 231. It even has applied that doctrine without reference to 79.10. See Florida ex rel. Davis v. Hardie, 108 Fla. 133, 146 So. 97. On the other hand, it has, at times, treated habeas corpus petitions as barred by 79.10 only where the issues have been raised and decided in a prior proceeding. See Moat v. Mayo, 82 So.2d 591; Lee v. Tucker, 42 So.2d 49; Pope v. Mayo, 39 So.2d 286; and \n\n[351 \nU.S. 277, 283]\n\u00a0\n compare Florida ex rel. Williams v. Prescott, supra; Florida ex rel. Davis v. Hardie, supra.\n\nIn its more recent cases, the Supreme Court of Florida has held that, on an original application for habeas corpus, the petitioner may not raise issues that have been raised in prior proceedings whatever those may have been. Also, that unless he can show good reason for his failure to do so, he is precluded from raising issues which he could have raised in any such prior proceedings. Washington v. Mayo, 77 So.2d 620; Irvin v. Chapman, 75 So.2d 591; Florida ex rel. Johnson v. Mayo, 69 So.2d 307.\n4\n In arguing before us that the issues now raised were or were not raised in prior proceedings, the parties have relied somewhat upon cases from this Court to support their arguments. Those decisions are not squarely in point because \n\n[351 \nU.S. 277, 284]\n\u00a0\n the issue before us is not one of federal law. The issue before us on res judicata is whether, under Florida law, petitioner was or was not free to raise in the Supreme Court of Florida in 1955 the questions he attempted to raise there. We conclude that the Supreme Court of Florida might have rested its denial of the 1955 petition on the grounds that the several federal issues presented to it in 1955 had been previously raised within the meaning of 79.10 and, therefore, could not be raised again under the state practice, or at least could have been raised in the prior proceedings and, accordingly, under the above decisions they likewise were not available as a matter of state law.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nPetitioner further suggests that, under Florida law, the doctrine of res judicata will \"not be so rigidly applied as to defeat the ends of justice.\" Universal Construction Co. v. Fort Lauderdale, 68 So.2d 366, 369. Relying on that case, petitioner argues that the application of res judicata is within the discretion of the court, but that case does not provide the necessary authority for that conclusion. In that case, the Supreme Court of Florida, exercising traditional common-law and equitable powers, created an exception to the common-law doctrine of res judicata because of an \"unusual situation\" confronting it. Id., at 370. The question before us is whether, under the facts of this case, the Supreme Court of Florida must necessarily read a similar exception into an Act of the legislature. We find no authoritative basis for doing so.\n\nFinally, it is suggested that the order of the Florida court denying the 1955 petition shows affirmatively that the court decided the petition on the merits of the federal questions raised. We do not so read it. At most it is \n\n[351 \nU.S. 277, 285]\n\u00a0\n inconclusive and leaves room for a decision on the state grounds indicated in 79.10 or by Washington v. Mayo, supra. The language of the order is that petitioner \"failed to show . . . probable cause to believe that he is detained in custody without lawful authority . . . .\" That is stated in the standard form used in habeas corpus proceedings. We find nothing on its face showing that the court must have decided the case on federal grounds rather than on the readily available and substantial state grounds.\n\nInasmuch as the Supreme Court of Florida's denial of the 1955 petition might have rested on either of the state grounds now suggested by the State, petitioner has failed to establish our jurisdiction to decide the federal issues that he urges upon us. He has not shown that they have been passed upon by the highest court of his State.\n\nFor lack of jurisdiction, the case, therefore, must be\n\n      Dismissed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"811.11 Horse or cattle stealing \"Whoever commits larceny by stealing any horse, mule, mare, filly, colt, cow, bull, ox, steer, heifer or calf, the property of another, shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison not less than two years nor more than five years.\" Fla. Stat. Ann., 1944.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] There was no allegation in this or the subsequent petition that the prosecution knowingly used perjured testimony as in Mooney v. Holohan, \n294 \nU.S. 103\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The 1955 petition for habeas corpus and the petition for certiorari to this Court were drafted by petitioner. In similar circumstances, this Court has held that \"where the substance of the claim is clear, we should not insist upon more refined allegations than [such a person] could be expected to supply.\" Tomkins v. Missouri, \n323 \nU.S. 485, 487\n; Rice v. Olson, \n324 \nU.S. 786, 791\n-792; Holiday v. Johnston, \n313 \nU.S. 342, 350\n. Florida follows the same practice. Ex parte Amos, 93 Fla. 5, 12, 112 So. 289, 292; Chase v. Florida ex rel. Burch, 93 Fla. 963, 968, 113 So. 103, 106.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] While it is true that in the Johnson and Irvin cases the issues sought to be raised in the habeas corpus proceeding could have been raised on direct appeal, the court held that the writ was not available because the petitioners had failed to raise those issues in \"prior proceedings.\" These included a writ of error coram nobis in Johnson and a previous trial on the merits in Irvin. It is suggested that the Washington case does not preclude this Court from taking jurisdiction because in that case the court, while stating the rule that would preclude jurisdiction, did consider on its merits a nonfederal contention which had not been previously raised. But assuming that the contention so considered had involved a substantial federal question, this Court would have lacked jurisdiction to review the judgment for the reason that it might have rested upon the adequate state ground. For our purposes, therefore, the discussion of the merits in that case may be treated as dicta. Furthermore, the contention considered on its merits in the Washington case \"apparently was not raised upon the earlier proceeding . . . .\" 77 So.2d, at 622. In the instant case, the perjury issue was presented in the 1949 petition, although not in terms of a federal constitutional issue. The Washington case, therefore, is certainly no authority for a conclusion in the instant case that any issues growing out of the previously raised issue, that the conviction rested upon perjured testimony, could be raised in the proceeding which is before us.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Our discussion of the Florida law is solely for the purpose of determining whether the test for our jurisdiction is met. We do not intimate that, under that law, petitioner is foreclosed from seeking any further remedial process that may be open to him.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE BLACK and MR. JUSTICE CLARK concur, dissenting.\n\nPetitioner is a prisoner in the Florida State Prison, serving a total sentence of 30 years for cattle stealing. In February 1955 he filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Supreme Court of Florida. That court denied the petition without affording petitioner a hearing and without requiring a response from respondent, the custodian of the prison. A timely motion for rehearing was also denied. We granted certiorari. \n350 \nU.S. 872\n.\n\nIn these circumstances, the allegations of the petition must be accepted as true for purposes of review. See Hawk v. Olson, \n326 \nU.S. 271, 273\n; Williams v. Kaiser, \n323 \nU.S. 471, 473\n-474. If they are taken as true, we have a shocking case of miscarriage of justice. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 277, 286]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn 1945 the County Solicitor for Polk County, Florida, filed two informations charging petitioner and two codefendants, R. B. Massey, Jr., and Charles Bath, with six offenses of stealing cattle, each information containing three separate counts. The first count of the first information charged that the three defendants on July 7, 1945, stole two steers belonging to Mrs. Edna P. Bronson; the second count charged that the three defendants on July 7, 1945, stole two cows belonging to Mrs. Bronson; and the third count charged that on July 7, 1945, they stole one heifer belonging to Mrs. Bronson. In the second information, the first count charged that the three defendants on July 29, 1945, stole one cow belonging to William C. Zipperer; the second count charged that the three defendants on July 29, 1945, stole one heifer belonging to Mr. Zipperer; and the third count charged that, on the same day, the defendants stole one heifer belonging to Mr. Zipperer. The second and third counts of the second information are virtually identical.\n\nAt the trial petitioner asserted his innocence. His two codefendants, however, admitted their guilt and implicated petitioner. Their testimony was the only evidence linking petitioner with the crimes charged. All three were convicted. Bath apparently received a sentence of two years' imprisonment and Massey, 26 years. Petitioner, 53 years old at the time and never before accused of dishonesty, was sentenced to five years' imprisonment on each of the 6 counts, each sentence to be served consecutively, making a total sentence of 30 years. Petitioner, now 63 years old, has served more than 10 years of his sentence.\n\nIn May 1949 petitioner, without the assistance of counsel, prepared a petition for writ of habeas corpus and filed it in the Supreme Court of Florida. The petition was inartistically drawn. Petitioner contended that his trial on a bill of information rather than on a grandjury \n\n[351 \nU.S. 277, 287]\n\u00a0\n indictment violated the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution. Secondly, he contended that \"he is innocent of said offense and is falsely imprisoned by reason that verdict of guilt was wholly supported by prejudge [sic] and perjured testimony.\" Accompanying the petition was an affidavit by one J. E. Croft relating a prison conversation he had with Bath, the codefendant who received the relatively light sentence of two years' imprisonment. According to this affidavit, Bath told Croft that petitioner was completely innocent. Bath described an agreement which he and codefendant Massey had made before they embarked on their cattle-stealing ventures. They agreed that, if they were caught, they would say they were working for petitioner, for whom they had worked as laborers on other occasions. Bath explained that by naming petitioner they had hoped to be \"passed up\" and given a chance to get out of the country.\n\nIn addition to the Croft affidavit, the habeas corpus petition was accompanied by an affidavit signed and sworn to by Massey. He recanted his trial testimony, clearing petitioner of all responsibility for the stolen cattle. Massey stated that his story implicating petitioner \"was a falsehood and that I gave such testimony, hoping that it would aid me when my case came up.\" The affidavit concluded, \"Before God is my judge Dan Durley, never had anything to do with any cattle stealing that I testified to at the trial.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court of Florida denied the 1949 petition for a writ of habeas corpus on the ground that petitioner had failed to show probable cause that his detention was unlawful. It should be noted that the 1949 petition did not assert that the use of perjured testimony deprived petitioner of a federal constitutional right.\n\nIn January 1952 petitioner filed a second habeas corpus petition in the Circuit Court of Union County, Florida, \n\n[351 \nU.S. 277, 288]\n\u00a0\n this time assisted by court-appointed counsel. He contended that the six 5-year sentences amounted to double jeopardy because the two informations upon which he was convicted charged him in substance with no more than two offenses, each of which carried a maximum penalty of 5 years, and that petitioner had already served sufficient time to satisfy a 10-year sentence. He made a general claim that his imprisonment was \"in direct violation of his rights as set out in the Constitution of the United States.\" There was no mention of the perjured testimony issue. After argument the Circuit Court of Union County quashed the writ. An appeal to the Supreme Court of Florida was dismissed.\n\nThe basis of the present litigation is the habeas corpus petition filed in the Florida Supreme Court in February 1955. Petitioner prepared it without the aid of counsel. The petition repeats the double-jeopardy contention as well as the charge that he was convicted solely on the basis of perjured testimony, coupling these allegations with a claim that his imprisonment deprives him of liberty \"in violation of his Constitutional Rights afforded him by the State of Florida and the Constitution of the United States of America.\" His federal constitutional arguments were elaborated in the motion for rehearing. Petitioner's claim that it violates due process to let his conviction stand solely on perjured testimony was raised for the first time in the 1955 habeas corpus petition - the one now under consideration.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nThe Court dismisses the case on the ground that the Florida Supreme Court order denying habeas corpus might have rested on an adequate state ground - res judicata. I disagree. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 277, 289]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Court concludes that under Florida law petitioner is barred from raising federal issues in the 1955 habeas corpus proceeding because he had raised them or at least had a fair and adequate opportunity to raise them in prior habeas corpus proceedings. The Court strangely relies on Washington v. Mayo, 77 So.2d 620. That case involved a habeas corpus petition in which two contentions were raised. The first contention had been expressly raised and decided in a previous habeas corpus proceeding. The second contention, however, had not been raised previously. This contention was decided on the merits by the Florida Supreme Court even though the petitioner \"has not shown that he did not have a fair and adequate opportunity to raise and have it determined.\" Id., at 622.\n\nJohnson v. Mayo, 69 So.2d 307, and Irvin v. Chapman, 75 So.2d 591, also relied on by the Court, are not in point. In both cases, the Florida Supreme Court held that an issue that could have been raised on direct appeal from the conviction could not be litigated in subsequent habeas corpus proceedings.\n2\n Those cases did not involve the question now before us - whether prior habeas corpus proceedings bar the litigation of issues which could not have been raised on direct appeal from the conviction.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nThe Florida Supreme Court has expressly dismissed a number of habeas corpus proceedings on the ground that former habeas corpus adjudications were res judicata. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 277, 290]\n\u00a0\n But in those cases the habeas corpus petitions attempted to relitigate issues which had been expressly presented and decided in the previous habeas corpus proceedings. See Moat v. Mayo, 82 So.2d 591; Pope v. Mayo, 39 So.2d 286; Florida ex rel. Williams v. Prescott, 110 Fla. 261, 148 So. 533.\n\nRes judicata is not a rigid doctrine in Florida. The Supreme Court recently refused to apply it where to do so would \"defeat the ends of justice.\" Universal Const. Co. v. City of Ft. Lauderdale, 68 So.2d 366, 369.\n4\n Once the facts alleged by petitioner are conceded, as they must be on the present record, it defeats the ends of justice to deny relief here.\n\nThe language of the Florida Supreme Court's order in the present case indicates that petitioner's federal constitutional claims were rejected not on grounds of res judicata but on their merits. The petition was denied because of failure to show \"probable cause to believe that [petitioner] is detained in custody without lawful authority.\" Faced with a similar state court order in Williams v. Kaiser, \n323 \nU.S., at 478\n, we said: \"The denial of the petition on the grounds that it fails to state a cause of action strongly suggests that it was denied because there was no cause of action based on the federal right.\" We should hold the same in the present case.\n\nOnce we reach the merits the answer seems clear. It is well settled that to obtain a conviction by the use of \n\n[351 \nU.S. 277, 291]\n\u00a0\n testimony known by the prosecution to be perjured offends due process. Mooney v. Holohan, \n294 \nU.S. 103\n; Pyle v. Kansas, \n317 \nU.S. 213\n. While the petition did not allege that the prosecution knew that petitioner's codefendants were lying when they implicated petitioner, the State now knows that the testimony of the only witnesses against petitioner was false. No competent evidence remains to support the conviction. Deprivation of a hearing under these circumstances amounts in my opinion to a denial of due process of law.\n\nPerhaps a hearing on the charges would dispel them. But on the present record, we have a grave miscarriage of justice involving an invasion of federal rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In the 1949 petition, petitioner argued that the testimony was perjured, but he did not present this as a federal question. The 1952 petition did not mention the perjured testimony issue.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The Florida Supreme Court stated the rationale of these decisions as follows: \"It is elementary that a writ of habeas corpus cannot be used as a substitute for appeal, motion to quash or a motion in arrest of judgment.\" Johnson v. Mayo, 69 So.2d, at 308.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Petitioner's claim of a denial of federal rights because his conviction is based solely on perjured testimony obviously could not have been raised on direct appeal. He did not obtain the affidavits showing that the witnesses had lied until long after the time to appeal his conviction had expired.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] \"The basic principle upon which the doctrine of res judicata rests is that there should be an end to litigation and that `in the interest of the State every justiciable controversy should be settled in one action in order that the courts and the parties will not be bothered for the same cause by interminable litigation.' 59 So.2d at page 44; italics supplied. Nevertheless, when a choice must be made we apprehend that the State, as well as the courts, is more interested in the fair and proper administration of justice than in rigidly applying a fiction of the law designed to terminate litigation.\" 68 So.2d, at 369. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 277, 292]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","28":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEAST TEXAS LINES v.

JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThree motor common carriers filed a complaint with the Interstate Commerce Commission under 204 (c) of Part II of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 Stat. 547, as amended, 49 U.S.C. 304 (c), alleging that Frozen Food Express, a common carrier by motor vehicle, was and had been transporting fresh and frozen meats and fresh and frozen dressed poultry in interstate commerce without a certificate of convenience and necessity from the Commission which covers those commodities. The complaint prayed for a cease and desist order. Frozen Food Express admitted that it was and had been so transporting the named commodities but asserted in defense that those operations were within the exemption of 203 (b) (6).\n1\n\u00a0\n\nThe Commission found that Frozen Food Express had been performing unauthorized operations and that fresh and frozen meats and fresh and frozen dressed poultry were not within the exemption of 203 (b) (6). 62 \n\n[351 \nU.S. 49, 51]\n\u00a0\n M. C. C. 646. Accordingly it ordered Frozen Food Express to cease and desist from engaging in these operations. Frozen Food Express brought suit before a three-judge District Court (28 U.S.C. 2325) to set the Commission's order aside, 28 U.S.C. 1336; 49 Stat. 550, as amended, 49 U.S.C. 305 (g); 60 Stat. 243, 5 U.S.C. 1009. The answer of the United States and the complaint in intervention filed by the Secretary of Agriculture supported the position of Frozen Food Express. The original complainants before the Commission and other interested carriers and carrier associations intervened in support of the Commission. The District Court sustained the Commission's conclusion that fresh and frozen meats are nonexempt commodities. No appeal was taken from that holding. The District Court held that fresh and frozen dressed poultry are exempt commodities under 203 (b) (6) and restrained the Commission from enforcing its cease and desist order as respects those products. 128 F. Supp. 374. The cases are here by appeal. 28 U.S.C. 1253, 2101 (b).\n\nWe agree with the District Court that the Commission's ruling does not square with the statute. The exemption of motor vehicles carrying \"agricultural (including horticultural) commodities (not including manufactured products thereof)\" was designed to preserve for the farmers the advantage of low-cost motor transportation. See especially 79 Cong. Rec. 12217. The victory in the Congress for the exemption was recognition that the price which the farmer obtains for his products is greatly affected by the cost of transporting them to the consuming market in their raw state or after they have become marketable by incidental processing.\n\nThe history of the words \"agricultural . . . commodities (not including manufactured products thereof)\" contained in 203 (b) (6) supports that conclusion. The bill as it came to the floor of the House from the Interstate \n\n[351 \nU.S. 49, 52]\n\u00a0\n and Foreign Commerce Committee (79 Cong. Rec. 12204) exempted \"motor vehicles used exclusively in carrying livestock or unprocessed agricultural products.\" Id., 12220. Mr. Pettengill for the Committee offered an amendment which substituted for the words \"unprocessed agricultural products\" the phrase \"agricultural commodities not including manufactured products thereof.\" That amendment was agreed to after the following colloquy:\n\n \"Mr. PETTENGILL. Mr. Chairman, we have heard a good deal of discussion this afternoon as to what is a processed agricultural product, whether that would include pasteurized milk or ginned cotton. It was not the intent of the committee that it should include those products. Therefore, to meet the views of many Members we thought we would strike out the word `unprocessed' and make it apply only to manufactured products.\n\n\n  .  .  . .   .\n\n\n \"Mr. WHITTINGTON. In other words, under the amendment to the committee amendment, cotton in bales and cottonseed transported from the ginneries to the market or to a public warehouse would be exempt, whereas they might not be exempt if the language remained, because ginning is sometimes synonymous with processing.\n\n\n \"Mr. PETTENGILL. That is correct.\"\n\n\n It is plain from this change that the exemption of \"agricultural commodities\" was considerably broadened by making clear that the exemption was lost not by incidental or preliminary processing but by manufacturing.\n2\n Killing, dressing, and freezing a chicken is certainly a \n\n[351 \nU.S. 49, 53]\n\u00a0\n change in the commodity. But it is no more drastic a change than the change which takes place in milk from pasteurizing, homogenizing, adding vitamin concentrates, standardizing, and bottling. Yet the Commission agrees that milk so processed is not a \"manufactured\" product, but falls within the meaning of the \"agricultural\" exemption. 52 M. C. C. 511, 551. The Commission also agrees that ginned cotton and cottonseed are exempt. Id., 523-524. But there is hardly less difference between cotton in the field and cotton at the gin or in the bale or between cottonseed in the field and cottonseed at the gin, than between a chicken in the pen and one that is dressed. The ginned and baled cotton and the cottonseed, as well as the dressed chicken, have gone through a processing stage. But neither has been \"manufactured\" in the normal sense of the word. The Court in Anheuser-Busch Assn. v. United States, \n207 \nU.S. 556, 562\n, in a case arising under the tariff laws, said,\n\n \". . . Manufacture implies a change, but every change is not manufacture, and yet every change in an article is the result of treatment, labor and manipulation. But something more is necessary, as set forth and illustrated in Hartranft v. Wiegmann, \n121 \nU.S. 609\n. There must be transformation; a new and different article must emerge, `having a distinctive name, character or use.'\" \n\n[351 \nU.S. 49, 54]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n In that case imported corks were made ready for use in beer bottles by stamping, by removal of dust, meal, bugs, and worms, by washing and steaming to remove tannin and to increase elasticity, and by drying. Plainly, the corks were processed. But the Court held they had not been manufactured within the drawback provision of the tariff laws. And see Hartranft v. Wiegmann, \n121 \nU.S. 609, 615\n; United States v. Dudley, \n174 \nU.S. 670\n.\n\nA chicken that has been killed and dressed is still a chicken. Removal of its feathers and entrails has made it ready for market. But we cannot conclude that this processing which merely makes the chicken marketable turns it into a \"manufactured\" commodity.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nAt some point processing and manufacturing will merge. But where the commodity retains a continuing substantial identity through the processing stage we cannot say that it has been \"manufactured\" within the meaning of 203 (b) (6).\n\nThe Commission is the expert in the field of transportation. And its judgment is entitled to great deference because of its familiarity with the conditions in the industry which it regulates. American Trucking Assns. v. United States, \n344 \nU.S. 298, 310\n. But Congress has placed limits on its statutory powers; and our duty on judicial review is to determine those limits. See Social Security Board v. Nierotko, \n327 \nU.S. 358\n. Those limits would be passed here if the Commission were permitted to expand \"manufactured\" to include such incidental processing as is involved in dressing and freezing a chicken.\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] SEC. 203 (b) (6) provides: \"Nothing in this part except the provisions of section 204 relative to qualifications and maximum hours of service of employees and safety of operation or standards of equipment shall be construed to include . . . motor vehicles used in carrying property consisting of ordinary livestock, fish (including shell fish), or agricultural (including horticultural) commodities (not including manufactured products thereof), if such motor vehicles are not used in carrying any other property, or passengers, for compensation . . . .\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Two more changes were made in the agricultural exemption clause before the bill reached final form. The words \"fish, including shellfish,\" were added after the word \"livestock\" (79 Cong. Rec. 12220), and the exemption was strengthened by making it \"absolute \n\n[351 \nU.S. 49, 53]\n\u00a0\n rather than discretionary\" with the Interstate Commerce Commission. Id., at 12225-12226. As originally enacted in 1935, 203 (b) (6) exempted motor vehicles \"used exclusively\" in carrying agricultural commodities. In 1938 the word \"exclusively\" was deleted and the following language was added at the end of the clause: \"if such motor vehicles are not used in carrying any other property, or passengers, for compensation.\" 52 Stat. 1237. In 1940 the word \"ordinary\" was inserted before the word \"livestock,\" making the exemption applicable to \"ordinary livestock.\" 54 Stat. 921. Finally, in 1952, the words \"agricultural commodities\" were broadened to \"agricultural (including horticultural) commodities.\" 66 Stat. 479.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The fact that most poultry is sold alive and is not killed and processed by the grower is not controlling.

C. 646, and its administrative practice of over 15 years, I would sustain its interpretation of the Act to the effect that fresh and frozen dressed poultry, like fresh and frozen dressed meats, are not entitled to exemption as agricultural commodities. No appeal has been taken from that part of the judgment which held valid the Commission's determination that fresh and frozen dressed meats are products manufactured from agricultural commodities. The Commission's like treatment of poultry is not arbitrary or unreasonable. On the contrary, there was much evidence before the Commission which clearly supported its decision. Consequently, we should accord that decision the weight ordinarily given to informed administrative action. We cannot say that the order of the Commission, which held that there is no significant distinction between the two, is not an allowable judgment.\n\n \"Such determinations [of fact by the Shipping Board or Interstate Commerce Commission as a basis for administrative orders] will not be set aside by courts if there is evidence to support them.

Before expiration of the contract and without the consent of the distributor, the supplier filed with the Commission under 205 (d) of the Act a schedule purporting to increase its rate to the distributor. Acting under 205 (e), the Commission conducted proceedings to determine the reasonableness of the new rate, denied the distributor's motion to reject the filing on the ground that the supplier could not thus unilaterally change the contract, and held the new rate not to be \"unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory, or preferential.\" Held:\n\n 1. These proceedings were not effective to supersede the supplier's contract with the distributor. United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas Service Corp., ante, p. 332. Pp. 352-353.\n\n\n 2. The requirements of 206 (a), which provides that, if the Commission finds an existing rate to be \"unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or preferential,\" it may determine a \"just and reasonable rate\" and fix the same by order, were not satisfied by the Commission's statement that, \"if a finding on the lawfulness of the [existing] contract rate were necessary or appropriate, on the record before us that finding would have to be that the [existing] rate is unreasonably low and therefore unlawful. For none of the evidence in this record warrants a finding that any rate would be reasonable that would produce a return of substantially less than the 4.75% resulting from the proposed rate, which is the minimum [the supplier] is willing to accept.\" Pp. 353-355.\n\n\n  (a) Under 206 (a), the Commission has undoubted power to prescribe a change in contract rates whenever it determines \n\n[350 \nU.S. 348, 349]\n\u00a0\n them to be unlawful; but its power is limited to prescribing the rate \"to be thereafter observed,\" and it can effect no change prior to the date of the order. P. 353.\n\n\n  (b) If the proceedings here satisfied in substance the requirements of 206 (a), it would seem immaterial that the investigation was begun as one into the reasonableness of the proposed rate rather than the existing contract rate. P. 353.\n\n\n  (c) The purpose of the power given the Commission under 206 (a) is the protection of the public interest, as distinguished from the private interest of the utilities, and a contract may not be said to be either \"unjust\" or \"unreasonable\" simply because it is unprofitable to the public utility. Pp. 354-355.\n\n\n 3. The order of the Court of Appeals setting aside the Commission's approval of the new rate and remanding the case to the Commission is affirmed with instructions to remand the case to the Commission for such further proceedings, not inconsistent with this opinion, as the Commission may deem desirable.

JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis case presents questions under Title II of the Federal Power Act, 49 Stat. 847, 16 U.S.C. 824 et seq., which are in part similar to those we have decided today under the Natural Gas Act in United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas Service Corp., ante, p. 332. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 348, 350]\n\u00a0\n The pertinent provisions of the Federal Power Act, set forth in the margin,\n1\n are 205 (c), (d), and (e), and 206 (a), which are substantially identical to 4 (c), \n\n[350 \nU.S. 348, 351]\n\u00a0\n (d), and (e), and 5 (a), respectively, of the Natural Gas Act.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nRespondent Sierra Pacific Power Company (Sierra) distributes electricity to consumers in northern Nevada and eastern California. For many years, it has purchased the major part of its electric power from petitioner Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E), a \"public utility\" subject to regulation under Part II of the Federal Power Act. In 1947 Sierra, faced with increased postwar demands and consumer agitation for cheaper power, began \n\n[350 \nU.S. 348, 352]\n\u00a0\n negotiating for power from other sources, including the Federal Bureau of Reclamation, which at the time had unused capacity at Shasta Dam. To forestall the potential competition, PG&E offered Sierra a 15-year contract for power at a special low rate, which offer Sierra finally accepted in June 1948. The contract was duly filed with the Federal Power Commission.\n\nEarly in 1953, when power from Shasta Dam was no longer available to Sierra, PG&E, without the consent of Sierra, filed with the Commission under 205 (d) of the Federal Power Act a schedule purporting to increase its rate to Sierra by approximately 28%. The Commission, acting under 205 (e), suspended the effective date of the new rate until September 6, 1953, and initiated a proceeding to determine its reasonableness. Sierra was permitted to intervene in the proceeding but its motion to reject the filing on the ground that PG&E could not thus unilaterally change the contract was denied. After completion of the hearings, the Commission, by order dated June 17, 1954, reaffirmed its refusal to reject the filing and held the new rate not to be \"unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory, or preferential.\" 7 P. U. R. 3d 256. On Sierra's petition for review, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, holding that the contract rate could be changed only upon a finding by the Commission that it was unreasonable, set aside the Commission's order and remanded the case with instructions to the Commission to dismiss the 205 (e) proceeding, but without prejudice to its instituting a new proceeding under 206 (a) to determine the reasonableness of the contract rate. 96 U.S. App. D.C. 140, 223 F.2d 605. We brought the case here because of the importance of the questions involved in the administration of the Federal Power Act. \n349 \nU.S. 937\n.\n\nThe first question before us is whether PG&E's unilateral filing of the new rate under 205 (d), and the \n\n[350 \nU.S. 348, 353]\n\u00a0\n approval of the new rate by the Commission under 205 (e), were effective to supersede PG&E's contract with Sierra. We think not. As the parties concede, the provisions of the Federal Power Act relevant to this question are in all material respects substantially identical to the equivalent provisions of the Natural Gas Act. In United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas Service Corp., supra, decided today, we construed the Natural Gas Act as not authorizing unilateral contract changes, and that interpretation is equally applicable to the Federal Power Act. Accordingly, for the reasons there given, we conclude that neither PG&E's filing of the new rate nor the Commission's finding that the new rate was not unlawful was effective to change PG&E's contract with Sierra.\n\nThis case, however, raises a further question not present in the Mobile case. The Commission has undoubted power under 206 (a) to prescribe a change in contract rates whenever it determines such rates to be unlawful. While this power is limited to prescribing the rate \"to be thereafter observed\" and thus can effect no change prior to the date of the order, the Commission's order here, if based on the necessary findings, could have been effective to prescribe the proposed rate as the rate to be in effect prospectively from the date of the order, June 17, 1954. If the proceedings here satisfied in substance the requirements of 206 (a), it would seem immaterial that the investigation was begun as one into the reasonableness of the proposed rate rather than the existing contract rate.\n\nThe condition precedent to the Commission's exercise of its power under 206 (a) is a finding that the existing rate is \"unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or preferential.\" Petitioners contend that the Commission did in fact make such a finding. It was stipulated in the proceedings before the Commission that 5.5% was normally a reasonable rate of return for PG&E's operations, \n\n[350 \nU.S. 348, 354]\n\u00a0\n that the contract rate would produce a 2.6% rate of return, and that the proposed rate would produce a 4.75% rate of return. The Commission concluded that the proposed rate was not unreasonably high because it provided no more than a fair return and was not unreasonably low because the 0.75% deficiency of its yield from the stipulated reasonable rate of return was not being made up on other sales and was justified in order to retain business the loss of which by PG&E would result in idle facilities. It also concluded that the proposed rate was not unduly discriminatory or preferential, despite substantial differences between it and the rates being charged other customers. While no further findings were necessary in view of the Commission's interpretation of the Act as permitting unilateral contract changes, the Commission went on to say:\n\n\"However, we may point out that if a finding on the lawfulness of the 1948 contract rate were necessary or appropriate, on the record before us that finding would have to be that the 1948 rate is unreasonably low and therefore unlawful. For none of the evidence in this record warrants a finding that any rate would be reasonable that would produce a return of substantially less than the 4.75% resulting from the proposed rate, which is the minimum PG&E is willing to accept.\"\n\n\n It is contended that by this statement the Commission in substance found that the existing contract rate was \"unreasonable\" and fixed the proposed rate as \"the just and reasonable rate,\" thereby satisfying the requirements of 206 (a).\n\nBut even accepting this statement as a finding of unreasonableness of the contract rate, the Commission's conclusion appears on its face to be based on an erroneous standard. In short, the Commission holds that the \n\n[350 \nU.S. 348, 355]\n\u00a0\n contract rate is unreasonable solely because it yields less than a fair return on the net invested capital. But, while it may be that the Commission may not normally impose upon a public utility a rate which would produce less than a fair return, it does not follow that the public utility may not itself agree by contract to a rate affording less than a fair return or that, if it does so, it is entitled to be relieved of its improvident bargain. Cf. Arkansas Natural Gas Co. v. Railroad Comm'n, \n261 \nU.S. 379\n. In such circumstances the sole concern of the Commission would seem to be whether the rate is so low as to adversely affect the public interest - as where it might impair the financial ability of the public utility to continue its service, cast upon other consumers an excessive burden, or be unduly discriminatory. That the purpose of the power given the Commission by 206 (a) is the protection of the public interest, as distinguished from the private interests of the utilities, is evidenced by the recital in 201 of the Act that the scheme of regulation imposed \"is necessary in the public interest.\" When 206 (a) is read in the light of this purpose, it is clear that a contract may not be said to be either \"unjust\" or \"unreasonable\" simply because it is unprofitable to the public utility.\n\nWhether under the facts of this case the contract rate is so low as to have an adverse effect on the public interest is of course a question to be determined in the first instance by the Commission. We shall therefore affirm the order of the Court of Appeals, with instructions to remand the case to the Federal Power Commission for such further proceedings, not inconsistent with this opinion, as the Commission may deem desirable.\n\n    It is so ordered.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"SEC. 205. . . .

JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nPart II of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 Stat. 543, as amended, 49 U.S.C. 301 et seq., grants the Commission pervasive control over motor carriers. Common carriers and contract carriers by motor vehicle, subject to that part of the Act, must have a certificate of public convenience and necessity or a permit issued by the Commission. 206 (a), 209 (a). The Commission has powers of investigation to determine if a motor carrier has complied with the Act; and it has authority to issue an order compelling compliance. 204 (c). These requirements for a certificate or permit\n*\n are not, however, applicable to \"motor vehicles used in carrying property consisting of ordinary livestock, fish (including shell fish), or agricultural (including horticultural) commodities (not including manufactured products thereof), if such motor vehicles are not used in carrying any other property, or passengers, for compensation.\" 203 (b) (6).\n\nThe controversy in these cases centers around this \"agricultural\" exemption. After an investigation instituted on its own motion, the Commission issued an order that specified commodities are not \"agricultural\" within the meaning of 203 (b) (6).\n\nThe hearing to determine the meaning and application of the term \"agricultural . . . commodities (not including manufactured products thereof)\" as used in 203 (b) (6) was held before an examiner. It was a public hearing at which various governmental officials and agencies and \n\n[351 \nU.S. 40, 42]\n\u00a0\n various producers, shippers, and carriers appeared and presented evidence. The Commission's decision was in the form of a report and order. 52 M. C. C. 511. The report, which concerns various groups of commodities, covers 71 pages of the printed record. The findings list those commodities that the Commission finds are exempted under 203 (b) (6) and those that are not. The order of the Commission incorporates the \"findings\" and states that the proceeding \"be, and it is hereby discontinued.\"\n\nFrozen Food Express, the plaintiff, is a motor carrier transporting numerous commodities which the Commission ruled were nonexempt under 203 (b) (6) but which the carrier claims are \"agricultural commodities.\" Plaintiff, who was not a party to the administrative proceeding, instituted suit before a three-judge District Court (28 U.S.C. 2325) to enjoin the order of the Commission and have it set aside, naming the United States and the Commission as defendants. 28 U.S.C. 1336; 49 Stat. 550, as amended, 49 U.S.C. 305 (g); 60 Stat. 243, 5 U.S.C. 1009. The complaint alleged that plaintiff is a common carrier by motor vehicle, holding a certificate of public convenience and necessity which authorizes it to transport certain commodities between designated points and places; that plaintiff is transporting, in addition to those commodities, commodities which are exempt under 203 (b) (6) and for which plaintiff has sought no authority from the Commission; that the Commission in its order has held the latter commodities nonexempt and accordingly has deprived it of the right granted by the statute; that the order of the Commission classifying certain commodities as nonexempt is unlawful; and that the Commission threatens to enjoin transportation of the commodities which plaintiff claims are exempt. The Secretary of Agriculture intervened, supporting plaintiff's position on some of the commodities. Other interveners \n\n[351 \nU.S. 40, 43]\n\u00a0\n are trucking associations and railroads which support the Commission. The United States as a defendant supports the Commission on some of its findings and opposes it on others.\n\nThe District Court, being of the view that the case was controlled by United States v. Los Angeles R. Co., \n273 \nU.S. 299\n, dismissed the action, saying that the \"order\" of the Commission was not subject to judicial review. 128 F. Supp. 374. The cases are here by appeal. 28 U.S.C. 1253, 2101 (b).\n\nWe disagree with the District Court. We do not think United States v. Los Angeles R. Co., supra, is controlling here. In that case the \"order\" held nonreviewable was a valuation of a carrier's property made by the Commission. The Court held that the \"order\" was no more than a report of an investigation which might never be the basis of a proceeding before the Commission or a court. Mr. Justice Brandeis, speaking for the Court, said:\n\n \"The so-called order here complained of is one which does not command the carrier to do, or to refrain from doing, any thing; which does not grant or withhold any authority, privilege or license; which does not extend or abridge any power or facility; which does not subject the carrier to any liability, civil or criminal; which does not change the carrier's existing or future status or condition; which does not determine any right or obligation. This so-called order is merely the formal record of conclusions reached after a study of data collected in the course of extensive research conducted by the Commission, through its employees. It is the exercise solely of the function of investigation. . . .\" \n273 \nU.S. 309\n-310.\n\n\n The situation here is quite different. The determination by the Commission that a commodity is not an \n\n[351 \nU.S. 40, 44]\n\u00a0\n exempt agricultural product has an immediate and practical impact on carriers who are transporting the commodities, and on shippers as well. The \"order\" of the Commission warns every carrier, who does not have authority from the Commission to transport those commodities, that it does so at the risk of incurring criminal penalties. 222 (a). Where unauthorized operations occur, the Commission may proceed administratively and issue a cease and desist order. 204 (c). Such orders of the Commission are enforceable by the courts. 222 (b). And wilful violation of a cease and desist order is ground for revocation of a certificate or permit. 212. The determination made by the Commission is not therefore abstract, theoretical, or academic. Cf. El Dorado Oil Works v. United States, \n328 \nU.S. 12, 18\n-19. The \"order\" of the Commission which classifies commodities as exempt or nonexempt is, indeed, the basis for carriers in ordering and arranging their affairs. Cf. Rochester Tel. Corp. v. United States, \n307 \nU.S. 125, 132\n. Carriers who are without the appropriate certificate or permit, because they believe they carry exempt commodities, run civil and criminal risks. A carrier authorized to carry specified commodities and dependent on exempt articles for its return load may lose its right to operate at all, if it does not respect the Commission's \"order.\" Carriers and shippers alike are told that they are or are not free to bargain for rates, that they must or must not pay the filed charges. The \"order\" of the Commission is in substance a \"declaratory\" one, see 60 Stat. 240, 5 U.S.C. 1004 (d), which touches vital interests of carriers and shippers alike and sets the standard for shaping the manner in which an important segment of the trucking business will be done. Cf. Columbia Broadcasting System v. United States, \n316 \nU.S. 407\n. The consequences we have summarized are not conjectural. The Commission itself places this interpretation on its action and argues, contrary to its \n\n[351 \nU.S. 40, 45]\n\u00a0\n position in the Los Angeles Case, supra, for finality of the order. We conclude that the issues raised in the complaint are justiciable and that the District Court should adjudicate the merits.\n\n     Reversed.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Exempted carriers are also not subject to the provisions concerning rates and charges, 217, 218, nor to the requirements concerning bodily injury and property damage insurance. 215.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, dissenting.\n\nI do not agree that the District Court had jurisdiction to entertain this action to set aside the Commission's \"order.\" It seems to me that the case falls squarely within those carefully developed rules which require that judicial intervention be withheld until administrative action has reached its complete development. I find nothing in the nature of the order which commends it to reviewability at this stage other than the fact that its promulgation was preceded by a lengthy investigation and that it contains a series of \"findings\" and \"conclusions.\" These factors should not be permitted to obscure the true character of the order.\n\nAfter a self-initiated investigation, in which various carriers participated, the Commission entered this order discontinuing the proceedings and incorporating the \"findings of fact and conclusions\" of the Commission. That the order was not intended to be a \"legislative\" regulation seems apparent, since it was not put in the form ordinarily used by the Commission in promulgating regulations. The order simply lists the commodities considered by the Commission and determines whether they are within the 203 (b) (6) exemption; it nowhere commands that carriers hauling commodities considered non-exempt comply either with the order or with the general requirements of the Interstate Commerce Act. It is clear, therefore, that no administrative or criminal proceeding can be brought for violation of the order itself. And it is equally clear that the proceeding did not conclude any rights as between any specific carriers and the Commission. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 40, 46]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Interstate Commerce Act does, of course, provide for administrative and criminal sanctions to enforce compliance with its provisions. An uncertificated carrier hauling commodities non-exempt under 203 (b) (6) runs the risk of a criminal prosecution under 222 (a) of the Act. But the order has no operative effect in such a proceeding - it does not extend the carrier's criminal liability, which exists because of a violation of the Act and not the order. And if the enforcement takes the form of a cease and desist proceeding against a particular carrier, again the only question would be whether the Act, rather than the order, was being violated. If such an administrative proceeding is instituted, and a cease and desist order is issued, the carrier subject to that order would be entitled to contest the statutory authority of the Commission in judicial proceedings of precisely the scope brought here.\n\nNor can this order be likened to a determination of status, held reviewable in Rochester Telephone Corp. v. United States, \n307 \nU.S. 125\n. As I understand that case, the touchstone of the decision was that the determination \"necessarily and immediately carried direction of obedience to previously formulated mandatory orders addressed generally to all carriers amenable to the Commission's authority.\" 307 U.S., at p. 144. The specific determination that a particular carrier must comply with Commission regulations is quite different from this order, which is directed to no one in particular and is binding on no one, not even the Commission. Neither can this order be analogized to a declaratory order directed to the status of a particular carrier, which might be reviewable as carrying with it a direct threat of prosecution - see Rochester Telephone Corp. v. United States, supra, at p. 132, n. 11. Indeed, the Commission itself does not consider its determinations the final answer to the meaning of the 203 (b) (6) exemption, even for administrative \n\n[351 \nU.S. 40, 47]\n\u00a0\n purposes. This is evident from the proceedings in East Texas Motor Freight Lines v. Frozen Food Express, post, p. 49, where in a cease and desist proceeding the Commission heard new evidence on whether the particular commodities there involved were within the exemption, and was evidently ready to reconsider the determinations embodied in the order involved here.\n\nTo be sure, the order does serve as a warning to carriers that the Commission interprets the Act in a particular way, and it is true that courts will give the Commission's views some indeterminate weight in construing the statute. But that very fact, instead of justifying a holding of reviewability, seems to me a strong argument against it. The Commission's willingness, in individual cases, to reconsider its determinations with respect to particular commodities points up the tentative nature of the conclusions here sought to be reviewed. When this action is heard on the merits, the District Court will have as an aid in construing the statute administrative interpretations which are admittedly inconclusive, and if they are to be given any weight it would seem important that this Court not do anything to freeze them in their present immature state. For all we know, the Commission's decision not to issue this order in the form of regulations may have been because it recognized the need for further study.\n\nYears of experience have shown that 203 (b) (6) presents difficult problems of interpretation, and this Court should be wary of establishing a procedure which would prematurely throw into the courts questions of statutory construction not arising in the context of concrete facts, and which does not bring to the courts even the benefit of final interpretation by the agency assigned to administer the statute. That this should be done in a case where there is a right of direct appeal to this Court makes the wisdom of today's decision even more questionable. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 40, 48]\n\u00a0\n\n\nLastly, the order does not have the immediate impact of the sort which, at times, has led this Court to regard particular administrative action as ripe for judicial review. In Columbia Broadcasting System v. United States, \n316 \nU.S. 407\n, the very existence of the regulations had, without anything more, an immediate effect on the business of the party attacking them. There is much to be said for finding administrative action reviewable when it entails immediate practical consequences for those affected by it. Cf. Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee v. McGrath, \n341 \nU.S. 123\n. But the carriers subject to the Interstate Commerce Act are in no way worse off now than they were before this order issued; there is no greater liability or risk under the statute occasioned by the order, which has no more effect than would any other informal expression of views by the Commission. If anything, carriers are in a better position, since they can now make a more reasoned judgment as to the applicability of the statute to particular commodities, and this may have been the principal reason for the Commission making public its findings.\n\nIn my view, then, the language quoted by the majority from United States v. Los Angeles R. Co. aptly describes this order of the Commission, and I consider that wise decision controlling here. Neither the character nor the meaning of this order can be changed by the fact that the Commission, in asking us to hold it reviewable, calls it a \"formal determination\" of the scope of 203 (b) (6). The significant fact is that, as shown by East Texas Motor Freight Lines v. Frozen Food Express, post, p. 49, the Commission itself does not consider its order definitive. Today's decision opens the door wide to premature judicial review of various kinds of administrative action, and I must withhold my assent from it. I would affirm the decision below. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 40, 49]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","31":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGENERAL BOX CO. v. UNITED STATES(1956)\nNo. 383\nArgued: March 28, 1956Decided: May 7, 1956\n\n\n\n\n Petitioner owned timber on \"batture,\" land located between low-and high-water mark on the Mississippi River in Louisiana, which was subject to a servitude of the State for levee purposes. The rights of the State had been donated to the United States. Without notice to petitioner, the timber was destroyed by a government contractor in levee-building operations, and petitioner sued in the federal court under the Tucker Act to recover its value. Held:\n\n 1. This Court accepts the determination of the Court of Appeals that, under Louisiana law, prior notice to petitioner was not a prerequisite to an appropriation of its timber for levee purposes. Pp. 164-166.\n\n\n 2. Petitioner's property was effectively appropriated by state authorities pursuant to the servitude, and therefore the United States is not liable to petitioner for its value. Pp. 166-167.\n\n\n 3. The State having donated to the United States its rights as against petitioner's timber, the United States could exercise those rights to the fullest extent without incurring liability, just as the State could have done. P. 167.\n\n\n 4. The destruction of petitioner's timber was not a taking by the United States in the exercise of the power of eminent domain for which the Fifth Amendment required compensation. P. 167.\n\n\n 224 F.2d 7, affirmed.\n\nEdward Donald Moseley and Ross R. Barnett argued the cause for petitioner. On the brief with Mr. Moseley was Fred G. Benton. P. Z. Jones and Carl A. Chadwick entered an appearance for petitioner.\n\nS. Billingsley Hill argued the cause for the United States. With him on the brief were Solicitor General Sobeloff, Assistant Attorney General Morton, John R. Benney and Roger P. Marquis. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 159, 160]\n\u00a0\n\n\nFred S. LeBlanc, Attorney General, and John L. Madden, Assistant Attorney General, filed a brief for the State of Louisiana, as amicus curiae, urging affirmance.\n\nMR. JUSTICE REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nGeneral Box Company, an owner of trees of commercial value along the main stem of the Mississippi River in Louisiana, brought this action to recover from the United States the value of its timber destroyed by the Government through its duly authorized agent, a contractor.\n\nThe trees grew upon land belonging to others and located between the low- and high-water mark of the river. Such land is known in Louisiana as \"batture.\"\n1\n Since colonial days batture has been subject to a servitude of the State for use in the construction and maintenance of levees. It may be used for these purposes without the payment of compensation to the owner.\n2\n The United States cooperates with Louisiana in the containment of the Mississippi within levees.\n3\n To carry out federal plans in the area in controversy, the United States requires,\n4\n and Louisiana agrees to furnish,\n5\n the necessary rights-of-way \"without cost\" for the construction of levees. Louisiana has given general authority to its Levee Boards to donate to the United States the necessary \"lands, movable \n\n[351 \nU.S. 159, 161]\n\u00a0\n or immovable property, rights of way, or servitudes\" for flood control use.\n6\n The Fifth Louisiana Levee District, the one here involved, agreed to meet the requirements of the federal Flood Control Act.\n7\n\u00a0\n\nThe location of the operation giving rise to this action was at the Brabston Levee in the Fifth Louisiana Levee District. The first step taken by the United States to obtain the permission of the State to use the State's servitude in the batture here in issue was the filing of the federal plans with the State District Engineer. The plans were approved by the Engineer and the local Levee Board was so notified.\n8\n On June 10, 1947, the Levee Board received the drawings from the United States District Engineer with the following request for authority:\n\n \"It is desired that this District be furnished a formal statement by your Board that rights-of-way are available for the construction of the enlargement and granting the United States a right of entry to prosecute the work. This statement may be in the form of a letter signed by the President of the Board.\" \n\n[351 \nU.S. 159, 162]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n Under a standing resolution, adopted September 12, 1945, the President of the Board was empowered to honor applications for such authority.\n9\n On June 12, 1947, the Board President responded to the United States Engineer, quoting the words of the request and adding:\n\n \"The Board of Commissioners of the Fifth Louisiana Levee District hereby is glad to comply with your request and render you any assistance possible.\"\n\n\n On July 9 that letter was spread upon the minutes of the Board. We accept that, as did the Court of Appeals, as a ratification by the Board of the act of its President. On July 10 the contractors who were to execute the levee work were authorized by the United States to proceed within 20 days, and the clearing of the batture was commenced on July 22.\n\nNo notice was given to petitioner of the intention to bulldoze its trees off the batture. On September 12 the petitioner discovered that the trees were being destroyed, and an objection was promptly made. The contractor, however, refused to halt its operations, relying upon its contract with the Government.\n\nPetitioner brought two actions in the District Court under the Tucker Act. 28 U.S.C. 1346 (a) (2), to recover the value of the destroyed timber.\n10\n The suits \n\n[351 \nU.S. 159, 163]\n\u00a0\n were consolidated for trial, and ultimately a single judgment was entered against the United States in the amount of $10,801 plus interest.\n11\n Both the United States and petitioner took appeals to the Court of Appeals, the former on the merits and the latter from so much of the judgment as fixed the interest at 4% from date of judgment. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding the United States to be free from liability.\n12\n We granted certiorari to examine the liability of the United States for proceeding to clear this land without notice to petitioner, the owner of the trees, and thus without granting petitioner a reasonable opportunity to salvage the timber.\n13\n\u00a0\n\nOne of the defenses relied upon by the United States throughout this litigation is a claim that it is not liable to petitioner for the timber losses because it received rights-of-way on the land involved from the Levee Board. and that the Levee Board legally appropriated those rights-of-way without compensation under its riparian servitude. Petitioner concedes that under the civil law of Louisiana the property on which its trees were standing, being batture, is subject to a riparian servitude for use by the State of Louisiana in constructing and repairing levees, and that historically the owner of such \n\n[351 \nU.S. 159, 164]\n\u00a0\n property has been required to permit State use without compensation of such part thereof as might be needed for levee purposes. And it is not denied that the timber on this land, as well as the land itself, is subject to the exercise of the servitude for levee purposes.\n14\n\u00a0\n\nPetitioner in effect does claim, however, that the State did not effectively exercise the riparian servitude for the reason that the appropriation here was arbitrary and therefore beyond the power of the State. This contention is based upon the fact that no notice of the proposed destruction was given to petitioner. It is argued that under Louisiana law, which of course defines the bounds of the riparian servitude, the power possessed by the State by reason of the servitude is not an unlimited and arbitrary power;\n15\n that it would be arbitrary, oppressive and unjust to exercise the State's rights under the servitude in the circumstances of this case without prior notice to petitioner; that therefore the attempt by the State to exercise the servitude without such notice was ineffective to cause an appropriation of the timber pursuant to the \n\n[351 \nU.S. 159, 165]\n\u00a0\n servitude. If Louisiana could not exercise its rights under the servitude without first giving notice to petitioner, the timber here involved was never successfully taken by the State free of an obligation to compensate for the taking.\n16\n It would follow that the United States received no rights from the Levee Board permitting destruction of the trees by it free of that obligation. The Court of Appeals held, based upon its analysis of Louisiana law, that prior notice to petitioner was not a prerequisite to an appropriation of its timber for levee purposes. We ordinarily accept the determinations of the Courts of Appeals on questions of local law, and we do so here. Ragan v. Merchants Transfer Co., \n337 \nU.S. 530, 534\n; Huddleston v.Dwyer, \n322 \nU.S. 232, 237\n.\n\nThe Louisiana courts have made no pronouncement which directly controls this question. But see Board of Comm'rs v.Trouille, 212 La. 152, 31 So.2d 700. The Supreme Court of Louisiana has, however, as recently as 1946, reviewed the long history of the riparian servitude. Dickson v. Board of Comm'rs, 210 La. 121, 26 So.2d 474. In that case it was noted that:\n\n\". . . while in all of the remaining states of the Union lands necessary for levee purposes can only be used after expropriation and proper indemnification, in Louisiana the state has the right to act first, i. e., the authority to appropriate such land to a use to which it is subject under its very title, and talk later.\n\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \". . . And however unfair it may seem to the owners of this type of land they are without right to complain because their acquisition of such land was subject by law to this ancient servitude and the \n\n[351 \nU.S. 159, 166]\n\u00a0\n private mischief must be endured rather than the public inconvenience or calamity.\" 210 La., at 132, 136, 26 So.2d at 478, 479.\n\n\n The court further stated that the rights of the State under the servitude can be exercised in the way found to be \"most expeditious from an engineering, economical, and practical standpoint.\" 210 La., at 138, 26 So.2d, at 480; Board of Comm'rs v. Franklin, 219 La. 859, 866, 54 So.2d 125, 127-128. The levee enlargement plan here called for bulldozing standing timber for reasons of economy - that operation admittedly being a less expensive method for clearing land than removing the stumps of cut timber. The servitude was developed so as to insure \"that the shores of navigable rivers and streams in this state would always be kept free for the public for levee . . . purposes.\" 210 La., at 131-132, 26 So.2d, at 478. This historical background makes clear that the rights of the State in property subject to the servitude are very broad. By law, and for the good of all, lands were made available to the State for levee purposes in as convenient a manner to the State as was necessary for the public welfare, and with little regard for the severity of the obligations imposed on the individual property owner. Nothing in the development of the servitude indicates that, before the State can exercise its obviously comprehensive rights, it must provide an opportunity to remove timber from batture.\n\nSince, as we hold, petitioner's property was effectively appropriated by state authorities pursuant to the servitude, the United States cannot be liable to petitioner for the value of the property. The state, as owner of the servitude, legally could have destroyed the timber without prior notice and without any opportunity for mitigation of losses, and yet be free of liability to petitioner. The destruction, it seems to us, was consistent with the \n\n[351 \nU.S. 159, 167]\n\u00a0\n rights of the State under the servitude. Rather than undertake the levee project itself, Louisiana, through one of its agencies, donated its rights as against petitioner's timber to the United States. The United States, as done of those rights, could exercise them to their full extent without incurring liability, just as its donor could have done.\n\nThe petitioner sought compensation for the destruction of the trees based upon a claim that the \"destruction of said timber was [a] taking . . . within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment to the Federal Constitution.\" But this property was not taken by the United States in the exercise of its power of eminent domain. In effect, the timber was \"owned\" by Louisiana for levee purposes, and the United States succeeded to that \"ownership\" by \"conveyance.\" Louisiana furnished its batture as required by the law of both the United States and Louisiana for use in protecting the property in the State from floods. Petitioner did not assert in its complaints or in its question presented on petition for certiorari that the destruction violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\n17\n\u00a0\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Batture is \"that part of the river bed which is uncovered at the time of low water, but is covered annually at the time of ordinary high water.\" (Italics omitted.)

T. Shields, be and he is hereby authorized and empowered on behalf of the Board of Commissioners, Fifth Louisiana Levee District, to grant rights of way where the need is immediate, the proper right-of-way resolutions to be passed in the regular manner at the following Board meeting.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] Although alternative claims were made under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. 1346 (b), they were abandoned while the cases were still in the District Court.

The Board of Commissioner of the Fifth Levee District was made a third party defendant in the District Court pursuant to a motion of the United States. It was and is the Government's position that, if it is liable to petitioner, it is entitled to judgment over against the Board. The District Court ruled that the United States was liable and that it, and not the Levee Board, must pay the award. 119 F. Supp. 749. The Court of Appeals did not reach the question of the liability of the Board over to the United States since that court held that the United States was not liable at all. In view of our disposition of the case, we likewise need not reach that question.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] Cf. Lacour v. Red River, A. & B. B. Levee Dist., 158 La. 737, 104 So. 636; La. Const., 1921, Art. XVI, 6; Louisiana Civil Code, 1945, Art. 665. Petitioner suggests that the destruction of the timber in this case was not for \"levee purposes,' but rather was undertaken merely for the purpose of saving the government money. This contention is based on the fact that the only reason the trees were destroyed was because the contractors were permitted under their contract to bulldoze the standing trees - a less expensive method for clearing land than removing the stumps of cut timber. But in order for the use of the timber to be for \"levee purposes,\" it is not necessary that the trees themselves be employed in the construction or improvement of the levee. It is sufficient if the trees were destroyed in connection with a levee project. Cf. Lacour v. Red River, A. & B. B. Levee Dist., supra; La. Const., 1921, Art.

JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, concurring.\n\nThe conflicting views between two members and the rest of this Court on the law of Louisiana relevant to the issue in this case prove once more what a precarious business it is for us to adjudicate a federal issue dependent on what the Court finds to be state law, when the highest court of a state has not given us authoritative \n\n[351 \nU.S. 159, 168]\n\u00a0\n guidance regarding its law. In like situations I have from time to time, suggested that legal procedure is not without resources for enabling us to found our decision securely on state law. See, e. g., Propper v. Clark, \n337 \nU.S. 472, 493\n (dissenting in part). By means of the declaratory judgment (it is available in Louisiana, La. Rev. Stat., 1950, 13:4231 et seq.) or otherwise, it ought to be possible to suspend definitive judgment on the federal issue until a pronouncement can be had from the state court on controlling state law. For myself I am prepared so to proceed here. In default of it, I concur in the opinion and judgment of the Court.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom MR. JUSTICE HARLAN concurs, dissenting.\n\nWe have at the root of this case a question of Louisiana law - whether the timber grown on batture is \"property\" and, if so, whether it may be confiscated without any opportunity to the owner to salvage or remove it. The timber concededly is of value. It is bought and sold and plays a significant role in the conduct of commercial enterprises.\n1\n The Court apparently concedes that the timber is \"property\" within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment. Otherwise the Court would not reserve decision on whether the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment has been violated. If the timber is \"property\" so far as the Due Process Clause is concerned, it \n\n[351 \nU.S. 159, 169]\n\u00a0\n would seem to be \"property\" within the meaning of the Just Compensation Clause of the same Amendment. The question then comes down to whether the timber may be confiscated without any notice to the owner. If Louisiana could not confiscate the timber, then the United States certainly may not. For the United States has succeeded to such ownership as Louisiana has.\n\nConcededly this land between low- and high-water mark - the batture - may be used as the State chooses for the construction and maintenance of levees without compensation to anyone. But we have it on excellent authority that, under Louisiana law, private property on the batture may not be confiscated without reasonable opportunity of the owner to salvage it. The authority is the eminent district judge who decided this case, Hon. Ben C. Dawkins. Judge Dawkins, who was appointed to the federal bench in 1924, was a Louisiana lawyer of distinction. He not only practiced law in that State. From 1912-1918 he was a state district judge and from 1918-1924 an associate justice of Louisiana's Supreme Court. He was a member of the Louisiana Constitutional Convention in 1921. Indeed, Judge Dawkins was the author of Art. XVI, 6 of the Louisiana Constitution, which provides that batture may be taken for levee purposes without compensation. See General Box Co. v. United States, 107 F. Supp. 981, 983. Judge Dawkins held that, under Louisiana law, notice to the owner of the timber was necessary. There is no square holding of the Louisiana courts on the point. The problem lies in the penumbra of Louisiana law, making all the more difficult a prediction as to what the Louisiana courts would hold. On questions far less complicated or obscure than this one, we have deferred to decisions of the lower federal judge on the local law of his own state. See MacGregor v. State Mutual Co., \n315 \nU.S. 280, 281\n; Huddleston v. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 159, 170]\n\u00a0\n Dwyer, \n322 \nU.S. 232, 237\n; Hillsborough v. Cromwell, \n326 \nU.S. 620, 630\n; Steele v. General Mills, \n329 \nU.S. 433, 439\n; Ragan v. Merchants Transfer Co., \n337 \nU.S. 530, 534\n; Bernhardt v. Polygraphic Co., \n350 \nU.S. 198, 204\n.\n\nJudge Dawkins relied on Pruyn v. Nelson Bros., 180 La. 760, 768, 157 So. 585, 587, where the Louisiana Supreme Court in reviewing the servitude governing batture said:\n\n \"This servitude is limited only by the reasonableness of its use, and the administrative officers of the state of Louisiana are charged with determining that limit, subject to review by the courts only when oppression or injustice is shown and proved.\"\n\n\n Judge Dawkins ruled that what was done in this case amounted to \"oppression or injustice\" within the meaning of the Pruyn case. See 119 F. Supp. 749, 751. I would defer to his judgment. We are dealing with nuances of local law that only one trained in it can evaluate.\n2\n The difficulty is compounded for common-law lawyers. For this is civil law that has overtones from distinct languages and history.\n\nMr. Justice Holmes wrote, in a case from Puerto Rico, of the special deference due local judges on rulings upon matters under the civil law. Diaz v. Gonzalez, \n261 \nU.S. 102, 105\n-106:\n\n\"This is especially true in dealing with the decisions of a Court inheriting and brought up in a different system from that which prevails here. When we contemplate such a system from the outside it seems like a wall of stone, every part even with all the others, except so far as our own local education may lead us to see subordinations to which we are accustomed. But to one brought up within it, varying \n\n[351 \nU.S. 159, 171]\n\u00a0\n emphasis, tacit assumptions, unwritten practices, a thousand influences gained only from life, may give to the different parts wholly new values that logic and grammar never could have got from the books.\"\n\n\n I cannot read the Louisiana decisions without feeling that Judge Dawkins was right on the law.\n3\n The servitude governing batture is dominant but not absolute. Private property must give way before it - but only to the extent that the public welfare demands. As stated in Peart v. Meeker, 45 La.

In several cases this court has said that the power so conferred is not arbitrary, and that the citizen is not without remedy to subject it to judicial control in proper cases.\" \n\n[351 \nU.S. 159, 172]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n If the State destroyed a home or other structure in the batture without notice to the owner, I think Louisiana would grant a remedy - provided of course the State was not confronted with an emergency and did not have to act with speed. But, where there is time to give notice, it is \"oppressive\" not to do so, as Judge Dawkins said.\n\nEven if I am mistaken in this view of the Louisiana law, I would hold as a matter of federal law that the United States cannot rely on the state-created servitude to justify its own action, which borders on the wanton destruction of the property interests of the private owners of the timber. For all that appears, General Box was prepared to remove the timber without additional expense or delay to the United States.\n\nThe requirement of notice is deeply engrained in our system of jurisprudence. Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank, \n339 \nU.S. 306\n; Covey v. Town of Somers, decided this day, ante, p. 141. The taking of property without notice where notice can reasonably be given, and with the result that the owner is deprived of the chance to salvage the property, is sheer confiscation.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The timber which was destroyed was on two tracts of land. In 1946 petitioner purchased the entire fee of one tract for $30,000 and resold it for $15,000 two months later, reserving the timber rights for 20 years. In 1947 petitioner purchased the timber rights on the second tract for a period of 10 years, paying $36,000 for these rights. The trial judge found that the total value of the timber destroyed was $10,801, and he entered a judgment for that amount plus interest.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] None of the judges either of the Circuit Court or of this Court who voted to reverse Judge Dawkins is from the Louisiana Bar.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] No Louisiana cases have been found in which notice was not given in time to allow property to be salvaged from the batture. In Board of Levee Commissioners v. Kelly, 225 La. 411, 73 So.2d 299, 30 days notice was given to batture dwellers to remove their structures and possessions. And see Board of Commissioners v. Franklin, 219 La. 859, 863-864, 54 So.2d 125, 127-128; Board of Commissioners v. Trouille, 212 La. 152, 157-158, 31 So.2d 700, 701-702; Peart v. Meeker, 45 La. Ann. 421, 424, 12 So. 490, 491, in each of which notice was given. In the present case, written notice was sent to the owners after the clearing in question was completed. In this notice, the owners were warned that work would begin on another levee. The letter-notice said, \"We respectfully request that any buildings, timber or other obstacles which might be within the rights-of-way be removed prior to the time that the contractor begins work.\" The Court quotes from Dickson v. Board of Comm'rs, 210 La. 121, 26 So.2d 474, to the effect that the State may \"appropriate such land . . . and talk later.\" But the Dickson case involved consequential damages to riparian land resulting from a change in a river channel, not a taking of land or other property. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 159, 173]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","32":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGENERAL STORES CORP. v.

It had been converted from an operating company to a holding company with the shares of the subsidiaries pledged to creditors; and it had heavy short-term loans. It had no publicity held debts, but had over 2,000,000 shares of common stock listed on the American Stock Exchange and held by over 7,000 shareholders. A shareholder owning 3,000 shares, and the Securities and Exchange Commission, moved that the proceedings be dismissed unless the petition be amended to comply with Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act. Held: In deciding that proceedings under Chapter X rather than Chapter XI were appropriate, the discretion exercised by the District Court and the Court of Appeals did not transcend allowable bounds, and their judgment is affirmed. Pp. 463-468.\n\n (a) In determining whether Chapter X or Chapter XI affords the appropriate remedy, the question is whether, on the facts of the case, the formulation of a plan under the auspices of disinterested trustees, as assured by Chapter X and the other protective provisions of that Chapter, would better serve the public and private interests concerned, including those of the debtor, than the simpler arrangement under Chapter XI. Pp. 465-466.\n\n\n (b) The essential difference in the choice between Chapter X and Chapter XI is not between the small company and the large company nor in the nature of the capital structure but between the needs to be served.

JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nPetitioner instituted proceedings under c. XI of the Bankruptcy Act (52 Stat. 905, as amended, 11 U.S.C. 701 et seq.) alleging it was unable to pay its debts as they matured. It proposed an arrangement of its general unsecured trade and commercial debts, none of which is evidenced by any publicly held security. Petitioner has indeed no debts of any nature by way of bonds, mortgage certificates, notes, debentures, or obligations of like character, publicly held. It does, however, have over 2,000,000 shares of $1 par value common stock listed on the American Stock Exchange and held by over 7,000 shareholders. One of these - an owner of 3,000 shares - and the Securities and Exchange Commission moved that the proceedings be dismissed unless, within a time fixed by the court, the petition be amended to comply with the requirements of c. X of the Bankruptcy Act (52 Stat. 883, as amended, 11 U.S.C. 501 et seq.) for a corporate reorganization. The District Court granted the motions. 129 F. Supp. 801. The Court of Appeals affirmed by a \n\n[350 \nU.S. 462, 464]\n\u00a0\n divided vote. 222 F.2d 234. The case is here on certiorari. \n350 \nU.S. 809\n.\n\nPetitioner, formerly known as D. A. Schulte, Inc., has operated for some years a chain of stores for the sale of tobacco and accessory products. Petitioner has also had a chain of difficulties. Its financial problems go back at least to 1936 when it filed a petition for reorganization under former 77B of the Bankruptcy Act. After its reorganization was completed in 1940, it had a few years of prosperity followed by a postwar decline in volume of business, a rise in costs, and substantial losses. During these years $600,000 cash was raised by the sale of stock and a new management installed with a view to converting some existing stores into candy, food, and drink establishments. That idea was abandoned and the proceeds of the stock sale were used for general corporate purposes. It was then decided to liquidate the existing specialty stores and to have petitioner acquire the stock of two existing retail drugstore chains - Stineway Drug Company and Ford Hopkins Company. The Stineway stock was acquired for $1,220,320, petitioner borrowing $870,000 from Stineway for the purpose. Later petitioner borrowed an additional $440,000 from Stineway to help make the down payment on the Ford Hopkins stock, making a total indebtedness to Stineway of $1,310,000, represented by two non-interest-bearing notes. The Ford Hopkins stock was acquired for $2,800,000, the down payment being $735,000, the balance being payable in a yearly amount of $200,000 with 4 per cent interest and secured by the Stineway and Ford Hopkins stock.\n\nWhile the two drug chains were being acquired, petitioner started the liquidation of its own stores, a process that was completed under c. XI of the Bankruptcy Act. The disposition of those stores involved the rejection of numerous leases and the creation of claims of landlords against petitioner. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 462, 465]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe arrangement proposed by petitioner under c. XI would extend its unsecured obligations and provide for a 20 per cent payment on confirmation of the plan and 20 per cent annually for 4 years thereafter. The claims listed were the $1,310,000 debt to Stineway and $525,000 unsecured claims, exclusive of claims by landlords. We were advised on oral argument that during the course of the c. XI proceedings it was decided that this offer was not feasible and that the unsecured creditors are now offered the equivalent of 40 per cent of their claims in full satisfaction.\n\nMuch of the argument has been devoted to the meaning of Securities and Exchange Commission v. United States Realty Co., \n310 \nU.S. 434\n. In that case we held that relief was not properly sought under c. XI but that c. X offered the appropriate relief. That was a case of a debtor with publicly owned debentures, publicly owned mortgage certificates, and publicly owned stock. An arrangement was proposed that would leave the debentures and stock unaffected and extend the certificates and reduce the interest. It was argued in that case, as it has been in the instant one, that c. X affords the relief for corporations whose securities are publicly owned, while c. XI is available to debtors whose stock is closely held; that c. X is designed for the large corporations, c. XI for the smaller ones; that it is the character of the debtor that determines whether c. X or c. XI affords the appropriate remedy. We did not adopt that distinction in the United States Realty case. Rather we emphasized the need to determine on the facts of the case whether the formulation of a plan under the control of the debtor, as provided by c. XI, or the formulation of a plan under the auspices of disinterested trustees, as assured by c. X and the other protective provisions of that chapter, would better serve \"the public and private interests concerned including those of the debtor.\" \n310 \nU.S., at 455\n. The United \n\n[350 \nU.S. 462, 466]\n\u00a0\n States Realty case presented a rather simple problem. There one class of creditors was being asked to make sacrifices, while the position of the stockholders remained unimpaired (id., 453-454, 456), contrary to the teachings of Case v. Los Angeles Lumber Products Co., \n308 \nU.S. 106\n. Moreover, the history of the company raised a serious question \"whether any fair and equitable arrangement in the best interest of creditors\" could be effected \"without some re-arrangement of its capital structure.\" Id., 456. For those reasons c. X was held to offer the appropriate relief.\n\nThe character of the debtor is not the controlling consideration in a choice between c. X and c. XI. Nor is the nature of the capital structure. It may well be that in most cases where the debtor's securities are publicly held c. X will afford the more appropriate remedy. But that is not necessarily so. A large company with publicly held securities may have as much need for a simple composition of unsecured debts as a smaller company. And there is no reason we can see why c. XI may not serve that end. The essential difference is not between the small company and the large company but between the needs to be served.\n\nReadjustment of all or a part of the debts of an insolvent company without sacrifice by the stockholders may violate the fundamental principle of a fair and equitable plan (see Case v. Los Angeles Lumber Products Co., supra), as the United States Realty Co. case emphasizes.\n\nReadjustment of the debts structure of a company, without more, may be inadequate unless there is also an accounting by the management for misdeeds which caused the debacle.\n\nReadjustment of the debts may be a minor problem compared with the need for new management. Without a new management today's readjustment may be a temporary moratorium before a major collapse. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 462, 467]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThese are typical instances where c. X affords a more adequate remedy than c. XI. The appointment of a disinterested trustee ( 156), his broad powers of investigation ( 167), the role of the trustee in preparing a plan ( 169), the duty of the Securities and Exchange Commission to render an advisory report on the plan ( 172), the requirement that the plan be \"fair and equitable, and feasible\" ( 174, 221), the power to include the subsidiaries, Stineway and Ford Hopkins, in the reorganization of petitioner ( 129) - these are controls which c. X gives to the entire community of interests in the company being reorganized and which are lacking under c. XI. These controls are essential both where a complicated debt structure must be readjusted and where a sound discretion indicates either that there must be an accounting from the management or that a new management is necessary. Those conditions only illustrate the need for c. X. There may be others equally compelling.\n\nThe history of this debtor indicates not fraud but either an improvident over extension or a business that has been out of step with modern trends. One corporate reorganization has already been suffered. Heavy short-term loans hang ominously over the company; and it has been converted from an operating company to a holding company with the shares of the subsidiaries pledged to creditors. It is argued that only a short moratorium is needed. There are, however, fears that a short moratorium may be merely a prelude to new disasters, that what the company needs is a fundamental reorganization of its capital structure, so that its limited cash resources will not be dissipated in an effort to meet the demands for debt reduction. A question as to what is \"fair and equitable\" between creditors and stockholders may eventually be reached in the reorganization. But the paramount issue at present concerns what is \"feasible.\" A \"feasible\" plan within the meaning of c. X, 174, 221, might mean, first, \n\n[350 \nU.S. 462, 468]\n\u00a0\n a merger of the subsidiaries with the holding company, and, second, a funding of the unsecured debt and a realignment of debt and stock so as to give a balanced capital structure. The old business has been liquidated and the new one launched with heavy borrowings on a short-term basis. If the new one is to succeed, it may well need a more thoroughgoing capital readjustment than is possible under c. XI. That was the view of two lower courts. We could reverse them only if their exercise of discretion transcended the allowable bounds. We cannot say that it does. Rather we think that the lower courts took a fair reading of c. X and the functions it serves and reasonably concluded that this business needed a more pervasive reorganization than is available under c. XI.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE HARLAN took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, whom MR. JUSTICE BURTON joins, dissenting.\n\nThis is a proceeding for confirmation of an arrangement under Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. 701 et seq. The controlling facts are these. Petitioner is a corporation with a simple capital structure, with its common stock, which is traded on the American Stock Exchange, held in the hands of 7,000 stockholders. The proposed arrangement exclusively affects the unsecured creditors, including wage earners whom the Bankruptcy Act accords priority of payment. All these creditors strongly support confirmation of the arrangement. The Securities and Exchange Commission, in its capacity of protector of public investors, opposed the resort to Chapter XI and insisted on the reorganization procedure defined by Chapter X. The stockholders themselves have not opposed the arrangement, barring only a single stockholder \n\n[350 \nU.S. 462, 469]\n\u00a0\n representing two-tenths of one percent of the common stock of the debtor. There is no suggestion of fraud or other improper behavior on the part of the management of the debtor, which has suffered business misadventure apparently attributable to changes in consumer response to the type of business conducted by the original Schulte tobacco stores. The District Court dismissed the petition under Chapter XI, with leave to the debtor to meet the requirements of reorganization under Chapter X.\n*\n 129 F. Supp. 801. A divided Court of Appeals sustained the District Court, 222 F.2d 234, and its judgment is here affirmed.\n\nThe essence of this Court's decision is that the District Court acted as it did in the exercise of allowable discretion. But if the exercise of discretion by the District Court was guided by inappropriate standards, its exercise of discretion is left without a supporting basis and cannot stand. Such, I believe, is the situation here.\n\nThe District Court was set on its course by what it deemed the guiding ruling of this Court in Securities and Exchange Commission v. United States Realty & Improvement Co., \n310 \nU.S. 434\n. But the usually careful district judge misconceived the demands of that case upon him by relying on some general observation without the qualifying illumination of the literary and factual context of what he quoted from the opinion in that case. The District Court found guidance in the statement that \"the two chapters [X and XI] were specifically devised to afford different procedures, the one adapted to the reorganization \n\n[350 \nU.S. 462, 470]\n\u00a0\n of corporations with complicated debt structures and many stockholders, the other to composition of debts of small individual business and corporations with few stockholders . . . .\" \n310 \nU.S. 434, 447\n.\n\nIn the first place, his quotation breaks into a sentence, which plainly enough indicated that what the district judge quoted was not the ratio decidendi of the Realty case but a loose generality. The district judge left unquoted the qualifying introduction, \"While we do not doubt that in general,\" with the further cautionary phrase, \"as will presently appear more in detail . . . .\" The later details derive significance from the wholly different set of facts in the Realty case. In that case the arrangement for which shelter was sought under Chapter XI involved changes affecting security holders, and those changes, the Court found, easily might adversely affect the creditors. This precluded a finding that the arrangement was \"for the best interests of the creditors,\" which is an essential requisite for confirmation. The Court was very careful to say that the application it gave to Chapter XI in the Realty case \"does not mean that there is no scope for application of that chapter in many cases where the debtor's financial business and corporate structure differ from respondent's.\" \n310 \nU.S., at 454\n.\n\nAgain, while what was quoted from the Realty case by the district judge seemed to indicate a sharp line between corporations \"with many stockholders\" and corporations \"with few stockholders,\" assigning Chapter X to the former and restricting Chapter XI to the latter, the opinion in the Realty case went on to say (what was not quoted below), \"we find in neither chapter any definition or classification which would enable us to say that a corporation is small or large, its security holders few or many, or that its securities are `held by the public,' so as to place the corporation exclusively within the jurisdiction of the \n\n[350 \nU.S. 462, 471]\n\u00a0\n court under one chapter rather than the other.\" \n310 \nU.S., at 447\n.\n\nThe upshot of the matter is that a critical reading of the extended opinion in the Realty case requires the conclusion that all its general observations must be limited to the particular situation which elicited them. And yet, the controlling consideration in the District Court's dismissal of the Chapter XI proceeding is fairly attributable to the fact that the plan of arrangement concerned \"a corporation with 7,000 holders of two and a quarter million shares of stock listed on the American Stock Exchange and recently selling at under two dollars a share.\" 129 F. Supp. 801, 805. Such a basis for judgment disregards the informal, efficient, and economical procedure for financial readjustments of a corporation with its creditors where no change in the capital structure is involved, where no charge of impropriety in corporate management is intimated, where all the creditors urge that the proposed arrangement is for their \"best interests\" ( 366 of the Chandler Act, 52 Stat. 840, 911), and where a refusal to entertain the arrangement would work real hardship to 174 wage claimants.\n\nNot only was the District Court's exercise of discretion against entertainment of the Chapter XI proceeding based on a misconception of the holding in the Realty case. It was also in disregard of the amendment to Chapter XI by 35 of the Act of July 7, 1952, 66 Stat. 420, 433. By that amendment Congress eliminated the requirement that a plan of arrangement had to be \"fair and equitable.\" That requirement was in Chapter XI, as it stood at the time of the Realty decision, and by it Congress had written into Chapter XI the absolute rule for equity reorganizations laid down by this Court in Northern Pacific R. Co. v. Boyd, \n228 \nU.S. 482\n, and Case v. Los Angeles Lumber Products Co., \n308 \nU.S. 106\n. (H. R. Rep. No. 2320, 82d \n\n[350 \nU.S. 462, 472]\n\u00a0\n Cong., 2d Sess. 21.) Even if the \"fair and equitable\" rule were still in Chapter XI, there is nothing in the facts of this case to show that the arrangement would not satisfy that requirement, for we have noted that the plan of arrangement here, unlike the situation in Realty, leaves untouched the position of the security holders. Since the Realty decision to no small degree turned on the enforcement of the \"fair and equitable\" rule, it is noteworthy that no consideration was given by the lower courts, and none is given by this Court, to the significance of this amendment by Congress. One would suppose that the elimination, in 1952, of this drastic requirement is the clearest possible indication that Chapter XI should be given a more generous scope than even the narrowest reading of Realty might suggest. Chapter XI should not be shriveled in its availability.\n\nI would reverse the Court of Appeals.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] At the time of the Realty decision, if a proceeding was found to have been improperly brought under Chapter XI, it had to be dismissed and a proceeding started anew under Chapter X. Section 30 of the Act of July 7, 1952, amended the law so as to allow a transfer of a Chapter XI proceeding, if improperly filed thereunder, to Chapter X. 66 Stat. 420, 432, and see H. R. Rep.

Cf. District of Columbia v. Woodbury, \n136 \nU.S. 450, 466\n. There was no error in refusing the requested instructions. We consider this to be a case where, in the exercise of our supervisory powers over the lower federal courts, the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be reversed in the interests of justice, and that of the District Court reinstated. Accordingly, we find it unnecessary to consider the question presented as to Rule 51.\n\n     Reversed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER, concurring.\n\nThe controlling claim on which petitioner sought certiorari was that the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit disclosed conflict and confusion among the circuits in the application of Rule 51 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

Therefore, for the reasons set forth by Mr. Chief Justice Taft on behalf of the Court in Layne & Bowler Corp. v.

Doubtless hundreds upon hundreds of such suits are constantly brought in the state courts of Texas. This suit is brought in a federal couut because the plaintiff is a citizen of Texas and the defendant corporation is, in the eyes of the law, a citizen of Delaware. The federal court in a case like this is deemed to be a state court of Texas,* and the law by which the plaintiff's rights are to be determined is exclusively Texas law. Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, \n304 \nU.S. 64\n. No federal law, statute or decisional, is remotely involved. These diversity litigations place, it is becoming increasingly recognized, an undue burden upon the federal courts in their ability to dispose expeditiously of other litigation which can be properly brought only in \n\n[352 \nU.S. 874\n, 875]\n\u00a0\n the federal courts. Very often litigants in the position of the plaintiff bring a suit involving merely local law in a federal court because for one reason or another they expect a more favorable outcome than if the suit were tried in the local courts. See Lumbermen's Mutual Casualty Co. v. Elbert, \n348 \nU.S. 48, 53\n, 154 (concurring opinion).\n  Mr. Justice REED and Mr. Justice BURTON would deny certiorari.\n  This case was tried before a jury, which found for the plaintiff. Defendant appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. While the particular judges who heard the case are not from Texas, they are, however, constantly charged in such cases as this with the task of being conversant with, and applying, Texas law. The Court of Appeals held that, as a matter of Texas law, the District Court committed error in not directing a verdict for the defendant. It reversed the judgment of the District Court and rendered judgment for the defendant. Plaintiff then sought a writ of certiorari to review the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n  This Court cannot determine whether the Court of Appeals was right or wrong in its judgment without determining whether on this record the case should or should not have been left to the jury. That can only be decided on the basis of an investigation of Texas law. This Court is not a court to determine the local law of the forty-eight States. Error on the part of a Court of Appeals in applying the local law of any one of the forty-eight States involves injustice to a particular litigant, whether it is a personal injury case or any other case. If the claim of injustice in a particular case arising solely out of diversity jurisdiction justifies review by this Court, it justifies it in every case in which on a surface view of the record this Court feels a Court of Appeals may have been wrong in its ascertainment of local law.\n  In taking one of these cases, encouragement doubtless is given to seek this Court's review in other like cases. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 874\n, 876]\n\u00a0\n But Congress sought to relieve this Court of the burden of such cases when it established the Courts of Appeals in 1891. This Court has respected the purpose of that enactment by stating again and again that it does not sit to correct errors, even a plain error, in a particular case, especially one involving a local controversy of this sort. The Supreme Court of the United States is designed for important questions of general significance in the construction of federal law and in the adjustment of the serious controversies that arise inevitably and in increasing measure in a federal system like ours. These questions are more than sufficient in volume and difficulty to engage all the energy and thought possessed by the Court; it should not be diverted by the correction of errors in local controversies turning on particular circumstances.\n  The Court's consideration of a case like this and the encouragement given for similar demands upon the Court are, in my deep conviction, so inimical to the effective discharge of the true functions of this Court that I cannot abstain from expressing my dissent from the Court's entertainment of the petition for certiorari. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] '... a federal court adjudicating a state-created right solely because of the diversity of citizenship of the parties is for that purpose, in effect, only another court of the State ....'

UNITED STATES(1956)\nNo. 460\nArgued: January 25, 1956Decided: March 5, 1956\n\n\n\n\n Acting under 18 U.S.C. 4244-4248, a Federal District Court held a hearing on the sanity of petitioner, who had been indicted for robbery of a post office and felonious assault on a postal employee and had been found by authorities of a medical center for federal prisoners to be insane and unlikely to recover in the near future. After considering conflicting testimony and reports of psychiatrists, the Court found that petitioner was insane and so mentally incompetent that he could not stand trial; that, if released, he probably would endanger the safety of the officers, property, or other interests of the United States; and that no suitable arrangements for his custody and care, other than commitment to the custody of the Attorney General, were available. The Court, therefore, committed petitioner to the custody of the Attorney General until his sanity should be restored, or his mental condition so improved that, if released, he would not endanger the safety of the officers, property, or other interests of the United States, or until suitable arrangements could be made for his custody and care by the State of his residence. Held: The District Court's action is sustained. Pp. 367-376.\n\n (a) The statute deals not only with problems of temporary mental disorder but also with mental disability which seems more than temporary. Pp. 373-374.\n\n\n (b) As here construed, the statute is within the power of Congress under the Necessary and Proper Clause, Art. I, 8, cl. 18. Pp. 375-376.\n\n\n 219 F.2d 376, affirmed.\n\nWilliam J. Burrell, acting under appointment by the Court, \n350 \nU.S. 945\n, argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioner.\n\nSolicitor General Sobeloff argued the cause for the United States. With him on the brief were Assistant Attorney General Olney, Charles F. Barber, Beatrice Rosenberg and Julia P. Cooper. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 366, 367]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis case involves the construction and constitutional validity of the Act of September 7, 1949, 63 Stat. 686, now codified in 18 U.S.C. 4244-4248, \"To provide for the care and custody of insane persons charged with or convicted of offenses against the United States, and for other purposes.\"\n\nSection 4244 provides a procedure for determining mental incompetency during the period \"after arrest and prior to the imposition of sentence or prior to the expiration of any period of probation.\"\n1\n Section 4245 sets up a similar procedure for persons in prison believed to have been mentally incompetent at the time of their trial when the issue was not raised or determined before or during trial. Section 4246 states that whenever the trial court shall determine, under 4244 and 4245, that an accused \n\n[350 \nU.S. 366, 368]\n\u00a0\n is or was mentally incompetent, the court may commit the accused to the custody of the Attorney General until the accused is mentally competent to stand trial or until the pending charges against him are disposed of according to law. Section 4246 further provides that if the court, after hearing as provided in the preceding 4244 and 4245, finds that the conditions specified in 4247 exist, the commitment shall be governed by 4248.\n2\n Section 4247 states that when a prisoner's sentence is about to expire and the prison board of examiners finds him insane and a probable danger to the officers, property, or other interests of the United States, then the court shall hold a hearing and, if it determines that those conditions exist, it may commit the prisoner to the custody of the Attorney General.\n3\n Under 4248 the \n\n[350 \nU.S. 366, 369]\n\u00a0\n commitment shall run until sanity is restored, or until the prisoner's condition is so improved that he will not endanger the officers, property, or other interests of the United States, or until suitable arrangements are made for the care of the prisoner by his State of residence - reserving to the prisoner his right to establish his eligibility to release by writ of habeas corpus.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nPetitioner, a resident of Cleveland, Ohio, was indicted on November 20, 1952, by a grand jury of the Western District of Missouri on two counts, for robbery from a United States Post Office in Kansas City, Missouri, and for felonious assault there on a postal employee. Under Rule 20 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure petitioner signed a waiver of trial in the Western District of Missouri and was transferred to the Eastern Division of the Northern District of Ohio. Acting on the suggestion of appointed counsel, the district judge ordered petitioner examined by a psychiatrist. After a hearing in which the examining psychiatrist testified that it was doubtful that petitioner, because of his mental condition, could have fully understood the significance of the waiver he signed, the District Court, on February 2, 1953, remanded \n\n[350 \nU.S. 366, 370]\n\u00a0\n the case to the District Court for the Western District of Missouri for disposition.\n\nThat court ordered the accused delivered to the United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners at Springfield, Missouri, for the purpose of ascertaining his mental condition. On April 15, 1953, the Chief of the Psychiatric Service at the Medical Center filed his report concluding that the accused was legally insane, in that he was unable to choose between right and wrong and could not, by reason of his mental condition adequately cooperate with counsel in his own defense.\n\nPetitioner was then transferred to jail; but, on November 16, 1953, the District Court entered an order returning him to the Medical Center for determination whether he was acutely or chronically insane. The report of the Neuropsychiatric Staff of the Medical Center, filed February 1, 1954, indicated that petitioner was \"psychotic and incompetent,\" that \"it is unlikely that this subject will regain his sanity in the near future,\" and recommended that \"consideration be given to transferring this subject to a state hospital in his state of residence.\" The District Court, on the following day, ordered a further hearing under 4246 to \"resolve the power to commit defendant as mentally defective under the conditions specified in Section 4247. . . .\" and for that purpose requested the Director and Board of Examiners of the Medical Center to certify whether in their judgment the defendant, if released, would \"probably endanger the safety of the officers, the property, or other interests of the United States, and that suitable arrangements for the custody and care of the (defendant) are not otherwise available.\" The report of the Board, dated February 4, 1954, concluded that the accused remained \"psychotic and incompetent,\" and stated that \"at the present time there appears to be little likelihood of his recovering to the extent that he might be considered competent in the \n\n[350 \nU.S. 366, 371]\n\u00a0\n near future.\" In reply to the request of the District Court, \"[t]he Board agreed that this subject might be considered potentially dangerous to the extent that if released he might conceivably persist in criminal activities of the type with which he is presently charged. In considering this man's mental illness the Board finds that he does not hold any fixed delusions concerning wanting to harm any person or group of persons, either officials of the government or otherwise, so that in this respect he probably would not constitute a danger to the safety of officers, property, or other interests of the United States. . . . The Board further recommends that this subject be considered a suitable candidate for state hospital care if suitable arrangements can be made.\" In May 1954 petitioner was transferred to the custody of the State of Ohio where he was again examined by the psychiatrist who had made the examination when petitioner was transferred to the District Court for the Northern District of Ohio in 1952. This time the psychiatrist found that petitioner \"is now in a state of remission equivalent to a recovery. He is not now insane in the legal sense.\" Petitioner was then released by the Ohio authorities.\n\nPetitioner was rearrested in Ohio under the original indictment, which was still pending, and on June 16, 1954, removed to the Western District of Missouri. On June 18, counsel appointed for petitioner moved the court to appoint at least one qualified psychiatrist to inquire into petitioner's mental competency and to hold a hearing for that purpose. Two psychiatrists were appointed and were directed to report to the court. Petitioner was also recommitted to the United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners at Springfield, Missouri, for further examination.\n\nThe hearing on petitioner's sanity was held on July 15. The two psychiatrists appointed by the court testified \n\n[350 \nU.S. 366, 372]\n\u00a0\n that in their belief petitioner was sane. The first three reports of the Medical Center were received in evidence, along with a fourth, a report of the Neuropsychiatric Staff of the Medical Center at Springfield, dated July 8, 1954. This latest report concluded \"that the subject remains legally insane by reason of a major mental disorder which would prevent him from having a proper understanding of the proceeding pending against him and which also impairs his ability to properly assist in his own defense.\" The staff further concluded \"that this subject's prognosis for recovery appears to be poor and that he will probably require indefinite hospitalization to insure his own safety and that of society. The staff does not consider the subject to be potentially dangerous except to the extent that if released, he might persist in engaging in criminal activities similar to those with which he is presently charged.\" The Chief of the Psychiatric Service at the Medical Center testified at this hearing to the same effect.\n\nThe District Court, in its order of July 30, found that the accused was insane and so mentally incompetent that he could not stand trial, that, if released, he would probably endanger the safety of the officers, property, or other interests of the United States, and that no suitable arrangements for custody and care, other than commitment to the custody of the Attorney General, were available. Petitioner was therefore committed to the custody of the Attorney General until his sanity should be restored, or his mental condition so improved that, if released, he would not endanger the safety of the officers, property, or other interests of the United States, or until suitable arrangements could be made for the custody and care of defendant by Ohio, the State of his residence. 125 F. Supp. 777, 778. Petitioner appealed from this judgment and the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, its seven circuit judges sitting en banc, affirmed, one judge dissenting. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 366, 373]\n\u00a0\n 219 F.2d 376. Because of the important issue of federal power raised by the case and because of conflicting views in the Courts of Appeals, compare Higgins v. United States, 205 F.2d 650, and Wells v. Attorney General, 201 F.2d 556, with the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in this case, we granted certiorari. \n350 \nU.S. 821\n.\n\nA detailed history of the legislation is set forth in the opinion of the Court of Appeals. 219 F.2d, at 380-384. It is sufficient to note here that the bill was proposed by the Judicial Conference of the United States after long study by a conspicuously able committee, followed by consultation with federal district and circuit judges.\n\nThe statute deals comprehensively with those persons charged with federal crime who are insane or mentally incompetent to stand trial. It provides a procedure for determination of such insanity or mental incompetence, and further provides for commitment of those found to be insane or mentally incompetent. Petitioner's assertion that the statute deals only with the problem of temporary mental disorder is not supported by the language of the statute, and the report of the Committee of the Judicial Conference clearly indicates that the statute was designed to deal with mental disability which seems more than temporary:\n\n \"If the accused's mental disability appears not to be a transitory condition, but in all likelihood he will, because of his insanity, never be brought to trial, it would seem that as a general rule the federal government should not assume responsibility for his hospitalization merely because he has been accused (but not convicted) of a federal crime. Normally such a person should be turned over to the state of his domicile to be confined in a state mental hospital if hospitalization is called for. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 366, 374]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n \"But there may be cases where the accused's domicile cannot be satisfactorily established and where no state will assume responsibility for his care. The federal government may then be faced with the practical situation that it has lawful custody of a person whom it is not safe to let at large. In a recent case in the District of Massachusetts, United States v. Torrez [unreported], a Filipino was brought into the district and indicted for murder on the high seas. After notice of hearing at which alienists for the government and for the defendant testified, the judge found that the defendant was at present insane and unable rationally to aid in the conduct of his defense. Obviously in such case there should be authority in the court to cause the confinement of the accused in a mental hospital.\"\n\n\n The District Court pursued the appropriate procedure in holding a hearing to determine the existence of the conditions specified in 4247, once it determined that the accused's mental incompetence seemed more than temporary. Although the language of the statute and the report of the Committee of the Judicial Conference demonstrate that the statute deals generally with the situations both of temporary and more than temporary insanity, one could infer from the reports on the bill by the Committee, by the Judicial Conference itself, and by the committees of both Houses of Congress that the specific commitment under 4248 was designed only for prisoners whose sentences are about to expire. But this is a case for applying the canon of construction of the wag who said, when the legislative history is doubtful, go to the statute. The second sentence of 4246 clearly makes commitment under 4248 applicable to persons found mentally incompetent under 4244 who meet the conditions specified in 4247. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 366, 375]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe reach then the narrow constitutional issue raised by the order of commitment in the circumstances of this case. The petitioner came legally into the custody of the United States. The power that put him into such custody - the power to prosecute for federal offenses - is not exhausted. Its assertion in the form of the pending indictment persists. The District Court has found that the accused is mentally incompetent to stand trial at the present time and that, if released, he would probably endanger the officers, property, or other interests of the United States - and these findings are adequately supported. In these circumstances the District Court has entered an order retaining and restraining petitioner, while in his present condition, with habeas corpus always available when circumstances warrant. This commitment, and therefore the legislation authorizing commitment in the context of this case, involve an assertion of authority, duly guarded, auxiliary to incontestable national power. As such it is plainly within congressional power under the Necessary and Proper Clause. Art. I, 8, cl. 18.\n\nThe fact that at present there may be little likelihood of recovery does not defeat federal power to make this initial commitment of the petitioner. We cannot say that federal authority to prosecute has now been irretrievably frustrated. The record shows that two court-appointed psychiatrists found petitioner sane and competent for trial. While the District Court did not accept their conclusion, their testimony illustrates the uncertainty of diagnosis in this field and the tentativeness of professional judgment. The only certain thing that can be said about the present state of knowledge and therapy regarding mental disease is that science has not reached finality of judgment, even about a situation as unpromising as petitioner's at least as indicated by the report of the United States Medical Center at Springfield. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 366, 376]\n\u00a0\n Certainly, denial of constitutional power of commitment to Congress in dealing with a situation like this ought not to rest on dogmatic adherence to one view or another on controversial psychiatric issues.\n\nWe decide no more than the situation before us presents and equally do not imply an opinion on situations not now before us. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE HARLAN took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] SEC. 4244: \"Whenever after arrest and prior to the imposition of sentence or prior to the expiration of any period of probation the United States Attorney has reasonable cause to believe that a person charged with an offense against the United States may be presently insane or otherwise so mentally incompetent as to be unable to understand the proceedings against him or properly to assist in his own defense, he shall file a motion for a judicial determination of such mental competency of the accused, setting forth the ground for such belief with the trial court in which proceedings are pending.

ILLINOIS(1956)\nNo. 95\nArgued: December 7, 1955Decided: April 23, 1956\n\n\n\n\n Illinois law gives every person convicted in a criminal trial a right of review by writ of error; but a full direct appellate review can be had only by furnishing the appellate court with a bill of exceptions or report of the trial proceedings, certified by the trial judge, and it is sometimes impossible to prepare such documents without a stenographic transcript of the trial proceedings, which are furnished free only to indigent defendants sentenced to death. Convicted in an Illinois state court of armed robbery, petitioners moved in the trial court that a certified copy of the entire record, including a stenographic transcript of the proceedings, be furnished to them without cost. They alleged that they were without funds to pay for such documents and that failure of the court to provide them would violate the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. Their motion was denied. They then filed a petition under the Illinois Post-Conviction Hearing Act, under which only questions arising under the State or Federal Constitution may be raised. They alleged that there were manifest nonconstitutional errors in the trial which entitled them to have their convictions set aside on appeal, that the only impediment to full appellate review was their lack of funds to buy a transcript, and that refusal to afford full appellate review solely because of their poverty was a denial of due process and equal protection. This petition was dismissed, and the Illinois Supreme Court affirmed, solely on the ground that the petition raised no substantial state or federal constitutional question. Held: Petitioners' constitutional rights were violated, the judgment of the Illinois Supreme Court is vacated, and the cause is remanded to that Court for further action affording petitioners adequate and effective appellate review. Pp. 13-26.\n\n Judgment vacated and cause remanded.\n\nCharles A. Horsky, acting under appointment by the Court, \n349 \nU.S. 949\n, argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioners. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 12, 13]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWilliam C. Wines, Assistant Attorney General of Illinois, argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief was Latham Castle, Attorney General.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK announced the judgment of the Court and an opinion in which THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, and MR. JUSTICE CLARK join.\n\nIllinois law provides that \"Writs of error in all criminal cases are writs of right and shall be issued of course.\"\n1\n The question presented here is whether Illinois may, consistent with the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, administer this statute so as to deny adequate appellate review to the poor while granting such review to all others.\n\nThe petitioners Griffin and Crenshaw were tried together and convicted of armed robbery in the Criminal Court of Cook County, Illinois. Immediately after their conviction they filed a motion in the trial court asking that a certified copy of the entire record, including a stenographic transcript of the proceedings, be furnished them without cost. They alleged that they were \"poor persons with no means of paying the necessary fees to acquire the Transcript and Court Records needed to prosecute an appeal . . . .\" These allegations were not denied. Under Illinois law in order to get full direct appellate review of alleged errors by a writ of error it is necessary for the defendant to furnish the appellate court with a bill of exceptions or report of proceedings at the trial certified by the trial judge.\n2\n As Illinois concedes, it is sometimes \n\n[351 \nU.S. 12, 14]\n\u00a0\n impossible to prepare such bills of exceptions\n3\n or reports without a stenographic transcript of the trial proceedings.\n4\n Indigent defendants sentenced to death are provided with a free transcript at the expense of the county where convicted.\n5\n In all other criminal cases defendants needing a transcript, whether indigent or not, must themselves buy it. The petitioners contended in their motion before \n\n[351 \nU.S. 12, 15]\n\u00a0\n the trial court that failure to provide them with the needed transcript would violate the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. The trial court denied the motion without a hearing.\n\nGriffin and Crenshaw then filed a petition under the Illinois Post-Conviction Hearing Act.\n6\n Only questions arising under the Illinois or Federal Constitution may be raised in proceedings under this Act. A companion state act provides that indigent petitioners under the Post-Conviction Act may, under some circumstances, obtain a free transcript.\n7\n The effect is that indigents may obtain a free transcript to obtain appellate review of constitutional questions but not of other alleged trial errors such as admissibility and sufficiency of evidence. In their Post-Conviction proceeding petitioners alleged that there were manifest nonconstitutional errors in the trial which entitled them to have their convictions set aside on appeal and that the only impediment to full appellate review was their lack of funds to buy a transcript. These allegations have not been denied. Petitioners repeated their charge that refusal to afford full appellate review solely because of poverty was a denial of due process and equal protection. This petition like the first was dismissed without hearing any evidence. The Illinois Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal solely on the ground that the charges raised no substantial state or federal constitutional questions - the only kind of questions which may \n\n[351 \nU.S. 12, 16]\n\u00a0\n be raised in Post-Conviction proceedings. We granted certiorari. \n349 \nU.S. 937\n.\n\nCounsel for Illinois concedes that these petitioners needed a transcript in order to get adequate appellate review of their alleged trial errors.\n8\n There is no contention that petitioners were dilatory in their efforts to get appellate review, or that the Illinois Supreme Court denied review on the ground that the allegations of trial error were insufficient. We must therefore assume for purposes of this decision that errors were committed in the trial which would merit reversal, but that the petitioners could not get appellate review of those errors solely because they were too poor to buy a stenographic transcript. Counsel for Illinois denies that this violates either the Due Process or the Equal Protection Clause, but states that if it does, the Illinois Post-Conviction statute entitles petitioners to a free transcript. The sole question for us to decide, therefore, is whether due process or equal protection has been violated.\n9\n\u00a0\n\nProviding equal justice for poor and rich, weak and powerful alike is an age-old problem.\n10\n People have never ceased to hope and strive to move closer to that goal. This hope, at least in part, brought about in 1215 the royal concessions of Magna Charta: \"To no one will we sell, to no one will we refuse, or delay, right or justice. . . . No free man shall be taken or imprisoned, or \n\n[351 \nU.S. 12, 17]\n\u00a0\n disseised, or outlawed, or exiled, or anywise destroyed; nor shall we go upon him nor send upon him, but by the lawful judgment of his peers or by the law of the land.\" These pledges were unquestionably steps toward a fairer and more nearly equal application of criminal justice. In this tradition, our own constitutional guaranties of due process and equal protection both call for procedures in criminal trials which allow no invidious discriminations between persons and different groups of persons. Both equal protection and due process emphasize the central aim of our entire judicial system - all people charged with crime must, so far as the law is concerned, \"stand on an equality before the bar of justice in every American court.\" Chambers v. Florida, \n309 \nU.S. 227, 241\n. See also Yick Wo v. Hopkins, \n118 \nU.S. 356, 369\n.\n11\n\u00a0\n\nSurely no one would contend that either a State or the Federal Government could constitutionally provide that defendants unable to pay court costs in advance should be denied the right to plead not guilty or to defend themselves in court.\n12\n Such a law would make the constitutional promise of a fair trial a worthless thing. Notice, the right to be heard, and the right to counsel would under such circumstances be meaningless promises to the poor. In criminal trials a State can no more discriminate on account of poverty than on account of religion, race, or color. Plainly the ability to pay costs in advance bears no rational relationship to a defendant's \n\n[351 \nU.S. 12, 18]\n\u00a0\n guilt or innocence and could not be used as an excuse to deprive a defendant of a fair trial. Indeed, a provision in the Constitution of Illinois of 1818 provided that every person in Illinois \"ought to obtain right and justice freely, and without being obliged to purchase it, completely and without denial, promptly and without delay, conformably to the laws.\"\n13\n\u00a0\n\nThere is no meaningful distinction between a rule which would deny the poor the right to defend themselves in a trial court and one which effectively denies the poor an adequate appellate review accorded to all who have money enough to pay the costs in advance. It is true that a State is not required by the Federal Constitution to provide appellate courts or a right to appellate review at all. See, e. g., McKane v. Durston, \n153 \nU.S. 684, 687\n-688. But that is not to say that a State that does grant appellate review can do so in a way that discriminates against some convicted defendants on account of their poverty. Appellate review has now become an integral part of the Illinois trial system for finally adjudicating the guilt or innocence of a defendant. Consequently at all stages of the proceedings the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses protect persons like petitioners from invidious discriminations. See Cole v. Arkansas, \n333 \nU.S. 196, 201\n; Dowd v. United States ex rel. Cook, \n340 \nU.S. 206, 208\n; Cochran v. Kansas, \n316 \nU.S. 255, 257\n; Frank v. Mangum, \n237 \nU.S. 309, 327\n.\n\nAll of the States now provide some method of appeal from criminal convictions, recognizing the importance of appellate review to a correct adjudication of guilt or innocence. Statistics show that a substantial proportion of criminal convictions are reversed by state appellate \n\n[351 \nU.S. 12, 19]\n\u00a0\n courts.\n14\n Thus to deny adequate review to the poor means that many of them may lose their life, liberty or property because of unjust convictions which appellate courts would set aside. Many States have recognized this and provided aid for convicted defendants who have a right to appeal and need a transcript but are unable to pay for it.\n15\n A few have not. Such a denial is a misfit in a country dedicated to affording equal justice to all and special privileges to none in the administration of its criminal law.\n16\n There can be no equal justice where the kind of trial a man gets depends on the amount of money he has. Destitute defendants must be afforded as adequate appellate review as defendants who have money enough to buy transcripts.\n\nThe Illinois Supreme Court denied these petitioners relief under the Post-Conviction Act because of its holding that no constitutional rights were violated. In view of our holding to the contrary the State Supreme Court may decide that petitioners are now entitled to a transcript, as the State's brief suggests. See Ill. Rev. Stat., 1955, c. 37, 163f. Cf. Dowd v. United States ex rel. Cook, 340 \n\n[351 \nU.S. 12, 20]\n\u00a0\n U.S., at 209-210. We do not hold, however, that Illinois must purchase a stenographer's transcript in every case where a defendant cannot buy it. The Supreme Court may find other means of affording adequate and effective appellate review to indigent defendants. For example, it may be that bystanders' bills of exceptions or other methods of reporting trial proceedings could be used in some cases.\n17\n The Illinois Supreme Court appears to have broad power to promulgate rules of procedure and appellate practice.\n18\n We are confident that the State will provide corrective rules to meet the problem which this case lays bare.\n\nThe judgment of the Supreme Court of Illinois is vacated and the cause is remanded to that court for further action not inconsistent with the foregoing paragraph. MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER joins in this disposition of the case.\n\n    Vacated and remanded.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Ill. Rev. Stat., 1955, c. 38, 769.1.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Ill. Rev.

A writ of error may also be prosecuted on a \"mandatory record\" kept by the clerk, consisting of the indictment, arraignment, plea, verdict and sentence.

In such instances review is \n\n[351 \nU.S. 12, 13]\n\u00a0\n limited to errors on the face of the mandatory record, and there is no review of trial errors such as an erroneous ruling on the admission of evidence.

JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, concurring in the judgment.\n\nThe admonition of de Tocqueville not to confuse the familiar with the necessary has vivid application to appeals in criminal cases. The right to an appeal from a conviction for crime is today so established that this leads to the easy assumption that it is fundamental to the protection of life and liberty and therefore a necessary ingredient of due process of law. \"Due process\" is, perhaps, the least frozen concept of our law - the least \n\n[351 \nU.S. 12, 21]\n\u00a0\n confined to history and the most absorptive of powerful social standards of a progressive society. But neither the unfolding content of \"due process\" nor the particularized safeguards of the Bill of Rights disregard procedural ways that reflect a national historic policy. It is significant that no appeals from convictions in the federal courts were afforded (with roundabout exceptions negligible for present purposes) for nearly a hundred years; and, despite the civilized standards of criminal justice in modern England, there was no appeal from convictions (again with exceptions not now pertinent) until 1907. Thus, it is now settled that due process of law does not require a State to afford review of criminal judgments.\n\nNor does the equal protection of the laws deny a State the right to make classifications in law when such classifications are rooted in reason. \"The equality at which the `equal protection' clause aims is not a disembodied equality. The Fourteenth Amendment enjoins `the equal protection of the laws,' and laws are not abstract propositions.\" Tigner v. Texas, \n310 \nU.S. 141, 147\n. Since capital offenses are sui generis, a State may take account of the irrevocability of death by allowing appeals in capital cases and not in others. Again, \"the right of appeal may be accorded by the State to the accused upon such terms as in its wisdom may be deemed proper.\" McKane v. Durston, \n153 \nU.S. 684, 687\n-688. The States have exercised this discriminating power. The different States and the same State from time to time have conditioned criminal appeals by fixing the time within which an appeal may be taken, by delimiting the scope of review, by shaping the mechanism by which alleged errors may be brought before the appellate tribunal, and so forth.\n\nBut neither the fact that a State may deny the right of appeal altogether nor the right of a State to make an appropriate classification, based on differences in crimes and their punishment, nor the right of a State to lay down \n\n[351 \nU.S. 12, 22]\n\u00a0\n conditions it deems appropriate for criminal appeals, sanctions differentiations by a State that have no relation to a rational policy of criminal appeal or authorizes the imposition of conditions that offend the deepest presuppositions of our society. Surely it would not need argument to conclude that a State could not, within its wide scope of discretion in these matters, allow an appeal for persons convicted of crimes punishable by imprisonment of a year or more, only on payment of a fee of $500. Illinois, of course, has done nothing so crude as that. But Illinois has said, in effect, that the Supreme Court of Illinois can consider alleged errors occurring in a criminal trial only if the basis for determining whether there were errors is brought before it by a bill of exceptions and not otherwise.\n*\n From this it follows that Illinois has decreed that only defendants who can afford to pay for the stenographic minutes of a trial may have trial errors reviewed on appeal by the Illinois Supreme Court. (See People v. LaFrana, 4 Ill. 2d 261, \n\n[351 \nU.S. 12, 23]\n\u00a0\n 266, 122 N. E. 2d 583, 585-586.) It has thereby shut off means of appellate review for indigent defendants.\n\nThis Court would have to be willfully blind not to know that there have in the past been prejudicial trial errors which called for reversal of convictions of indigent defendants, and that the number of those who have not had the means for paying for the cost of a bill of exceptions is not so negligible as to invoke whatever truth there may be in the maxim de minimis.\n\nLaw addresses itself to actualities. It does not face actuality to suggest that Illinois affords every convicted person, financially competent or not, the opportunity to take an appeal, and that it is not Illinois that is responsible for disparity in material circumstances. Of course a State need not equalize economic conditions. A man of means may be able to afford the retention of an expensive, able counsel not within reach of a poor man's purse. Those are contingencies of life which are hardly within the power, let alone the duty, of a State to correct or cushion. But when a State deems it wise and just that convictions be susceptible to review by an appellate court, it cannot by force of its exactions draw a line which precludes convicted indigent persons, forsooth erroneously convicted, from securing such a review merely by disabling them from bringing to the notice of an appellate tribunal errors of the trial court which would upset the conviction were practical opportunity for review not foreclosed.\n\nTo sanction such a ruthless consequence, inevitably resulting from a money hurdle erected by a State, would justify a latter-day Anatole France to add one more item to his ironic comments on the \"majestic equality\" of the law. \"The law, in its majestic equality, forbids the rich as well as the poor to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal bread.\" (John Cournos, A Modern Plutarch, p. 27.) \n\n[351 \nU.S. 12, 24]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe State is not free to produce such a squalid discrimination. If it has a general policy of allowing criminal appeals, it cannot make lack of means an effective bar to the exercise of this opportunity. The State cannot keep the word of promise to the ear of those illegally convicted and break it to their hope. But in order to avoid or minimize abuse and waste, a State may appropriately hedge about the opportunity to prove a conviction wrong. When a State not only gives leave for appellate correction of trial errors but must pay for the cost of its exercise by the indigent, it may protect itself so that frivolous appeals are not subsidized and public moneys not needlessly spent. The growing experience of reforms in appellate procedure and sensible, economic modes for securing review still to be devised, may be drawn upon to the end that the State will neither bolt the door to equal justice nor support a wasteful abuse of the appellate process.\n\nIt follows that the petitioners must be accorded an appeal from their conviction, either by having the State furnish them a transcript of the proceedings in the trial court, or by any other means, of which we have not been advised, that may be available under Illinois law, so that the errors of which they complain can effectively be brought for review to the Illinois Supreme Court. It is not for us to tell Illinois what means are open to the indigent and must be chosen. Illinois may prescribe any means that are within the wide area of its constitutional discretion.\n\nThe case of these petitioners is that the only adequate means of bringing for review allegedly fatal trial defects resulting in a potentially reversible conviction was a bill of exceptions which their poverty precluded them from securing. The order of the Illinois Supreme Court and the argument of the Attorney General of Illinois in support of that court's judgment apparently assumed that that was the case. Considering the nature of the issue \n\n[351 \nU.S. 12, 25]\n\u00a0\n thus raised by petitioners appearing for themselves, it would savor of disrespect to the Supreme Court of Illinois for us to find an implication in its unqualified rejection of the claims of the petitioners that an effective review other than by bill of exceptions could be had in the present situation. Cf. Diaz v. Gonzalez, \n261 \nU.S. 102, 105\n-106. When the case again reaches the Illinois Supreme Court, that court may, of course, find within the existing resources of Illinois law means of according to petitioners effective satisfaction of their constitutional right not to be denied the equal protection of the laws.\n\nWe must be mindful of the fact that there are undoubtedly convicts under confinement in Illinois prisons, in numbers unknown to us and under unappealed sentences imposed years ago, who will find justification in this opinion, unless properly qualified, for proceedings both in the state and the federal courts upon claims that they are under illegal detention in that they have been denied a right under the Federal Constitution. It would be an easy answer that a claim that was not duly asserted - as was the timely claim by these petitioners - cannot be asserted now. The answer is too easy. Candor compels acknowledgement that the decision rendered today is a new ruling. Candor compels the further acknowledgement that it would not be unreasonable for all indigent defendants, now incarcerated, who at the time were unable to pay for transcripts of proceedings in trial courts, to urge that they were justified in assuming that such a restriction upon criminal appeals in Illinois was presumably a valid exercise of the State's power at the time when they suffered its consequences. Therefore it could well be claimed that thereby any conscious waiver of a constitutional right is negatived.\n\nThe Court ought neither to rely on casuistic arguments in denying constitutional claims, nor deem itself imprisoned within a formal, abstract dilemma. The judicial \n\n[351 \nU.S. 12, 26]\n\u00a0\n choice is not limited to a new ruling necessarily retrospective, or to rejection of what the requirements of equal protection of the laws, as now perceived, require. For sound reasons, law generally speaks prospectively. More than a hundred years ago, for instance, the Supreme Court of Ohio, confronted with a problem not unlike the one before us, found no difficulty in doing so when it concluded that legislative divorces were unconstitutional. Bingham v. Miller, 17 Ohio 445. In arriving at a new principle, the judicial process is not impotent to define its scope and limits. Adjudication is not a mechanical exercise nor does it compel \"either\/or\" determinations.\n\nWe should not indulge in the fiction that the law now announced has always been the law and, therefore, that those who did not avail themselves of it waived their rights. It is much more conducive to law's self-respect to recognize candidly the considerations that give prospective content to a new pronouncement of law. That this is consonant with the spirit of our law and justified by those considerations of reason which should dominate the law, has been luminously expounded by Mr. Justice Cardozo, shortly before he came here and in an opinion which he wrote for the Court. See Address of Chief Judge Cardozo, 55 Report of New York State Bar Assn., 263, 294 et seq., and Great Northern R. Co. v. Sunburst Oil & Refining Co., \n287 \nU.S. 358, 363\n-366. Such a molding of law, by way of adjudication, is peculiarly applicable to the problem at hand. The rule of law announced this day should be delimited as indicated.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] \"The record in the trial court may consist only of the mandatory record, viz., indictment, arraignment, plea, trial and judgment. . . . This appears in the clerk's record in every case . . . . The record may include also a bill of exceptions, which consists of all of the motions and rulings of the trial court, evidence heard, instructions, and other matters which do not come directly within the clerk's mandatory record. This may be only a part of the record on review when a bill of exceptions is prayed and allowed, and certified by the court. . . . Therefore, when the review is had upon the common-law record, the sole matter only that may be considered by the court is error appearing upon the face of the record, and matters may not be added by argument, affidavit, or otherwise, to supply or expand the record. The case must stand or fall upon the errors appearing in the record. Of course, where there is a bill of exceptions, which includes motions, evidence, rulings on evidence, instructions, and the like, and such bill of exceptions is made a part of the record, errors may be reached by the remedy of writ of error. . . .\" People v. Loftus, 400 Ill. 432, 433-434, 81 N. E. 2d 495, 497-498.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BURTON and MR. JUSTICE MINTON, whom MR. JUSTICE REED and MR. JUSTICE HARLAN join, dissenting.\n\nWhile we do not disagree with the desirability of the policy of supplying an indigent defendant with a free transcript of testimony in a case like this, we do not agree \n\n[351 \nU.S. 12, 27]\n\u00a0\n that the Constitution of the United States compels each State to do so with the consequence that, regardless of the State's legislation and practice to the contrary, this Court must hold invalid state appellate proceedings wherever a required transcript has not been provided without cost to an indigent litigant who has requested that it be so provided. It is one thing for Congress and this Court to prescribe such procedure for the federal courts. It is quite another for this Court to hold that the Constitution of the United States has prescribed it for all state courts.\n\nIn the administration of local law the Constitution has been interpreted as permitting the several States generally to follow their own familiar procedure and practice. In so doing this Court has recognized the widely differing but locally approved procedures of the several States. Whether approving of the particular procedures or not, this Court has treated them largely as matters reserved to the States and within the broad range of permissible \"due process\" in a constitutional sense.\n\nIllinois, as the majority admit, could thus deny an appeal altogether in a criminal case without denying due process of law. McKane v. Durston, \n153 \nU.S. 684\n. To allow an appeal at all, but with some difference among convicted persons as to the terms upon which an appeal is exercised, does not deny due process. It may present a question of equal protection. The petitioners urge that point here.\n\nWhether the Illinois statute denies equal protection depends upon whether, first, it is an arbitrary and unreasonable distinction for the legislature to make, between those convicted of a capital offense and those convicted of a lesser offense, as to their right to a free transcript. It seems to us the whole practice of criminal law teaches that there are valid distinctions between the ways in which criminal cases may be looked upon and treated \n\n[351 \nU.S. 12, 28]\n\u00a0\n without violating the Constitution. Very often we have cases where the convicted seek only to avoid the death penalty. As all practicing lawyers know, who have defended persons charged with capital offenses, often the only goal possible is to avoid the death penalty. There is something pretty final about a death sentence.\n\nIf the actual practice of law recognizes this distinction between capital and noncapital cases, we see no reason why the legislature of a State may not extend the full benefit of appeal to those convicted of capital offenses and deny it to those convicted of lesser offenses. It is the universal experience in the administration of criminal justice that those charged with capital offenses are granted special considerations. Examples of such will readily occur. All States allow a larger number of peremptory challenges of jurors in capital cases than in other cases. Most States permit changes of venue in capital cases on different terms than in other criminal cases. Some States require a verdict of 12 jurors for conviction in a capital case but allow less than 12 jurors to convict in noncapital cases. On the other side of the coin, most States provide no statute of limitations in capital cases. We think the distinction here made by the Illinois statute between capital cases and noncapital cases is a reasonable and valid one.\n\nSecondly, certainly Illinois does not deny equal protection to convicted defendants when the terms of appeal are open to all, although some may not be able to avail themselves of the full appeal because of their poverty. Illinois is not bound to make the defendants economically equal before its bar of justice. For a State to do so may be a desirable social policy, but what may be a good legislative policy for a State is not necessarily required by the Constitution of the United States. Persons charged with crimes stand before the law with varying degrees of economic and social advantage. Some can afford better \n\n[351 \nU.S. 12, 29]\n\u00a0\n lawyers and better investigations of their cases. Some can afford bail, some cannot. Why fix bail at any reasonable sum if a poor man can't make it?\n\nThe Constitution requires the equal protection of the law, but it does not require the States to provide equal financial means for all defendants to avail themselves of such laws.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK'S opinion is not limited to the future. It holds that a past as well as a future conviction of crime in a state court is invalid where the State has failed to furnish a free transcript to an indigent defendant who has sought, as petitioner did here, to obtain a review of a ruling that was dependent upon the evidence in his case. This is an interference with state power for what may be a desirable result, but which we believe to be within the field of local option.\n\nWhether Illinois would permit appeals adequate to pass upon alleged errors on bills of exception, prepared by counsel and approved by judges, without requiring that full stenographic notes be transcribed is not before us. We assume that it would.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, dissenting.\n\nMuch as I would prefer to see free transcripts furnished to indigent defendants in all felony cases, I find myself unable to join in the Court's holding that the Fourteenth Amendment requires a State to do so or to furnish indigents with equivalent means of exercising a right to appeal. The importance of the question decided by the Court justifies adding to what MR. JUSTICE BURTON and MR. JUSTICE MINTON have written my further grounds for dissenting and the reasons why I find the majority opinions unsatisfying.\n\n1. Inadequacy of the Record. - I would decline to decide the constitutional question tendered by petitioners because the record does not present it in that \"clean-cut,\" \n\n[351 \nU.S. 12, 30]\n\u00a0\n \"concrete,\" and \"unclouded\" form usually demanded for a decision of constitutional issues. Rescue Army v. Municipal Court of Los Angeles, \n331 \nU.S. 549, 584\n. In my judgment the case should be remanded to the Illinois courts for further proceedings so that we might know the precise nature of petitioners' claim before passing on it.\n\nThe record contains nothing more definite than the allegation that \"petitioners are poor persons with no means of paying the necessary fees to acquire the Transcript and Court Records needed to prosecute an appeal from their convictions.\" For my part I cannot tell whether petitioners' claim is that a transcript was \"needed\" because (a) under Illinois law a transcript is a prerequisite to appellate review of trial errors,\n1\n or (b) as a factual matter petitioners could not prepare an adequate bill of exceptions short of having a transcript.\n\nIf the claim is that a transcript was legally necessary, it is based on an erroneous view of Illinois law. The Illinois cases cited by the petitioners establish only that trial errors cannot be reviewed in the absence of a bill of exceptions, and not that a transcript is essential to the preparation of such a bill.\n2\n To the contrary, an \n\n[351 \nU.S. 12, 31]\n\u00a0\n unbroken line of Illinois cases establishes that a bill of exceptions may consist simply of a narrative account of the trial proceedings prepared from any available sources - for example, from the notes or memory of the trial judge, counsel, the defendant, or bystanders - and that the trial judge must either certify such a bill as accurate or point out the corrections to be made.\n3\n Viewed in the light of these cases, the only constitutional question \n\n[351 \nU.S. 12, 32]\n\u00a0\n presented by petitioners' bare allegation that they were unable to purchase a transcript would be: Is an indigent defendant, who has not shown that he is unable to obtain full appellate review of his conviction by a narrative bill of exceptions, constitutionally entitled to the added advantage of a free transcript of the trial proceedings for use as a bill of exceptions? I need hardly pause to suggest that such a claim would present no substantial constitutional question.\n\nThe Court, however, either takes judicial notice that as a practical matter the alternative methods of preparing a bill of exceptions are inadequate or finds in petitioners' claims an allegation of fact that their circumstances were such as to prevent them from utilizing the alternative methods. But even accepting this reading of the pleadings, the constitutional question tendered should not be decided without knowing the circumstances underlying the conclusory allegation of \"need.\" Petitioners' indigence, the only underlying \"fact\" alleged, did not in itself necessarily preclude them from preparing a narrative bill of exceptions, and we are told nothing as to the other circumstances which prevented them from doing so. The record does not even disclose whether petitioners were incarcerated during the period in which the bill of exceptions had to be filed, or whether they were represented by counsel at the trial. We are left to speculate on the nature of the alleged trial errors and the scope of the bill of exceptions needed to present them. Who can say that if we knew the facts we might not have before us a much narrower constitutional question than the one decided today, or perhaps no such question at all. In these circumstances, I would follow the salutary policy \"of avoiding constitutional decisions until the issues are presented with clarity, precision and certainty,\" Rescue Army v. Municipal Court of Los Angeles, supra, at p. 576, and would refuse to decide the \n\n[351 \nU.S. 12, 33]\n\u00a0\n constitutional question in the abstract form in which it has been presented here.\n\nAccording to petitioners' tabulation, no more than 29 States provide free transcripts as of right to indigents convicted of non-capital crimes. Thus the sweeping constitutional pronouncement made by the Court today will touch the laws of at least 19 States\n4\n and will create a host of problems affecting the status of an unknown multitude of indigent convicts. A decision having such wide impact should not be made upon a record as obscure as this, especially where there are means ready at hand to have clarified the issue sought to be presented.\n\nHowever, since I stand alone in my view that the Court should refrain from deciding the broad question urged upon us until the necessity for such a decision becomes manifest, I deem it appropriate also to note my disagreement with the Court's decision of that question. Inasmuch as the Court's decision is not - and on this record cannot be - based on any facts peculiar to this case, I consider that question to be: Is an indigent defendant \n\n[351 \nU.S. 12, 34]\n\u00a0\n who \"needs\" a transcript in order to appeal constitutionally entitled, regardless of the nature of the circumstances producing that need, to have the State either furnish a free transcript or take some other action to assure that he does in fact obtain full appellate review?\n\n2. Equal Protection. - In finding an answer to that question in the Equal Protection Clause, the Court has painted with a broad brush. It is said that a State cannot discriminate between the \"rich\" and the \"poor\" in its system of criminal appeals. That statement of course commands support, but it hardly sheds light on the true character of the problem confronting us here. Illinois has not imposed any arbitrary conditions upon the exercise of the right of appeal nor any requirements unnecessary to the effective working of its appellate system. Trial errors cannot be reviewed without an appropriate record of the proceedings below; if a transcript is used, it is surely not unreasonable to require the appellant to bear its cost; and Illinois has not foreclosed any other feasible means of preparing such a record. Nor is this a case where the State's own action has prevented a defendant from appealing. Cf. Dowd v. United States ex rel. Cook, \n340 \nU.S. 206\n; Cochran v. Kansas, \n316 \nU.S. 255\n. All that Illinois has done is to fail to alleviate the consequences of differences in economic circumstances that exist wholly apart from any state action.\n\nThe Court thus holds that, at least in this area of criminal appeals, the Equal Protection Clause imposes on the States an affirmative duty to life the handicaps flowing from differences in economic circumstances. That holding produces the anomalous result that a constitutional admonition to the States to treat all persons equally means in this instance that Illinois must give to some what it requires others to pay for. Granting that such a classification would be reasonable, it does not follow that a State's failure to make it can be regarded as discrimination. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 12, 35]\n\u00a0\n It may as accurately be said that the real issue in this case is not whether Illinois has discriminated but whether it has a duty to discriminate.\n\nI do not understand the Court to dispute either the necessity for a bill of exceptions or the reasonableness of the general requirement that the trial transcript, if used in its preparation, be paid for by the appealing party. The Court finds in the operation of these requirements, however, an invidious classification between the \"rich\" and the \"poor.\" But no economic burden attendant upon the exercise of a privilege bears equally upon all, and in other circumstances the resulting differentiation is not treated as an invidious classification by the State, even though discrimination against \"indigents\" by name would be unconstitutional. Thus, while the exclusion of \"indigents\" from a free state university would deny them equal protection, requiring the payment of tuition fees surely would not, despite the resulting exclusion of those who could not afford to pay the fees. And if imposing a condition of payment is not the equivalent of a classification by the State in one case, I fail to see why it should be so regarded in another. Thus if requiring defendants in felony cases to pay for a transcript constitutes a discriminatory denial to indigents of the right of appeal available to others, why is it not a similar denial in misdemeanor cases or, for that matter, civil cases?\n\nIt is no answer to say that equal protection is not an absolute, and that in other than criminal cases the differentiation is \"reasonable.\" The resulting classification would be invidious in all cases, and an invidious classification offends equal protection regardless of the seriousness of the consequences. Hence it must be that the differences are \"reasonable\" in other cases not because the \"classification\" is reasonable but simply because it is not unreasonable in those cases for the State to fail to relieve indigents of the economic burden. That is, the issue here \n\n[351 \nU.S. 12, 36]\n\u00a0\n is not the typical equal protection question of the reasonableness of a \"classification\" on the basis of which the State has imposed legal disabilities, but rather the reasonableness of the State's failure to remove natural disabilities. The Court holds that the failure of the State to do so is constitutionally unreasonable in this case although it might not be in others. I submit that the basis for that holding is simply an unarticulated conclusion that it violates \"fundamental fairness\" for a State which provides for appellate review, and thus apparently considers such review necessary to assure justice, not to see to it that such appeals are in fact available to those it would imprison for serious crimes. That of course is the traditional language of due process, see Betts v. Brady, \n316 \nU.S. 455, 462\n, and I see no reason to import new substance into the concept of equal protection to dispose of the case, especially when to do so gives rise to the all-too-easy opportunity to ignore the real issue and solve the problem simply by labeling the Illinois practice as invidious \"discrimination.\"\n\n3. Due Process. - Has there been a violation of the Due Process Clause? The majority of the Court concedes that the Fourteenth Amendment does not require the States to provide for any kind of appellate review. Nevertheless, Illinois, in the forefront among the States, established writs of error in criminal cases as early as 1827.\n5\n In 1887, it provided for official court reporters, thereby relieving defendants of the burden of hiring reporters in order to obtain a transcript.\n6\n In 1927, it provided that for indigents sentenced to death \"all necessary costs and expenses\" incident to a writ of error, including the cost of a transcript, would be paid by \n\n[351 \nU.S. 12, 37]\n\u00a0\n the counties.\n7\n And in 1953, free transcripts were authorized for the presentation of constitutional claims.\n8\n Thus Illinois has steadily expanded the protection afforded defendants in criminal cases, and in recent years has made substantial strides towards alleviating the natural disadvantages of indigents. Can it be that, while it was not unconstitutional for Illinois to afford no appeals, its steady progress in increasing the safeguards against erroneous convictions has resulted in a constitutional decline?\n\nOf course the fact that appeals are not constitutionally required does not mean that a State is free of constitutional restraints in establishing the terms upon which appeals will be allowed. It does mean, however, that there is no \"right\" to an appeal in the same sense that there is a right to a trial.\n9\n Rather the constitutional right under the Due Process Clause is simply the right not to be denied an appeal for arbitrary or capricious reasons. Nothing of that kind, however, can be found in any of the steps by which Illinois has established its appellate system.\n\nWe are all agreed that no objection of substance can be made to the provisions for free transcripts in capital and constitutional cases. The due process challenge must therefore be directed to the basic step of permitting appeals at all without also providing an in forma pauperis procedure. But whatever else may be said of Illinois' reluctance to expend public funds in perfecting appeals for indigents, it can hardly be said to be arbitrary. A policy of economy may be unenlightened, but it is certainly \n\n[351 \nU.S. 12, 38]\n\u00a0\n not capricious. And that it has never generally been so regarded is evidenced by the fact that our attention has been called to no State in which in forma pauperis appeals were established contemporaneously with the right of appeal. I can find nothing in the past decisions of this Court justifying a holding that the Fourteenth Amendment confines the States to a choice between allowing no appeals at all or undertaking to bear the cost of appeals for indigents, which is what the Court in effect now holds.\n\nIt is argued finally that, even if it cannot be said to be \"arbitrary,\" the failure of Illinois to provide petitioners with the means of exercising the right of appeal that others are able to exercise is simply so \"unfair\" as to be a denial of due process. I have some question whether the non-arbitrary denial of a right that the State may withhold altogether could ever be so characterized. In any event, however, to so hold it is not enough that we consider free transcripts for indigents to be a desirable policy or that we would weigh the competing social values in favor of such a policy were it our function to distribute Illinois' public funds among alternative uses. Rather the question is whether some method of assuring that an indigent is able to exercise his right of appeal is \"implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,\" Palko v. Connecticut, \n302 \nU.S. 319, 325\n, so that the failure of a State so to provide constitutes a \"denial of fundamental fairness, shocking to the universal sense of justice,\" Betts v. Brady, supra, at 462. Such an equivalence between persons in the means with which to exercise a right of appeal has not, however, traditionally been regarded as an essential of \"fundamental fairness,\" and the reforms extending such aid to indigents have only recently gained widespread acceptance. Indeed, it was not until an Act of Congress in 1944 that defendants in federal criminal \n\n[351 \nU.S. 12, 39]\n\u00a0\n cases became entitled to free transcripts,\n10\n and to date approximately one-third of the States still have not taken that step. With due regard for the constitutional limitations upon the power of this Court to intervene in State matters, I am unable to bring myself to say that Illinois' failure to furnish free transcripts to indigents in all criminal cases is \"shocking to the universal sense of justice.\"\n\nAs I view this case, it contains none of the elements hitherto regarded as essential to justify action by this Court under the Fourteenth Amendment. In truth what we have here is but the failure of Illinois to adopt as promptly as other States a desirable reform in its criminal procedure. Whatever might be said were this a question of procedure in the federal courts, regard for our system of federalism requires that matters such as this be left to the States. However strong may be one's inclination to hasten the day when in forma pauperis criminal procedures will be universal among the States, I think it is beyond the province of this Court to tell Illinois that it must provide such procedures.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Illinois Supreme Court may have interpreted the pleadings in this manner. It described the petitioners' \"sole contention\" as being that they were \"unable to purchase a bill of exceptions and were, therefore, unable to obtain a complete review by this Court.\" This suggests that the state court construed the claim to be that an appeal was necessarily precluded by the lack of a transcript, not that the petitioners' particular circumstances produced that result. If that is what the Illinois court meant, its construction, having a reasonable basis, would be binding on this Court and would constitute an adequate state ground for the denial of any claim premised on the existence of particular circumstances preventing the petitioners from pursuing other available methods of review.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] E. g., People v. Johns, 388 Ill. 212, 57 N. E. 2d 895; People v. Loftus, 400 Ill. 432, 81 N. E. 2d 495; People v. O'Connell, 411 Ill. 591, 104 N. E. 2d 825.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Weatherford v. Wilson, 3 Ill.

Donoghue, 377 Ill. 122, 35 N. E. 2d 371 (1941). This line of cases was reaffirmed by the Illinois Supreme Court in 1953, just three months before the petitioners were convicted, in People v. Joyce, 1 Ill. 2d 225, 230, 115 N. E. 2d 262, 264-265, in which the Williams, Gary, Holdom and Lindheimer cases, supra, were cited with approval for the proposition that trial errors may be presented on a writ of error by a \"constructed or `bystander's' bill of exceptions.\" The holding of that case was that a defendant to whom these alternative methods were not available \"as a practical matter\" because of his indigence and incarceration did not, by failing to seek direct review of his conviction, \"waive\" the right given him by the Illinois Post-Conviction Hearing Act to assert his constitutional claims in a collateral proceeding. Accord: People v. La Frana, 4 Ill. 2d 261, 266, 122 N. E. 2d 583, 585-586. That holding does not, of course, detract from the court's affirmation that a transcript is not legally required for appellate review of trial errors. It is equally clear that Illinois' recognition of \"practicalities\" in not applying a strict doctrine of waiver to the remedial Post-Conviction Hearing Act does not necessarily mean that the alternative methods of obtaining review are not sufficiently \"available\" to satisfy any supposed constitutional requirements. That question would depend upon the facts of the particular case - of which we have not been informed here - and upon the evaluation of them for constitutional purposes.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Of these 19 at least 5 have, however, expressly given the trial courts discretionary power to order free transcripts in non-capital cases.

Code, 1951, 2.32.240 (if \"justice will thereby be promoted\"). The Rhode Island Supreme Court has reached a similar result by interpretation of a statute authorizing reimbursement for expenditures of appointed counsel. State v. Hudson, 55 R. I. 141, 179 A. 130 (1935) (\"sound discretion . . . to be exercised with great circumspection and only for serious cause\"). In addition, petitioners' brief refers to a letter from the Chief Justice of the Connecticut Supreme Court of Errors which states that free transcripts may be furnished in the discretion of the court in non-capital cases.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Ill.

Whether a conviction of a conspiracy to procure from the Fraud Bureau of the Internal Revenue Department a decision not to prosecute a tax fraud, where the object of the conspiracy had been accomplished by January, 1949, and prosecution was barred under the statute of limitations by January, 1952, may be sustained, on the theory that the conspiracy must have included a continuing agreement to conceal-the indictment having been found October 25, 1954, and the proof being that one or more of the conspirators in March, 1952, attempted to cover their tracks from investigators.\n\n'2. Whether independent acts of alleged conspirators, after the accomplishment of the object of the conspiracy and done without the knowledge or the participation of the petitioner Grunewald, may suffice to support a charge against him that the original conspiracy included a continuing purpose to conceal so that the conspiracy might be deemed to extend down to the last act of concealment.\n\n'3. Whether an alleged continuing conspiracy to conceal could be found as to the petitioner Grunewald, when he was concerned only with the original object of the conspiracy and was acquitted by the Trial Court on three counts of attempting to influence witnesses, which the Court charged the jury could be acts of continuing concealment.\n\n'4. Whether a purpose to continue to conceal the accomplishment of the primary conspiracy may be inferred from the fact that the conspirators would be pre- \n\n[352 \nU.S. 866\n, 867]\n\u00a0\n sumed to know that their activities would always be open to investigation- whether a subordinate conspiracy to conceal may be implied from the original crime.\n\n'5. Whether the Trial Court committed error in permitting the jury to find a continuing conspiracy to conceal from the fact that, more than three years after and object of the conspiracy had been accomplished, the petitioner Grunewald, when his secretary was subpoenaed before a grand jury, told her she need not answer various questions and could say she forgot.\n\n'6. Whether the Trial Court committed error in permitting the defendant Halperin, the only witness for the defense, to be cross-examined, for the purpose of impeaching his credibility, on the fact that he had been, prior to the trial, subpoenaed before a grand jury and had there claimed his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination on a long line of questions. The constitutional privilege thus infringed is that part of the Fifth Amendment which reads '... nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself ...\"?\n\n No. 184:\n'1. When a defendant testifies in his own defense at his trial, and his answers to questions show that, although averring his innocence, he was justified in invoking the Fifth Amendment with regard to like questions before a Grand Jury-as in this case all agree-is not that defendant denied due process when the Government on cross-examination brings out before the trial jury, the fact that he refused to answer the questions before the Grand Jury, upon such constitutional grounds?\n\n'2. When a defendant has been subpoenaed to testify before a Grand Jury in an investigation, of which he is a primary target, has claimed his Constitutional privilege, advised the Grand Jury that he was doing so as an innocent man ensnared in suspicious circumstances and because he could not cross-examine or be represented \n\n[352 \nU.S. 866\n, 868]\n\u00a0\n by counsel, may the trial court charge the jury that they, may consider his refusal to testify before the Grand Jury on the score of his credibility, although his trial testimony was entirely consistent with his position before the Grand Jury?\n\n'3. Under the circumstances surrounding a defendant's appearance before a Grand Jury as set forth in the last preceding paragraph, does not the Court's instruction as aforesaid illegally impeach and impede the defendant's statutory right to be a witness on his own behalf?\n\n'4. Does the rationale of Raffel v. United States, \n271 \nU.S. 494\n [46 S. Ct. 566], apply to prior invocation of the Fifth Amendment before a Grand Jury as distinguished from such action at a prior trial?\n\n'5. Does not the doctrine and rationale of Slochower v. Board of Higher Education [\n350 \nU.S. 551\n], decided by this Court April 9, 1956, compel the conclusion that a defendant under the circumstances aforesaid, is denied due process of law when he is examined by the Government and compelled to admit that he refused to answer questions before the Grand Jury, and the Trial Court advises the jury they may consider that refusal on the subject of his credibility?\n\n'6. Is not a defendant, particularly one who asserted that he was invoking the Fifth Amendment as an innocent man being plotted against and beset by suspicious circumstances entitled to have the jury charged, 'An innocent man may honestly claim his answers may tend to incriminate him'?\n\n'8. Does not the opinion of the Court of Appeals that the statute of limitations against conspiracy was not tolled, in that certain overt acts of concealment when committed were chargeable to the original conspiracy disregard and deny effect to this Court's views on proof of subsidiary concealment conspiracies, as set forth in Krulewitch v. United States, \n336 \nU.S. 440\n [] and Lutwak v. United States, \n344 \nU.S. 604\n []? \n\n[352 \nU.S. 866\n, 869]\n\u00a0\n  '9.

UNITED STATES(1956)\nNo. 231\nArgued: Decided: May 7, 1956\n\n\n\n\n Petitioners, Navajo Indians living in southeastern Utah, sued under the Federal Tort Claims Act to recover for the confiscation and destruction by federal agents of their horses, which were grazing on public lands of the United States. The Government defended on the ground that the federal agents were acting pursuant to the Utah abandoned horse statute. The trial court awarded petitioners jointly a lump-sum judgment for $100,000 and enjoined the Government and its agents from further interference with petitioners. Held: On the record in this case, petitioners are entitled to a judgment for damages, which must be apportioned among them; but they are not entitled to an injunction. Pp. 174-182.\n\n (a) The trial was not conducted so improperly as to vitiate the trial court's findings of fact. P. 177, note 3.\n\n\n (b) Under the Taylor Grazing Act and the Federal Range Code issued thereunder, government agents may invoke local impoundment laws only after complying with 161.11 (a) and (b) of the Federal Range Code. Since the federal agents did not give petitioners the written notice required by the Federal Range Code, there was not such compliance here, and they acted without statutory authorization. Pp. 177-180.\n\n\n (c) In attempting to enforce a federal statute which they administer, the federal agents were acting within the scope of their employment, and the Government is liable under the Federal Tort Claims Act for their wrongful and tortious acts. Pp. 180-181.\n\n\n (d) The exceptions set forth in 28 U.S.C. 2680 do not bar recovery, because the federal agents were not \"exercising due care\" and were not performing a \"discretionary function or duty\" within the meaning of that Section. P. 181.\n\n\n (e) Under the Federal Tort Claims Act, any findings of damages must be made with sufficient particularity so that they may be reviewed. The findings in this case and the award of damages in a lump sum to petitioners jointly did not meet this requirement, and the case must be remanded to the District Court for appropriate findings in this regard. P. 182. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 173, 174]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n (f) The District Court had no power to enjoin the United States or its individual agents over whom that Court never acquired personal jurisdiction.

Marquis argued the cause for the United States. With him on the brief were Solicitor General Sobeloff, Assistant Attorney General Morton and S. Billingsley Hill.\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nPetitioners, eight families of Navajo Indians, seek damages under the Federal Tort Claims Act for the destruction of their horses by agents of the Federal Government. The District Court allowed damages of $100,000 and enjoined the Government and its agents from further interference with petitioners. The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit reversed, 220 F.2d 666, on the ground that the Utah abandoned horse statute, Utah Code Ann., 1953, 47-2, was properly invoked by the government agents. We do not agree with the Court of Appeals.\n\nPetitioners are wards of the Government. They have lived from time immemorial in stone and timber hogans on public land in San Juan County, Utah. This bleak area in the southeastern corner of the State is directly north of the Navajo Indian Reservation. While some Indian families from the reservation come into the area to graze their livestock, petitioners claim to have always lived there the year round. They are herdsmen and for generations they have grazed their livestock on this land. They are a simple and primitive people. Their living is derived entirely from their animals, from the little corn they are able to grow in family plots, and the wild game and pine nuts that the land itself affords. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 173, 175]\n\u00a0\n The District Court found that horses, as petitioners' beasts of burden and only means of transportation, were essential to their existence.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nIn 1934 the Government enacted the Taylor Grazing Act, 48 Stat. 1269, 43 U.S.C. 315, which provided for the regulation and use of these public lands. Grazing permits were issued to white livestock operators, and for a number of years these permittees grazed their livestock in common with petitioners, who continued in peaceable occupation and use of the land they claimed as their ancestral home. Limited forage made disputes between the stockmen and the Indians inevitable, and about 1950 both the Government and the white livestock operators filed suits to remove the Indians from this land.\n2\n In \n\n[351 \nU.S. 173, 176]\n\u00a0\n addition to legal proceedings, another method was employed by the government agents. Beginning in September 1952 and continuing until sometime after the present suit was filed in the District Court, the Department of Interior's range manager vigorously prosecuted a campaign to round up and destroy petitioners' horses. This action was taken pursuant to the Utah abandoned horse statute, Utah Code Ann., 1953, 47-2, which provides that the Board of County Commissioners may authorize the elimination of \"abandoned\" horses on the open range. An \"abandoned\" horse is defined as one running at large on the open range which is either not branded or, if branded, one on which the tax for the preceding year has not been paid. During the roundup a total of 115 horses and 38 burros belonging to petitioners were taken and sold or destroyed. Some horses were sold locally. Some were shot and their carcasses left on the range. Most of the animals, however, were trucked some 350 miles away to Provo, Utah, where they were sold to a horse-meat plant or a glue factory. The total amount derived from such sales, about $1,700, has been retained by the District Advisory Board composed of local stockmen. No part of it has been paid or offered to petitioners.\n\nThere is considerable evidence in the record to show that the Utah abandoned horse statute was applied discriminatorily against the Indians. In one instance the assistant range manager watched from a bluff while petitioner Hosteen Sakezzie released his horses from their corral. Later, a short distance away, the same government agent supervised a roundup of these horses and drove them 35 miles through the night to another corral from which they were loaded into trucks for the horsemeat plant. Sakezzie and three other Indians trailed the horses to the entrucking point but were not allowed to reclaim them. On another occasion five horses taken during the roundup which belonged to white stockmen \n\n[351 \nU.S. 173, 177]\n\u00a0\n were returned to their owners on the payment of a nominal $2.50 a head, but petitioner Little Wagon was told that to reclaim his horses the charge would be $60 a head, an amount known to be far above his means. For the most part, these and other facts found by the District Court were unchallenged in the Court of Appeals and are unchallenged here.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nThe Court of Appeals did not reach the question of liability under the Federal Tort Claims Act, since it concluded that the government agents' actions were authorized by the Utah abandoned horse statute. We cannot dispose of this case so easily.\n\nThe Taylor Grazing Act seeks to provide the most beneficial use of the public range and to protect grazing rights in the districts it creates. Chournos v. United States, 193 F.2d 321. Section 2 of the Act, 48 Stat. 1270, 43 U.S.C. 315a, provides that the Secretary of the Interior shall \"make such rules and regulations . . . and do any and all things necessary to accomplish the purposes of this Act.\" Pursuant to this authorization the Secretary has issued the Federal Range Code, 43 CFR 161.1 et seq. Unauthorized grazing on the federal range and the removal of trespassing livestock is expressly provided for by 161.11 (b) of this Code:\n\n \"(b) Unlawful grazing on Federal range; removal of livestock; impoundment. Whenever the charge consists of unlawfully grazing livestock on the Federal \n\n[351 \nU.S. 173, 178]\n\u00a0\n range, the notice served on the alleged violator . . . will order the alleged violator to remove the livestock or to cause them to be removed immediately or within such reasonable time as may be specified. If the alleged violator fails to comply with the notice the range manager may proceed to exercise the proprietary right of the United States in the Federal range, under local impoundment law and procedure, if practicable; otherwise he may refer the matter through the usual channels for appropriate legal action by the United States against the violator.\"\n\n\n Whenever the charge consists of unlawfully grazing livestock, this section requires that written notice, as provided by 161.11 (a),\n4\n together with an order to remove the livestock, be served on the alleged violator. Only \"if the alleged violator fails to comply with the notice\" may the range manager proceed under local impoundment law and procedure. It is clear that both the written notice and failure to comply are express conditions precedent to the employment of local procedures. The Code is, of course, the law of the range, and the activities of federal agents are controlled by its provisions.\n5\n They are required to follow the procedures there established. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 173, 179]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Court of Appeals held that there was no inconsistency between the federal regulation and the state statute because the regulation pertained to individual owners while the statute was aimed at \"abandoned\" horses running loose on the range. We cannot agree. As we read it, the Utah statute is directed not to horses abandoned in the sense that they are ownerless, or that their owners cannot be located, but rather to horses considered \"abandoned\" under an express statutory definition. As applied to horses \"at large upon the open range,\" this definition depends only on branding and payment of prior tax assessment without any consideration of whether the horses are owned by someone and, if so, whether such owner is known or can be located. As the Court of Appeals itself recognized: \"The dictionary definition of the term `abandoned' has no application.\" 220 F.2d, at 672. Furthermore, the record is replete with evidence that in this case the government agents actually did know that the horses belonged to petitioners and had not been abandoned. The District Court found that, \"said agents knew beyond any possible doubt to whom said horses belonged\"; that \"the said agents and employees of defendant knew these brands to be the brands used by plaintiffs as well as they knew that the horses belonged to plaintiffs\"; and concluded that the horses \"were used daily in the performance of the work of their owners, the plaintiffs, and this was well known by defendant's said agents and employees.\" In the face of these findings, not disturbed by the Court of Appeals, it cannot be contended that the government agents were unable to comply with the specific provision for notice which regulated their actions. Nor has the Government contended that there \n\n[351 \nU.S. 173, 180]\n\u00a0\n was an attempt at any time to comply with the notice provisions of the Federal Range Code.\n\nFor these reasons we hold that the Utah abandoned horse statute was not properly invoked. The circumstances of this case were specifically provided for by 161.11 (b) of the Federal Range Code, and the government agents failed to comply with the terms of that section because the requisite notice was not given.\n\nBut, having concluded that there was no statutory authority, we are faced with the question whether the Government is liable under the Federal Tort Claims Act for wrongful and tortious acts of its employees committed in an attempt to enforce a federal statute which they administer. We believe there is such liability in the circumstances of this case.\n\nSection 1346 (b) of Title 28, United States Code, authorizes suits against the Government for \"loss of property . . . caused by the negligent or wrongful act . . . of any employee of the Government while acting within the scope of his office or employment, under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act . . . Occurred.\" It is clear that the federal agents here were acting within the scope of their employment under both state and federal law. Under the law of Utah an employer is liable to third persons for the willful torts of his employees if the acts are committed in furtherance of the employer's interests or if the use of force could have been contemplated in the employment. Cf. Barney v. Jewel Tea Co., 104 Utah 292. 139 P.2d 878. Both of these conditions obtained here. The federal agents were attempting to enforce the federal range law, and such enforcement must contemplate at least the force used in removal of stock from the range. The fact that the agents did not have actual authority for the procedure they employed does not affect liability. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 173, 181]\n\u00a0\n There is an area, albeit a narrow one, in which a government agent, like a private agent, can act beyond his actual authority and yet within the scope of his employment. We note also that 1346 (b) provides for liability for \"wrongful\" as well as \"negligent\" acts. In an earlier case the Court has pointed out that the addition of this word was intended to include situations like this involving \"`trespasses' which might not be considered strictly negligent.\" Dalehite v. United States, \n346 \nU.S. 15, 45\n.\n\nNor does 28 U.S.C. 2680 bar liability here. This section provides that:\n\n \"The provisions of this chapter and section 1346 (b) of this title shall not apply to -\n\n\n \"(a) Any claim based upon an act or omission of an employee of the Government, exercising due care, in the execution of a statute or regulation, whether or not such statute or regulation be valid, or based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee of the Government, whether or not the discretion involved be abused.\"\n\n\n The first portion of section (a) cannot apply here, since the government agents were not exercising due care in their enforcement of the federal law. \"Due care\" implies at least some minimal concern for the rights of others. Here, the agents proceeded with complete disregard for the property rights of the petitioners. Nor can the second portion of (a) exempt the Government from liability. We are here not concerned with any problem of a \"discretionary function\" under the Act. see Dalehite v. United States, supra. These acts were wrongful trespasses not involving discretion on the part of the agents, and they do give rise to a claim compensable under the Federal Tort Claims Act. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 173, 182]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe District Court awarded damages in the lump sum of $100,000, the amount sought by petitioners jointly. Apparently this award was based on the value of the horses, consequential damages for deprivation of use and for \"mental pain and suffering.\" Under the Federal Tort Claims Act, damages are determined by the law of the State where the tortious act was committed, 28 U.S.C. 1346 (b), subject to the limitations that the United States shall not be liable for \"interest prior to judgment or for punitive damages,\" 28 U.S.C. 2674. But it is necessary in any case that the findings of damages be made with sufficient particularity so that they may be reviewed. Here the District Court merely awarded the amount prayed for in the complaint. There was no attempt to allot any particular sum to any of the 30 plaintiffs, who owned varying numbers of horses and burros. There can be no apportionment of the award among the petitioners unless it be assumed that the horses were valued equally, the burros equally, and some assumption is made as to the consequential damages and pain and suffering of each petitioner. These assumptions cannot be made in the absence of pertinent findings, and the findings here are totally inadequate for review. The case must be remanded to the District Court for the appropriate findings in this regard.\n\nSince the District Court did not possess the power to enjoin the United States, neither can it enjoin the individual agents of the United States over whom it never acquired personal jurisdiction. That part of the Court of Appeals judgment dissolving the injunction is affirmed. The remainder of the judgment is reversed and remanded to the District Court for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n    Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] For example, No. 13 of the Findings of Fact made by the District Court states: \"Wood is the only fuel available to plaintiffs as a fuel for their fires, and it is necessary at certain times to travel by horse up to 15 or 20 miles to drag or haul wood to the camps or hogans. Water is also scare and this must be carried by horse and burro for distances up to 10 miles from the camps. Trips to reach the pine nuts areas often require trips by horse for 150 miles, and to reach sites of certain ceremonies and other functions among the Navajo people often require plaintiffs and their families to travel on their horses for 150 miles. Seventy-five mile trips are required in their hunting expeditions which can only be done on horses. That the same use is made of burros as of horses by plaintiffs and the burro is held in the same esteem by them as are horses.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The suit by the United States was dismissed by the District Court, 93 F. Supp. 745. The Court of Appeals reversed the dismissal and reinstated the complaint, United States v. Hosteen Tse-Kesi, 191 F.2d 518. The suit was later dismissed by the District Court on June 27, 1953, for the reason that it was moot because the Indians had moved to the reservation and were no longer on the public lands. The suit brought by several white stockmen in a Utah state court resulted in an order enjoining certain Navajo Indians, including some of the petitioners, from trespassing and grazing livestock on the lands in question. Young v. Felornia, 121 Utah 646, 244 P.2d 862. A petition for certiorari in this suit was pending before this Court at the time the roundup was started. Certiorari was subsequently denied, \n344 \nU.S. 886\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] While the Government does not challenge particular findings, it does level a general charge that the trial was conducted in such an atmosphere of bias and prejudice that no factual conclusions of the court should be relied on. The Court of Appeals noted \"that the case was tried in an atmosphere of maximum emotion and a minimum of judicial impartiality.\" 220 F.2d, at 670. After oral argument and a through consideration of the record, however, we do not find that the trial was conducted so improperly as to vitiate these findings. See Labor Board v. Donnelly Co., \n330 \nU.S. 219, 236\n-237.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] \" 161.11 Procedure for enforcement of rules and regulations - (a) Service of notice.

Eight years later, he petitioned the same court for habeas corpus, claiming that his conviction was invalid under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, because (1) his pleas of guilty resulted from coercion and threats by state officers, and (2) he was never advised of his right to counsel or given the benefit of counsel. The District Attorney filed an answer challenging the materiality of some of petitioner's allegations, denying others and urging that the writ be refused because of petitioner's tardiness in challenging the judgment. The petition was dismissed summarily without a hearing. Held: Petitioner was entitled to a hearing and the judgment is reversed. Pp. 117-123.\n\n (a) Petitioner's allegations as to his treatment prior to confession and his understanding of the nature and consequences of a guilty plea present the very kind of dispute that should be decided only after a hearing. Pp. 119-121.\n\n\n (b) Neither petitioner's statement at his trial that he was guilty and threw himself upon the mercy of the court nor any other statements made by him at that time were in themselves sufficient to refute as frivolous or false the allegations in his petition for habeas corpus concerning matters not shown by the record.

P. 123.\n\n\n Reversed and remanded.\n\nHerbert Monte Levy and Marjorie Hanson Matson argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioner.\n\nWray G. Zelt, Jr. argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were Harold V. Fergus and John F. Roney.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nIn 1945 petitioner Stephen Herman pleaded guilty in a Pennsylvania state court to 8 charges of burglary, 12 of larceny, 8 of forgery, and 2 of false pretense.\n1\n He was sentenced to serve 17 1\/2 to 35 years in the penitentiary, 2 1\/2 to 5 years on each of the charges, some running consecutively, some concurrently. Eight years later, in 1953, he filed this petition for habeas corpus in the same Pennsylvania court, asking that his conviction be held invalid as in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. He alleged: (1) that his pleas of guilty were the result of coercion and threats by state officers and (2) that at no stage of the proceedings was he either advised of his right to or given the benefit of counsel. The District Attorney filed an answer challenging the materiality of some of petitioner's allegations, \n\n[350 \nU.S. 116, 118]\n\u00a0\n denying others, and urging that the writ be refused because of petitioner's tardiness in challenging the judgment. He asked that the petition be summarily dismissed on the ground that \"it would be a waste of time and very expensive for Washington Country to have this defendant go into a hearing to prove charges that he could have raised at the time he was sentenced by this Court.\" The petition was summarily dismissed without a hearing by the same trial judge who had sentenced petitioner.\n\nOn appeal, the Superior Court of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania affirmed the dismissal. 176 Pa. Super. 387, 107 A. 2d 595. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania denied leave to appeal without opinion. We granted certiorari, \n349 \nU.S. 904\n, because summary dismissal in the face of the petitioner's serious allegations appeared to be out of line with decisions of this Court.\n\nOur prior decisions have established that: (1) a conviction following trial or on a plea of guilty based on a confession extorted by violence or by mental coercion is invalid under the Federal Due Process Clause;\n2\n (2) where a person convicted in a state court has not intelligently and understandingly waived the benefit of counsel and where the circumstances show that his rights could not have been fairly protected without counsel, the Due Process Clause invalidates his conviction;\n3\n (3) where a denial of these constitutional protections is alleged in an \n\n[350 \nU.S. 116, 119]\n\u00a0\n appropriate proceeding by factual allegations not patently frivolous or false on a consideration of the whole record, the proceeding should not be summarily dismissed merely because a state prosecuting officer files an answer denying some or all of the allegations.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nIn the light of our previous holdings we now consider the allegations of the petition for habeas corpus and the prosecuting officer's answer. The petition alleged:\n\nPetitioner, who had been to school only 6 years, was 21 years old when arrested. His only prior experience with criminal procedure was 2 years earlier, when without the benefit of counsel he pleaded guilty to charges of burglary, larceny, and forgery, and was sentenced to 6 to 12 months in jail. After his arrest on the present charges he was held incommunicado for 3 days. During this period a state trooper grabbed him by the neck and threatened to choke him if he did not confess, and there were threats against the safety of his wife and daughter. Petitioner finally confessed after 72 hours of intermittent questioning and was taken to a justice of the peace. He waived indictment and agreed to plead guilty to 3 charges. More than a month later he was taken before the Court of Common Pleas and charged with some 30 offenses. The assistant prosecuting attorney demanded that petitioner sign a plea of guilty to all the charges. When petitioner asked what he was signing, the assistant prosecuting attorney said \"Sign your name and forget it.\" Petitioner was not informed of the seriousness of the charges by the prosecutor or the judge; he did not know that his plea of guilty could result in a maximum sentence of some 315 years; he did not know nor was he informed that he could have counsel. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 116, 120]\n\u00a0\n Petitioner pleaded guilty to all of the charges against him. He now says he was innocent of all but one.\n\nThe District Attorney's answer alleged: It was immaterial that petitioner was only 21 years old and of limited educational background. Since petitioner had previous experience in criminal procedure from the former case in which he pleaded guilty, he understood his rights and was barred from alleging that his lack of criminal experience violated due process. It was not necessary that a defendant should have the advice, support, and assistance of relatives or friends even if it be assumed that there was anything in the record to show that such an opportunity was denied to petitioner. Petitioner had no constitutional right to be informed by the court or prosecuting attorney of his right to counsel or of the severity of the sentences which might be imposed upon him. There was no showing that petitioner had been injured by not having counsel. The District Attorney did not deny that petitioner had been told in the courtroom to \"Sign your name and forget it,\" but denied only \"that the statements were made by the Assistant District Attorney in order to obtain pleas to the charges involved.\" The District Attorney defended the State's right to confine petitioner for a period of 72 hours on the ground that this was not \"an unreasonable length of time to hold a defendant.\" The charge that the officers threatened the safety of petitioner's wife and daughter was specifically denied as untrue, as was the charge that petitioner was grabbed by the neck. The answer alleged that petitioner's confession was wholly voluntary.\n\nThe foregoing narrative of the allegations in the petition and the answer reveals a sharp dispute as to the facts material to a determination of the constitutional questions involved. The allegations as to petitioner's treatment prior to confession and his understanding of the nature and consequences of a guilty plea present the very \n\n[350 \nU.S. 116, 121]\n\u00a0\n kind of dispute which should be decided only after a hearing. It is true that the trial record shows that petitioner told the judge that he was guilty and said \"I throw myself at the mercy of the court, Your Honor.\" But neither these nor any other statements made before the trial judge at that time\n5\n are in themselves sufficient to refute as frivolous or false the serious charges made by the petitioner concerning matters not shown by the record. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 116, 122]\n\u00a0\n See Palmer v. Ashe, \n342 \nU.S. 134, 137\n. It is entirely possible that petitioner's prior confession caused him, in the absence of counsel, to enter the guilty plea. Moreover, the number and complexity of the charges against petitioner, as well as their seriousness, create a strong conviction that no layman could have understood the accusations and that petitioner should, therefore, have been advised of his right to be represented by counsel. We cannot agree with the Pennsylvania Superior Court that the mere fact that petitioner had, without the benefit of counsel, pleaded guilty to an offense 2 years before showed that he had the capacity to defend himself against the 30 charges here. We held in Gibbs v. Burke, \n337 \nU.S. 773\n, \n\n[350 \nU.S. 116, 123]\n\u00a0\n that in spite of Gibbs' conviction in 6 prior criminal cases the circumstances showed he was entitled to the benefit of counsel. In Uveges v. Pennsylvania, \n335 \nU.S. 437\n, where the facts were strikingly similar to those presented here, we held that representation by counsel was required by the Due Process Clause. Nor was petitioner barred from presenting his challenge to the conviction because 8 years had passed before this action was commenced. Uveges did not challenge his conviction for 7 years. \n335 \nU.S. 437, 438\n-439. And in a later case we held that a prisoner could challenge the validity of his conviction 18 years after he had been convicted. Palmer v. Ashe, \n342 \nU.S. 134\n. The sound premise upon which these holdings rested is that men incarcerated in flagrant violation of their constitutional rights have a remedy.\n\nThe chief argument made by the State here in support of the court's summary dismissal of the petition is this: \"Counsel for petitioner argues that since facts are alleged in the petition, a hearing must be held. Since our answer contradicted the allegations in the petition, the lower court was not required to grant a hearing. This contention was sustained by the Superior Court.\" We cannot accept this argument. Under the allegations here petitioner is entitled to relief if he can prove his charges. He cannot be denied a hearing merely because the allegations of his petition were contradicted by the prosecuting officers.\n\nThe judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n    Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The courts below so computed the charges. Petitioner counts only 27 charges. The record casts doubt on the accuracy of both computations.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] E. g., Brown v. Mississippi, \n297 \nU.S. 278\n; Chambers v.

HARVESTER CORP. v. GOODRICH(1956)\nNo. 82\nArgued: Decided: April 9, 1956\n\n\n\n\n New York State imposes a highway use tax, computed by the weight-distance principle, upon motor carriers operating heavy vehicles on the State's highways. The tax owed by a carrier is a statutory lien upon all motor vehicles operated by the carrier within the State, and the lien is paramount to all prior liens or encumbrances. Vendors of particular trucks, who sold them to the carrier under conditional sales agreements more than a year after the statute became effective, challenged application of the statutory tax lien, in some circumstances, as a deprivation of property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution. Held:\n\n 1. As applied to taxes based upon the carrier's operation of other trucks within the State, whether before or during the time that the carrier operated the particular trucks within the State, the State's priority of lien is constitutional. Pp. 538-548.\n\n\n 2. As applied to taxes assessed against the carrier after the vendors have repossessed the particular trucks, but which were based upon the carrier's operations on the State's highways before such repossession, the State's priority of lien is constitutional. Pp. 538-548.\n\n\n 308 N. Y. 731. 124 N. E. 2d 339, affirmed.\n\nJohn Lord O'Brian argued the cause for appellants. With him on the brief were Charles A. Horsky, Robert L. Randall and John T.

Javits, Attorney General, Sidney Kelly, Jr., Assistant Attorney General, and Walter V. Ferris, Deputy Assistant Attorney General. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 537, 538]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE BURTON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe State of New York imposes a highway use tax upon motor carriers operating heavy vehicles on its public highways. Many such vehicles are purchased and operated under conditional sales agreements, and certain conditional vendors here question the extent to which the State may subordinate the vendors' security interests to the State's lien for taxes owed by the carrier. The vendors question the constitutionality of any grant of priority to the State's lien, over their rights in particular trucks, insofar as the lien is made applicable to taxes based upon the carrier's operation of other trucks within the State, whether before, or during, the time that the carrier has operated the particular trucks within the State. The vendors object, likewise, to any priority for the lien as applied to taxes assessed against the carrier after the vendors have repossessed the particular trucks, even though the taxes are based upon the carrier's operations on the State's highways before such repossession.\n1\n For the reasons hereafter stated, we sustain the State's priority in each instance.\n\nInternational Harvester Credit Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and Brockway Motor Company, Inc., a New York corporation, as plaintiffs (now appellants), with the members of the State Tax Commission of New York as defendants (now appellees), submitted this controversy to the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Appellate Division, Third Department, on stipulated facts, pursuant to 546 of the Civil Practice Act of New York. Appellants \n\n[350 \nU.S. 537, 539]\n\u00a0\n sought a declaratory judgment that the liens asserted by the State were not superior to the conditional vendors' interests in certain trucks and that Article 21 of the Tax Law was unconstitutional, insofar as it prescribed the priorities to which they objected.\n2\n Appellants also asked that the bonds filed by them to secure payment of the taxes be canceled and returned.\n\nWith one judge not voting, the Appellate Division decided in favor of appellees, sustaining generally the State's liens and priorities.\n3\n 284 App. Div. 604, 132 N. Y. S. 2d 511. On appeal, taken as a matter of right, that judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeals of New York, with one judge dissenting. 308 N. Y. 731, 124 N. E. 2d 339. On appeal to this Court, under 28 U.S.C. 1257 (2), we noted probable jurisdiction. \n350 \nU.S. 813\n.\n\nThe stipulated facts may be summarized as follows: From January 1, 1952, through February 1954, Eastern Cartage and Leasing Co., Inc., here called the \"carrier,\" was a domestic corporation owning at least 15 motor vehicles. As a motor carrier it operated these vehicles over the public highways of the State of New York subject to the highway use tax imposed by Article 21 of the Tax Law, supra. That tax was imposed upon the \"carrier\" or \"owner,\" and those terms did not include \n\n[350 \nU.S. 537, 540]\n\u00a0\n the conditional vendor of trucks operated by the motor carrier.\n4\n It was payable with the monthly returns.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nIn recognition of the administrative difficulties involved in enforcing and collecting this tax, in contrast to a flat rate tax, or one measured by gross receipts, the statute prescribed extensive remedies, as well as penalties, civil and criminal (see 512 of the Tax Law), to protect the interest of the State.\n6\n The provisions for the State's lien covering the points at issue are as follows:\n\n\" 506. Payment of tax\n\n\n .  .  .   .  .\n\n\n \"The fees, taxes, penalties and interest accruing under this article shall constitute a lien upon all \n\n[350 \nU.S. 537, 541]\n\u00a0\n motor vehicles and vehicular units of such carrier. The lien shall attach at the time of operation of any motor vehicle or vehicular unit of such carrier within this state and shall remain effective until the fees, taxes, penalties and interest are paid, or the motor vehicle or vehicular unit is sold for the payment thereof. Such liens shall be paramount to all prior liens or encumbrances of any character and to the rights of any holder of the legal title in or to any such motor vehicle or vehicular unit.\" McKinney's N. Y. Laws, Tax Law.\n\n\n From January 1, 1952, through February 1954, the carrier incurred, and failed to pay, highway use taxes of $3,158.77, plus penalties and interest of $539.27 through April 21, 1954. The taxes carried interest at 1% per month. While neither appellant knew anything of these delinquencies until the State asserted them in April 1954, it is also true that neither appellant had inquired of the carrier or of the State as to their possible existence.\n7\n\u00a0\n\n[350 \nU.S. 537, 542]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn February and March 1953, while the carrier was operating under the Highway Use Tax Act, International Harvester Company, a foreign corporation doing business in New York State, sold two tractors to the carrier for $8,253 each.\n8\n In each such transaction, the carrier executed and delivered to the vendor a conditional sales agreement for $6,541. The agreements were assigned by the vendor to the International Harvester Credit Corporation, one of the appellants herein, and were properly filed in the office of the Clerk of the Town of Rotterdam, Schenectady County, New York. Each truck was operated by the carrier on the public highways of New York State and remained in the carrier's possession and control until repossessed January 26, 1954. The carrier was then delinquent under its sales agreements to the extent of $4,578.79 on each truck, and the vendor bought them in at public sale. It resold one to a purchaser in New York and the other to a purchaser in Massachusetts.\n\nComparable facts relate to the truck sold the carrier by appellant Brockway Motor Company. Its sales price was $7,257; the conditional sales agreement was for $6,757. The repossession took place March 26, 1954, when $5,625 was owed to the vendor. The record shows no disposal of the truck.\n\nApril 21, 1954, the State asserted its lien on each truck for the entire amount of the highway use tax delinquencies of the carrier, totaling $3,698.04.\n9\n\u00a0\n\n[350 \nU.S. 537, 543]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThere is no dispute as to the amount of the tax due to the State nor of the claim that such sum is due from the carrier.\n10\n There also is no controversy as to the validity of the State's lien against the respective trucks for such part of the tax as is measured by the operation of each on the State's highways.\n\nThe issue, accordingly, has been narrowed by the parties to the validity of the subordination of the rights of the respective conditional vendors of these trucks to the State's lien for any part of the carrier's delinquent taxes that exceeds the sum determined by the operation of the trucks on the State's highways. To the extent of such excess, the vendors claim that the statutory lien deprives them of property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution.\n\nSeparate factual considerations are presented by the State's lien (1) for the taxes measured by the carrier's operation of trucks other than the three here in question, and (2) for the taxes measured by the carrier's operation of trucks before its first operation of the respective three trucks in question. The principle which supports the State's priority of lien is, however, the same in both instances. That principle supports also the priority of the State's lien as dating from the time of the carrier's first operation of the respective three trucks within the State. This holds good even though no assessment of the tax \n\n[350 \nU.S. 537, 544]\n\u00a0\n was made by the State until after the respective trucks had been repossessed by their conditional vendors. The State's claim of priority for its lien depends, in each instance, upon its constitutional right to enforce the collection of all taxes due it from the motor carrier for the latter's use of the highways of New York under a statute giving ample notice of the tax and of the provisions for its collection.\n\nThere is no doubt that the State may impose and enforce a lien covering all taxes owed to it by a carrier for the privilege of using the State's highways, where such lien applies to vehicles owned by the carrier free and clear of encumbrances. The lien for such taxes may be enforced against any or all of such trucks, regardless of whether the taxes accrued from the carrier's operation of one or the other of such trucks, or even whether they accrued from the carrier's use of the highways before its acquisition and operation of any of the particular trucks subjected to the lien. Likewise, the lien unquestionably could attach to the trucks as of the time of their first use by the carrier within the State. See United States v. Alabama, \n313 \nU.S. 274, 280\n-282. Such liens are simple illustrations of the State's exercise of its prerogative right to impose a statutory lien for delinquent taxes upon the taxpayer's property. See Marshall v. New York, \n254 \nU.S. 380, 382\n-384. A State is entitled to wide discretion in such matters.\n\nThe controversy arises here because, for the present purposes, the State treats the three trucks now before us in the same manner as it does the carrier's unencumbered trucks. The vendors, relying upon their conditional sales agreements, deny this right. The State does not dispute the validity of those agreements. The State, however, treats them as security interests rather than as absolute interests. The State emphasizes the action of the vendors in yielding control of the trucks to the carrier thus \n\n[350 \nU.S. 537, 545]\n\u00a0\n enabling the carrier to operate them on the State's highways. The burden placed on the highways has been precisely the same as though the carrier had held unencumbered title to the trucks.\n\nLooking at the situation from another point of view, New York has an unquestionable right to regulate the use of conditional sales agreements within the State. The prescribed priority of its highway tax liens over the rights of conditional vendors may be regarded, therefore, as in the nature of a supplement to the New York Uniform Conditional Sales Act. McKinney's N. Y. Laws. Personal Property Law, Art. 4.\n\nNew York subjects each carrier to a reasonably computed tax for the use of its highways and, in order to collect that tax, places a statutory lien upon all motor vehicles operated by the carrier within the State. The carrier here was the beneficial owner and operator of the three trucks during the time it had possession of them. The conditional sales agreements provided the vendors with security for payment of the purchase price of the trucks. As long as the carrier kept up its payments, the possession and control of the trucks were in the carrier and its use of them on the highways had the same effect on those highways as though the trucks had been paid for in full.\n11\n\u00a0\n\n[350 \nU.S. 537, 546]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe enforcement of this lien rests upon principles known to the law in other connections. A landlord's lien for unpaid rent long has been enforceable against personal property found on the premises in the possession of the tenant, even though the legal title to such personal property may be in a third party who has allowed the tenant to have possession and beneficial use of it. Spencer v. M'Gowen, 13 Wend. (N. Y.) 256.\n12\n\u00a0\n\nThe highway use tax is not assessed on the conditional vendor or on the vendor's trucks as such. It is a tax assessed on the carrier and the lien for its collection is imposed on the trucks in the carrier's possession which have been operated by it on New York's highways. The State asserts no personal liability on the part of either of the appellants. The State's claim is limited to its lien as set forth in a statute which was in effect more than a year before the respective appellants sold their trucks to the carrier. While it is not a condition of the validity of the State's lien, it is obvious that vendors of trucks, as well as carriers, derive substantial benefits from the State's costly construction and maintenance of its highways for heavy traffic. The reasonableness of the lien is thereby emphasized. Cases condemning attempts by States to compute one person's tax by reference to the income or activities of another are not persuasive here. The tax here is on the carrier and it is computed with reference to the carrier's own use of the highways. This statutory lien does not destroy the efficacy of conditional sales financing. Practically, it suggests that the conditional vendors secure assurance from their carrier-customers that the latters' highway use taxes are not in arrears. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 537, 547]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWhile the State would not, at common law, have a lien to the extent here asserted, that is far from saying that the lien, when imposed by statute, is arbitrary or unreasonable and, therefore, lacking in due process.\n\nJustice Cardozo said for this Court in Burnet v. Wells, \n289 \nU.S. 670, 677\n-678:\n\n \"The controversy is one as to the boundaries of legislative power. It must be dealt with in a large way, as questions of due process always are, not narrowly or pedantically, in slavery to forms or phrases. `Taxation is not so much concerned with the refinements of title as it is with the actual command over the property taxed - the actual benefit for which the tax is paid.' Corliss v. Bowers, supra [281 \nU.S. 376], p. 378. Cf. Burnet v. Guggenheim, supra [288 \nU.S. 280], p. 283. Refinements of title have at times supplied the rule when the question has been one of construction and nothing more, a question as to the meaning of a taxing act to be read in favor of the taxpayer. Refinements of title are without controlling force when a statute, unmistakable in meaning, is assailed by a taxpayer as overpassing the bounds of reason, an exercise by the lawmakers of arbitrary power. In such circumstances the question is no longer whether the concept of ownership reflected in the statute is to be squared with the concept embodied, more or less vaguely, in common law traditions. The question is whether it is one that an enlightened legislator might act upon without affront to justice. Even administrative convenience, the practical necessities of an efficient system of taxation, will have heed and recognition within reasonable limits.\" (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n\n There is little doubt that if this tax on the carrier were required to be computed at a flat rate, or measured by the \n\n[350 \nU.S. 537, 548]\n\u00a0\n gross receipts of the carrier from its use of the State's highways, that the liens here asserted on all vehicles in the carrier's fleet of trucks (although subject to conditional sales) would be valid as a reasonable means of enforcing such an unallocable tax. The State has no less a constitutional right to prescribe and enforce its lien where, as here, the tax on the carrier is allocable because computed in close proportion to the actual burden placed on the highways by the respective trucks operated by the carrier. In either case, the tax is owed by the carrier and the need for an effective lien to enforce it is all the more necessary where, as here, the tax cannot be computed or readily collected in advance.\n\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals of the State of New York, accordingly, is\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE BLACK concurs in the result.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] We do not have before us the validity of the attempted subordination of a conditional vendor's security interest in a truck sold to and operated by a carrier where the tax is measured by any use of the highways by the carrier after the truck has been repossessed by its vendor. Such a claim was made in this case but it was abandoned by the State.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Article 21 of the Tax Law, effective October 1, 1951, imposed a tax for the privilege of operating on the highways of New York motor vehicles having a gross weight of over 18,000 pounds each. McKinney's N. Y. Laws, 501 (2) and 503. The tax was computed on a graduated scale beginning at six mills per mile for vehicles of between 18,001 and 20,000 pounds. The scale rose to 35 mills for trucks weighing between 74,001 and 76,000 pounds, with an additional two mills per ton and fraction thereof above that weight. The tax was determined by multiplying the number of miles operated over the highways of the State by the rate for the appropriate weight group. Id., 503.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The lien was not upheld as to any taxes which accrued after repossession of the trucks.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] \"Such tax shall be upon the carrier except that where the carrier is not the owner of such vehicular unit, the tax shall be a joint and several liability upon both.\" Tax Law, 503. And see the following interpretation of the above sentence by the Attorney General of New York which we accept:\n\n\"In my opinion, the statute does not intend the inclusion of `a conditional vendor' in the word `owner.' The joint and several liability imposed upon an owner other than the carrier is designed to cover those who lawfully place the use and control of vehicles in the hands of other for operation upon the highways under circumstances and arrangements which do not look to divestiture of their own proprietary interests. A conditional vendor, on the other hand, retains legal title as a special interest, protecting the unpaid purchase price of the vehicle. The transaction looks to defeasance of all his interest if completed in accordance with its terms.\n\n .  .  .   .  .\n\n\n\n\"I conclude that a conditional vendor is not an `owner' subjected to personal liability for the highway use tax as such.\" Rep.

JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, with whom MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS concurs, dissenting.\n\nSo far as the United States Constitution limits them, the States have the amplest scope in imposing highway taxes and devising relevant means for enforcing them. Within the vast range of its discretionary taxing power, a State may provide that a creditor who adds to the corpus of equipment used by his debtor on the State's highways cannot be heard to complain if his equity in such equipment is subordinated not only to tax liens on that specific equipment, but also, as is true of the New York State legislation, for tax liens incurred by all the debtor's vehicles for the entire period during which the creditor has enabled his debtor to have added vehicles on the road. As a practical matter, the carrier's creditor may \n\n[350 \nU.S. 537, 549]\n\u00a0\n well have adequate means of protecting himself regarding the incidence of highway taxes and their default during the whole of the period that such creditor helped to enhance the totality of vehicles used by the carrier.\n\nWe therefore agree with the Court that taxes incurred by all the vehicles in Eastern's service during the period that the three International Harvester tractors were on the road may be collected by way of enforcing tax liens for such total taxes against the three International tractors. It is immaterial that these three tractors were held under a credit arrangement whereby International Harvester reserved interest in them by way of security for payment of their purchase price.\n\nA very different situation is presented for such part of the taxes as are sought to be collected by way of lien out of these International Harvester tractors for the period antedating their conditional sale to Eastern.\n\nProperty is included within the triad of interests protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment - \"nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\" When one man's property is taken and given to another or, as in this case, is taken to satisfy the debts of another, a justifying public purpose must meet the requirements of the Due Process Clause. See Thompson v. Consolidated Gas Co., \n300 \nU.S. 55, 79\n-80.\n\nIt is one thing for a creditor, who has enabled his debtor to hold himself out as having dominion over property which the creditor has placed within his debtor's control, to suffer for debts incurred by his debtor to third persons. It is quite another thing to saddle such creditor's property with satisfaction of prior obligation to a third person when the creditor had no means whatever of safeguarding himself against the enforcement of such third-party indebtedness. Nor does it matter that the third party is the State. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 537, 550]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn the situation before us, International Harvester had no means of protecting itself against highway taxes incurred by Eastern prior to the time that it put its three tractors into Eastern's hands. It is admitted that under New York law in force at the time of the conditional sale of these tractors, International Harvester could not possibly have protected itself against the losses to which it is now subjected except by avoiding such sales. It could not possibly have ascertained the tax liabilities of its conditional vendee prior to the credit arrangement in the sale of these tractors. It could not have informed itself by examining the tax returns of its vendee. New York made it a misdemeanor for any state official to divulge such information. N. Y. Tax Law, Art. 21, 514. Thus, there is no connection whatever between the undoubted property interest that International Harvester had in the three tractors and the extent of the lien that the State sought to foreclose in them. When one considers the important role played in our economy by credit sales, it will hardly do for the law to deem such transactions extra-hazardous and subject such creditors to an insurer's risks.\n\nWe would therefore remand the case to the New York courts in order to restrict the enforcible lien in appellant's tractors to the highway taxes incurred by Eastern for the period that appellant's vehicles were in Eastern's service. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 537, 551]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","43":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJAY v. BOYD(1956)\nNo. 503\nArgued: May 3, 1956Decided: June 11, 1956\n\n\n\n\n An alien, whose deportation had been ordered because admittedly, after entry, he had been a member of the Communist Party from 1935 through 1940, applied for suspension of his deportation under 244 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which authorizes the Attorney General, \"in his discretion,\" to suspend deportation of any deportable alien who meets certain statutory requirements relating to moral character, hardship and period of residence in the United States. After administrative hearings not expressly required by statute but authorized by regulations of the Attorney General, a special inquiry officer found that the alien met the statutory prerequisites for the favorable exercise of discretionary relief but denied relief because of confidential information not disclosed to the alien. The use of such confidential information without disclosure thereof to the applicant was expressly authorized by the regulations if \"the disclosure of such information would be prejudicial to the public interest, safety, or security.\" Held: The Attorney General has properly exercised his discretionary powers under the statute in this case, and denial of the application is sustained. Pp. 347-361.\n\n (a) Under his rulemaking authority and as a matter of administrative convenience, the Attorney General validly delegated his authority to special inquiry officers with review by the Board of Immigration Appeals. P. 351, n. 8.\n\n\n (b) The regulation permitting consideration of confidential information not disclosed to the applicant is not inconsistent with 244 (a). Pp. 352-356.\n\n\n (c) Suspension of deportation is not a matter of right but a matter of grace, like probation, parole or suspension of sentence, and the applicant is not entitled to the kind of a hearing which contemplates full disclosure of the considerations entering into an exercise of the Attorney General's discretion. Pp. 354-356.\n\n\n (d) Section 244 (c), which requires the Attorney General to file with Congress \"a complete and detailed statement of the facts\" \n\n[351 \nU.S. 345, 346]\n\u00a0\n regarding cases in which suspension is granted, with \"the reasons for such suspension,\" is inapplicable to cases in which suspension is denied, and it affords no basis for a conclusion that an applicant must be apprised of reasons for a denial of his request for suspension. P. 356.\n\n\n (e) Section 235 (c), which specifically authorizes the Attorney General to determine, in some circumstances, that an alien is excludable \"on the basis of information of a confidential nature,\" does not, by implication, prevent the use of confidential information in rulings upon applications for suspension of deportation. Pp. 356-357.\n\n\n (f) Though it is contended that, in construing the statute, all doubts should be resolved in the applicant's favor, because the use of such confidential information is inconsistent with the \"tradition and principles of free government\" and denial of suspension may lead to severe results, this Court must adopt the plain meaning of this statute. Pp. 357-358.\n\n\n (g) As here construed, 244 is constitutional. P. 357, n. 21.\n\n\n (h) The regulation permits the use of undisclosed confidential information only when disclosure \"would be prejudicial to the public interest, safety, or security,\" and this is a reasonable class of cases in which to exercise that power. P. 358.\n\n\n (i) Since the Board of Immigration Appeals, the District Court and the Court of Appeals concluded, in effect, that the special inquiry officer found that disclosure of the confidential information in this case would have been contrary to the public interest, safety or security, this Court accepts that finding, and nothing more is required by the regulation. P. 358, n. 22.\n\n\n (j) In view of the gratuitous nature of the relief, the use of confidential information in a suspension of deportation proceeding is more clearly within statutory authority than the regulations sustained in Knauff v. Shaughnessy, \n338 \nU.S. 537\n, and Shaughnessy v. Mezei, \n345 \nU.S. 206\n. Pp. 358-359.\n\n\n (k) The use of undisclosed confidential information as a basis for denying suspension of deportation did not transgress any of the related regulations governing suspension of deportation proceedings. Pp. 359-361.\n\n\n 222 F.2d 820, 224 F.2d 957, affirmed.\n\nWill Maslow and John Caughlan argued the cause for petitioner. On the brief were Mr. Caughlan and Norman Leonard. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 345, 347]\n\u00a0\n\n\nJohn V. Lindsay argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were Solicitor General Sobeloff, Assistant Attorney General Olney, Gray Thoron, Beatrice Rosenberg, J. F. Bishop and L. Paul Winings.\n\nMr. Maslow and Shad Polier filed a brief for the American Jewish Congress, as amicus curiae, urging reversal.\n\nMR. JUSTICE REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nPetitioner brought this habeas corpus proceeding to test the validity of the denial of his application under 244 (a) (5) and 244 (c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 66 Stat. 215, 216, 8 U.S.C. 1254 (a) (5) and 1254 (c), for discretionary suspension of deportation. He contends that the denial of his application was unlawful because based on confidential, undisclosed information. The District Court denied the writ, holding, so far as pertinent here, that, \"after complying with all the essentials of due process of law in the deportation hearing and in the hearing to determine eligibility for suspension of deportation, [the Attorney General may] consider confidential information outside the record in formulating his discretionary decision.\"\n1\n The Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding, inter alia, that petitioner was not \"denied due process of law in the consideration of his application for suspension of deportation because of the use of this confidential information.\" 222 F.2d 820, 820-821; rehearing denied, 224 F.2d 957. We granted certiorari, \n350 \nU.S. 931\n, to consider the validity of 8 CFR, Rev. 1952, 244.3, the Attorney General's regulation which provides:\n\n \" 244.3 Use of confidential information. In the case of an alien qualified for . . . suspension of deportation under section . . . 244 of the Immigration \n\n[351 \nU.S. 345, 348]\n\u00a0\n and Nationality Act the determination as to whether the application for . . . suspension of deportation shall be granted or denied (whether such determination is made initially or on appeal) may be predicated upon confidential information without the disclosure thereof to the applicant, if in the opinion of the officer or the Board making the determination the disclosure of such information would be prejudicial to the public interest, safety, or security.\"\n\n\n Following a hearing, the fairness of which is unchallenged, petitioner was ordered deported in 1952 pursuant to 8 U.S.C. (1946 ed., Supp. V) 137-3. That section provided for the deportation of any alien \"who was at the time of entering the United States, or has been at any time thereafter,\" a member of the Communist Party of the United States.\n2\n Petitioner, a citizen of Great Britain, last entered the United States in 1921. At the deportation hearing he admitted having been a voluntary member of the Communist Party from 1935 through 1940. He attacked the validity of the deportation order in the courts below on the ground that there is \"no lawful power . . . under the Constitution or laws of the United States\" to deport one who has \"at no time violated any condition imposed at the time of his entry.\" But that point has been abandoned, and in this Court petitioner in effect concedes that he is deportable. See Galvan v. Press, \n347 \nU.S. 522\n; Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, \n342 \nU.S. 580\n.\n\nIn 1953, upon motion of petitioner, the deportation order was withdrawn for the purpose of allowing petitioner to seek discretionary relief from the Attorney General under 244 (a) (5) of the Act. The application for \n\n[351 \nU.S. 345, 349]\n\u00a0\n suspension of deportation was filed and a hearing thereon was held before a special inquiry officer of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.\n3\n The special inquiry officer found petitioner to be qualified for suspension of deportation\n4\n - that is, found that petitioner met the statutory prerequisites to the favorable exercise of the discretionary relief.\n5\n But the special inquiry officer decided the case for suspension did not \"warrant favorable \n\n[351 \nU.S. 345, 350]\n\u00a0\n action\" in view of certain \"confidential information.\"\n6\n The Board of Immigration Appeals dismissed an appeal, basing its decision \"Upon a full consideration of the evidence of record and in light of the confidential information available.\"\n7\n Thus, the Board in considering the appeal reviewed the undisclosed information as well as the evidence on the open record. Petitioner then commenced the present habeas corpus action. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 345, 351]\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs previously noted, 244 (a) (5) of the Act provides that the Attorney General \"may, in his discretion\" suspend deportation of any deportable alien who meets certain statutory requirements relating to moral character, hardship and period of residence within the United States. If the Attorney General does suspend deportation under that provision, he must file, pursuant to 244 (c), \"a complete and detailed statement of the facts and pertinent provisions of law in the case\" with Congress, giving \"the reasons for such suspension.\" So far as pertinent here, deportation finally cancels only if Congress affirmatively approves the suspension by a favorable concurrent resolution within a specified period of time. There is no express statutory grant of any right to a hearing on an application to the Attorney General for discretionary suspension of deportation. For purposes of effectuating these statutory provisions, the Attorney General adopted regulations delegating his authority under 244 of the Act to special inquiry officers;\n8\n giving the alien the right to apply for suspension during a deportation hearing;\n9\n putting the burden on the applicant to establish the statutory requirements for eligibility for suspension;\n10\n allowing the alien-applicant to submit any evidence in support of his application;\n11\n requiring the special inquiry officer to present \n\n[351 \nU.S. 345, 352]\n\u00a0\n evidence bearing on the applicant's eligibility for relief;\n12\n and requiring a \"written decision\" with \"a discussion of the evidence relating to the alien's eligibility for such relief and the reasons for granting or denying such application.\"\n13\n The Attorney General also promulgated the regulation under attack here, 8 CFR, Rev. 1952, 244.3, see pp. 347-348, supra, providing for the use by special inquiry officers and the Board of Immigration Appeals of confidential information in ruling upon suspension applications if disclosure of the information would be prejudicial to the public interest, safety or security.\n\nWe note that petitioner does not suggest that he did not receive a full and fair hearing on evidence of record with respect to his statutory eligibility for suspension of deportation. In fact, petitioner recognizes that the special inquiry officer found in his favor on all issues relating to eligibility for the discretionary relief and that those findings were adopted by the Board of Immigration Appeals.\n14\n This favorably disposed of petitioner's eligibility for consideration for suspension of deportation - the first step in the suspension procedure. Thus, we have here the case of an admittedly deportable alien who has been ordered deported following an unchallenged hearing, and who has been accorded another full and fair hearing on the issues respecting his statutory qualifications for discretionary suspension of deportation.\n\nIt is urged upon the Court that the confidential information regulation is invalid because inconsistent with 244 of the Act. In support of this claim, petitioner argues that 244 implicitly requires the Attorney General to give a hearing on applications for suspension of deportation. It is then said that this statutory right is nullified and rendered illusory by the challenged regulation, \n\n[351 \nU.S. 345, 353]\n\u00a0\n and that therefore the regulation is invalid. But there is nothing in the language of 244 of the Act upon which to base a belief that the Attorney General is required to give a hearing with all the evidence spread upon an open record with respect to the considerations which may bear upon his grant or denial of an application for suspension to an alien eligible for that relief. Assuming that the statute implicitly requires a hearing on an open record as to the specified statutory prerequisites to favorable action, there is no claim here of a denial of such a hearing on those issues. Moreover, though we assume a statutory right to a full hearing on those issues, it does not follow that such a right exists on the ultimate decision - the exercise of discretion to suspend deportation.\n\nEligibility for the relief here involved is governed by specific statutory standards which provide a right to a ruling on an applicant's eligibility. However, Congress did not provide statutory standards for determining who, among qualified applicants for suspension, should receive the ultimate relief. That determination is left to the sound discretion of the Attorney General. The statute says that, as to qualified deportable aliens, the Attorney General \"may, in his discretion\" suspend deportation.\n15\n\u00a0\n\n[351 \nU.S. 345, 354]\n\u00a0\n It does not restrict the considerations which may be relied upon or the procedure by which the discretion should be exercised. Although such aliens have been given a right to a discretionary determination on an application for suspension, cf. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, \n347 \nU.S. 260\n, a grant thereof is manifestly not a matter of right under any circumstances, but rather is in all cases a matter of grace. Like probation or suspension of criminal sentence, it \"comes as an act of grace,\" Escoe v. Zerbst, \n295 \nU.S. 490, 492\n, and \"cannot be demanded as a right,\" Berman v. United States, \n302 \nU.S. 211, 213\n.\n16\n And this unfettered discretion of the Attorney General with respect to suspension of deportation is analogous to the Board of Parole's powers to release federal prisoners on parole.\n17\n Even if we assume that Congress has given to qualified applicants for suspension of deportation a right to offer evidence to the Attorney General in support of their applications, the similarity between the discretionary powers vested in the \n\n[351 \nU.S. 345, 355]\n\u00a0\n Attorney General by 244 (a) of the Act on the one hand, and judicial probation power and executive parole power on the other hand, leads to a conclusion that 244 gives no right to the kind of a hearing on a suspension application which contemplates full disclosure of the considerations entering into a decision. Clearly there is no statutory right to that kind of a hearing on a request for a grant of probation after criminal conviction in the federal courts.\n18\n Nor is there such a right with respect to an application for parole.\n19\n Since, as we hold, the Attorney \n\n[351 \nU.S. 345, 356]\n\u00a0\n General's discretion is not limited by the suggested hearing requirement, the challenged regulation cannot be said to be inconsistent with 244 (a) of the Act.\n\nPetitioner says that a hearing requirement, with a consequent disclosure of all considerations going into a decision, is made implicit by 244 (c) if not by 244 (a). Section 244 (c), it will be recalled, requires the Attorney General to file with Congress \"a complete and detailed statement of the facts\" as to cases in which suspension is granted, \"with reasons for such suspension.\" This statutory mandate does not, however, order such a report on cases in which suspension is denied. Section 244 (c) actually emphasizes the fact that suspension is not a matter of right. Congress was interested in limiting grants of this relief to the minimum. It evidenced an interest only in the reasons relied upon by the Attorney General for granting an application so that it could have an opportunity to accept or reject favorable administrative decisions. This in no way suggests that the applicant is to be apprised of the reasons for a denial of his request for suspension.\n\nPetitioner also points to 235 (c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1225 (c), which specifically authorizes the Attorney General to determine under some circumstances that an alien is excludable \"on the basis of information of a confidential nature.\"\n20\n It is argued from this that had Congress intended to permit the use of confidential information in rulings upon applications for suspension of deportation, it would have expressly so provided in language as specific as that used in 235 (c). The difficulty with this argument is that 235 (c) is an exception to an express statutory mandate under 236 (a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1226 (a), that determinations of admissibility \n\n[351 \nU.S. 345, 357]\n\u00a0\n be \"based only on the evidence produced at the inquiry.\" No such express mandate exists with respect to suspension of deportation, and, therefore, no specific provision for the use of confidential information was needed if normally contemplated by the broad grant of discretionary power to the Attorney General.\n\nIt is next argued that, even if the confidential information regulation is not inconsistent with 244 (a), it nevertheless should be held invalid. Emphasizing that Congress did not in terms authorize such a procedure, petitioner contends that the Act should be construed to provide a right to a hearing because only such a construction would be consistent with the \"tradition and principles of free government.\"\n21\n On its face this is an attractive argument. Petitioner urges that, in view of the severity of the result flowing from a denial of suspension of deportation, we should interpret the statute by resolving all doubts in the applicant's favor. Cf. United States v. Minker, \n350 \nU.S. 179, 187\n-188. But we must adopt the plain meaning of a statute, however severe the consequences. Cf. Galvan v. Press, \n347 \nU.S. 522, 528\n. As we have already stated, suspension of deportation is not given to deportable aliens as a right, but, by congressional direction, it is dispensed according to the unfettered \n\n[351 \nU.S. 345, 358]\n\u00a0\n discretion of the Attorney General. In the face of such a combination of factors we are constrained to construe the statute as permitting decisions based upon matters outside the administrative record, at least when such action would be reasonable.\n\nIt may be that 244 (a) cannot be interpreted as allowing a decision based on undisclosed information in every case involving a deportable alien qualified for suspension. Thus, it could be argued that, where there is no compelling reason to refuse to disclose the basis of a denial of an application, the statute does not contemplate arbitrary secrecy. However, the regulation under attack here limits the use of confidential information to instances where, in the opinion of the special inquiry officer or the Board of Immigration Appeals, \"the disclosure . . . would be prejudicial to the public interest, safety, or security.\" If the statute permits any withholding of information from the alien, manifestly this is a reasonable class of cases in which to exercise that power.\n22\n\u00a0\n\nOur conclusion in this case is strongly supported by prior decisions of this Court. In both Knauff v. Shaughnessy, \n338 \nU.S. 537\n, and Shaughnessy v. Mezei, \n345 \nU.S. 206\n, we upheld a regulation of the Attorney General calling for the denial of a hearing in exclusion cases where the Attorney General determined that an alien was excludable \n\n[351 \nU.S. 345, 359]\n\u00a0\n on the basis of confidential information, and where, as here, the disclosure of that information would be prejudicial to the public interest.\n23\n And again, as here, the statutes involved in those cases did not expressly authorize the use of such information in making the administrative ruling. It is true that a resident alien in a deportation proceeding has constitutional protections unavailable to a nonresident alien seeking entry into the United States, and that those protections may militate against construing an ambiguous statute as authorizing the use of confidential information in a deportation proceeding. Cf. Kwong Hai Chew v. Colding, \n344 \nU.S. 590\n. But the issue involved here under 244 (a) is not whether an alien is deportable, but whether, as a deportable alien who is qualified for suspension of deportation, he should be granted such suspension. In view of the gratuitous nature of the relief, the use of confidential information in a suspension proceeding is more clearly within statutory authority than were the regulations involved in the Knauff and Mezei cases.\n\nConcluding that the challenged regulation is not inconsistent with the Act, we must look to petitioner's claim that the use of undisclosed confidential information is unlawful because inconsistent with related regulations governing suspension of deportation procedures. As previously noted, an application for suspension is considered as part of the \"hearing\" to determine deportability. 8 CFR, Rev. 1952, 242.53 (c) and 242.54 (d); and see 8 CFR, Rev. 1952, 242.5. The alien is entitled to \"submit any evidence in support of his application which he believes should be considered by the special inquiry officer.\" 8 CFR, Rev. 1952, 242.54 (d). The hearing to determine deportability, during which the suspension \n\n[351 \nU.S. 345, 360]\n\u00a0\n application is considered, is to be a \"fair and impartial hearing.\" 8 CFR, Rev. 1952, 242.53 (b). And a decision of the special inquiry officer on the request for suspension must contain \"the reasons for granting or denying such application.\" 8 CFR, Rev. 1952, 242.61 (a).\n\nWe conclude that, although undisclosed information was used as a basis for denying suspension of deportation, none of the above-mentioned regulations was transgressed. While an applicant for suspension is, by regulation, entitled to \"submit any evidence in support of his application,\" that is merely a provision permitting an evidentiary plea to the discretion of those who are to make the decision. In this respect it is not unlike the \"statement\" and the opportunity to present \"information in mitigation of punishment\" to which a convicted defendant is entitled under Rule 32 (a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure before criminal sentence is imposed.\n24\n And the situation is not different because the matter of suspension of deportation is taken up in the \"fair and impartial\" deportation \"hearing.\" Assuming that such a \"hearing\" normally precludes the use of undisclosed information, the \"hearing\" here involved necessarily contemplates the use of confidential matter in some circumstances. We must read the body of regulations governing suspension procedures so as to give effect, if possible, to all of its provisions. Cf. Lawson v. Suwannee Fruit & S. S. Co., \n336 \nU.S. 198\n.\n\nThis same rationale leads us to conclude that the requirement of a decision containing \"reasons\" is fully complied with by a statement to the effect that the application has been denied on the basis of confidential information, the disclosure of which would be prejudicial to the public interest, safety or security. Section 244.3 says \n\n[351 \nU.S. 345, 361]\n\u00a0\n that such information may be used \"without the disclosure thereof to the applicant.\" Reading the provision for a statement of the \"reasons\" for a decision in the light of 244.3, it follows that express reliance on confidential information constitutes a statement of the \"reasons\" for a denial of suspension within the meaning of 242.61 (a). If \"reasons\" must be disclosed but confidential information need not be, the former mandate, which certainly comprehends the latter provision, must be satisfied by an express invocation of the latter provision.\n\nCongress has provided a general plan dealing with the deportation of those aliens who have not obtained citizenship although admitted to residence. Since it could not readily make exception for cases of unusual hardship or extenuating circumstances, those matters were left to the consideration and discretion of the Attorney General. We hold that in this case the Attorney General has properly exercised his powers under the suspension statute and we affirm the judgment below.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The District Judge wrote no opinion. The quote is taken from the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, Record 15, 17-18.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] A similar provision is now contained in 8 U.S.C. 1251 (a) (6) (C).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] \"In determining cases submitted for hearing, special inquiry officers shall exercise . . . the authority contained in section 244 of the Immigration and Nationality Act to suspend deportation.\" 8 CFR, Rev. 1952, 242.6.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The finding was: \"As the respondent has not been found to have been a Communist Party member later than 1940, it follows that more than ten years has elapsed since the assumption of the status which constitutes the ground for his deportation. Evidence of record, consisting of affidavits of persons well acquainted with the respondent, together with employment records, as well as a report of an investigation by this Service, satisfactorily establishes that he has been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of not less than ten years last past. A check of the local and Federal records reveals no criminal record. An independent character investigation, as well as the above related affidavits tend to establish that for the ten years immediately preceding his application for relief, he has been a person of good moral character. \". . . He has stated that if he were deported he would suffer extreme and unusual hardship in that he would be separated from relatives and friends, and in effect that he would find it almost impossible to maintain himself because of lack of funds. On the record, respondent appears to be qualified for suspension of deportation.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Section 244 (a) (5) of the Act provides in pertinent part that \"the Attorney General may, in his discretion, suspend deportation\" in the case of a deportable alien who (1) has been present in the United States for at least ten years since the ground for his deportation arose; (2) \"proves that during all of such period he was and is a person of good moral character\"; and (3) is one \"whose deportation would, in the opinion of the Attorney General, result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] In his petition for a writ of habeas corpus petitioner alleged, \"Upon information and belief,\" that the \"confidential information\" considered by the special inquiry officer, and later by the Board of Immigration Appeals, was nothing more than the fact that petitioner's name had appeared on a list circulated by the American Committee for the Protection of the Foreign Born, an organization which had been designated subversive by the Attorney General, ex parte. Petitioner claimed that \"Solely by reason of [his] name appearing on said list, his case for discretionary relief was prejudged and no fair or impartial consideration of his case was given . . . .\" In its Return to the Order to Show Cause, the Government denied that the confidential information relied upon was as alleged by petitioner, and denied that the case had been prejudged. The District Court made no specific finding with respect to the character or substance of the confidential information, but it did determine that the special inquiry officer and the Board of Immigration Appeals \"exercised their independent judgment in denying discretionary relief.\" See Accardi v. Shaughnessy, \n347 \nU.S. 260, 349\n U.S. 280; Marcello v. Bonds, \n349 \nU.S. 302\n. Petitioner apparently abandoned this allegation and argument in the Court of Appeals. In his petition for a writ of certiorari in this Court, he indirectly raises the point again by claiming to be \"entitled to a judicial hearing upon . . . his allegation of fact in habeas corpus proceedings that the undisclosed and so-called confidential matter . . . was of such a character that its consideration was not authorized by applicable regulations established by the Attorney General.\" However, petitioner made no direct assertion in this Court with respect to prejudgment. In this state of the record we conclude that there is no claim of prejudgment before this Court. See n. 22, infra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] No further administrative appeal was then available to petitioner.

Petitioner does not suggest, nor can we conclude, that Congress expected the Attorney General to exercise his discretion in suspension cases personally. There is no doubt but that the discretion was conferred upon him as an administrator in his capacity as such, and that under his rulemaking authority, as a matter of administrative convenience, he could delegate his authority to special inquiry officers with review by the Board of Immigration Appeals. 66 Stat. 173, 8 U.S.C. 1103.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] 8 CFR, Rev. 1952, 242.54 (d).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] Ibid.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] Ibid.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] 8 CFR, Rev. 1952, 242.53 (c).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] 8 CFR, Rev. 1952, 242.61 (a).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] See notes 4 and 5, supra, and accompanying text.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] Congress first provided for suspension of deportation in 1940 by adding a new provision to the Immigration Act of 1917. 54 Stat. 672, as amended, 62 Stat. 1206, 8 U.S.C. (1946 ed., Supp. V) 155 (c). That new provision provided that \"the Attorney General may . . . suspend deportation\" under certain circumstances. In enacting the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, Congress added the phrase \"in his discretion\" after the words \"the Attorney General may.\" In an analysis of draft legislation leading up to the 1952 Act, prepared by the Immigration and Naturalization Service for the assistance of the congressional committees, it was stated that the new words were suggested \"in order to indicate clearly that the grant of suspension is entirely discretionary . . . .\" That analysis was considered by the congressional committees. See S. Rep. No. 1137, 82d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 3; H. R. Rep. No. 1365, 82d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 28.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] As stated by Judge Learned Hand, \"The power of the Attorney General to suspend deportation is a dispensing power, like a judge's power to suspend the execution of a sentence, or the President's to pardon a convict.\" United States ex rel.

No. 1137, 82d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 25, for an indication that suspension of deportation is a matter of grace to cover cases of unusual hardship. And see 81 Cong. Rec. 5546, 5553, 5554, 5561, 5569-5570, and 5572, where early proposed legislation for administrative suspension of deportation was variously described as a procedure for \"clemency\" and \"amnesty,\" and was compared with presidential discretion. And see S. Rep. No. 1515, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., p. 600, emphasizing that suspension of deportation is an entirely discretionary action which does not follow automatically from compliance with the formal eligibility requirements.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] \". . . if in the opinion of the Board [of Parole] such release is not incompatible with the welfare of society, the Board may in its discretion authorize the release of such prisoner on parole.\" (Emphasis supplied.) 18 U.S.C. 4203.

Hunter, 90 U.S. App. D.C. 85, 193 F.2d 41.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] A sentencing court \"may suspend . . . sentence and place the defendant on probation\" if it is \"satisfied that the ends of justice and the best interest of the public as well as the defendant will be served thereby.\" 18 U.S.C. 3651. \"The probation service of the court shall make a presentence investigation and report to the court before the imposition of sentence or the granting of probation . . . .\" Rule 32 (c) (1), Fed.

New York, \n337 \nU.S. 241\n, where this Court held that there is no constitutional bar to setting a state criminal sentence on the basis of \"out-of-court information.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 19\n] \"If it appears to the Board of Parole from a report by the proper institutional officers or upon application by a prisoner eligible for release on parole, that there is a reasonable probability that such prisoner will live and remain at liberty without violating the laws, and if in the opinion of the Board such release is not incompatible with the welfare of society, the Board may in its discretion authorize the release of such prisoner on parole.\" 18 U.S.C. 4203 (a). Note also that only certain prisoners are eligible for this discretionary relief. 18 U.S.C. 4202.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 20\n] See Knauff v. Shaughnessy, \n338 \nU.S. 537\n, and Shaughnessy v. Mezei, \n345 \nU.S. 206\n, upholding a regulation of the Attorney General to a similar effect which had been promulgated prior to the existence of 235 (c) or any other such specific statutory authority.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 21\n] It is not claimed that a contrary construction would render the statute and regulation unconstitutional, or even that a substantial constitutional question would thereby arise. The thrust of the argument is rather that the statute should be construed liberally in favor of the alien as a matter of statutory interpretation. In any event, in this case we have not violated our normal rule of statutory interpretation that, where possible, constructions giving rise to doubtful constitutional validity should be avoided. That rule does not authorize a departure from clear meaning. E. g., United States v. Sullivan, \n332 \nU.S. 689, 693\n; Hopkins Federal Savings & Loan Assn. v. Cleary, \n296 \nU.S. 315, 334\n-335. Moreover, the constitutionality of 244 as herein interpreted gives us no difficulty. Cf. Williams v. New York, \n337 \nU.S. 241\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 22\n] Petitioner presents the claim that the decision of the special inquiry officer was void in that the \"so-called confidential matter . . . was of such a character that its consideration was not authorized by applicable regulations established by the Attorney General.\" See note 6, supra. To the extent that this is an allegation that the undisclosed information, if revealed, would not have been prejudicial to the public interest, petitioner is arguing that the decision violated 8 CFR, Rev. 1952, 244.3. The Board of Immigration Appeals, the District Court, and the Court of Appeals concluded, in effect, that the special inquiry officer found that the disclosure of the information would have been contrary to public interest, safety or security. We accept that finding. Nothing more is required by the regulation.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 23\n] The substance of this regulation is now incorporated in 235 (c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1225 (c). See pp. 356-357, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 24\n] See note 18, supra.\n\nMR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN, dissenting.\n\nIn conscience, I cannot agree with the opinion of the majority. It sacrifices to form too much of the American spirit of fair play in both our judicial and administrative processes.\n\nIn the interest of humanity, the Congress, in order to relieve some of the harshness of the immigration laws, gave the Attorney General discretion to relieve hardship in deportation cases. I do not believe it was \"an unfettered discretion,\" as stated in the opinion. It was an administrative discretion calling for a report to Congress on the manner of its use. The Attorney General, recognizing this, rightfully provided for an administrative hearing for the exercise of that discretion. On the other hand, he provided by his regulation that his numerous \n\n[351 \nU.S. 345, 362]\n\u00a0\n subordinate hearing officers might, in spite of a record clearly establishing a right to relief, deny that relief if, on the basis of undisclosed \"confidential\" information, the relief would in their opinion be \"prejudicial to the public interest, safety, or security.\" Such a hearing is not an administrative hearing in the American sense of the term. It is no hearing.\n\nYet, on the basis of such \"confidential\" information, after more than 40 years of residence here, we are tearing petitioner from his relatives and friends and from the country he fought to sustain,\n*\n when the record shows he has not offended against our laws, bears a good reputation, and would suffer great hardship if deported. Petitioner is not a citizen of the United States, but the Due Process Clause protects \"persons.\" To me, this is not due process. If sanction of this use and effect of \"confidential\" information is confirmed against this petitioner by a process of judicial reasoning, it may be recognized as a principle of law to be extended against American citizens in a myriad of ways.\n\nI am unwilling to write such a departure from American standards into the judicial or administrative process or to impute to Congress an intention to do so in the absence of much clearer language than it has used here.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Petitioner's only absence from this country since his original entry in 1914 was during World War I to serve in the Armed Forces of our neighbor and ally, the Dominion of Canada.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK, dissenting.\n\nThis is a strange case in a country dedicated by its founders to the maintenance of liberty under law. The petitioner, Cecil Reginald Jay, is being banished because he was a member of the Communist Party from 1935 to 1940. His Communist Party membership at that time did not violate any law. The Party was recognized then \n\n[351 \nU.S. 345, 363]\n\u00a0\n as a political organization and had candidates in many state elections. Jay's Communist Party membership ended 10 years before such membership was made a ground for deportation by Congress. 64 Stat. 1006-1008. It is for this past Communist membership, wholly legal when it existed, that Jay has been ordered deported.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nEven though an alien has been found to be deportable, Congress has provided a procedure which he can invoke to have his deportation suspended. 66 Stat. 163, 214-216, 8 U.S.C. 1254 (a) (5), 1254 (c). He is entitled to suspension \"in the discretion\" of the Attorney General if he \"proves\" that during the preceding 10 years he has been a person of good moral character and if deportation would result in exceptional and unusual hardship. The language of the statute plainly shows that an alien must be given an opportunity to \"prove\" these things if he can. This of course means that he must have a full and fair hearing. Jay asked to be allowed to give such proof and in fact proved his case to the complete satisfaction of the hearing officer who passed on it. But the hearing officer \"after considering confidential information\" refused to suspend deportation. The Board of Immigration Appeals dismissed Jay's appeal. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 345, 364]\n\u00a0\n\n\nJay is now 65 years of age. He came to this country from England for permanent residence in 1914. He has remained here ever since except for time he served in the army of our ally Canada during the First World War. Despite the Government's far-flung investigative network it has not been able to dig up one single incident of misconduct on the part of Jay during his entire 65 years which it is willing to produce in court.\n2\n That Jay is a person of good moral character and that his enforced exile from this country will work an \"exceptional and extremely unusual hardship\" have been found by the hearing officer.\n\nI agree with THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS that the Attorney General's regulation authorizing Jay and others like him to be deported upon alleged anonymous information should be held invalid as beyond the statutory power of the Attorney General. But a majority of the Court holds otherwise. This makes it necessary to consider the constitutionality of the use of anonymous information for such a purpose. In Footnote 21 of its opinion the Court states, somewhat as an aside, that \"the constitutionality of 244 as herein interpreted gives us no difficulty.\" In this easy fashion the Court disposes of a challenge to the power of Congress to banish people \n\n[351 \nU.S. 345, 365]\n\u00a0\n on information allegedly given federal officers by persons whose names are not revealed and whose statements (if made) are shrouded in the darkness which surrounds \"confidential information.\"\n\nWhat is meant by \"confidential information\"? According to officers of the Immigration Service it may be \"merely information we received off the street\"; or \"what might be termed as hearsay evidence, which could not be gotten into the record . . .\"; or \"information from persons who were in a position to give us the information that might be detrimental to the interests of the Service to disclose that person's name . . .\"; or \"such things, perhaps, as income-tax returns, or maybe a witness who didn't want to be disclosed, or where it might endanger their life, or something of that kind . . . .\"\n3\n No nation can remain true to the ideal of liberty under law and at the same time permit people to have their homes destroyed and their lives blasted by the slurs of unseen and unsworn informers. There is no possible way to contest the truthfulness of anonymous accusations. The supposed accuser can neither be identified nor interrogated. He may be the most worthless and irresponsible character in the community. What he said may be wholly malicious, untrue, unreliable, or inaccurately reported. In a court of law the triers of fact could not even listen to such gossip, much less decide the most trifling issue on it.\n\nThe Court today is not content with allowing exile on the basis of anonymous gossip. It holds that the hearing officer who condemned Jay could act in his \"unfettered discretion,\" subject only to review by the Board of Immigration Appeals. Of course the Court refers to the \n\n[351 \nU.S. 345, 366]\n\u00a0\n Attorney General's \"unfettered discretion,\" but participation of the Attorney General in this case is a fiction. The Court concedes in Note 8 of its opinion that the Attorney General does not personally exercise discretion in these cases. Therefore, the \"unfettered discretion\" to which the Court subjects persons like Jay is the unfettered discretion of inquiry officers of the Immigration Service, reviewable only by the Board of Immigration Appeals. Under our system of government there should be no way to subject the life and freedom of one individual to the \"unfettered\" or, more accurately, the \"arbitrary\" power of another. Article III of our Constitution and the Bill of Rights intend that people\n4\n shall not have valuable rights and privileges taken away from them by government unless the deprivation occurs after some kind of court proceeding where witnesses can be confronted and questioned and where the public can know that the rights of individuals are being protected.\n\nUnfortunately, this case is not the first one in recent years where arbitrary power has been approved and where anonymous information has been used to take away vital rights and privileges of people.\n5\n The Court disposes of what has been done to Jay to its satisfaction by saying that his right to stay here if he proves he is a good \n\n[351 \nU.S. 345, 367]\n\u00a0\n citizen \"comes as an act of grace,\" like \"probation or suspension of criminal sentence.\" But probation and suspension of criminal sentence come only after conviction of crime. Cf. Williams v. New York, \n337 \nU.S. 241\n. Here the Government with all of its resources has not been able to prove that Jay ever committed a crime of any kind. And Congress provided the suspension procedure so that one in Jay's situation could get special relief if he proved his good moral character. Viewed realistically this suspension procedure is an integral part of the process of deciding who shall be deported.\n\nNo amount of legal reasoning by the Court and no rationalization that can be devised can disguise the fact that the use of anonymous information to banish people is not consistent with the principles of a free country. Unfortunately there are some who think that the way to save freedom in this country is to adopt the techniques of tyranny. One technique which is always used to maintain absolute power in totalitarian government is the use of anonymous information by government against those who are obnoxious to the rulers.\n6\n In connection with another case like this\n7\n I referred to a statement made by the Roman Emperor Trajan to Pliny the Younger around the end of the First Century. Rome \n\n[351 \nU.S. 345, 368]\n\u00a0\n at that time was prosecuting the Christians for alleged subversive activities. Pliny expressed his doubts to Trajan as to the best method of handling the prosecutions. He wrote Trajan, \"An anonymous information was laid before me containing a charge against several persons, who upon examination denied they were Christians, or had ever been so. . . .\" Trajan replied, \"You have adopted the right course, my dearest Secundus, in investigating the charges against the Christians who were brought before you. . . . Anonymous informations ought not to be received in any sort of prosecution. It is introducing a very dangerous precedent, and is quite foreign to the spirit of our age.\"\n8\n\u00a0\n\nIt was also foreign to the brave spirit of the American age that gave birth to our constitutional system of courts with their comprehensive safeguards for fair public trials. In those courts a defendant's fate is to be determined by independent judges and juries who hear evidence given by witnesses in their presence and in the presence of the accused.\n9\n But this case shows how far we have departed from the carefully conceived plan to safeguard individual liberty. Although the Court today pays lip service to judicial review, a hearing officer's condemnation of Jay is held final and unreviewable. His condemnation is in open defiance of all the public testimony given, and rests exclusively on \"confidential information\" he claims to have received from unrevealed sources. Unfortunately this condemnation of Jay on anonymous information is not unusual - it manifests the popular fashion in these days of fear. Legal rationalizations\n10\n have been contrived \n\n[351 \nU.S. 345, 369]\n\u00a0\n to shift trials from constitutional courts to temporary removable appointees like the hearing officer who decided against Jay.\n11\n And when an accused rises to defend himself before such an officer he is met by a statement that \"We have evidence that you are guilty of something, but we cannot tell you what, nor who gave us the evidence.\" If, taking the Bill of Rights seriously, he complains, he is met by the rather impatient rejoinder that the Government's safety would be jeopardized by according him the kind of trial the Constitution commands.\n12\n But the core of our constitutional system is \n\n[351 \nU.S. 345, 370]\n\u00a0\n that individual liberty must never be taken away by shortcuts, that fair trials in independent courts must never be dispensed with. That system is in grave danger. This case emphasizes that fact. Prosecution of any sort on anonymous information is still too dangerous, just as it was when Trajan rejected it nearly two thousand years ago. Those who prize liberty would do well to ponder this.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The constitutionality of this Act authorizing deportation for conduct legal when it occurred was sustained in Galvan v. Press, \n347 \nU.S. 522\n. MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS and I dissented. On April 6, 1953, President Eisenhower sent a message to Senator Arthur V. Watkins calling attention to the harshness of the immigration laws which were used here to deport Jay. In listing \"injustices\" claimed to exist in the legislation President Eisenhower referred to: \"Deportation provisions that permit an alien to be deported at any time after entry, irrespective of how long ago he was involved, after entry, in an active or [sic] affiliation designated as `subversive.' Such alien is now subject to deportation even if his prior affiliation was terminated many years ago and he has since conducted himself as a model American.\" 99 Cong. Rec. 4321.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Included in the testimony for Jay was an affidavit by the Assistant Executive Director for the Seattle Housing Authority which employed him, stating: \"Mr. Jay was rated as one of the most conscientious and faithful employees of this Authority. His honesty was unquestioned. His interest in his work extended beyond the normal working hours and he was always willing to accept additional responsibilities without additional compensation. He was forthright in his opinions. His general moral character is evidenced by the fact that during his entire period of employment not one complaint was ever received from either the tenants or his fellow employees as to his relationships with people.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Hearings before House Subcommittee on Legal and Monetary Affairs of the Committee on Government Operations: Practices and Procedures of the Immigration and Naturalization Service in Deportation Proceedings, 84th Cong., 1st Sess. 18, 67, 138, 207.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The fact that Jay is an alien should not mean that he is outside the protection of the Constitution. As Mr. Justice Brewer said in dealing with whether aliens are protected by the first 10 Amendments: \"It is worthy of notice that in them the word `citizen' is not found. In some of them the descriptive word is `people,' but in the Fifth it is broader, and the word is `person,' and in the Sixth it is the `accused,' while in the Third, Seventh, and Eighth there is no limitation as to the beneficiaries suggested by any descriptive word.\" Fong Yue Ting v.

After the murderous purge of hundreds of German citizens Hitler said: \"If anyone reproaches me and asks why I did not resort to the regular courts of justice for conviction of the offenders, then all that I can say to him is this: in this hour I was responsible for the fate of the German people, and thereby I became the supreme Justiciar of the German people! \". . . If people bring against me the objection that only a judicial procedure could precisely weight the measure of the guilt and of its expiation, then against this view I lodge my most solemn protest. He who rises against Germany is a traitor to his country: and the traitor to his country is not to be punished according to the range and the extent of his act, but according to the purpose which that act has revealed.\" Speech delivered by Hitler in the Reichstag on 13 July 1934, 1 Hitler's Speeches (Baynes ed. 1942), 321-323. The Russian purges of the 1930's are reported to have been governed \n\n[351 \nU.S. 345, 370]\n\u00a0\n by a directive initiated by Stalin, which stated: \"I. Investigative agencies are directed to speed up the cases of those accused of the preparation or execution of acts of terror. \"II. Judicial organs are directed not to hold up the execution of death sentences pertaining to crimes of this category in order to consider the possibility of pardon, because the Presidium of the Central Executive Committee USSR does not consider as possible the receiving of petitions of this sort. \"III. The organs of the Commissariat of Internal Affairs are directed to execute the death sentences against criminals of the above-mentioned category immediately after the passage of sentences.\" Department of State Press Release, June 4, 1956, p. 15; Washington Post & Times Herald, June 6, 1956, p. 11, cols. 7-8.\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, dissenting.\n\nSince the petitioner was found deportable under the Act of Oct. 16, 1918, 40 Stat. 1012, 8 U.S.C. 137, as amended, 64 Stat. 1006, 1008, 8 U.S.C. (1946 ed., Supp. V) 137-3, his deportation would follow automatically had not Congress, in 244 (a) (5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, entrusted the Attorney General with the power of relaxing this dire consequence by suspending the deportation. 66 Stat. 163, 214, 8 U.S.C. 1254 (a) (5). This the Attorney General is authorized to do if the petitioner has been present in the United States for at least ten years since the grounds for his deportation arose, if he can prove that during all of such period he has been and is a person of good moral character, and, finally, if his deportation would, in the opinion of the Attorney General, \"result in exceptional and extremely \n\n[351 \nU.S. 345, 371]\n\u00a0\n unusual hardship.\" If the Attorney General finds that all three conditions are satisfied, he \"may, in his discretion, suspend deportation.\" Such is the feature of mitigation with which Congress qualified what obviously is, and was designed to be, a very drastic exercise of its constitutional power to turn aliens out of the country for some past misdeed, often unthinking foolishness, and, it may well be, long after genuine repentance and the evolution of the alien into a worthy member of society.\n\nBy this provision, Congress plainly responded to the dictates of humanity. But, just as Congress could have exercised to the utmost its power of constitutional severity, so it could appropriately define the mode for its alleviation. It has seen fit to make the Attorney General the agent for its quality of mercy, to be exercised by him \"in his discretion.\" The power of dispensation given the Attorney General he can, I have no doubt, withhold without accounting to anyone, and certainly without recourse to judicial review. Congress was evidently content to leave to the conscience of the chief law officer of the Government, the head of the Department of Justice, both the carrying out of its humane purpose and the protection of the public interest.\n\nIf the Attorney General's conscience is satisfied to act on considerations that he does not desire to expose to the light of day or to impart to an alien whose liberty may be at stake, thereby involving the fate of an innocent family. Congress leaves him free to do so. But Congress has not seen fit to invest his subordinates with such arbitrary authority over the lives of men.\n\nOne is not unmindful of the fact that the Attorney General is burdened with a vast range of duties, and that he, too, has only twenty-four hours in a day. To be sure, one of his predecessors in the administration of our immigration laws, President Taft's Secretary of Commerce and Labor, himself examined every deportation file in which \n\n[351 \nU.S. 345, 372]\n\u00a0\n an appeal was lodged. And Alfred E. Smith cannot have been the only Governor to read the records in the hundreds of applications that came before him each year for executive clemency. But, if in his wisdom the Attorney General devises a system for delegating the means for carrying out the responsibility for which Congress has given him discretion, he cannot also delegate his discretion. (That the nature of a delegated power may preclude redelegation, see, e. g., the Canadian case, Attorney-General of Canada v. Brent, (1956) 2 D. L. R. (2d) 503, affirming 1955. 3 D. L. R. 587.)\n\nIf the Attorney General devises, as he has devised, an administrative system for effectuating 244 (a) (5) of the Act of 1952, administrative arbitrariness is ruled out. If the Attorney General invokes the aid of administrative law, as he has done by establishing a procedure before a special inquiry officer of the Immigration and Naturalization Service and a review of that officer's decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals, these two agencies of administrative law cannot be authorized to defy the presuppositions of a fair hearing. The Attorney General may act on confidential information and Congress has left him to square it with his conscience. But he cannot shelter himself behind the appearance of legal procedure - a system of administrative law - and yet infuse it with a denial of what is basic to such a system. See, e. g., Ohio Bell Telephone Co. v. Public Utilities Comm'n, \n301 \nU.S. 292, 300\n.\n\nPresident Eisenhower has explained what is fundamental in any American code. A code devised by the Attorney General for determining human rights cannot be less than Wild Bill Hickok's code in Abilene, Kansas:\n\n \"It was: meet anyone face to face with whom you disagree. You could not sneak up on him from behind, or do any damage to him, without suffering the penalty of an outraged citizenry. If you met \n\n[351 \nU.S. 345, 373]\n\u00a0\n him face to face and took the same risks he did, you could get away with almost anything, as long as the bullet was in the front.\n\n\n \"And today, although none of you has the great fortune, I think, of being from Abilene, Kansas, you live after all by that same code, in your ideals and in the respect you give to certain qualities. In this country, if someone dislikes you, or accuses you, he must come up in front. He cannot hide behind the shadow. He cannot assassinate you or your character from behind, without suffering the penalties an outraged citizenry will impose.\" Press release of remarks of the President, on November 23, 1953, on receiving America's Democratic Legacy Award at dinner on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the Anti-Defamation League.\n\n\n For me, the philosophy embodied in these remarks rules the situation before us. The petitioner sustained the burden which the statute put upon him to prove himself deserving to remain in this country and to save his family from being disrupted. On the record, the Attorney General's special inquiry officer found that the respondent \"appears to be qualified for suspension of deportation,\" and this finding was not upset on appeal. But this finding for the petitioner was nullified on the basis of some \"confidential information.\" The petitioner had no means of meeting this \"confidential information.\" We can take judicial notice of the fact that in conspicuous instances, not negligible in number, such \"confidential information\" has turned out to be either baseless or false. There is no reason to believe that only these conspicuous instances illustrate the hazards inherent in taking action affecting the lives of fellow men on the basis of such information. The probabilities are to the contrary. A system of administrative law cannot justify itself on the assumption that the \"confidential information\" available \n\n[351 \nU.S. 345, 374]\n\u00a0\n to these inquiry officers and the Board of Appeals is impregnable or even likely to be true. When the Attorney General scrutinizes \"confidential information,\" at all events it is the Attorney General who does so. If he is unable to carry out the discretion vested solely in him to act on whatever he chooses to act upon, he must either devise a sifting process that meets the elementary decencies of procedure or advise Congress of his inability to carry out the extraordinary responsibility which it has reposed in him and not in his subordinates.\n\nI would reverse.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, dissenting.\n\nThe statement that President Eisenhower made in 1953 on the American code of fair play is more than interesting Americana. As my Brother FRANKFURTER says, it is Americana that is highly relevant to our present problem. The President said: \"In this country, if someone dislikes you, or accuses you, he must come up in front. He cannot hide behind the shadow. He cannot assassinate you or your character from behind, without suffering the penalties an outraged citizenry will impose.\"\n1\n\u00a0\n\n[351 \nU.S. 345, 375]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThat bit of Americana is relevant here because we have a question as to what a \"hearing\" is in the American meaning of the word. Fairness, implicit in our notions of due process, requires that any \"hearing\" be full and open with an opportunity to know the charge and the accusers, to reply to the charge, and to meet the accusers. And when Congress provides for a hearing, as it implicitly has in 244 of the present Act, it should be assumed that Congress has the same lively sense of the requirements of fair play as the Eisenhower code demands.\n\nThe philosophy of the full hearing, especially as it involves the right to meet the accusers, has been put in classical words by Professor Zechariah Chafee, Jr., in his recent book The Blessings of Liberty (1956), p. 35:\n\n \"One important benefit from confronting the suspect with his accusers is the opportunity to cross-examine them and rigorously test any dubious statement. As old Sir Matthew Hale says, it `beats and boults out the truth much better.' Add to that the old-fashioned value of putting people face to face out in the open. Accusers who secretly confer in private with an official or two and a couple of clerks may, as in Hale's time, `oftentimes deliver that which they will be ashamed to testify publicly.' An honest witness may feel quite differently when he has to repeat \n\n[351 \nU.S. 345, 376]\n\u00a0\n his story looking at the man whom he will harm greatly by distorting or mistaking the facts. He can now understand what sort of human being that man is. As for the false witness, the tribunal can learn ever so much more by looking at him than by reading an F. B. I. abstract of his story. The pathological liar and the personal enemy can no longer hide behind a piece of paper.\"\n\n\n And see Peters v. Hobby, \n349 \nU.S. 331, 350\n-352; O'Brian, National Security and Individual Freedom (1955), pp. 61-63.\n\nHarry P. Cain, member of the Subversive Activities Control Board, recently joined the President in endorsing this code of fair play:\n2\n\u00a0\n\n \"In all of our traditional efforts to protect the individual against oppression and false conviction by the state, we have relied basically and primarily on confrontation and cross-examination. By no other means can those who must judge their fellow man minimize to the fullest and desired extent the mistakes which humans make. Without recourse to these means, it is impossible for anyone accused of anything to protect himself fully against enemies whose evidence may consist of nothing more than malice, vindictiveness, mistaken identity, intolerance, prejudice, or a perverted desire to destroy.\"\n\n\n A hearing is not a hearing in the American sense if faceless informers or confidential information may be used to deprive a man of his liberty. That kind of hearing is so un-American that we should lean over backwards to avoid imputing to Congress a purpose to sanction it under 244.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The entire statement made at the B'Nai B'Rith Dinner in Washington, D.C., November 23, 1953, reads as follows: \"Why are we proud? We are proud, first of all, because from the beginning of this Nation, a man can walk upright, no matter who he is, or who she is. He can walk upright and meet his friend - or his enemy; and he does not feel that because that enemy may be in a position of great power that he can be suddenly thrown in jail to rot there without charges and with no recourse to justice. We have the habeas corpus act, and we respect it. \"I was raised in a little town of which most of you have never heard. But in the West it is a famous place. It is called Abilene, Kansas. We had as our Marshal for a long time a man named Wild Bill Hickock. If you don't know anything about him, read your Westerns more. Now that town had a code, and I was raised as a boy to prize that code. \"It was: meet anyone face to face with whom you disagree. You \n\n[351 \nU.S. 345, 375]\n\u00a0\n could not sneak up on him from behind, or do any damage to him, without suffering the penalty of an outraged citizenry. If you met him face to face and took the same risks he did, you could get away with almost anything, as long as the bullet was in the front. \"And today, although none of you has the great fortune, I think, of being from Abilene, Kansas, you live after all by that same code, in your ideals and in the respect you give to certain qualities. In this country, if someone dislikes you, or accuses you, he must come up in front. He cannot hide behind the shadow. He cannot assassinate you or your character from behind, without suffering the penalties an outraged citizenry will impose.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Address before New York Civil Liberties Union, New York City, February 22, 1956. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 345, 377]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","44":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJOHNSTON v. UNITED STATES(1956)\nNo. 643\nArgued: Decided: May 21, 1956\n\n\n\n\n These registrants under the Universal Military Training and Service Act were classified as conscientious objectors and were ordered by their local draft boards to report for civilian work at state hospitals located in judicial districts other than those in which they resided and were registered and where their orders were issued. They refused to report for work at the places designated, and each was indicted for a violation of 12 (a) of the Act. Held: The venue for their trials was in the judicial districts where the civilian work was to be performed - not in the judicial districts in which they resided and where their orders were issued. Pp. 216-223.\n\n (a) The general rule is that, where the crime charged is a failure to do a legally required act, the place fixed for its performance determines the situs of the crime. P. 220.\n\n\n (b) The possibility that registrants might be ordered to report to points remote from the situs of draft boards neither allows nor requires judicial changes in the law of venue. P. 220.\n\n\n (c) The venue requirements of Article III of the Constitution and the Sixth Amendment state the public policy that fixes the situs of a trial in the vicinage of the crime rather than where the accused is a resident; and a variation from the rule for the convenience of the prosecution or the accused is not justified. Pp. 220-221.\n\n\n 227 F.2d 745, affirmed.\n\n 229 F.2d 257, reversed.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Together with No. 704, United States v.

With him on the brief were Solicitor General Sobeloff, Assistant Attorney General Olney and Beatrice Rosenberg.\n\nMR. JUSTICE REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThese two cases concern the prosecution of three defendants for violations of the provisions of the Universal Military Training and Service Act. 50 U.S.C. App. 451 et seq. We must determine the proper venue for the trial of these crimes.\n\nDefendants Johnston and Sokol resided in the Western Judicial District of Pennsylvania and registered there with the local draft boards. Both were classified 1-O (Conscientious objectors) and both were ordered to report to the boards for assignment of civilian work in lieu of induction. They were instructed to report to separate state hospitals situated in the Eastern Judicial District of Pennsylvania. They reported to the boards but personally refused to comply with the instructions. They were indicted in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and the indictments were dismissed for lack of jurisdiction on the ground that venue could only be in the Western District. 131 F. Supp. 955. The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed and remanded the case for trial. That court reasoned that venue was where the defendants failed to report. 227 F.2d 745.\n\nDefendant Patteson, likewise classified 1-O, was ordered to report to his local board in Oklahoma for similar assignment. He, too, reported to the board and there personally refused to comply with instructions to report at the Topeka, Kansas, State Hospital. After indictment in Kansas, the Kansas District Court ordered the case transferred to Oklahoma under Rule 21 (b), Fed. Rules \n\n[351 \nU.S. 215, 217]\n\u00a0\n Crim. Proc.\n1\n The Oklahoma court retransferred the case to Kansas as it thought the venue was there. The Kansas court thereupon dismissed the indictment on the ground that the venue was in Oklahoma. 132 F. Supp. 67. The judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. 229 F.2d 257.\n\nEach registrant received an order, the pertinent parts of which follow:\n\n   \"SELECTIVE SERVICE SYSTEM\n\n\n\"ORDER TO REPORT FOR CIVILIAN WORK AND STATEMENT OF EMPLOYER\n\n.   .   .   .  .\n\n\n\n\"You are ordered to report to the local board named above at m. on the _______ day of ________, 195_, where you will be given instructions to proceed to the place of employment.\n\n\n\"You are ordered to report for employment pursuant to the instructions of the local board, to remain in employment for twenty-four (24) consecutive months or until such time as you are released or transferred by proper authority.\n\n\n\"You will be instructed as to your duties at the place of employment.\n\n\n\"Failure to report at the hour and on the day named in this order, or to proceed to the place of employment pursuant to instructions, or to remain in this employment \n\n[351 \nU.S. 215, 218]\n\u00a0\n the specified time will constitute a violation of the Universal Military Training and Service Act, as amended, which is punishable by fine or imprisonment or both.\n\n ........................................   \"(Clerk or Member of the Local Board)\n\n\n  \"STATEMENT OF EMPLOYER\n\n\n.   .   .   .  .\n\n\n\"Failed to report\n\n\n   .................................     \"Personnel Director\"\n2\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n None of the registrants entered the district of his indictment after receiving his orders.\n\nThe indictment in each case charges the registrant, a conscientious objector,\n3\n with violation of 12 (a) of the Act.\n4\n In the Johnston indictment the pertinent language is:\n\n\". . . did knowingly neglect to perform a duty imposed upon him by the provision of said Act in that \n\n[351 \nU.S. 215, 219]\n\u00a0\n he failed and refused to obey an order of Local Board 87, New Castle, Pennsylvania, directing him to report for employment at Norristown State Hospital, Norristown, Pennsylvania, and to remain employed there for twenty-four consecutive months in violation of Title 50, U.S.C. Appx., Sections 456 and 462, as amended.\"\n\n\n In the Sokol case it is:\n\n\". . . did knowingly neglect to perform a duty . . . in that he failed to report to the Philadelphia State Hospital, . . . for assignment to perform civilian work contributing to the maintenance of the national health, safety or interest, in lieu of induction; in violation of Title 50 Appx. Secs. 456 (j) and 462.\"\n\n\n In the Patteson case it is:\n\n\". . . did knowingly and willfully refuse, neglect and fail to report at the Topeka State Hospital at the time and place so designated in said order.\"\n\n\n The question at issue in these three cases is fairly presented by the registrants Johnston and Sokol in their petition for certiorari. It reads thus:\n\n \"Where each petitioner resided in the Western District of Pennsylvania, the Selective Service local board of each was located in the Western District of Pennsylvania, the orders to perform work were issued in the Western District of Pennsylvania and each petitioner did not go beyond his local board in the Western District of Pennsylvania and at all times refused to leave the Western District of Pennsylvania \n\n[351 \nU.S. 215, 220]\n\u00a0\n and did not proceed to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, were the offenses committed in the Western District of Pennsylvania and not in the Eastern District and, therefore, does it violate rights guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution to indict and prosecute each petitioner in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania?\"\n\n\n Our analysis of the law and the facts in these cases convinces us that the venue of these violations of the orders lies in the district where the civilian work was to be performed, that is, for Patteson in Kansas, and the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for Johnston and Sokol.\n\nWe are led to this conclusion by the general rule that where the crime charged is a failure to do a legally required act, the place fixed for its performance fixes the situs of the crime.\n5\n The possibility that registrants might be ordered to report to points remote from the situs of draft boards neither allows nor requires judicial changes in the law of venue. No showing of any arbitrary action appears in these cases. Article III of the Constitution and the Sixth Amendment fix venue \"in the State\" and \"district wherein the crime shall have been committed.\" The venue of trial is thereby predetermined, but those provisions do not furnish guidance for determination of the place of the crime. That place is determined by the acts of the accused that violate a statute. This requirement of venue states the public policy that fixes the situs of the trial in the vicinage of the crime rather than the \n\n[351 \nU.S. 215, 221]\n\u00a0\n residence of the accused. Cf. United States v. Anderson, \n328 \nU.S. 699, 705\n. A variation from that rule for convenience of the prosecution or the accused is not justified. The result would be delay and confusion.\n6\n\u00a0\n\nThis rule was followed in United States v. Johnson, \n323 \nU.S. 273\n, relied on by the registrants, where a maker and shipper of dentures mailed in Illinois was charged in Delaware, the State of receipt by a consignee, with violating the law by \"use\" of the mails \"for the purpose of sending or bringing into\" a State such dentures. Id., at 274. This Court, by interpretation of the statute, restricted prosecution of the shipper to the State of the shipment saying:\n\n\"It is a reasonable and not a strained construction to read the statute to mean that the crime of the sender is complete when he uses the mails in Chicago, and the crime of the unlicensed dentist in California or Florida or Delaware, who orders the dentures from Chicago, is committed in the State into which he brings the dentures. As a result, the trial of the sender is restricted to Illinois and that of the unlicensed dentist to Delaware or Florida or California.\" Id., at 277-278.\n7\n\u00a0\n\n\n Venue for these prosecutions lies where, under 12 (a), supra, the registrants did \"knowingly fail or neglect or refuse to perform any duty required of him under or in the execution of this title . . ., or rules, regulations, or directions made pursuant to this title . . . .\" These registrants \n\n[351 \nU.S. 215, 222]\n\u00a0\n were made subject to 12 (a) by 6 (j), which declares that a conscientious objector who fails or neglects to obey an order of his local board shall be deemed to have \"failed or neglected to perform a duty required of him\" by 12.\n8\n\u00a0\n\nThe orders set out above, p. 217, could only be the basis of one conviction but they directed the registrant to perform two duties. The first is to report to the local board. This was done by each registrant. The second is to report for employment and to remain there in employment for 24 consecutive months. The \"instructions to proceed\" given by the board and the statement that \"failure . . . to proceed to the place of employment pursuant to instructions\" would constitute a crime, are for the registrant's information. They did not create another duty. This appears emphatically from the characterization in the explanatory paragraph that failure to report or proceed to the place of employment would be a violation of orders. The crimes charged arise from failure to complete the second duty - report for employment. Accordingly venue must lie where the failure occurred. See cases cited above, n. 5.\n\nIt will be noted that the indictments set out the place of the alleged crimes in the terms of the orders and give jurisdiction for trial in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and the District of Kansas. In each instance, the charge is failure to perform a \"duty\" in that the registrant \n\n[351 \nU.S. 215, 223]\n\u00a0\n failed \"to report\" to the respective hospitals. Thus, the indictments, based on the charged violation of the order, follow, as we see it, the requirements of law for trial in the State and district where the crime was committed.\n\nWe affirm the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in No. 643, Johnston and Sokol, and reverse the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in No. 704, the Patteson case.\n\n     No. 643, affirmed.\n\n\n     No. 704, reversed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"(b) OFFENSE COMMITTED IN TWO OR MORE DISTRICTS OR DIVISIONS. The court upon motion of the defendant shall transfer the proceeding as to him to another district or division, if it appears from the indictment or information or from a bill of particulars that the offense was committed in more than one district or division and if the court is satisfied that in the interest of justice the proceeding should be transferred to another district or division in which the commission of the offense is charged.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The stipulations in the Johnston and Sokol cases show the use of this form.

United States, \n329 \nU.S. 338\n, that Dodez had exhausted his administrative remedies and therefore could defend on indictment his failure when he violated an order to report to the local board for work of national importance. Venue was laid in the District of the Board. No question was raised or decided here as to venue. Petition for certiorari, p. 2; Brief of the United States. Furthermore, as the United States points out in this case, at the time of Dodez' breach, the Government delivered the conscientious objector registrants to the place of work. See Order to Report for work, R. 155, No. 86, 1946 Term.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE BLACK concur, dissenting.\n\nPatteson, who lives in Oklahoma and defied his draft board there, is required to stand trial in Kansas. Johnston and Sokol, who live in the Western District of Pennsylvania and defied their draft board there, are forced by this decision to stand trial in the Eastern District. Yet each defied the law at home, not in the distant place. Unlike United States v. Anderson, \n328 \nU.S. 699\n, no act of any kind was committed in the distant district. Unlike Rumely v. McCarthy, \n250 \nU.S. 283\n, and United States v. Lombardo, \n241 \nU.S. 73\n, Congress has not specifically selected the failure to perform an act in the distant district and made it a crime. The statutory crime is the failure of a conscientious objector, directed to perform civilian work, \"to obey any such order from his local board.\" 62 Stat. 612, as amended, 65 Stat. 86, 50 U.S.C. App. 456 (j). The argument in the case has been like a theological debate over the number of angels who can stand on the head of a pin. Of course, the duty to obey can be divided up into a whole series of duties. But, when the registrant is adamant in his refusal to budge from his home town and stays at home defying the local authorities, the crime he has committed has been committed at home. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 215, 224]\n\u00a0\n\n\nAny doubts should be resolved in favor of the citizen. We should construe the statute against two historic constitutional provisions. Article III, 2, cl. 3, provides that \"The Trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury; and such Trial shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed within any State, the Trial shall be at such Place or Places as the Congress may by Law have directed.\" And the Sixth Amendment guarantees an accused \"a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law . . . .\" While we have here a statutory problem, not a constitutional one, the history of the two constitutional guarantees throws light on the problem of venue. When the British Parliament proposed taking Americans abroad or to another colony for trial, the Virginia Resolves of May 16, 1769, voiced the unanimous view that \"thereby the inestimable Privilege of being tried by a Jury from the Vicinage, as well as the Liberty of summoning and producing Witnesses on such Trial, will be taken away from the party accused.\"\n*\n\u00a0\n\nThe boys in the present cases suffer comparably. For their defiance of their local boards they are sent to distant places for trial where they have no friends, where they are unknown, and to which all witnesses must be transported. Congress would have the power to fix the venue there. But it has not done so unambiguously. Cf. United States v. Midstate Co., \n306 \nU.S. 161, 166\n; United States v. Johnson, \n323 \nU.S. 273, 276\n. I would read the statute with an eye to history and try the offenders at home where our forefathers thought that normally men would receive the fairest trial.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Journals of the House of Burgesses of Virginia, 1766-1769, p. 214. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 215, 225]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","45":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKINSELLA v.

She was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment. 10 C. M. R. 350. Her conviction was affirmed by the Board of Review, 17 C. M. R. 314, and the Court of Military Appeals, 5 U.S.C. M. A. 314, and she began serving her sentence in the Federal Reformatory for Women, Alderson, West Virginia.\n\nThereafter, a petition for a writ of habeas corpus was filed on Mrs. Smith's behalf by her father, respondent herein. The petition alleged that the court-martial had no jurisdiction to try Mrs. Smith because Article 2 (11) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice violates both Art. III, 2, and Amendment VI of the Federal Constitution, which guarantee the right to trial by jury to a civilian. The United States District Court for the \n\n[351 \nU.S. 470, 473]\n\u00a0\n Southern District of West Virginia issued a preliminary writ. After a hearing, which included the submission of briefs and unlimited oral argument, the writ was discharged and Mrs. Smith was remanded to the custody of the Warden. 137 F. Supp. 806. In order to expedite the determination of the case, the Government itself sought certiorari while an appeal was pending before the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. We granted review on March 12, 1956, \n350 \nU.S. 986\n, because of the serious constitutional question presented and its farreaching importance to our Armed Forces stationed in some sixty-three different countries throughout the world. We agree with the decision of the District Court.\n\nIn its entirety, Art. 2 (11), 50 U.S.C. 552, provides that:\n\n \"The following persons are subject to this chapter:\n\n\n .  .  .  .   .\n\n\n \"(11) Subject to the provisions of any treaty or agreement to which the United States is or may be a party or to any accepted rule of international law, all persons serving with, employed by, or accompanying the armed forces without the continental limits of the United States and without the following territories: That part of Alaska east of longitude one hundred and seventy-two degrees west, the Canal Zone, the main group of the Hawaiian Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. . . .\"\n\n\n Mrs. Smith comes squarely within the terms of this provision. As a military dependent, she had accompanied her husband beyond the continental limits of the United States. Prior to her husband's death they lived together in Washington Heights, an American community in Tokyo composed exclusively of American servicemen and their dependents. Japan, at the time of the offense, had ceded to the United States \"exclusive jurisdiction over all \n\n[351 \nU.S. 470, 474]\n\u00a0\n offenses which may be committed in Japan by members of the United States armed forces, the civilian component, and their dependents . . . .\" Art. XVII, 3 UST (Part 3) 3354. Since Article 2 (11) concededly applies to this case if it was within the power of Congress to enact, the constitutionality of that provision is the sole question presented. Essentially, we are to determine only whether the civilian dependent of an American serviceman authorized to accompany him on foreign duty may constitutionally be tried by an American military court-martial in a foreign country for an offense committed in that country.\n\nTrials by court-martial are governed by the Uniform Code of Military Justice, 64 Stat. 109, 50 U.S.C. 551 et seq. The Code was carefully drawn by Congress to include the fundamental guarantees of due process, and in operation it has provided a fair and enlightened system of justice. However, courts-martial are not required to provide all the protections of constitutional courts; therefore, to try by court-martial a civilian entitled to trial in an Article III court is a violation of the Constitution. Toth v. Quarles, \n350 \nU.S. 11\n. Accordingly, our first inquiry is directed to the question whether, as a matter of constitutional right, an American citizen outside of the continental limits of the United States and in a foreign country is entitled to trial before an Article III court for an offense committed in that country.\n\nIn making this determination, we are not faced with the question \"whether the Constitution is operative, for that is self-evident, but whether the provision relied on is applicable.\"\n2\n Entirely aside from the power of Congress \n\n[351 \nU.S. 470, 475]\n\u00a0\n under Article III of the Constitution, it has been well-established since Chief Justice Marshall's opinion in American Insurance Co. v. Canter, 1 Pet. 511, that Congress may establish legislative courts outside the territorial limits of the United States proper. The procedure in such tribunals need not comply with the standards prescribed by the Constitution for Article III courts. In cases arising from Hawaii,\n3\n the Philippines,\n4\n and Puerto Rico,\n5\n this Court has recognized the power of Congress to enact a system of laws which did not provide for trial by jury. By 1922 it was regarded as \"clearly settled\" that the jury provisions of Article III and the Sixth and Seventh Amendments \"do not apply to territory belonging to the United States which has not been incorporated into the Union.\" Balzac v. Porto Rico, \n258 \nU.S. 298, 304\n-305.\n\nIn an earlier case, this Court had sustained the constitutionality of an Act of Congress which created consular courts to try, pursuant to treaties, American citizens for crimes committed in Japan, China, and other countries. In re Ross, \n140 \nU.S. 453\n. Ross, an American seaman convicted of murder by a consular court in Yokohama, Japan, contended that he had been deprived of his constitutional right to both grand and petit juries. In rejecting this claim, the Court pointed out that these constitutional guarantees were not applicable to a consular court sitting outside the continental United States. \n140 \nU.S., at 464\n. Recounting the long-established practice of governments to provide \"for the exercise of judicial authority in other countries by [their] officers appointed to reside therein,\" id., at 463, the Court noted that the requirement of a grand and petit jury in these circumstances \"would defeat the main purpose of investing the \n\n[351 \nU.S. 470, 476]\n\u00a0\n consul with judicial authority.\" \n140 \nU.S., at 465\n. In 1929, citing Ross with approval in Ex parte Bakelite Corp., \n279 \nU.S. 438, 451\n, this Court reaffirmed the doctrine that \"legislative courts . . . exercise their functions within particular districts in foreign territory and are invested with a large measure of jurisdiction over American citizens in those districts. The authority of Congress to create them and to clothe them with such jurisdiction has been upheld by this Court and is well recognized.\" These cases establish beyond question that the Constitution does not require trial before an Article III court in a foreign country for offenses committed there by an American citizen and that Congress may establish legislative courts for this purpose.\n\nHaving determined that one in the circumstances of Mrs. Smith may be tried before a legislative court established by Congress,\n6\n we have no need to examine the power of Congress \"To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces\" under Article I of the Constitution. If it is reasonable and consonant with due process for Congress to employ the existing system of courts-martial for this purpose, the enactment must be sustained.\n\nIn the present day, we, as a Nation, have found it necessary to the preservation of our security to maintain American forces in some sixty-three foreign countries. The practical necessity of allowing these men to be \n\n[351 \nU.S. 470, 477]\n\u00a0\n accompanied by their families where possible has been recognized by Congress as well as the services, and the result has been the creation of American communities of mixed civilian and military population at bases throughout the world. In all matters of substance, the lives of military and civilian personnel alike are geared to the local military organization which provides their living accommodations, medical facilities and transportation from and to the United States. We could not find it unreasonable for Congress to conclude that all should be governed by the same legal standard to the end that they receive equal treatment under law. The effect of a double standard might well create sufficient unrest and confusion to result in the destruction of effective law enforcement.\n7\n By the enactment of Article 2 (11) of the Code, Congress has provided that all shall be subject to the same system of justice and that the military commander who bears full responsibility for the care and safety of those civilians attached to his command shall also have authority to regulate their conduct.\n\nIt was conceded before this Court that Congress could have established, or might yet establish, a system of territorial or consular courts to try offenses committed by \n\n[351 \nU.S. 470, 478]\n\u00a0\n civilian dependents abroad. While this would be within the power of Congress, In re Ross, supra, clearly nothing in the Constitution compels it. The power to create a territorial or consular court does not preclude, but must necessarily include, the power to provide for trial before a military tribunal unless that alternative is \"so clearly arbitrary or capricious that legislators acting reasonably could not have believed it necessary or appropriate for the public welfare.\"\n8\n The choice among different types of legislative tribunals is peculiarly within the power of Congress, Ex parte Bakelite Corp., \n279 \nU.S. 438, 451\n, and we are concerned only with the constitutionality, not the wisdom, of this choice.\n\nIn selecting the Uniform Code of Military Justice, Congress might have sought to avoid needless and potentially harmful duplication of a legal system already extant in every foreign nation where our troops are stationed. On the other hand, Congress could well have determined that the Code was adequate to the purpose to be achieved and would afford more safeguards to an accused than any other available procedure. The Code is a uniform system of legal procedure, applicable beyond any constitutional question to all servicemen stationed abroad. It was adopted by Congress only after an exhaustive study of several years duration and the consultation of acknowledged authorities in the fields of constitutional and military law.\n9\n In addition to the fundamentals of due process, it includes protections which this Court has not required a State to provide\n10\n and some procedures which would \n\n[351 \nU.S. 470, 479]\n\u00a0\n compare favorably with the most advanced criminal codes. We find no constitutional defect in the fact that the Code does not provide for indictment by grand jury or trial by petit jury. In these respects it does not differ from the procedures specifically approved by this Court in other types of legislative courts established abroad by Congress. In re Ross, supra; Hawaii v. Mankichi, \n190 \nU.S. 197\n; Dorr v. United States, \n195 \nU.S. 138\n; Balzac v. Porto Rico, supra.\n\nFurthermore, since under the principles of international law each nation has jurisdiction of the offenses committed within its own territory, Schooner Exchange v. McFaddon, 7 Cranch 116, 136, the essential choice involved here is between an American and a foreign trial. Foreign nations have relinquished jurisdiction to American military authorities only pursuant to carefully drawn agreements which presuppose prompt trial by existent authority.\n11\n Absent the effective exercise of jurisdiction thus obtained, there is no reason to suppose that the nations involved would not exercise their sovereign right to try and punish for offenses committed within their borders. Under these circumstances, Congress may well have determined that trial before an American court-martial in which the fundamentals of due process are assured was preferable to leaving American servicemen and their dependents throughout the world subject to widely varying standards of justice unfamiliar to our people.\n12\n\u00a0\n\n[351 \nU.S. 470, 480]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe note that this case presents no problem of the jurisdiction of a military court-martial sitting within the territorial limits of the United States or the power of Congress to provide for trial of Americans sojourning, touring, or temporarily residing abroad. No question of the legal relation between treaties and the Constitution is presented. On the question before us, we find no constitutional bar to the power of Congress to enact Article 2 (11) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.\n\nThe judgment is\n\n       Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Relevant portions of the administrative agreement are:    \"Article IX \"1. The United States shall have the right to bring into Japan for purposes of this Agreement persons who are members of the United States armed forces, the civilian component, and their dependents. .  .  .  .  .   \"Article XVII \"1. Upon the coming into force with respect to the United States of the `Agreement between the Parties to the North Atlantic Treaty regarding the Status of their Forces', signed at London on June 19, 1951, the United States will immediately conclude with Japan, at the option of Japan, an agreement on criminal jurisdiction similar to the corresponding provisions of that Agreement. \"2. Pending the coming into force with respect to the United States of the North Atlantic Treaty Agreement referred to in paragraph 1, the United States service courts and authorities shall have the right to exercise within Japan exclusive jurisdiction over all offenses which may be committed in Japan by members of the United States armed forces, the civilian component, and their dependents, excluding their dependents who have only Japanese nationality. Such jurisdiction may in any case be waived by the United States. .   .  .  .  . \"4. The United States undertakes that the United States service courts and authorities shall be willing and able to try and, on conviction, to punish all offenses against the laws of Japan which members of the United States armed forces, civilian component, \n\n[351 \nU.S. 470, 472]\n\u00a0\n and their dependents may be alleged on sufficient evidence to have committed in Japan, and to investigate and deal appropriately with any alleged offense committed by members of the United States armed forces, the civilian component, and their dependents, which may be brought to their notice by Japanese authorities or which they may find to have taken place. The United States further undertakes to notify the Japanese authorities of the disposition made by United States service courts of all cases arising under this paragraph. The United States shall give sympathetic consideration to a request from Japanese authorities for a waiver of its jurisdiction in cases arising under this paragraph where the Japanese Government considers such waiver to be of particular importance. Upon such waiver, Japan may exercise its own jurisdiction. \"5. In the event the option referred to in paragraph 1 is not exercised by Japan, the jurisdiction provided for in paragraph 2 and the following paragraphs shall continue in effect. In the event the said North Atlantic Treaty Agreement has not come into effect within one year from the effective date of this Agreement, the United States will, at the request of the Japanese government, reconsider the subject of jurisdiction over offenses committed in Japan by members of the United States armed forces, the civilian component, and their dependents.\" 3 UST (Part 3) 3346, 3353-3356.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Mr. Justice White concurring in Downes v.

Quarles, supra, where the defendant, after discharge from military service and return to this country, was entitled to trial before an Article III court, and we found \"no excuse for new expansion of court-martial jurisdiction at the expense of the normal and constitutionally preferable system of trial by jury.\" \n350 \nU.S., at 22\n-23. In Toth we found that Article 3 (a) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice \"necessarily encroaches on the jurisdiction of federal courts set up under Article III of the Constitution.\" \n350 \nU.S., at 15\n. No like constitutional bar exists in the present case.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] One need only consider the disruptive effect of establishing another type of legislative court to deal with the same offenses in the same territorial jurisdiction as the military tribunals. In cases of conspiracy or joint crime, parallel trials would have to be held in separate courts. Since the trials could not proceed at the same time, one would of necessity precede and influence the other, and results could understandably be disparate. Nor is the problem of insignificant proportions. Reliable figures show that our Armed Forces overseas are accompanied by approximately a quarter of a million dependents and civilian workers. Figures relating to the Army alone show that in the 6 fiscal years from July 1, 1949, to June 30, 1955, a total of 2,280 civilians were tried by courts-martial. While it is true that the vast majority of these prosecutions were for minor offenses, the volume alone shows the serious problem that would be presented by the administration of a dual system of courts.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Mr. Justice Brandeis dissenting in Burns Baking Co. v.

Rev. 1091; Re, The NATO Status of Forces Agreement and International Law, 50 N. W. U. L. Rev. 349.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] It has been suggested that bringing American citizens to this country for trial for offenses committed abroad may be a preferable solution even if it is not required by the Constitution. Congress \n\n[351 \nU.S. 470, 480]\n\u00a0\n might well have concluded that this suggestion was completely impractical. First, a condition precedent to trial in this country would be the consent of the foreign nation concerned in each individual case. This consent could always be withheld and it is likely that foreign nations would refuse to cede jurisdiction over serious offenses when trial might be held many thousands of miles away. Even where jurisdiction was obtained, the deterrent effect of such prosecutions might well be vitiated by the distance and delay involved. Secondly, both the Government and the accused would face serious problems in the production of witnesses. Depositions for the Government are not permitted in criminal cases. See Rule 15, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Attendance of foreign witnesses could be only on a voluntary basis and the testimony of no foreign witness could be compelled if the witness or his government refused. The expense of transporting witnesses would be considerable for the Government and probably impossible for a defendant, whose successful defense may depend on the demeanor of one witness. In fairness, the Government would have to bear the expense of transporting the defendant's witnesses as well as its own, and the possibilities of abuse are obvious. Finally, a breakdown of the figures on trial by courts-martial of civilians abroad from 1950-1955 shows that some 2,000 of the 2,280 cases tried involved offenses for which the maximum punishment was six months or less. The Government might be unwilling to undergo the heavy expense and inconvenience of trial here for such minor offenses. The alternatives would be either trial by the foreign country or no trial at all; the result must be the practical abdication of American judicial authority, precisely what Congress wished to avoid. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 470, 481]\n\u00a0\n\n\nReservation of MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER.Fn\n\nThe Court today sustains Mrs. Clarice B. Covert's conviction by a general court-martial in England for the murder of her husband, a sergeant in the United States Air Force, and the conviction of Mrs. Dorothy Krueger Smith by a general court-martial in Japan for the murder of her husband, a colonel in the United States Army. The Court does so, although it announces that \"we have no need to examine the power of Congress `To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces' under Article I of the Constitution.\" The plain inference from this is that the Court is not prepared to support the constitutional basis upon which the Covert and Smith courts-martial were instituted and the convictions were secured.\n\nThe Uniform Code of Military Justice which governed these proceedings, and the international arrangements with England and Japan whereby the United States was allowed to exercise jurisdiction over the alleged crimes, are concerned with, directed toward, and explicitly acknowledged as legal measures that had their source in, and were obviously to be an exercise of, the constitutional power of Congress \"To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces.\" As provided by the Uniform Code of Military Justice, Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Covert were tried as though they were members of the Armed Forces. In view of this Court's opinion in Toth v. Quarles, \n350 \nU.S. 11\n, and the fact that the Constitution \"clearly distinguishes the military from the civil class as separate communities\" and \"recognizes no third class which is part civil and part military - military for a particular purpose or in a particular \n\n[351 \nU.S. 470, 482]\n\u00a0\n situation, and civil for all other purposes and in all other situations . . .,\" Winthrop, Military Law and Precedents (2d ed. 1896), 145, the Court's failure to rest its decision upon the congressional power \"To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces\" is significant.\n\nHaving put out of consideration reliance on the immediately pertinent constitutional provision bearing on the difficulties raised by these cases, the Court sustains the convictions by two lines of argument that obviously have nothing whatever to do with the regulation of the Armed Forces of the United States. The Court relies on In re Ross, \n140 \nU.S. 453\n, a case that represents, historically and juridically, an episode of the dead past about as unrelated to the world of today as the one-hoss shay is to the latest jet airplane. In complete disregard of the political and legal sources purporting to render women like Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Covert amenable to military courts-martial for crimes committed abroad, the Court draws on the system of capitulations whereby Western countries, including the United States, compelled powerless Eastern and Asiatic nations to surrender their authority over conduct within their confines by citizens of these Western nations to the rule of Western \"consular courts.\" The Eastern nations were made to yield because \"of the barbarous and cruel punishments inflicted in those countries, and the frequent use of torture to enforce confession from parties accused . . . .\" In re Ross, supra, at 463. I do not suppose that the arrangements by which Great Britain and Japan gave the United States jurisdiction over the murders with which Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Covert were charged are to be deemed concessions wrung by the United States as were the capitulations wrung, often by force, from the Ottoman Empire and other \n\n[351 \nU.S. 470, 483]\n\u00a0\n Eastern nations because they were deemed inferior by the West, long ago and far away.\n*\n\u00a0\n\nThe Court derives its second line of argument from the decisions of this Court which have evolved the power of Congress to deal with territory acquired by purchase or through war, beginning with the statute of 1822, which set up the government of Florida. See American Insurance Co. v. Canter, 1 Pet. 511. I must confess inability to appreciate the bearing of the series of complicated adjudications dealing with the difficult problems relating to \"organized\" and \"unorganized\" territories of the United States to legislation by Congress treating civilians accompanying members of the Armed Forces abroad as though they were part of the Armed Forces and therefore amenable to the Code of Military Justice.\n\nGrave issues affecting the status of American civilians throughout the world are raised by these cases; they are made graver by the arguments on which the Court finds it necessary to rely in reaching its result. Doubtless because of the pressure under which the Court works during its closing weeks, these arguments have been merely adumbrated in its opinion. To deal adequately with them, however, demands of those to whom they are not persuasive more time than has been available to examine \n\n[351 \nU.S. 470, 484]\n\u00a0\n and to analyze in detail the historical underpinning and implication of the cases relied upon by the Court, as a preliminary to a searching critique of their relevance to the problems now before the Court. For the moment, it must suffice, by way of example, to indicate that by resorting to In re Ross the Court has torn from its historical context an institution - the consular court - that had a totally different source and a totally different purpose than the source and purpose of Art. 2 (11) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, 64 Stat. 107, 109. A glimpse into the international environment and political assumptions out of which the consular court system derived and of which it was a part suffices to indicate the scope of the inquiry for which the Court's opinion calls. Such a glimpse is afforded by the justification for consular courts urged by the Government on this Court 65 years ago. Reliance was placed on this authoritative view of Secretary of State Hamilton Fish:\n\n \"A report made to Congress by my predecessor, Mr. Seward . . . shows that it has been the habit of this Department to regard the judicial power of our consular officers in Japan as resting upon the assent of the Government of that kingdom, whether expressed by formal convention or by tacit acquiescence in the notorious practice of the consular courts. In other words, they were esteemed somewhat in the same light as they would have been if they were constituted by the Mikado with American citizens as judges, and with all the authority with which a Japanese tribunal is invested in respect to the native subjects of Japan, to the extent that our Government will admit a jurisdiction understood to be extremely arbitrary. They were, so to speak, the agents of a depotism [sic], only restrained by such safeguards as \n\n[351 \nU.S. 470, 485]\n\u00a0\n our own Government may interpose for the protection of citizens who come within its sway.\" Brief for the United States, p. 25, In re Ross, \n140 \nU.S. 453\n.\n\n\n Time is required not only for the primary task of analyzing in detail the materials on which the Court relies. It is equally required for adequate reflection upon the meaning of these materials and their bearing on the issues now before the Court. Reflection is a slow process. Wisdom, like good wine, requires maturing.\n\nMoreover, the judgments of this Court are collective judgments. They are neither solo performances nor debates between two sides, each of which has its mind quickly made up and then closed. The judgments of this Court presuppose full consideration and reconsideration by all of the reasoned views of each. Without adequate study there cannot be adequate reflection. Without adequate reflection there cannot be adequate deliberation and discussion. And without these, there cannot be that full interchange of minds which is indispensable to wise decision and its persuasive formulation.\n\nThe circumstances being what they are, I am forced, deeply as I regret it, to reserve for a later date an expression of my views.\n\n Fn \n\n[351 \nU.S. 470, 481]\n\u00a0\n [NOTE: This reservation applies also to Reid v.

JUSTICE REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nIn each of these cases the employer refused to permit distribution of union literature by nonemployee union organizers on company-owned parking lots. The National Labor Relations Board, in separate and unrelated proceedings, found in each case that it was unreasonably difficult for the union organizer to reach the employees off company property and held that, in refusing the unions access to parking lots, the employers had unreasonably impeded their employees' right to self-organization in violation of 8 (a) (1) of the National Labor Relations Act. Babcock & Wilcox Co., 109 N. L. R. B. 485, 494; Ranco, Inc., id., 998, 1007, and Seamprufe, Inc., id., 24, 32.\n\nThe plant involved in No. 250, Labor Board v. Babcock & Wilcox Co., is a company engaged in the manufacture of tubular products such as boilers and accessories, located on a 100-acre tract about one mile from a community of 21,000 people. Approximately 40% of the 500 employees live in that town and the remainder live within a 30-mile radius. More than 90% of them drive to work in private \n\n[351 \nU.S. 105, 107]\n\u00a0\n automobiles and park on a company lot that adjoins the fenced in plant area. The parking lot is reached only by a driveway 100 yards long which is entirely on company property excepting for a public right-of-way that extends 31 feet from the metal of the highway to the plant's property. Thus, the only public place in the immediate vicinity of the plant area at which leaflets can be effectively distributed to employees is that place where this driveway crosses the public right-of-way. Because of the traffic conditions at that place the Board found it practically impossible for union organizers to distribute leaflets safely to employees in motors as they enter or leave the lot. The Board noted that the company's policy on such distribution had not discriminated against labor organizations and that other means of communication, such as the mail and telephones, as well as the homes of the workers, were open to the union.\n1\n The employer justified its refusal to allow distribution of literature on company property on the ground that it had maintained a consistent policy of refusing access to all kinds of pamphleteering and that such distribution of leaflets would litter its property.\n\nThe Board found that the parking lot and the walkway from it to the gatehouse, where employees punched in for work, were the only \"safe and practicable\" places for distribution of union literature. The Board viewed the \n\n[351 \nU.S. 105, 108]\n\u00a0\n place of work as so much more effective a place for communication of information that it held the employer guilty of an unfair labor practice for refusing limited access to company property to union organizers. It therefore ordered the employer to rescind its no-distribution order for the parking lot and walkway, subject to reasonable and nondiscriminating regulations \"in the interest of plant efficiency and discipline, but not as to deny access to union representatives for the purpose of effecting such distribution.\" 109 N. L. R. B., at 486.\n\nThe Board petitioned the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit for enforcement. That court refused enforcement on the ground the statute did not authorize the Board to impose a servitude on the employer's property where no employee was involved. Labor Board v. Babcock & Wilcox Co., 222 F.2d 316.\n\nThe conditions and circumstances involved in No. 251, Labor Board v. Seamprufe, Inc., and No. 422, Ranco, Inc. v. Labor Board, are not materially different, except that Seamprufe involves a plant employing approximately 200 persons and in the Ranco case it appears that union organizers had a better opportunity to pass out literature off company property. The Board likewise ordered these employers to allow union organizers limited access to company lots. The orders were in substantially similar form as that in the Babcock & Wilcox case. Enforcement of the orders was sought in the Courts of Appeals. The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in No. 251, Labor Board v. Seamprufe, Inc., 222 F.2d 858, refused enforcement on the ground that a nonemployee can justify his presence on company property only \"as it bears a cogent relationship to the exercise of the employees' guaranteed right of self-organization.\" These \"solicitors were therefore strangers to the right of self-organization, absent a showing of nonaccessibility amounting to a handicap to self-organization.\" Id., at 861. The Court of Appeals \n\n[351 \nU.S. 105, 109]\n\u00a0\n for the Sixth Circuit in No. 422 granted enforcement. Labor Board v. Ranco, Inc., 222 F.2d 543. The per curiam opinion depended upon its decision in Labor Board v. Monarch Tool Co., 210 F.2d 183, a case in which only employees were involved; Labor Board v. Lake Superior Lumber Corporation, 167 F.2d 147, an isolated lumber camp case; and our Republic Aviation Corp. v. Labor Board, \n324 \nU.S. 793\n. It apparently considered, as held in the Monarch Tool case, supra, at 186, that the attitude of the employer in the Ranco case was an \"unreasonable impediment to the freedom of communication essential to the exercise of its employees' rights to self organization.\" Because of the conflicting decisions on a recurring phase of enforcement of the National Labor Relations Act, we granted certiorari. \n350 \nU.S. 818, 894\n.\n\nIn each of these cases the Board found that the employer violated 8 (a) (1) of the National Labor Relations Act, 61 Stat. 140, making it an unfair labor practice for an employer to interfere with employees in the exercise of rights guaranteed in 7 of that Act. The pertinent language of the two sections appears below.\n2\n These holdings were placed on the Labor Board's determination in LeTourneau Company of Georgia, 54 N. L. R. B. 1253. In the LeTourneau case the Board balanced the conflicting interests of employees to receive information on self-organization on the company's property from fellow employees during nonworking time, \n\n[351 \nU.S. 105, 110]\n\u00a0\n with the employer's right to control the use of his property and found the former more essential in the circumstances of that case.\n3\n Recognizing that the employer could restrict employees' union activities when necessary to maintain plant discipline or production, the Board said: \"Upon all the above considerations, we are convinced, and find, that the respondent, in applying its `no-distributing' rule to the distribution of union literature by its employees on its parking lots has placed an unreasonable impediment on the freedom of communication essential to the exercise of its employees' right to self-organization,\" LeTourneau Company of Georgia, 54 N. L. R. B., at 1262. This Court affirmed the Board. Republic Aviation Corp. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 105, 111]\n\u00a0\n v. Labor Board, \n324 \nU.S. 793, 801\n et seq. The same rule had been earlier and more fully stated in Peyton Packing Co., 49 N. L. R. B. 828, 843-844.\n\nThe Board has applied its reasoning in the LeTourneau case without distinction to situations where the distribution was made, as here, by nonemployees. Carolina Mills, 92 N. L. R. B. 1141, 1149, 1168-1169.\n4\n The fact that our LeTourneau case ruled only as to employees has been noted by the Courts of Appeal in Labor Board v. Lake Superior Lumber Corp., 167 F.2d 147, 150, and Labor Board v. Seamprufe, Inc., 222 F.2d, at 860. Cf. Labor Board v. American Furnace Co., 158 F.2d 376, 380.\n\nIn these present cases the Board has set out the facts that support its conclusions as to the necessity for allowing nonemployee union organizers to distribute union literature on the company's property. In essence they are that nonemployee union representatives, if barred, would have to use personal contacts on streets or at home, telephones, letters or advertised meetings to get in touch with the employees. The force of this position in respect to employees isolated from normal contacts has been recognized by this Court and by others. See Republic Aviation Corporation v. Labor Board, supra, at 799, note 3; Labor Board v. Lake Superior Lumber Corp., supra, at 150. We recognize, too, that the Board has the responsibility of \"applying the Act's general prohibitory language in the light of the infinite combinations of \n\n[351 \nU.S. 105, 112]\n\u00a0\n events which might be charged as violative of its terms.\" Labor Board v. Stowe Spinning Co., \n336 \nU.S. 226, 231\n. We are slow to overturn an administrative decision.\n\nIt is our judgment, however, that an employer may validly post his property against nonemployee distribution of union literature if reasonable efforts by the union through other available channels of communication will enable it to reach the employees with its message and if the employer's notice or order does not discriminate against the union by allowing other distribution. In these circumstances the employer may not be compelled to allow distribution even under such reasonable regulations as the orders in these cases permit.\n\nThis is not a problem of always open or always closed doors for union organization on company property. Organization rights are granted to workers by the same authority, the National Government, that preserves property rights. Accommodation between the two must be obtained with as little destruction of one as is consistent with the maintenance of the other. The employer may not affirmatively interfere with organization; the union may not always insist that the employer aid organization. But when the inaccessibility of employees makes ineffective the reasonable attempts by nonemployees to communicate with them through the usual channels, the right to exclude from property has been required to yield to the extent needed to permit communication of information on the right to organize.\n\nThe determination of the proper adjustments rests with the Board. Its rulings, when reached on findings of fact supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole,\n5\n should be sustained by the courts unless its conclusions rest on erroneous legal foundations. Here the \n\n[351 \nU.S. 105, 113]\n\u00a0\n Board failed to make a distinction between rules of law applicable to employees and those applicable to nonemployees.\n6\n\u00a0\n\nThe distinction is one of substance. No restriction may be placed on the employees' right to discuss self-organization among themselves, unless the employer can demonstrate that a restriction is necessary to maintain production or discipline. Republic Aviation Corp. v. Labor Board, \n324 \nU.S. 793, 803\n. But no such obligation is owed nonemployee organizers. Their access to company property is governed by a different consideration. The right of self-organization depends in some measure on the ability of employees to learn the advantages of self-organization from others. Consequently, if the location of a plant and the living quarters of the employees place the employees beyond the reach of reasonable union efforts to communicate with them, the employer must allow the union to approach his employees on his property. No such conditions are shown in these records.\n\nThe plants are close to small well-settled communities where a large percentage of the employees live. The usual methods of imparting information are available. See, e. g., note 1, supra. The various instruments of publicity are at hand. Though the quarters of the employees are scattered they are in reasonable reach. The Act requires \n\n[351 \nU.S. 105, 114]\n\u00a0\n only that the employer refrain from interference, discrimination, restraint or coercion in the employees' exercise of their own rights. It does not require that the employer permit the use of its facilities for organization when other means are readily available.\n\nLabor Board v. Babcock & Wilcox Co., No. 250, is\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n Labor Board v. Seamprufe, Inc., No. 251, is\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n Ranco, Inc. v.

It has communicated with over 100 employees of Respondent on 3 different occasions by sending literature to them through the mails. Union representatives have communicated with many of Respondent's employees by talking with them on the streets of Paris, by driving to their homes and talking with them there, and by talking with them over the telephone. All of these contacts have been for the purpose of soliciting the adherence and membership of the employees in the Union.\" 109 N. L. R. B., at 492-493.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] \"SEC. 7.

Apart from U.S. Highway No. 13 (and perhaps the intersecting road), the respondent and its subsidiary own all the land adjacent to the plant. This, in itself, seriously limits the possibilities of effectively communicating with the bulk of the respondent's employees. This limitation would not, however, be too restrictive if the respondent's gate opened directly onto the highway, for then persons could stand outside the respondent's premises and distribute literature as each employee entered or left the plant. But at the respondent's plant the gate is 100 feet back from the highway, on company property. Over 60 percent of the respondent's employees, after passing the gate, enter automobiles or busses parked in the space between the gate and the highway, and presumably speed homeward, without ever setting foot on the highway. Distribution of literature to employees is rendered virtually impossible under these circumstances, and it is an inescapable conclusion that self-organization is consequently seriously impeded. It is no answer to suggest that other means of disseminating union literature are not foreclosed. Moreover, the employees' homes are scattered over a wide area. In the absence of a list of names and addresses, it appears that direct contact with the majority of the respondent's employees away from the plant would be extremely difficult.\" LeTourneau Company of Georgia, 54 N.

CO.(1956)\nNo. 79\nArgued: January 17, 1956Decided: February 27, 1956\n\n\n\n\n A labor union instituted proceedings before the National Labor Relations Board charging an employer with unfair labor practices in violation of 8 (a) (1) and 8 (a) (3) of the National Labor Relations Act. A complaint based on these charges was issued. At the hearing, the employer challenged the Board's jurisdiction on the ground that the union had not satisfied the requirements of 9 (h), which requires the filing of non-Communist affidavits by all \"officers\" of the union and of any national or international labor organization of which it is an affiliate, and offered to prove that the Regional Director of the CIO for Kentucky, who had not filed such an affidavit, was an \"officer\" within the meaning of 9 (h). Held:\n\n 1. The Board erred in ruling that, during the course of the unfair labor practice hearing, the employer could not show that the labor organization had not complied with 9 (h) and thereby establish the Board's want of jurisdiction.

Goldberg argued the cause for the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, as amicus curiae, urging reversal. With him on the brief were J. Albert Woll and Thomas E. Harris.\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nCharging respondent with coercion of its employees and discrimination against pro-union employees, Local 20 of the United Brewery Workers, CIO, instituted proceedings before the National Labor Relations Board for violation of 8 (a) (1) and 8 (a) (3) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, 61 Stat. 136, 140, 65 Stat. 601, 602, which outlaw such unfair labor practices. Pursuant to this charge, a complaint was issued; at the hearing which followed, respondent challenged the jurisdiction of the Board upon the ground that the union had not satisfied the requirements of 9 (h) of the Act. Section 9 (h) provides that \"no complaint shall be issued pursuant to [an unfair labor practice] charge made by a labor organization . . . unless there is on file with the Board an affidavit executed contemporaneously or within the preceding twelve-month period by each officer of such labor organization and the officers of any national or international labor organization of which it is an affiliate or constituent unit that he is not a member of the Communist Party or affiliated with such party, and that he does not believe in, and is not a member of or supports any organization that believes in or teaches, the overthrow of the United States Government by force or by any illegal or unconstitutional methods.\" Respondent offered to prove, by evidence of his duties and functions, that Taylor, the Regional Director of the CIO for Kentucky, who admittedly had not filed a non-Communist affidavit, was an \"officer\" within the meaning of 9 (h). \n\n[350 \nU.S. 264, 266]\n\u00a0\n The Board rejected this contention on two grounds: First, \"the compliance status of a union . . . is a matter for administrative determination, and not one to be litigated in complaint or representation proceedings.\" 108 N. L. R. B. 490, 491. Second, \"had the Respondent established in a collateral proceeding what it had offered to prove at the hearing herein, we are satisfied, and find, that under the Board's present `constitutional' test, such proof would fall short of substantiating the Respondent's contention that Taylor was an officer of the CIO.\" 108 N. L. R. B. 490, 492-493.\n\nOn the merits, the Board found that respondent had committed the unfair practices charged. When the Board sought enforcement of its decree, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, without passing upon the unfair practices, remanded the case to the Board for determination of the issue tendered by respondent in its claim that Taylor's functions constituted him an \"officer.\" 219 F.2d 441. We granted certiorari because of the importance of the questions raised in the administration of the statute. \n350 \nU.S. 819\n.\n\nThese questions are two in number: (1) May an employer, during the course of an unfair labor practice hearing, show that a labor organization has not complied with 9 (h) and thereby establish the Board's want of jurisdiction? (2) Assuming the answer to this question is \"yes,\" is the Board's construction of \"officer\" in 9 (h) - viz., \"any person occupying a position identified as an office in the constitution of the labor organization\" - proper? 29 CFR, 1955 Supp., 102.13.\n*\n\u00a0\n\n[350 \nU.S. 264, 267]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Court of Appeals answered the first question in the affirmative upon the authority of Labor Board v. Highland Park Manufacturing Co., \n341 \nU.S. 322\n. In that case an employer, defendant in an unfair labor practice suit, challenged the Board's interpretation of \"national or international labor organization\" in 9 (h). The agency had read this language as not including labor federations, i. e., the AFL or CIO. Therefore, it had not required affidavits from officers of these federations. Highland Park's challenge was rejected by the Board under its then settled policy that the employer could not raise noncompliance with 9 (h) as a bar to a proceeding on an unfair labor practice. The Court of Appeals held to the contrary, 184 F.2d 98, and we affirmed its decision.\n\nThe Board distinguishes Highland Park by suggesting that here the \"employer seeks to question only the fact of compliance, as distinguished from the necessity of compliance.\" The genesis of this distinction comes from the following in Highland Park: \"If there were dispute as to whether the C. I. O. had filed the required affidavits or whether documents filed met the statutory requirements and the Board had resolved that question in favor of the labor organizations, a different question would be presented.\" \n341 \nU.S. 322, 325\n. The Board misconceives the significance of the passage. Both Highland Park and this case involve the scope of 9 (h), the meaning to \n\n[350 \nU.S. 264, 268]\n\u00a0\n be derived from its language; neither case involves an inquiry into disputed facts, the situation referred to in Highland Park. Acceptance of a differentiation between these cases upon any such theory as that suggested by the Board would make of law too thin a dialectic enterprise.\n\nBut if the Board's distinction is overly subtle, its reason for attempting a distinction has force, namely, a concern with \"the need to expedite the hearing of cases and the resolution of issues on their merits . . . .\" 108 N. L. R. B. 490, 491. Much may be said for the claim that an employer should not be permitted to disrupt or delay complaint or representation cases by raising questions respecting 9 (h). But after Highland Park the argument comes too late.\n\nIn any event, whether the impediment to the effectiveness of the administrative process in determining the merits of a charge of unfair labor practice may be serious or negligible by injecting into it the subsidiary issue of compliance with 9 (h), depends upon the scope of the inquiry opened up by the latter issue. This brings us to that question. Our concern specifically is with the appropriate construction of \"officers\" in 9 (h). The Court of Appeals rejected the Board's \"constitutional\" rule for determining who is a union \"officer\" in favor of a so-called \"functional\" test. Presumably this test would require those members of a union who are effective instruments of its policies to file affidavits as \"officers,\" regardless of the fact that they do not fill the offices designated by their organization's constitution.\n\nNeither 9 (h) itself nor its legislative history attempts a definition of \"officers.\" \"Officers\" is a word of familiar usage and \"[a]fter all, legislation when not expressed in technical terms is addressed to the common run of men and is therefore to be understood according to the sense of the thing, as the ordinary man has a right to rely on ordinary words addressed to him.\" Addison v. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 264, 269]\n\u00a0\n Holly Hill Co., \n322 \nU.S. 607, 618\n. \"Officers\" normally means those who hold defined offices. It does not mean the boys in the back room or other agencies of invisible government, whether in politics or in the trade-union movement. A definition of officer as \"any person occupying a position identified as an office in the constitution of the labor organization\" accords with this lay understanding. 29 CFR, 1955 Supp., 102.13.\n\nBut if the word be deemed to have a peculiar connotation for those intimate with trade-union affairs, it is incumbent upon us to give the word its technical meaning, Boston Sand Co. v. United States, \n278 \nU.S. 41, 48\n, for 9 (h) is an integral part of a statute whose sponsors were familiar with labor organization and labor problems and which was doubtless drawn by specialists in labor relations. If such be the case, then of course the Board's expertness comes into play. We should affirm its definition if that definition does not appear too farfetched, Labor Board v. Hearst Publications, Inc., \n322 \nU.S. 111, 130\n. The statute provides some evidence to support the Board, for 9 (f), which requires unions to report specific information to the Secretary of Labor, differentiates between \"officers\" and \"agents\" of labor organizations.\n\nWe conclude that the Board's criterion for determining who are officers both accords with the lay definition of the word and is a reasonable, if indeed not a compelling, construction of the statute. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the case is remanded to that court for further proceedings.\n\n    Reversed and remanded.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE HARLAN took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] The only qualification to this practically automatic definition of who is or is not an officer is the following provision of 102.13 (b) (3) of the Board's Rules and Regulations:\n\n\". . . where the Board has reasonable cause to believe that a labor organization has omitted from its constitution the designation of any position as an office for the purpose of evading or circumventing \n\n[350 \nU.S. 264, 267]\n\u00a0\n the filing requirements of section 9 (h) of the act, the Board may, upon appropriate notice, conduct an investigation to determine the facts in that regard, and where the facts appear to warrant such action the Board may require affidavits from persons other than incumbents of positions identified by the constitution as offices before the labor organization will be recognized as having complied with section 9 (h) of the act.\" 29 CFR, 1955 Supp., 102.13 (b) (3).\n\n\n We interpret this to mean that the application of this exception is wholly within the Board's control and cannot be litigated in an unfair labor practice proceeding. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 264, 270]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","48":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLABOR BOARD v.

The company answered that it could not afford to pay such an increase, it was undercapitalized, had never paid dividends, and that an increase of more than 2 1\/2 cents per hour would put it out of business. The union asked the company to produce some evidence substantiating these statements, requesting permission to have a certified public accountant examine the company's books, financial data, etc. This request being denied, the union asked that the company submit \"full and complete information with respect to its financial standing and profits,\" insisting that such information was pertinent and essential for the employees to determine whether or not they should continue to press their demand for a wage increase. A union official testified before the trial examiner that \"[W]e were wanting anything relating to the Company's position, any records or what have you, books, accounting sheets, cost expenditures, what not, anything to back the Company's position that they were unable to give any more money.\" The company refused all the requests, relying solely on the statement that \"the information . . . is not pertinent to \n\n[351 \nU.S. 149, 151]\n\u00a0\n this discussion and the company declines to give you such information; You have no legal right to such.\"\n\nOn the basis of these facts the National Labor Relations Board found that the company had \"failed to bargain in good faith with respect to wages in violation of Section 8 (a) (5) of the Act.\" 110 N. L. R. B. 856. The Board ordered the company to supply the union with such information as would \"substantiate the Respondent's position of its economic inability to pay the requested wage increase.\" The Court of Appeals refused to enforce the Board's order, agreeing with respondent that it could not be held guilty of an unfair labor practice because of its refusal to furnish the information requested by the union. 224 F.2d 869. In Labor Board v. Jacobs Mfg. Co., 196 F.2d 680, the Second Circuit upheld a Board finding of bad-faith bargaining based on an employer's refusal to supply financial information under circumstances similar to those here. Because of the conflict and the importance of the question we granted certiorari. \n350 \nU.S. 922\n.\n\nThe company raised no objection to the Board's order on the ground that the scope of information required was too broad or that disclosure would put an undue burden on the company. Its major argument throughout has been that the information requested was irrelevant to the bargaining process and related to matters exclusively within the province of management. Thus we lay to one side the suggestion by the company here that the Board's order might be unduly burdensome or injurious to its business. In any event, the Board has heretofore taken the position in cases such as this that \"It is sufficient if the information is made available in a manner not so burdensome or time-consuming as to impede the process of bargaining.\"\n2\n And in this case the Board has held \n\n[351 \nU.S. 149, 152]\n\u00a0\n substantiation of the company's position requires no more than \"reasonable proof.\"\n\nWe think that in determining whether the obligation of good-faith bargaining has been met the Board has a right to consider an employer's refusal to give information about its financial status. While Congress did not compel agreement between employers and bargaining representatives, it did require collective bargaining in the hope that agreements would result. Section 204 (a) (1) of the Act admonishes both employers and employees to \"exert every reasonable effort to make and maintain agreements concerning rates of pay, hours, and working conditions . . . .\"\n3\n In their effort to reach an agreement here both the union and the company treated the company's ability to pay increased wages as highly relevant. The ability of an employer to increase wages without injury to his business is a commonly considered factor in wage negotiations.\n4\n Claims for increased wages have sometimes been abandoned because of an employer's unsatisfactory business condition; employees have even voted to accept wage decreases because of such conditions.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nGood-faith bargaining necessarily requires that claims made by either bargainer should be honest claims. This is true about an asserted inability to pay an increase in wages. If such an argument is important enough to present \n\n[351 \nU.S. 149, 153]\n\u00a0\n in the give and take of bargaining, it is important enough to require some sort of proof of its accuracy. And it would certainly not be farfetched for a trier of fact to reach the conclusion that bargaining lacks good faith when an employer mechanically repeats a claim of inability to pay without making the slightest effort to substantiate the claim. Such has been the holding of the Labor Board since shortly after the passage of the Wagner Act. In Pioneer Pearl Button Co., decided in 1936, where the employer's representative relied on the company's asserted \"poor financial condition,\" the Board said: \"He did no more than take refuge in the assertion that the respondent's financial condition was poor; he refused either to prove his statement, or to permit independent verification. This is not collective bargaining.\" 1 N. L. R. B. 837, 842-843. This was the position of the Board when the Taft-Hartley Act was passed in 1947 and has been its position ever since.\n6\n We agree with the Board that a refusal to attempt to substantiate a claim of inability to pay increased wages may support a finding of a failure to bargain in good faith.\n\nThe Board concluded that under the facts and circumstances of this case the respondent was guilty of an unfair labor practice in failing to bargain in good faith. We see no reason to disturb the findings of the Board. We do not hold, however, that in every case in which economic inability is raised as an argument against increased wages it automatically follows that the employees are entitled to substantiating evidence. Each case must turn upon its particular facts.\n7\n The inquiry must always be whether or not under the circumstances of the particular case the \n\n[351 \nU.S. 149, 154]\n\u00a0\n statutory obligation to bargain in good faith has been met. Since we conclude that there is support in the record for the conclusion of the Board here that respondent did not bargain in good faith, it was error for the Court of Appeals to set aside the Board's order and deny enforcement.\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"SEC. 8.

JUSTICE HARLAN join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\nThis case involves the nature of the duty to bargain which the National Labor Relations Act imposes upon employers and unions. Section 8 (a) (5) of the Act makes it \"an unfair labor practice for an employer . . . to refuse to bargain collectively with the representatives of his employees,\" and 8 (b) (3) places a like duty upon the union vis-a-vis the employer. Section 8(d) provides that \"to bargain collectively is the performance of the mutual obligation of the employer and the representative of the employees to meet at reasonable times and confer in good faith with respect to wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment, or the negotiation of an agreement, or any question arising thereunder, and the execution of a written contract incorporating any agreement reached if requested by either party, but such obligation does not compel either party to agree to a proposal or require the making of a concession . . . .\" 61 Stat. 142, 29 U.S.C. 158 (d).\n\nThese sections obligate the parties to make an honest effort to come to terms; they are required to try to reach an agreement in good faith. \"Good faith\" means more than merely going through the motions of negotiating; it is inconsistent with a predetermined resolve not to budge from an initial position. But it is not necessarily \n\n[351 \nU.S. 149, 155]\n\u00a0\n incompatible with stubbornness or even with what to an outsider may seem unreasonableness. A determination of good faith or of want of good faith normally can rest only on an inference based upon more or less persuasive manifestations of another's state of mind. The previous relations of the parties, antecedent events explaining behavior at the bargaining table, and the course of negotiations constitute the raw facts for reaching such a determination. The appropriate inferences to be drawn from what is often confused and tangled testimony about all this makes a finding of absence of good faith one for the judgment of the Labor Board, unless the record as a whole leaves such judgment without reasonable foundation. See Universal Camera Corp. v. Labor Board, \n340 \nU.S. 474\n.\n\nAn examination of the Board's opinion and the position taken by its counsel here disclose that the Board did not so conceive the issue of good-faith bargaining in this case. The totality of the conduct of the negotiation was apparently deemed irrelevant to the question; one fact alone disposed of the case. \"[I]t is settled law [the Board concluded], that when an employer seeks to justify the refusal of a wage increase upon an economic basis, as did the Respondent herein, good-faith bargaining under the Act requires that upon request the employer attempt to substantiate its economic position by reasonable proof.\" 110 N. L. R. B. 856.\n\nThis is to make a rule of law out of one item - even if a weighty item - of the evidence. There is no warrant for this. The Board found authority in Labor Board v. Jacobs Mfg. Co., 196 F.2d 680. That case presented a very different situation. The Jacobs Company had engaged in a course of conduct which the Board held to be a violation of 8 (a) (5). The Court of Appeals agreed that in light of the whole record the Board was entitled to find that the employer had not bargained in good faith. Its refusal to open its \"books and sales records\" for union \n\n[351 \nU.S. 149, 156]\n\u00a0\n perusal was only part of the recalcitrant conduct and only one consideration in establishing want of good faith.\n*\n The unfair labor practice was not founded on this refusal, and the court's principal concern about the disclosure of financial information was whether the Board's order should be enforced in this respect. The court sustained the Board's requirement for disclosure which \"will be met if the respondent produces whatever relevant information it has to indicate whether it can or cannot afford to comply with the Union's demands.\" 196 F.2d 680, 684. This is a very far cry indeed from a ruling of law that failure to open a company's books establishes lack of good faith. Once good faith is found wanting, the scope of relief to be given by the Board is largely a question of administrative discretion. Neither Jacobs nor any other court of appeals' decision which has been called to our attention supports the rule of law which the Board has fashioned out of one thread drawn from the whole fabric of the evidence in this case.\n\nThe Labor Board itself has not always approached \"good faith\" and the disclosure question in such a mechanical fashion. In Southern Saddlery Co., 90 N. L. R. B. 1205, the Board also found that 8 (a) (5) \n\n[351 \nU.S. 149, 157]\n\u00a0\n had been violated. But how differently the Board there considered its function.\n\n\"Bargaining in good faith is a duty on both sides to enter into discussions with an open and fair mind and a sincere purpose to find a basis for agreement touching wages and hours and conditions of labor. In applying this definition of good faith bargaining to any situation, the Board examines the Respondent's conduct as a whole for a clear indication as to whether the latter has refused to bargain in good faith, and the Board usually does not rely upon any one factor as conclusive evidence that the Respondent did not genuinely try to reach an agreement.\" 90 N. L. R. B. 1205, 1206.\n\n\n The Board found other factors in the Southern Saddlery case. The employer had made no counter-proposals or efforts to \"compromise the controversy.\" Compare, McLean-Arkansas Lumber Co., Inc., 109 N. L. R. B. 1022. Such specific evidence is not indispensable for a study of all the evidence in a record may disclose a mood indicative of a determination not to bargain. That is for the Board to decide. It is a process of inference-drawing, however, very different from the ultra vires law-making of the Board in this case.\n\nSince the Board applied the wrong standard here, by ruling that Truitt's failure to supply financial information to the union constituted per se a refusal to bargain in good faith, the case should be returned to the Board. There is substantial evidence in the record which indicates that Truitt tried to reach an agreement. It offered a 2 1\/2-cent wage increase, it expressed willingness to discuss with the union \"at any time the problem of how our wages compare with those of our competition.\" and it continued throughout to meet and discuss the controversy with the union. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 149, 158]\n\u00a0\n\n\nBecause the record is not conclusive as a matter of law, one way or the other, I cannot join in the Court's disposition of the case. To reverse the Court of Appeals without remanding the case to the Board for further proceedings, implies that the Board would have reached the same conclusion in applying the right rule of law that it did in applying a wrong one. I cannot make such a forecast. I would return the case to the Board so that it may apply the relevant standard for determining \"good faith.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] \"The respondent contends that it was under no statutory duty to confer with the union after the second meeting since all of the issues had been fully explored and the position of both parties expressed. Whether this was true, however, was a question of fact which the Board found adversely to the respondent. Since at both the meetings the respondent took the position that discussion of wage increases would be futile because it was financially unable to make them, and since it refused to discuss the other subjects at all, the Board was justified in concluding that the respondent had refused to bargain in good faith as the Act requires. Collective bargaining in compliance with the statute requires more than virtual insistence upon a prejudgment that no agreement could be reached by means of a discussion.\" Labor Board v. Jacobs Mfg.

JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\nSection 9 (h) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, 61 Stat. 136, 146, 65 Stat. 601, 602, 29 U.S.C. 159 (h), provides that the Board shall make no investigation nor issue any complaint on behalf of a union unless there is on file with the Board a non-Communist oath of each officer of the union and of each officer of any national or international labor organization of which it is an affiliate or constituent unit.\n1\n Section 9 (h) further provides that \"The provisions of section 35 A of the Criminal Code shall be applicable in respect to such affidavits.\" Section 35 A of the Criminal Code applies a criminal sanction\n2\n to false affidavits filed under 9 (h). The question in this case is whether criminal prosecution under that provision is the exclusive remedy for the filing of a false affidavit under 9 (h) or whether the Board may take administrative action and, on a finding that a false affidavit has been filed, enter an order of decompliance, \n\n[352 \nU.S. 145, 147]\n\u00a0\n withholding from the union in question the benefits of the Act until it is satisfied that the union has complied. The court below held that the criminal sanction was the exclusive remedy for filing the false affidavit. 96 U.S. App. D.C. 416, 226 F.2d 780. That decision is in conflict with a ruling of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. Labor Board v. Lannom Mfg. Co., 226 F.2d 194. We granted the petitions for certiorari in each case in order to resolve the conflict. \n351 \nU.S. 949\n; \n351 \nU.S. 905\n.\n\n\nThe union involved in the present case is the International Union of Mine, Mill, and Smelter Workers. The union filed a complaint with the Board charging that the Precision Scientific Co. refused to bargain with it in violation of the Act. During the course of the hearing before the Board, the company challenged the veracity of affidavits filed by one Travis, an officer of the union, under 9 (h). The Board, in accord with its practice,\n3\n refused to allow that issue to be litigated in the unfair labor practice proceeding. But later on, it issued an order directing an administrative investigation and hearing. A hearing was held before an examiner who found, among other things, that the 9 (h) affidavit filed by Travis in August 1949 was false and that the union membership knew it was false and yet continued to re-elect him as an officer. The Board agreed with the trial examiner, held that the union was not and had not been in compliance with 9 (h) of the Act, and ordered that the union be accorded no further benefits under the Act until it had complied. Maurice E. Travis, 111 N. L. R. B. 422. The Board, thereafter, dismissed the union's complaint against Precision Scientific Co., an action later vacated pursuant to a stay issued by the court below. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 145, 148]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe instant suit was brought in the District Court by the union, which prayed that the Board's order of decompliance be enjoined. Precision Scientific Co. intervened. The District Court denied a preliminary injunction. The Court of Appeals reversed, 96 U.S. App. D.C. 416, 226 F.2d 780, on the authority of its prior decision in Farmer v. International Fur & Leather Workers Union, 95 U.S. App. D.C. 308, 221 F.2d 862. It held that a false affidavit filed under 9 (h) of the Act gave rise only to a criminal penalty against the guilty union officer and did not in any way alter the union's right to the benefits of the Act, even where its members were aware of the officer's fraud.\n\n\nWe agree with the court below that the Board has no authority to deprive unions of their compliance status under 9 (h) and that the only remedy for the filing of a false affidavit is the criminal penalty provided in 35 A of the Criminal Code. We start with a statutory provision that contains only one express sanction, viz., prosecution for making a false statement. No other sections of the Act expressly supplement that one sanction.\n\n\nThe aim of 9 (h) is clear. It imposes a criminal penalty for filing a false affidavit so as to deter Communist officers from filing at all. The failure to file stands as a barrier to the making of an investigation by the Board and the issuance of any complaint for the benefit of the union in question. The section, therefore, provides an incentive to the members of the union to rid themselves of Communist leadership and elect officers who can file affidavits in order to receive the benefits of the Act. The filing of the required affidavits by the necessary officers is the key that makes available to the union the benefits of the Act.\n\n\nThe Board is under a duty to determine whether a filing has been made by each person specified in 9 (h), since its power to act on union charges is conditioned on \n\n[352 \nU.S. 145, 149]\n\u00a0\n filing of the necessary affidavits. That was the extent of our rulings in Labor Board v. Highland Park Co., \n341 \nU.S. 322\n; Labor Board v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co., \n350 \nU.S. 264\n. The argument made by the Board would have us go further and read into the Act an implied power to determine not only whether the affidavit has been filed but also whether the affidavit filed is true or false. And for that position reliance is placed on general statements in cases like Labor Board v. Indiana & Michigan Electric Co., \n318 \nU.S. 9, 18\n-19, that the Board has implied power to protect its process from abuse.\n\n\nWe are dealing here with a special provision that has a precise history. Both the Senate and the House originally passed bills which, though the language differed one from the other, made the test of compliance the fact of nonmembership of union officers in the Communist Party. See 1 Leg. Hist., Labor Management Relations Act, 1947 (Nat. Labor Rel. Bd., 1948), pp. 190, 251. If those provisions had become the law, the Board would have been required to conduct an inquiry into whether the officers were in fact non-Communist, at least where the veracity of the affiant was challenged.\n4\n But a fundamental change in 9 (h) was made by the Conference Committee. As stated in the Conference Report respecting the provisions in the two bills.\n\n\"In reconciling the two provisions the conferees took into account the fact that representation proceedings might be indefinitely delayed if the Board was required to investigate the character of all the local and national officers as well as the character of the officers of the parent body or federation. The conference agreement provides that no certification \n\n[352 \nU.S. 145, 150]\n\u00a0\n shall be made or any complaint issued unless the labor organization in question submits affidavits executed by each of its officers and officers of its national or international body, to the effect that they are not members or affiliates of the Communist Party or any other proscribed organization. The penal provisions of section 35 (a) of the Criminal Code (U.S.C., title 18, sec. 80) are made applicable to the execution of such affidavits.\" 2 Leg. Hist., op. cit., supra, p. 1542.\n\n\n\n Senator Taft explained the change to the Senate:\n\n \"This provision making the filing of affidavits with respect to Communist Party affiliation by its officers a condition precedent to use of the processes of the Board has been criticized as creating endless delays. It was to prevent such delays that this provision was amended by the conferees. Under both the Senate and House bills the Board's certification proceedings could have been infinitely delayed while it investigated and determined Communist Party affiliation. Under the amendment an affidavit is sufficient for the Board's purpose and there is no delay unless an officer of the moving union refuses to file the affidavit required.\" Id., at 1625; 93 Cong. Rec. 6860.\n\n\n\n This explicit statement by the one most responsible for the 1947 amendments seems to us to put at rest the question raised by this case. If, in spite of the change in wording of 9 (h) made by the Conference Committee, the Board could still investigate the truth or falsity of the affidavits filed, the unfair labor practice proceedings might be \"infinitely delayed,\" to use Senator Taft's words. Under the construction presently urged by the Board, Senator Taft's assurance that \"an affidavit is sufficient for the Board's purpose\" would be disregarded. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 145, 151]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nMuch argument is advanced that the contrary position is favored by policy considerations. For example, it is said that if the Board can look into the truth or falsity of all 9 (h) affidavits and enter orders of decompliance in case they are found to be false, union members will have greater incentive to rid themselves of Communist leaders. But the rule written into 9 (h) is for the protection of unions as well as for the detection of Communists. It is not fair to read it only against the background of a case where the members knew their officer was a Communist. We are dealing with a requirement equally applicable to all unions, whether the members are innocent of such knowledge or guilty. As Judge Bazelon stated in Farmer v. United Electrical Workers, 93 U.S. App. D.C. 178, 181, 211 F.2d 36, 39, there is no indication that Congress meant to impose on a union the drastic penalty of decompliance \"because its officer had deceived the union as well as the Board by filing a false affidavit.\" The penalty stated in 9 (h) is one against the guilty officers. In view of the wording of 9 (h) and its legislative history, we cannot find an additional sanction which in practical effect would run against the members of the union, not their guilty officers. That was the Board's original position,\n5\n and we think it is the correct one.\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"No investigation shall be made by the Board of any question affecting commerce concerning the representation of employees, raised by a labor organization under subsection (c) of this section, and no complaint shall be issued pursuant to a charge made by a labor organization under subsection (b) of section 10, unless there is on file with the Board an affidavit executed contemporaneously or within the preceding twelve-month period by each officer of such labor organization and the officers of any national or international labor organization of which it is an affiliate or constituent unit that he is not a member of the Communist Party or affiliated with such party, and that he does not believe in, and is not a member of or supports any organization that believes in or teaches, the overthrow of the United States Government by force or by any illegal or unconstitutional methods.

The evidence sought to be adduced under this allegation is \n\n[352 \nU.S. 145, 152]\n\u00a0\n accordingly immaterial.\" And see In the Matter of Alpert and Alpert, 92 N. L. R. B. 806, 807.\n\n\nOn March 18, 1952, Paul M. Herzog, then Chairman of the Board, testified on 9 (h) problems in Senate hearings. He reported that in the four years ending June 30, 1951, there had been filed with the Board 232,000 non-Communist affidavits. He reviewed the history of 9 (h) and remarked how \"intolerable and delaying\" the administrative process would have been if the proposals originally contained in 9 (h), and which we have discussed, had been enacted into law:\n\n\". . . Had this provision been enacted into law, the Board would have been inundated with litigation on an issue concerning which proof is singularly difficult to obtain, to the detriment of speedy disposal of cases which cry out for early employee recourse to the ballot box.\n\n\n\"Instead, Congress imposed an obligation on labor union `officers' - without defining them in the statute - to take the affirmative step of forswearing Communist affiliation. The theory evidently was that if these officers' refusal to sign affidavits deprived their constituents of all the Board's facilities, the spotlighting of that refusal would soon generate pressure from below to remove them from office. It was apparent from the outset that the NLRB's sole function was to make certain that the necessary persons filed these affidavits, and that, once they had done so pursuant to the rules we adopted, we were to process their cases without inquiring into the truth or falsity of the affidavits themselves. Where such an issue arose, the Board's statutory duty was only to refer the affidavit to the Department of Justice for investigation and possible prosecution for perjury under the Criminal Code. We have made 55 such referrals since 1947.\"\n\n\n\n Hearings, Senate Subcommittee of Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, Communist Domination of Unions and National Security, 82d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 91.\n\n\nOn November 10, 1953, the Board issued a Statement of Policy which overturned its previous position. The Board then concluded that a conviction for filing a false affidavit \"would necessarily invalidate any certifications or other official action taken by the Board in reliance on the truth of such affidavits.\" The extent of this change in policy was underscored by the Board's further decision to hold in abeyance representation elections which concerned a union whose officers were under indictment for filing false affidavits. 18 Fed.

The United States accepted appellant's bid, and in June appellant began work on the project. In September, the State of Arkansas filed an information accusing appellant of violation of Ark. Stat., 1947, 71-701 through 71-721, for submitting a bid, executing a contract, and commencing work as a contractor in the State of Arkansas without having obtained a license under Arkansas law for such activity from its Contractors Licensing Board. The case was tried on stipulated facts. Appellant was found guilty and fined. The trial court's judgment was affirmed by the Arkansas Supreme Court, 225 Ark. 285, 281 S. W. 2d 946, and the case came here on appeal. \n351 \nU.S. 948\n. Appellant and the United States as amicus curiae contend that the application of the Arkansas statute to this contractor interferes with the Federal Government's power to select contractors and schedule construction and is in conflict with the federal law regulating procurement.\n\n\n Congress provided in 3 of the Armed Services Procurement Act of 1947, 62 Stat. 21, 23, 41 U.S.C. 152, that awards on advertised bids \"shall be made . . . to that responsible bidder whose bid, conforming to the invitation for bids, will be most advantageous to the Government. price and other factors considered . . . .\" The report from the Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives indicated some of the factors to be considered: \"The question whether a particular bidder is a `responsible bidder' requires sound business judgment, and involves an evaluation of the bidder's experience, facilities, technical organization, reputation, financial resources, and other factors.\" H. R. Rep. No. 109, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. 18; see S. Rep. No. 571, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. 16. The Armed Services Procurement Regulations, \n\n[352 \nU.S. 187, 189]\n\u00a0\n promulgated under the Act, set forth a list of guiding considerations, defining a responsible contractor as one who\n\n \"(a) Is a manufacturer, construction contractor, or regular dealer . . . .\n\n\n \"(b) Has adequate financial resources, or ability to secure such resources;\n\n\n \"(c) Has the necessary experience, organization, and technical qualifications, and has or can acquire the necessary facilities (including probable subcontractor arrangements) to perform the proposed contract;\n\n\n \"(d) Is able to comply with the required delivery or performance schedule (taking into consideration all existing business commitments);\n\n\n \"(e) Has a satisfactory record of performance, integrity, judgment, and skills; and\n\n\n \"(f) Is otherwise qualified and eligible to receive an award under applicable laws and regulations.\" 32 CFR 1.307; see also 32 CFR 2.406-3.\n\n\n Under the Arkansas licensing law similar factors are set forth to guide the Contractors Licensing Board:\n\n\"The Board, in determining the qualifications of any applicant for original license . . . shall, among other things, consider the following: (a) experience, (b) ability, (c) character, (d) the manner of performance of previous contracts, (e) financial condition, (f) equipment, (g) any other fact tending to show ability and willingness to conserve the public health and safety, and (h) default in complying with the provisions of this act . . . or any other law of the State. . . .\" Ark. Stat., 1947, 71-709.\n\n\n Mere enumeration of the similar grounds for licensing under the state statute and for finding \"responsibility\" under the federal statute and regulations is sufficient to \n\n[352 \nU.S. 187, 190]\n\u00a0\n indicate conflict between this license requirement which Arkansas places on a federal contractor and the action which Congress and the Department of Defense have taken to insure the reliability of persons and companies contracting with the Federal Government. Subjecting a federal contractor to the Arkansas contractor license requirements would give the State's licensing board a virtual power of review over the federal determination of \"responsibility\" and would thus frustrate the expressed federal policy of selecting the lowest responsible bidder. In view of the federal statute and regulations, the rationale of Johnson v. Maryland, \n254 \nU.S. 51, 57\n, is applicable:\n\n \"It seems to us that the immunity of the instruments of the United States from state control in the performance of their duties extends to a requirement that they desist from performance until they satisfy a state officer upon examination that they are competent for a necessary part of them and pay a fee for permission to go on. Such a requirement does not merely touch the Government servants remotely by a general rule of conduct; it lays hold of them in their specific attempt to obey orders and requires qualifications in addition to those that the Government has pronounced sufficient. It is the duty of the Department to employ persons competent for their work and that duty it must be presumed has been performed. . . .\"\n\n\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of Arkansas is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n    Reversed and remanded. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 187, 191]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","51":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLESLIE v.

Under the Massachusetts Death Act, the standard of liability for wrongful death is punitive and the maximum amount recoverable is $20,000. The Tort Claims Act provides that the United States shall not be liable for punitive damages; and that, where the law of the place provides \"for damages only punitive in nature,\" the United States shall be liable for \"actual or compensatory damages, measured by the pecuniary injuries resulting from such death.\" Held: The amount of damages recoverable from the United States as compensatory damages is not limited to the maximum amount recoverable under the Massachusetts Death Act.

JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis is a suit under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. 1346 (b), 2674, to recover money damages from the United States on account of the death of one Crowley, caused by negligent operation of traveling cranes by various government employees in a federal \n\n[352 \nU.S. 128, 129]\n\u00a0\n arsenal located in Massachusetts.\n1\n The Act makes the United States liable for the negligence of its employees \"under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.\" 28 U.S.C. 1346 (b). That provision makes the law of Massachusetts govern the liability of the United States for this tort.\n\nThe Massachusetts Death Act, in relevant part, provides that a person, whose agents or servants by negligence cause the death of another not in his employment or service, \"shall be liable in damages in the sum of not less than two thousand nor more than twenty thousand dollars, to be assessed with reference to the degree of his culpability or of that of his agents or servants.\" Mass. Ann. Laws, 1955, c. 229, 2C. The assessment of damages with reference to the degree of culpability of the tort-feasor, rather than with reference to the amount of pecuniary loss suffered by the next of kin, makes those damages punitive in nature. That has been the holding of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts. As stated in Macchiaroli v. Howell, 294 Mass. 144, 147, 200 N. E. 905, 906-907, \"The chief characteristic of the statute is penal.\" And see Arnold v. Jacobs, 316 Mass. 81, 84, 54 N. E. 2d 922, 923; Porter v. Sorell, 280 Mass. 457, 460-461, 182 N. E. 2d 837, 838-839.\n\nThe Tort Claims Act, however, provides in 28 U.S.C. 2674 that:\n\n \"The United States shall be liable . . . in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual \n\n[352 \nU.S. 128, 130]\n\u00a0\n under like circumstances, but shall not be liable for interest prior to judgment or for punitive damages.\n\n\n \"If, however, in any case wherein death was caused, the law of the place where the act or omission complained of occurred provides, or has been construed to provide, for damages only punitive in nature, the United States shall be liable for actual or compensatory damages, measured by the pecuniary injuries resulting from such death to the persons respectively, for whose benefit the action was brought, in lieu thereof.\" (Italics added.)\n\n\n The District Court accordingly held that, since the United States was liable for \"actual or compensatory\" damages and not for \"punitive\" damages, the minimum and maximum limits contained in the Massachusetts Death Act were not applicable. It entered judgment for the plaintiffs in the amount of $60,000. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the Massachusetts Death Act, though punitive, sets the maximum that may be recovered in compensatory damages under the Tort Claims Act. 227 F.2d 385. The case is here on certiorari which we granted to review this important question of construction of the Tort Claims Act. \n350 \nU.S. 980\n.\n\nThe provision of the Act, making the United States liable \"for actual or compensatory damages\" where the law of the place provides \"for damages only punitive in nature,\" goes back to a 1947 amendment. Alabama\n2\n and Massachusetts\n3\n award only punitive damages for wrongful \n\n[352 \nU.S. 128, 131]\n\u00a0\n deaths. Controversies soon arose in those two States in suits under the Act, the Government maintaining that, since local law assessed only \"punitive damages,\" it was not liable. Several bills were introduced to remedy the situation.\n4\n But the solution agreed upon was in a proposal tendered by the Comptroller General. In reference to the Alabama and Massachusetts rule, the spokesman of the Comptroller General stated.\n5\n\u00a0\n\n \"Since in those two states compensatory damages are not allowed, all that is required is to amend the Federal Tort Claims Act to say that in such states compensatory damages shall be allowed. . . . It is believed that that suggestion would eliminate the discrepancy and would make the settlement of claims in those two states to be exactly in accord with the general rules followed in the other 46 states . . . .\"\n\n\n The Government seizes on this statement and like ones in the Committee Reports (see S. Rep. No. 763, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 2; H. R. Rep. No. 748, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 2) to argue that unless the ceiling provided in the Massachusetts law is respected, discrimination against the United States will be shown in Massachusetts, \n\n[352 \nU.S. 128, 132]\n\u00a0\n since over a dozen States have ceilings on compensatory damages. It is also argued that the sole purpose of the amendment was to permit recovery for wrongful death in the two States where punitive damages could be awarded, not to alter the measure of recovery in those States. It is true that Congress was not legislating as to ceilings. Congress was, however, legislating as to the measure of the damages that could be recovered against the United States. As a result of the 1947 amendment, the United States became liable not for \"punitive damages\" but for \"actual or compensatory\" damages, where the law of the place provides for damages \"only punitive in nature.\" 28 U.S.C. 2674. The measure of damages adopted was \"the pecuniary injuries\" resulting from the death.\n\nIt is argued that Massachusetts does not provide damages \"only punitive in nature\" within the meaning of the Act; that even punitive damages serve a remedial end, as recognized by the Massachusetts court under that State's Death Act. See Sullivan v. Hustis, 237 Mass. 441, 447, 130 N. E. 247, 249-250; Putnam v. Savage, 244 Mass. 83, 85, 138 N. E. 808, 809. It is said that Massachusetts law does not provide true punitive damages since the latter are never awarded for negligence alone and are generally imposed in addition to, not in lieu of, compensatory damages. These and related reasons are advanced for treating the Massachusetts measure of damages advanced as the measure of \"actual or compensatory\" damages recoverable against the United States under the Act.\n\nWe reject that reasoning. The standard of liability imposed by the Congress is at war with the one provided by Massachusetts. The standard of liability under the Massachusetts Death Act is punitive - i. e., \"with reference to the degree\" of culpability - not compensatory. The standard under the Tort Claims Act is \"compensatory,\" i. e., \"measured by the pecuniary injuries\" resulting \n\n[352 \nU.S. 128, 133]\n\u00a0\n from the death. There is nothing in the Massachusetts law which measures the damages by \"pecuniary injuries.\" The Massachusetts law, therefore, cannot be taken to define the nature of the damages that can be recovered under the Tort Claims Act.\n\nIn those States where punitive damages only are allowed for wrongful death, a limitation on the amount of liability has no relevance to the policy of placing limits on liability where damages are only compensatory. By definition, punitive damages are based upon the degree of the defendant's culpability. Where a state legislature imposes a maximum limit on such a punitive measure, it has decided that this is the highest punishment which should be imposed on a wrongdoer. This limitation, based as it is on concepts of punishment, cannot control a recovery from which Congress has eliminated all considerations of punishment.\n\nNor can it be concluded that the amendment was designed to remove discrimination in Alabama and Massachusetts between the recoveries allowed in suits against the Government and in suits against individual defendants. The amendment, in fact, perpetuates those differences. In suits in those States, recovery against the Government and against a private defendant will not be the same in identical circumstances. Where the degree of fault is high, but the pecuniary injury slight, a large recovery will represent the degree of the individual defendant's culpability, but the Government will be liable only for the slight amount of damage actually done. On the other hand, where fault is slight, but the pecuniary injury great, the individual defendant's liability will similarly be less than that of the Government. These differences in recovery are inherent in the different measures of damages applicable in suits against the Government and against a private defendant where the State chooses \n\n[352 \nU.S. 128, 134]\n\u00a0\n to provide a punitive measure of damages for wrongful death. By adopting in such a State a compensatory measure of damages in suits against the Government, Congress deliberately chose to permit these substantial differences in recovery to exist. We therefore cannot infer that Congress has, at the same time, provided that maximum recoveries be identical.\n\nThe solution that Congress chose was (a) the adoption of the local law - whether punitive or compensatory - to determine the existence of liability of the United States, and (b) the substitution of \"compensatory\" for \"punitive\" damages where local law provides only the latter. When Congress rejected liability for \"punitive\" damages, we conclude it went the whole way and made inoperative the rules of local law governing the imposition of \"punitive\" damages. When Congress adopted \"actual or compensatory damages,\" measured by the \"pecuniary injuries,\" as the measure of liability in those States that awarded damages \"only punitive in nature,\" we conclude it did not preserve as a limitation on \"compensatory\" damages the limitation imposed by local law on \"punitive\" damages. It would require considerable tailoring of the Act to make it read that way. We refuse the invitation to achieve the result by judicial interpretation.\n\n     Reversed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Plaintiffs were the administratrix of Crowley and the insurer of Crowley's employer.

JUSTICE HARLAN, concurring.\n\nAlthough I join in the Court's opinion in this case, the importance of the question impels me to add a word to what MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS has written. The problem is not an easy one, and I do not think that inquiry can stop with a literal reading of the terms of the statute, plain though they may appear to be. Taking, as I think we should, 2674 (2) within the wider context of the purpose of the Tort Claims Act as a whole, I am still not convinced \n\n[352 \nU.S. 128, 135]\n\u00a0\n that Congress intended the $20,000 limitation in the Massachusetts punitive statute to apply to recoveries under the Tort Claims Act.\n\nIn applying that limitation, the underlying reasoning of the Court of Appeals was that 2674 (2) must not be read as subverting the overriding philosophy of the Tort Claims Act, that is, that the Government should be liable \"in the same manner and to the same extent\" as a private individual under state law would be liable. It therefore argued that although 2674 (2) departed from this philosophy when it made recovery compensatory rather than punitive in instances where the state remedy was punitive, the section in every other respect should be construed harmoniously with this philosophy, and that therefore maxima in state statutes should apply to recoveries against the Government as well as private individuals, even though such a statute is punitive.\n\nBut it seems to me that the whole purpose and reason for the enactment of 2674 (2) was to differentiate between the Government and private defendants in the \"manner\" and \"extent\" of recovery in the particular cases where it applied, and I can find no good reason for giving the section only partial effect. In no case in Alabama or Massachusetts will a plaintiff recover from the Government \"in the same manner\" as he would against an individual defendant, and in no case, except by fortuitous circumstance, will he recover to \"the same extent.\" In both of these States if a highly culpable defendant causes small pecuniary injury, he will be \"punished\" at a high figure, whereas the Government will merely pay the small amount of compensation. Or if a merely careless defendant causes high pecuniary damage, he is punished at a low figure under state law, while the Government must pay for the heavy damage done. In both cases, the effect of the statute is to make the Government liable in a different \n\n[352 \nU.S. 128, 136]\n\u00a0\n manner and to a different extent than a private individual under the same circumstances; this, indeed, was the very purpose of the amendment. I therefore do not see why this purposeful differentiation in \"manner\" and \"extent\" of recovery should stop at the problem of maximum recoveries. Since the Government is by the very statute made liable on a different basis than a private individual and will in every case pay a different amount than would a private individual, why does it offend the philosophy of the Act to make the Government liable for more than a private individual would pay? Thus, while it is true that in general the Tort Claims Act makes the United States pro tanto a private defendant, the very purpose of 2674 (2) was to prevent this assimilation in States where recovery is punitive. It seems to me, therefore, that there is no reason to re-establish the assimilation on this one matter of maximum allowable recovery.\n\nFurthermore, I find it unlikely that Congress would have intended to subject plaintiffs to a maximum which was established for reasons of policy irrelevant to litigation under the Tort Claims Act. Massachusetts has decided that for reasons of policy - possibly because of the danger of excessive jury verdicts in \"punitive\" cases - recovery under its punitive statute should be limited to $20,000. The statute being penal, it embodies the judgment of the legislature that the highest punishment that should be imposed for nonhomicidal death is this figure. But as soon as punishment has nothing to do with the lawsuit - as it does not in suits under 2674 (2) - and as soon as recovery is for compensation of the victim rather than punishment, then the policy reasons on which the $20,000 limit are based vanish. Massachusetts might, of course, impose a limit on compensatory recoveries as well. It did so for a short time, but then repealed the statute. But it is clear that the limit embodied in this \n\n[352 \nU.S. 128, 137]\n\u00a0\n statute has nothing to do with a compensatory suit; the factors which led to the imposition of this maximum are irrelevant when damages are not punitive. It would therefore seem to me just as artificial to take the $20,000 limit of this statute and impose it on a Tort Claims Act recovery as it would be to use as a limit a maximum figure taken from a state criminal statute imposing a fine for negligent homicide. The limitation in the Massachusetts penal statute was arrived at under penal concepts, and should not be artificially imposed on a recovery from which penal considerations have been eliminated by congressional mandate.\n\nThe Court of Appeals suggests that if the Massachusetts \"punitive\" maximum were not applicable, the Government would be put at a unique disadvantage in Massachusetts, since the death statutes of some twelve other States place limitations on recovery which concededly would be applicable to the United States under the provisions of the Tort Claims Act. But the limitations in these other States all relate to compensation statutes, and I do not, of course, suggest that such a limitation in Massachusetts would not also apply to the Government. The resulting lack of symmetry in the operation of the Act as between Massachusetts and the other States having death recovery maxima, seems to me no greater than it is as between such States and those which impose no monetary limitation on death recoveries. Moreover, symmetry in the first aspect can only be achieved at the expense of offending \"the general scheme of the Tort Claims Act to refer questions of liability of the United States to the provisions of `the law of the place where the act or omission complained of occurred,'\"\n*\n since Massachusetts does not recognize compensatory actions. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 128, 138]\n\u00a0\n\n\nI think, therefore, that recovery of actual compensatory damages is, in this case, in full accord with the philosophy of the Tort Claims Act.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] 227 F.2d 385, 391.\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, whom MR. JUSTICE REED, MR. JUSTICE CLARK, and MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN join, dissenting.\n\nThe scope of this case, though involving a general Act of Congress, is geographically constricted; the holding is applicable only to actions under the Federal Tort Claims Act arising out of wrongful deaths in Massachusetts. The Court, finding the words of the Federal Tort Claims Act clear, reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals, which has special responsibility for interpreting federal law in matters unique to its circuit.\n\nUnderlying the Court's reasoning is the belief that the language of the 1947 amendment is so clear that it would require creative reconstruction of the amendment to limit the amount of the judgment to the maximum recoverable under the Massachusetts Death Act. On more than one occasion, but evidently not frequently enough. Judge Learned Hand has warned against restricting the meaning of a statute to the meaning of its \"plain\" words. \"There is no surer way to misread any document than to read it literally . . . .\" Guiseppi v. Walling, 144 F.2d 608, 624 (concurring opinion). Of course one begins with the words of a statute to ascertain its meaning, but one does not end with them. The notion that the plain meaning of the words of a statute defines the meaning of the statute reminds one of T. H. Huxley's gay observation that at times \"a theory survives long after its brains are knocked out.\" One would suppose that this particular theory of statutory construction had had its brains knocked out in Boston Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States, \n278 \nU.S. 41, 48\n. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 128, 139]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe words of this legislation are as plain as the Court finds them to be only if the 1947 amendment is read in misleading isolation. An amendment is not a repeal. An amendment is part of the legislation it amends. The 1947 amendment to the Federal Tort Claims Act of 1946 must be read to harmonize with the central purpose of the original Act. The central purpose of the original Act was to allow recovery against the United States on the basis and to the extent of recoveries for like torts committed by private tortfeasors in the State in which the act or omission giving rise to the claim against the United States occurred. The 1947 amendment filled the gap, a very small gap, that was disclosed in the scheme formulated by the 1946 Act.\n\nThe gap was the situation revealed in two of the forty-eight States, Alabama and Massachusetts. When the Federal Tort Claims Act was passed, the Death Acts of both Alabama and Massachusetts provided for assessment of the defendant's liability for damages on a punitive basis. In Alabama, however, there was no maximum limitation on the recovery, and the problem of this case - whether a recovery in excess of the statutory maximum recoverable against a private employer can be had against the United States - is therefore unique to recovery against the United States under the Massachusetts Death Act. In filling the gap, Congress was concerned only to provide for recovery against the United States for wrongful deaths in Massachusetts and Alabama and to provide for recovery as did the original Act, on a compensatory not a punitive basis. There is nothing to indicate, and it is unreasonable to suppose, that Congress meant a recovery in Massachusetts to be unlimited in amount in the face of the State's statutory limitation at the same time that recoveries in the dozen other States with statutory limitations would be restricted. Such a construction not only takes Massachusetts plaintiffs out of the general \n\n[352 \nU.S. 128, 140]\n\u00a0\n scheme of the Federal Tort Claims Act. It does so by putting them in a better position than plaintiffs in the dozen other States with statutory ceilings. This imputes to Congress a desire to correct the inequity in the 1946 Act by creating an inequity in the 1947 amendment.\n\nOf course the Massachusetts limitation is contained in a statute in which damages are related to a punitive rather than a compensatory basis. The purpose of the 1947 amendment was to allow recovery against the United States when the governing state statute measured damages on such a basis. With this sole exception that the state statute puts the recovery on a harsher basis, the state statute is the governing statute. It may well be that if Massachusetts were to enact a statute restricting recovery to compensatory damages, it would impose a different ceiling. But that is no reason for rejecting the ceiling in the present statute. It does not comport with good sense and reason to suppose that a State would impose a higher ceiling on a recovery based on compensatory damages than it does when it allows punitive damages. This common-sense assumption is supported by the fact that during the brief period from 1947 through 1949, when the Massachusetts statute did measure damages solely on a compensatory basis, the ceiling was fixed at $15,000. This was the same ceiling that was in the previous statute which measured damages on a combined punitive and compensatory basis and the same ceiling that was in the immediately subsequent statute which measured damages solely on a punitive basis. To deny effect to this common-sense assumption is to elevate the literal reading of the 1947 amendment above the central basis of the Federal Tort Claims Act, the assimilation of recovery under federal law to recovery under state law.\n\nThe Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, in an opinion by Chief Judge Magruder, construed the 1947 \n\n[352 \nU.S. 128, 141]\n\u00a0\n amendment in order to harmonize it with the central purpose of the Federal Tort Claims Act. Since elaboration of my reasons for agreeing with the interpretation of the Court of Appeals could only be a paraphrase of its opinion, I rest my dissent from the Court's judgment on what I regard as the substance of that opinion:\n\n\"In the process of enactment of the foregoing amendment [the 1947 Act], the committee reports in both the House and Senate, after pointing out that under the scheme of the Federal Tort Claims Act each case is determined `in accordance with the law of the State where the death occurred,' made the following comment:\n\n\n \"`This bill simply amends the Federal Tort Claims Act so that it shall grant to the people of two States the right of action already granted to the people of the other 46.\n\n\n \"`This bill, with the committee amendment, will not authorize the infliction of punitive damages against the Government, and as so amended, it is reported favorably by a unanimous vote.\n\n\n \"`Its passage will remove an unjust discrimination never intended, but which works a complete denial of remedy for wrongful homicide.' H. R. Rep. No. 748, Committee on the Judiciary, 80th Cong., 1st Sess.; Sen. Rep. No. 763, Committee on the Judiciary, 80th Cong., 1st Sess.\n\n\n  .   .   .  .  .\n\n\n \"Under the provisions of the Federal Tort Claims Act as they now appear in Title 28 of the Code, it is still true that Congress has not enacted a new comprehensive code of federal tort liability. It is still true that the Act in general calls for an application of the law of the state where the wrongful act or \n\n[352 \nU.S. 128, 142]\n\u00a0\n omission occurred. Also, the generalization is still in the law that the United States is to be held liable in tort `in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances.' The exceptional situation covered by the second paragraph of 28 U.S.C. 2674 [that is, the 1947 amendment] applies only to two of the 48 states, for in 46 of the states recovery under their respective Death Acts rests upon a compensatory basis. In about a dozen of these 46 states, the local Death Act contains some maximum limit on the amount of recovery . . . . In these states, as the plaintiffs are bound to concede, the United States could not be liable for more than the statutory maximum permitted by state law in suits against private employers. Such is the clear mandate of the first paragraph of 28 U.S.C. 2674.\n\n\n  .  .  . . .\n\n\n \"As suggested above, the 1947 amendment to the Tort Claims Act did make a partial break in the original pattern of the Act in that, wherever the amendment was applicable, it became possible (1) that the United States might be held liable for a greater sum of damages, assessed on a compensatory basis, than might be assessed under the local Death Act against a private employer in cases in which the wrongdoer was deemed to have been guilty of the minimum degree of culpability, and (2) the United States might be liable for no substantial damages at all, where the plaintiff failed to prove any pecuniary injury to the next of kin . . . though under the local Death Act a private employer might be subject to large damages assessed on a punitive basis. Thus in either of these situations the United States would \n\n[352 \nU.S. 128, 143]\n\u00a0\n not be liable `to the same extent' as a private employer under like circumstances, which is the generally applicable standard in the first paragraph of 28 U.S.C. 2674.\n\n\n \"But we think it is unnecessary to construe the 1947 congressional amendment, which was intended to remove what was deemed to be a discrimination in a very narrow situation, so as to effectuate a far greater discrimination and incongruity. If the contention of the plaintiffs were accepted, then in Massachusetts alone, of all the states whose respective Death Acts contain a maximum limit of recovery, the United States may be held liable in an amount in excess of the maximum limit of recovery permitted against a private employer. [Footnote omitted.]\n\n\n \"The plaintiffs would have us read literally, and in isolation, the language of the second paragraph of 28 U.S.C. 2674 that, in lieu of punitive damages, `the United States shall be liable for actual or compensatory damages, measured by the pecuniary injuries resulting from such death to the persons respectively, for whose benefit the action was brought.' It is argued that since the damages, so computed, have been found to be $60,000, and since the Congress has imposed no maximum limit of recovery, then necessarily, by the very command of the Congress, the judgment against the United States here must be in the sum of $60,000.\n\n\n \"The trouble with the foregoing argument is that the Federal Tort Claims Act, as amended, must be read as an organic whole. In 1947, when the Congress enacted the amendment, it demonstrated no objection to that portion of the Massachusetts Death Act which contained a maximum limit of recovery. That was purely a matter of local legislative policy, \n\n[352 \nU.S. 128, 144]\n\u00a0\n and if a private employer could not be held for more than $20,000, then the Congress, in waiving the governmental immunity of the United States, had no reason to impose a liability upon the United States in excess of the maximum limit applicable to a private employer. What the Congress did not want was to have damages assessed against the United States on a punitive basis. We give full effect to the language of the congressional amendment if we assess damages against the United States on a compensatory basis measured by the pecuniary injuries resulting to the next of kin. Having done that, and if the amount so computed is in excess of $20,000, it is in no way inconsistent to cut down the larger sum to $20,000, the maximum amount recoverable under the terms of the Massachusetts Death Act. All of the $20,000 to be recovered in such a case would be compensatory damages - not one cent of it would be punitive damages - and thus there would be achieved the congressional objective of preventing the infliction of punitive damages against the United States. In other words, except where Congress has clearly provided otherwise, it is the general scheme of the Tort Claims Act to refer questions of liability of the United States to the provisions of `the law of the place where the act or omission complained of occurred.' Thus we must look to the local law to see who is entitled to sue, and for whose benefit; we must look to the local law on whether contributory negligence of the decedent, or a release by him during his lifetime, bars the action for wrongful death; and we must also apply the provision of the local law as to the maximum amount of recovery, for in none of these particulars is there any inconsistent provision in the federal Act.\" 227 F.2d 385, 388-391. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 128, 145]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","53":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMASTRO PLASTICS CORP. v. LABOR BOARD(1956)\nNo. 19\nArgued: October 17, 1955Decided: February 27, 1956\n\n\n\n\n1. \nIn the collective-bargaining contract here involved, the union's undertaking \"to refrain from engaging in any strike or work stoppage during the term of this agreement\" did not waive the employees' right to strike solely in protest against unfair labor practices of their employers. Pp. 279-284.\n\n (a) The words \"any strike\" do not exclude all room for interpretation or necessarily include all strikes, even those against unlawful practices destructive of the foundation upon which collective bargaining must rest. Pp. 281-283.\n\n\n (b) Section 13 of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, providing that \"Nothing in this Act, except as specifically provided for herein, shall be construed so as either to interfere with or impede or diminish in any way the right to strike, or to affect the limitations or qualifications on that right,\" does not preclude reliance upon the Act for support of this interpretation of the strike-waiver clause. Pp. 283-284.\n\n\n2. \nIn the circumstances of this case, including the express finding of the National Labor Relations Board that the purpose of the strike here involved was not to \"terminate or modify\" the existing collective-bargaining contract but was solely to protest against the employers' unfair labor practices designed to oust the employees' bargaining representative, held that 8 (d) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, did not deprive the individual strikers of their status as employees, even though they struck within the 60-day waiting period prescribed by 8 (d) (4) following the union's written notice of its desire to modify its existing contract with the employers. Pp. 284-289.\n\n (a) Since the 60-day waiting period prescribed by 8 (d) (4) begins to run upon the giving of notice of a desire to \"terminate or modify\" an existing contract and its purpose is to relieve the parties during the renegotiation period from the economic pressure of a strike or lockout in relation to the subjects of the negotiations, the provision that any employee who engages in a strike \n\n[350 \nU.S. 270, 271]\n\u00a0\n during such waiting period shall lose his status as an employee should be construed as referring to strikes relating to the subjects of the negotiations and not to strikes designed solely to protest against unfair labor practices of the employers. Pp. 285-286.\n\n\n (b) A different construction would produce incongruous results. Pp. 286-287.\n\n\n (c) Much more explicit language would be needed to deprive employees of their right to strike in protest against violations of 7 and 8 (a), which protect their freedom of concerted action and freedom of choice of representatives. P. 287.\n\n\n (d) While the relevant legislative history provides no conclusive answer to the problem of interpretation here involved, it is consistent with the conclusion here reached. Pp. 287-289.\n\n\n (e) The cross-references to 8, 9 and 10 of the Act in the loss-of-status clause do not require a different result. P. 289.\n\n\n 214 F.2d 462, affirmed.\n\nBernard H. Fitzpatrick argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioners.\n\nDominick L. Manoli argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were Solicitor General Sobeloff, Theophil C. Kammholz and David P. Findling.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BURTON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis case presents two principal questions: (1) whether, in the collective-bargaining contract before us, the union's undertaking \"to refrain from engaging in any strike or work stoppage during the term of this agreement\" waives not only the employees' right to strike for economic benefits but also their right to strike solely against unfair labor practices of their employers, and (2) whether 8 (d) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended,\n1\n deprived individuals of their status as employees if, within the waiting period prescribed by 8 (d) (4), they engage in a strike solely against unfair labor practices of their employers. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 270, 272]\n\u00a0\n For the reasons hereafter stated, we answer each in the negative.\n\nMastro Plastics Corp. and French-American Reeds Manufacturing Co., Inc., petitioners herein, are New York corporations which, in 1949 and 1950, were engaged in interstate commerce, manufacturing, selling and distributing plastic articles, including reeds and other accessories for musical instruments. They operated in the City of New York within the same plant, under the same management and with the same employees. For collective bargaining, their employees were represented by Local 22045, American Federation of Labor, or by Local 3127, United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, AFL. These locals occupied the same office and used the services of the same representatives. During the period in question, the right of representation of petitioners' employees was transferred back and forth between them for reasons not material here. Accordingly, they are referred to in this opinion as the \"Carpenters.\"\n\nIn August 1950, Local 65 of the Wholesale and Warehouse Workers Union began a campaign among petitioners' employees in an effort to become their collective-bargaining representative. Petitioners bitterly opposed the movement, believing Local 65 to be Communist-controlled. Feeling that the Carpenters were too weak to cope successfully with Local 65, petitioners asked the Carpenters to transfer their bargaining rights to Local 318, International Brotherhood of Pulp, Sulphite and Paper Mill Workers, AFL. When the Carpenters declined to do so, petitioners selected a committee of employees to visit 318, obtain membership cards and seek members for that union. The cards were distributed during working hours and petitioners paid their employees for time spent in the campaign, including attendance at a meeting of 318. Petitioners' officers and supervisors instructed \n\n[350 \nU.S. 270, 273]\n\u00a0\n employees to sign these cards and indicated that those refusing to do so would be \"out.\"\n\nSeptember 28, Local 65 filed with the National Labor Relations Board its petition for certification as bargaining representative. October 24, Local 318 intervened in the representation proceedings and asked that it be certified. However, many employees revoked their applications for membership in 318 and reaffirmed their adherence to the Carpenters. This was followed on October 31 by the Carpenters' refusal to consent to an election on the ground that petitioners had unlawfully assisted 318 in the campaign.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nNovember 10, 1950, a crisis developed when the president of petitioners summarily discharged Frank Ciccone, an employee of over four years' standing, because of the latter's activity in support of the Carpenters and his opposition to 318. We accept the finding of the National Labor Relations Board that petitioners \"discriminatorily discharged, and thereafter refused to reinstate, Frank Ciccone because of his organizational activities in support of the . . . [Carpenters].\"\n3\n This discharge at once precipitated the strike which is before us and which the Board found \"was clearly caused and prolonged by the cumulative effects of the [petitioners'] unfair labor practices culminating in the discriminatory discharge of Ciccone.\"\n4\n\u00a0\n\n[350 \nU.S. 270, 274]\n\u00a0\n There was no disorder but the plant was virtually shut down until December 11 and it was March 9, 1951, before the Carpenters, on behalf of petitioners' employees, made an unconditional request to return to work. Petitioners ignored that request and neither Ciccone nor any of the other 76 striking employees has been reinstated.\n\nWhile the strike against petitioners' unfair labor practices continued, the collective-bargaining contract between petitioners and the Carpenters approached its expiration date of November 30, 1950, and, apart from the above-described organizational controversy, the Carpenters had taken timely steps to secure modification of their agreement. October 10, they had delivered to petitioners a notice (dated September 29, 1950) \"requesting modification\" of the contract.\n5\n They thus had started the statutory negotiating period running as prescribed by \n\n[350 \nU.S. 270, 275]\n\u00a0\n the above-mentioned 8 (d).\n6\n The Carpenters met several times with petitioners and pressed their demands for changes in the contract but the expiration date passed without any agreement being reached. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 270, 276]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn January 1951, the Carpenters initiated the present proceedings before the National Labor Relations Board by charging petitioners with unfair labor practices. Acting on those charges, the Board's general counsel filed a complaint alleging petitioners' support of Local 318 and discharge of numerous employees, including Ciccone, as violations of 8 (a) (1), (2) and (3) of the Act.\n7\n\u00a0\n\n[350 \nU.S. 270, 277]\n\u00a0\n\n\nPetitioners admitted that they had discharged the employees in question and had not rehired them. They denied, however, that in so doing they had committed any unfair labor practices. Their first affirmative defense was that the waiver of the right to strike, expressed by their employees in their collective-bargaining contract, applied to strikes not only for economic benefits but to any and all strikes by such employees, including strikes directed solely against unfair labor practices of the employer.\n\nPetitioners' other principal defense was that the existing strike began during the statutory waiting period initiated by the employees' request for modification of the contract and that, by virtue of 8 (d) of the Act,\n8\n the strikers had lost their status as employees. That defense turned upon petitioners' interpretation of 8 (d), applying it not only to strikes for economic benefits but to any and all strikes occurring during the waiting period, including strikes solely against unfair labor practices of the employer.\n\nThe trial examiner made findings of fact sustaining the complaint and recommended that petitioners be ordered to cease and desist from the interference complained of and be required to offer to Ciccone and the 76 other discharged employees full reinstatement, together with back pay for Ciccone from November 10, 1950, and for the other employees from March 9, 1951. See 103 N. L. R. B. 511, 526-563. With minor modifications, the Board adopted the examiner's findings and conclusions and issued the recommended order. 103 N. L. R. B. 511. The chairman and one member dissented in part.\n\nThe Court of Appeals, with one judge dissenting in part, accepted the Board's findings of fact and conclusions of law and enforced the Board's order. 214 F.2d 462. Since then, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has reached a similar conclusion. Labor Board v. Wagner \n\n[350 \nU.S. 270, 278]\n\u00a0\n Iron Works, 220 F.2d 126. Because of the importance of the issues in industrial relations and in the interpretation of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, we granted certiorari. \n348 \nU.S. 910\n.\n\nApart from the issues raised by petitioners' affirmative defenses, the proceedings reflect a flagrant example of interference by the employers with the expressly protected right of their employees to select their own bargaining representative. The findings disclose vigorous efforts by the employers to influence and even to coerce their employees to abandon the Carpenters as their bargaining representatives and to substitute Local 318. Accordingly, unless petitioners sustain at least one of their affirmative defenses, they must suffer the consequences of their unfair labor practices violating 8 (a) (1), (2) or (3) of the Act, as amended.\n\nIn the absence of some contractual or statutory provision to the contrary, petitioners' unfair labor practices provide adequate ground for the orderly strike that occurred here. Under those circumstances, the striking employees do not lose their status and are entitled to reinstatement with back pay, even if replacements for them have been made.\n9\n Failure of the Board to enjoin petitioners' illegal conduct or failure of the Board to sustain the right to strike against that conduct would seriously undermine the primary objectives of the Labor Act. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 270, 279]\n\u00a0\n See Labor Board v. Rice Milling Co., \n341 \nU.S. 665, 673\n. While we assume that the employees, by explicit contractual provision, could have waived their right to strike against such unfair labor practices and that Congress, by explicit statutory provision, could have deprived strikers, under the circumstances of this case, of their status as employees, the questions before us are whether or not such a waiver was made by the Carpenters in their 1949-1950 contract and whether or not such a deprivation of status was enacted by Congress in 8 (d) of the Act, as amended in 1947.\n\nI. Does the collective-bargaining contract waive the employees' right to strike against the unfair labor practices committed by their employers? The answer turns upon the proper interpretation of the particular contract before us. Like other contracts, it must be read as a whole and in the light of the law relating to it when made.\n\n \". . . we have two declared congressional policies which it is our responsibility to try to reconcile. The one seeks to preserve a competitive business economy; the other to preserve the rights of labor to organize to better its conditions through the agency of collective bargaining. We must determine here how far Congress intended activities under one of these policies to neutralize the results envisioned by the other.\" Allen Bradley Co. v. Local Union No. 3, \n325 \nU.S. 797, 806\n.\n\n\n This contract was made in the light of that declared policy. A similar dual purpose is emphasized as follows in 1 of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended:\n\n \"It is hereby declared to be the policy of the United States to eliminate the causes of certain substantial obstructions to the free flow of commerce and to mitigate and eliminate these obstructions when they \n\n[350 \nU.S. 270, 280]\n\u00a0\n have occurred by encouraging the practice and procedure of collective bargaining and by protecting the exercise by workers of full freedom of association, self-organization, and designation of representatives of their own choosing, for the purpose of negotiating the terms and conditions of their employment or other mutual aid or protection.\" 61 Stat. 137, 29 U.S.C. 151. See also, the declaration of policy in  1 (b) of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, 61 Stat. 136, 29 U.S.C. 141 (b).\n\n\n The two policies are complementary. They depend for their foundation upon assurance of \"full freedom of association.\" Only after that is assured can the parties turn to effective negotiation as a means of maintaining \"the normal flow of commerce and . . . the full production of articles and commodities . . . .\" 61 Stat. 136, 29 U.S.C. 141 (b).\n\nOn the premise of fair representation, collective-bargaining contracts frequently have included certain waivers of the employees' right to strike and of the employers' right to lockout to enforce their respective economic demands during the term of those contracts. Provided the selection of the bargaining representative remains free, such waivers contribute to the normal flow of commerce and to the maintenance of regular production schedules. Individuals violating such clauses appropriately lose their status as employees.\n10\n\u00a0\n\n[350 \nU.S. 270, 281]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe waiver in the contract before us, upon which petitioners rely, is as follows:\n\n \"5. The Union agrees that during the term of this agreement, there shall be no interference of any kind with the operations of the Employers, or any interruptions or slackening of production of work by any of its members. The Union further agrees to refrain from engaging in any strike or work stoppage during the term of this agreement.\"\n\n\n That clause expresses concern for the continued operation of the plant and has a natural application to strikes and work stoppages involving the subject matter of the contract.\n\nConceding that the words \"in any strike or work stoppage during the [one-year] term of this agreement,\" if read in complete isolation, may include all strikes and work stoppages of every nature, yet the trial examiner, the Board and the Court of Appeals agree that those words do not have that scope when read in their context and in the light of the law under which the contract was made. This unanimity of interpretation is entitled to much weight.\n11\n\u00a0\n\nPetitioners argue that the words \"any strike\" leave no room for interpretation and necessarily include all strikes, even those against unlawful practices destructive of the foundation on which collective bargaining must rest. We disagree. We believe that the contract, taken as a whole, deals solely with the economic relationship between the employers and their employees.\n12\n It is a typical collective-bargaining \n\n[350 \nU.S. 270, 282]\n\u00a0\n contract dealing with terms of employment and the normal operations of the plant. It is for one year and assumes the existence of a lawfully designated bargaining representative. Its strike and lockout clauses are natural adjuncts of an operating policy aimed at avoiding interruptions of production prompted by efforts to change existing economic relationships. The main function of arbitration under the contract is to provide a mechanism for avoiding similar stoppages due to \n\n[350 \nU.S. 270, 283]\n\u00a0\n disputes over the meaning and application of the various contractual provisions.\n\nTo adopt petitioners' all-inclusive interpretation of the clause is quite a different matter. That interpretation would eliminate, for the whole year, the employees' right to strike, even if petitioners, by coercion, ousted the employees' lawful bargaining representative and, by threats of discharge, caused the employees to sign membership cards in a new union. Whatever may be said of the legality of such a waiver when explicitly stated, there is no adequate basis for implying its existence without a more compelling expression of it than appears in 5 of this contract.\n\nThere has been no court decision called to our attention which has held that the employees' right to strike against unfair labor practices has been waived by language such as that which is before us. On the other hand, prior to such contract, such language had been held by the Board to apply appropriately to economic strikes with consequent loss of employee status.\n13\n\u00a0\n\nIt is suggested that 13 of the Act, as amended, precludes reliance by the Board upon the Act for support of its interpretation of the strike-waiver clause. That section provides that \"Nothing in this Act, except as specifically provided for herein, shall be construed so as either to interfere with or impede or diminish in any way the right to strike, or to affect the limitations or qualifications on that right.\" 61 Stat. 151, 29 U.S.C. 163. On the basis of the above language, petitioners claim that because the contract-waiver clause prohibits all strikes of every nature, nothing in the Act may be construed to affect the \"limitations or qualifications\" which the contract thus places on that right. Such a claim assumes the point at issue. The Board relies upon the context of the \n\n[350 \nU.S. 270, 284]\n\u00a0\n contract and upon the language of the clause itself, rather than upon the statute, to define the kind of strike that is waived.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the initial provision in 13 that nothing in the Act \"shall be construed so as either to interfere with or impede or diminish in any way the right to strike\" adds emphasis to the Board's insistence upon preserving the employees' right to strike to protect their freedom of concerted action. Inasmuch as strikes against unfair labor practices are not anywhere specifically excepted from lawful strikes, 13 adds emphasis to the congressional recognition of their propriety.\n14\n\u00a0\n\nFor the reasons stated above and those given by the Board and the court below, we conclude that the contract did not waive the employees' right to strike solely against the unfair labor practices of their employers.\n\nII. Does 8 (d) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, deprive individuals of their status as employees if, within the waiting period prescribed by 8 (d) (4), they engage in a strike solely against unfair labor practices of their employers? Here again the background is the dual purpose of the Act (1) to protect the right of employees to be free to take concerted action as provided in 7 and 8 (a),\n15\n and (2) to substitute collective bargaining for economic warfare in securing satisfactory wages, hours of work and employment conditions. Section 8 (d)\n16\n seeks to bring about the termination and modification of collective-bargaining agreements without interrupting the flow of commerce or the production of goods, while 7 and 8 (a) seek to insure freedom of concerted action by employees at all times. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 270, 285]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe language in 8 (d) especially relied upon by petitioners is as follows: \"Any employee who engages in a strike within the sixty-day period specified in this subsection shall lose his status as an employee of the employer engaged in the particular labor dispute, for the purposes of sections 8, 9, and 10 of this Act, as amended . . . .\" 61 Stat. 143, 29 U.S.C. 158 (d).\n\nPetitioners contend that the above words must be so read that employees who engage in any strike, regardless of its purpose, within the 60-day waiting period, thereby lose their status as employees. That interpretation would deprive Ciccone and his fellow strikers of their rights to reinstatement and would require the reversal of the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n17\n If the above words are read in complete isolation from their context in the Act, such an interpretation is possible. However, \"In expounding a statute, we must not be guided by a single sentence or member of a sentence, but look to the provisions of the whole law, and to its object and policy.\" United States v. Boisdore's Heirs, 8 How. 113, 122. See also, Peck v. Jenness, 7 How. 612, 622-623; Duparquet Co. v. Evans, \n297 \nU.S. 216\n, and United States v. American Trucking Assns., \n310 \nU.S. 534, 542\n-543.\n\nReading the clause in conjunction with the rest of 8, the Board points out that \"the sixty-day period\" referred to is the period mentioned in paragraph (4) of 8 (d). That paragraph requires the party giving notice of a desire to \"terminate or modify\" such a contract, as part of its obligation to bargain under 8 (a) (5) or 8 (b) (3), to continue \"in full force and effect, without resorting to \n\n[350 \nU.S. 270, 286]\n\u00a0\n strike or lock-out, all the terms and conditions of the existing contract for a period of sixty days after such notice is given or until the expiration date of such contract, whichever occurs later.\" Section 8 (d) thus seeks, during this natural renegotiation period, to relieve the parties from the economic pressure of a strike or lockout in relation to the subjects of negotiation. The final clause of 8 (d) also warns employees that, if they join a proscribed strike, they shall thereby lose their status as employees and, consequently, their right to reinstatement.\n\nThe Board reasons that the words which provide the key to a proper interpretation of 8 (d) with respect to this problem are \"termination or modification.\" Since the Board expressly found that the instant strike was not to terminate or modify the contract,\n18\n but was designed instead to protest the unfair labor practices of petitioners, the loss-of-status provision of 8 (d) is not applicable. We sustain that interpretation. Petitioners' construction would produce incongruous results. It concedes that prior to the 60-day negotiating period, employees have a right to strike against unfair labor practices designed to oust the employees' bargaining representative, yet petitioners' interpretation of 8 (d) means that if the employees give the 60-day notice of their desire to modify the contract, they are penalized for exercising that right to strike. This would deprive them of their most effective weapon at a time when their need for it is obvious. Although the employees' request to modify the contract would demonstrate their need for the services of their freely chosen representative, petitioners' interpretation would have the incongruous effect of cutting off the employees' freedom to strike against unfair labor practices aimed at that representative. This would relegate the employees to filing charges under a procedure too slow \n\n[350 \nU.S. 270, 287]\n\u00a0\n to be effective. The result would unduly favor the employers and handicap the employees during negotiation periods contrary to the purpose of the Act. There also is inherent inequity in any interpretation that penalizes one party to a contract for conduct induced solely by the unlawful conduct of the other, thus giving advantage to the wrongdoer.\n19\n\u00a0\n\nPetitioners contend that, unless the loss-of-status clause is applicable to unfair labor practice strikes, as well as to economic strikes, it adds nothing to the existing law relating to loss of status. Assuming that to be so, the clause is justifiable as a clarification of the law and as a warning to employees against engaging in economic strikes during the statutory waiting period. Moreover, in the face of the affirmative emphasis that is placed by the Act upon freedom of concerted action and freedom of choice of representatives, any limitation on the employees' right to strike against violations of 7 and 8 (a), protecting those freedoms, must be more explicit and clear than it is here in order to restrict them at the very time they may be most needed.\n\nThere is sufficient ambiguity here to permit consideration of relevant legislative history. While such history provides no conclusive answer, it is consistent with the view taken by the Board and by the Courts of Appeals for the Second and Seventh Circuits.\n20\n\u00a0\n\nSenator Ball, who was a manager for the 1947 amendments in the Senate and one of the conferees on the bill, stated that 8 (d) made mandatory what was already \n\n[350 \nU.S. 270, 288]\n\u00a0\n good practice and was aimed at preventing such interruptions of production as the \"quickie strikes\" occasionally used to gain economic advantages.\n\n \"The provision in the National Labor Relations Act defining collective bargaining, and providing that where a contract between a union and an employer is in existence, fulfilling the obligation on both sides to protect [bargain] collectively means giving at least 60 days' notice of the termination of the contract, or of the desire for any change in it, is another provision aimed primarily at protecting the public, as well as the employee, who have been the victims of `quickie' strikes. I do not think that is taking away any rights of labor . . . it is simply saying that they should all follow the sound, fair, and sane procedure which a majority of the good ones now follow.\" 93 Cong. Rec. 5014.\n\n\n One minority report suggested a fear that 8 (d) would be applicable to unfair practice strikes. The suggestion, however, was not even made the subject of comment by the majority reports or in the debates.\n21\n An unsuccessful minority cannot put words into the mouths of the majority and thus, indirectly, amend a bill.\n22\n\u00a0\n\nThe record shows that the supporters of the bill were aware of the established practice which distinguished between the effect on employees of engaging in economic strikes and that of engaging in unfair practice strikes.\n23\n\u00a0\n\n[350 \nU.S. 270, 289]\n\u00a0\n If Congress had wanted to modify that practice, it could readily have done so by specific provision. Congress cannot fairly be held to have made such an intrusion on employees' rights, as petitioners claim, without some more explicit expression of its purpose to do so than appears here.\n24\n\u00a0\n\nFinally, petitioners seek support for their interpretation of 8 (d) from the fact that its last clause makes a cross-reference to 8, 9 and 10 of the Act. Such reference does not expand the scope of 8 (d). It merely makes it clear that if 8 (d) is violated by the employees to whom it applies, then they lose their status as employees for the purposes of 8, 9 and 10.\n25\n\u00a0\n\nAs neither the collective-bargaining contract nor 8 (d) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, stands in the way, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 61 Stat. 140, 142-143, 29 U.S.C. 158 (d).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] In December, Locals 318 and 65 withdrew their representation proceedings from before the Board and the Carpenters (through Local 3127) filed its own representation proceeding. January 29, 1951, the Board issued a direction of election in the latter proceeding but, after the Carpenters filed charges of unfair practices, the Board postponed the holding of any election until the regional director might deem it proper.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] 103 N.

The record does not support \n\n[350 \nU.S. 270, 274]\n\u00a0\n a finding that the strike also had as an additional objective the termination or modification of the existing contract. It is true that demands for contract changes had previously been presented to the [petitioners], and there had been some discussion at meetings of Local 22045 or Local 3127 of a possible strike if such demands were not met. But no strike vote on that issue had ever been taken, nor was any strike action otherwise determined upon. On the record as a whole, I am fully satisfied, and I find, that the strike which immediately followed Ciccone's discharge was unplanned and began as a spontaneous demonstration by employees of their protest of the [petitioners'] unfair labor practices. Nor does the record reflect that its character changed after it began to one where the strikers were seeking to compel changes or modifications in economic terms or conditions of employment. There is no evidence that any negotiations were conducted or overtures made along such lines at any time after the commencement of the strike. The [petitioners] at the hearing made no such claim, and offered no evidence to establish that the strike had any purpose other than, or in addition to, that claimed by the General Counsel.\" 103 N.

JUSTICE MINTON and MR. JUSTICE HARLAN join, dissenting.\n\nThe petitioners are corporations in the plastics manufacturing business in New York and are subject to the Taft-Hartley Act, 61 Stat. 136, 29 U.S.C. 141. In November 1949 they negotiated a one-year collective bargaining agreement with the Carpenters Union, A. F. L., \n\n[350 \nU.S. 270, 290]\n\u00a0\n governing wages, hours and working conditions. The agreement provided for the arbitration of disputes and contained a clause outlawing strikes. During the life of this agreement, the Wholesale and Warehouse Workers Union commenced the solicitation of members among petitioners' employees, and in September 1950 requested the National Labor Relations Board to certify them as exclusive bargaining representative.\n\nIn an effort to keep the Warehouse Workers out of their plant, the petitioners enlisted the aid of a third union, the Pulp and Mill Workers. This latter organization had bested the Wholesale and Warehouse Workers elsewhere in organizational wars. Petitioners proselytized among their employees on behalf of the Pulp and Mill Workers, which in late October, having gained sufficient adherents, intervened in the representation proceeding initiated before the Board by the Warehouse Workers.\n\nMeanwhile the Carpenters had written petitioners on October 10, stating that they wished to negotiate a new contract to take effect upon the expiration of the current agreement. The letter made specific demands, and bargaining over them followed. When the petitioners' organizational activities became manifest, the Carpenters lodged unfair-labor-practice charges with the Board. Some members of the incumbent union tried to counteract the influence of the petitioners upon the employees. Frank Ciccone, a machinist, was one who was active in urging employees to remain loyal to the Carpenters.\n\nOn November 10 Ciccone was discharged because of this. The discharge, in conjunction with the antecedent employer unfair labor practices, precipitated a plant-wide strike accompanied by peaceful picketing. The strike continued until early February when the participants requested reinstatement. The request was rejected by the petitioners which had earlier notified the strikers of their discharge. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 270, 291]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe proceedings that followed before the Board resulted in findings against the employers of unfair labor practices under 8 (a) (1), (2) and (3). The Board entered a cease and desist order, and affirmatively directed petitioners to reinstate the discharged strikers with back pay. 103 N. L. R. B. 511. Chairman Herzog and Member Murdock dissented from the latter portion of the Board's order. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (Swan, J., dissenting in part) enforced the Board's order. 214 F.2d 462. We granted certiorari because of the important question of the construction of the Taft-Hartley Act raised by the case. \n348 \nU.S. 910\n.\n\nPetitioners did not contend in the Court of Appeals, nor have they argued here, that the Board erred either in finding them guilty of committing unfair labor practices, or in concluding that the strike was precipitated by these illegal practices. Rather they maintain that the Board lacked the power to order the discharged strikers reinstated. Two reasons are urged. First, the strike is claimed to constitute a breach of the labor agreement between petitioners and the bargaining representative of the strikers, and was therefore unprotected activity. Such is not the case. The Board and the Court of Appeals rightly held that the \"no-strike\" clause in the contract does not cover a work stoppage provoked by the petitioners' unfair labor practices. The second reason is that the strikers ceased to be employees within the meaning of the Act, and therefore were not entitled to reinstatement. Petitioners contend that the discharged workers lost their status as employees by reason of the 60-day \"cooling-off\" period provided by 8 (d) of the Act.\n\nSection 8 (d) defines the duty of the employer and the union to bargain collectively. A long proviso in the section treats specifically of the duty during the period \n\n[350 \nU.S. 270, 292]\n\u00a0\n of contract renegotiation. The relevant portions of the section follow:\n\n\". . . where there is in effect a collective-bargaining contract covering employees in an industry affecting commerce, the duty to bargain collectively shall also mean that no party to such contract shall terminate or modify such contract, unless the party desiring such termination or modification -\n\n\n \"(1) serves a written notice upon the other party to the contract of the proposed termination or modification sixty days prior to the expiration date thereof, or in the event such contract contains no expiration date, sixty days prior to the time it is proposed to make such termination or modification;\n\n\n  .   .  .  .  .\n\n\n \"(4) continues in full force and effect, without resorting to strike or lock-out, all the terms and conditions of the existing contract for a period of sixty days after such notice is given or until the expiration date of such contract, whichever occurs later: . . . Any employee who engages in a strike within the sixty-day period specified in this subsection shall lose his status as an employee of the employer engaged in the particular labor dispute, for the purposes of sections 8, 9, and 10 of this Act, as amended, but such loss of status for such employee shall terminate if and when he is reemployed by such employer.\" 61 Stat. 142-143, 29 U.S.C. 158 (d).\n\n\n The discharged employees struck during the 60-day period, for the notification required by 8 (d) (1) was given on October 10, and the strike began on November 10. The holding of the Board, however, sustained by the Court of Appeals, is that the loss-of-status provision does not apply to an unfair-labor-practice striker. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 270, 293]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThis provision was one of the amendments to the Wagner Act made by the Labor Management Relations Act, 61 Stat. 136. If the provision, couched in ordinary nontechnical language, is to be read as ordinary English words, concededly the striking employees lost their \"status\" as employees of petitioners \"for the purposes of sections 8, 9, and 10 . . . .\" Accordingly they were not entitled to re-employment by the petitioners, and the Board was without authority to order their reinstatement. The real problem, then, is to determine whether controlling considerations preclude giving the ordinary meaning to what Congress has written. While literalness of construction does not conclude ascertainment of a statute's meaning, it certainly is the beginning.\n\nThe so-called canons of construction are not technical rules of law which afford the answer to a problem like this. But they are \"axiom[s] of experience\" (Boston Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States, \n278 \nU.S. 41, 48\n), helpful guides in determining when language as plain as ours should be respected and enforced. Relevant guides in construing an amendatory provision like the one in issue are: (1) what was the state of the law before the amendment and (2) what light is shed on the specific provision by placing it in the context of the legislation, i. e., the Taft-Hartley Act, of which it is a part, in order to secure harmony and not discord of result. In a word, enactments like the Wagner Act and the Taft-Hartley Act must be considered as an organic whole.\n\nUnder the original Wagner Act, employees were given the right in 7 \"to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in concerted activities, for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.\" Duties were imposed upon the employer under 8. Among these, he could not interfere with the exercise by employees of their \n\n[350 \nU.S. 270, 294]\n\u00a0\n rights under 7, and he was required to bargain in good faith with the employees' representative. When the Board found that an employer had violated his duty under 8, it was empowered under 10 to order the employer to cease and desist from so doing and to take action undoing his violation, including the reinstatement of discharged employees, if such reinstatement would effectuate the policies of the Act.\n\nWhile the employer had numerous obligations to his employees and their bargaining representative, the union and the employees were under no statutory duty to the employer. For example, the union was not required to bargain in good faith, and it was not forbidden to strike in order to achieve its demands during a period of contract renegotiation.\n\nIf this case had come up under the Wagner Act the results would be clear. The employers violated 8 and thereby unleashed the strike. Such a strike would not have been in violation of any statutory duty because the union and the employees had no duties under the Wagner Act. Since the employers had committed an unfair labor practice, the Board had jurisdiction and could order the discharged strikers reinstated with back pay. Phelps Dodge Corp. v. Labor Board, \n313 \nU.S. 177\n. Furthermore, the employers' discharge of their employees because they engaged in a strike was itself an unfair labor practice under 8 for it interfered with their 7 right to engage in \"concerted activities.\"\n\nThe Wagner Act did not define \"concerted activities.\" All collective action, however, was not concerted activity protected by 7. We held in Labor Board v. Fansteel Metallurgical Corp., \n306 \nU.S. 240\n, that a sit-down strike was not 7 activity; and in Southern S. S. Co. v. Labor Board, \n316 \nU.S. 31\n, we decided that a strike in violation of the laws against mutiny was not protected under 7. If an employer interferes with collective \n\n[350 \nU.S. 270, 295]\n\u00a0\n employee action which is not sanctioned by 7, he does not violate 8, and in the absence of a violation of 8 the Board cannot take action under 10. Thus if an employer discharges workers because they engaged in a sit-down strike for higher wages, the Board cannot order him to reinstate the strikers. Since 8, however, did not place any duties upon employees or unions, most peaceful collective action was protected under 7, because most peaceful activity did not infringe some implicit federal labor policy or some other federal policy, such as that represented by the statute against mutiny.\n\nThe Taft-Hartley Act changed the situation. Section 8 of the Wagner Act was amended and duties were placed upon unions. Collective action which violates any of these duties is of course activity unprotected by 7. See Cox, The Right to Engage in Concerted Activities, 26 Ind. L. J. 319, 325-333 (1951). One of these new union duties, and an important one, is contained in 8 (d): unions may not strike to enforce their demands during the 60-day \"cooling-off\" period.\n\nBy reason of this new enactment, participating workers would not be engaged in a protected activity under 7 by striking for the most legitimate economic reasons during the 60-day period. The strike would be in violation of the provision of that section which says that during the period there shall be no resort to a strike. The employer could discharge such strikers without violating 8. This would be so if 8 were without the loss-of-status provision. The Board would be powerless to order reinstatement under 10. The loss-of-status provision in 8 (d) does not curtail the Board's power, since it did not have power to order reinstatement where a strike is resorted to for economic reasons before the 60-day period has expired. In such a situation the striker has no rights under 8 and 10. Yet the Board would have us construe the loss-of-status provision as applicable only \n\n[350 \nU.S. 270, 296]\n\u00a0\n to the economic striker and qualifying a power which the Board does not have.\n\nIt is with respect to the unfair-labor-practice striker that the provision serves a purpose. This becomes clear if we assume that there were no such provision and examine the consequences of its absence. On such an assumption, a strike based on an unfair labor practice by the employer during the 60-day period may or may not be a protected activity under 7. If it is, obviously discharged strikers would be entitled to reinstatement. The strike would not be a 7 activity, however, if, for example, it were in breach of a no-strike clause in the contract which extends to a work stoppage provoked by an employer unfair labor practice, cf. Labor Board v. Sands Mfg. Co., \n306 \nU.S. 332, 344\n, or if the no-strike clause in 8 (d) (4) (not to be confused with the loss-of-status provision) extends to such a work stoppage. However, even if the strike is not a 7 activity, the Board in the unfair-labor-practice strike situation as distinguished from the economic strike situation, may in its discretion order the discharged participants reinstated. This is so because of the antecedent employer unfair practice which caused the strike, and which gave employees rights under 8. If the Board finds that reinstatement of such strikers is a remedy that would effectuate the policies of the Act, it has the power under 10 (c) to issue the necessary order.\n\nThis would not be the case, however, if the loss-of-status provision were held applicable to unfair-labor-practice strikes, because participating workers would lose their rights as \"employees\" for the purposes of 8 and 10. Under the Act only \"employees\" are eligible for reinstatement. The unfair-labor-practice strike, then, is the one situation where loss of status for the purposes of 8 and 10 is of significance. At any rate, we have not been advised of any other situation to which the provision would apply. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 270, 297]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are therefore confronted with the demonstrable fact that if the provision stripping strikers of their status as employees during the 60-day period is to have any usefulness at all and not be an idle collection of words, the fact that a strike during that period is induced by the employer's unfair labor practice is immaterial.\n*\n Even though this might on first impression seem an undesirable result, it is so only by rejecting the important considerations in promoting peaceful industrial relations which might well have determined the action of Congress. In the first place, the Congress may have set a very high value on peaceful adjustments, i. e., the absence of strikes. One may take judicial notice of the fact that this consideration was at the very forefront of the thinking and feeling of the Eightieth Congress. And there is another consideration not unrelated to this. While in a particular case the cause of a strike may be clear, and in a particular case there may be no controversy regarding the \n\n[350 \nU.S. 270, 298]\n\u00a0\n circumstances which prove that an employer committed an unfair labor practice, as a matter of experience that is not always true, indeed often it is not true. One of the sharpest controversies, one of the issues most difficult of determination, is the very question of what precipitated a work stoppage. This is especially true where a new contract is being negotiated. It is not at all unreasonable, therefore, to find a congressional desire to preclude litigation over what all too often is a contentious subject and to deter all strikes during the crucial period of negotiation.\n\nWe need not agree with a legislative judgment in order to obey a legislative command. It is enough for us that Congress did not legislate idly, but did intend the loss-of-status provision to have an effect. \"We are not at liberty to construe any statute so as to deny effect to any part of its language. It is a cardinal rule of statutory construction that significance and effect shall, if possible, be accorded to every word. As early as in Bacon's Abridgment, sect. 2, it was said that `a statute ought, upon the whole, to be so construed that, if it can be prevented, no clause, sentence, or word shall be superfluous, void, or insignificant.' This rule has been repeated innumerable times. Another rule equally recognized is that every part of a statute must be construed in connection with the whole, so as to make all the parts harmonize, if possible, and give meaning to each.\" Market Co. v. Hoffman, \n101 \nU.S. 112, 115\n-116. Since the loss-of-status provision has an effect only in an unfair-labor-practice strike, the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be reversed.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] It may be noted that the opponents of the Taft-Hartley Act objected to the loss-of-status provision for just this reason:\n\n\"[T]he section is silent as to the Board's authority to accommodate conflicting issues such as provocation on the part of the employer. Under this section an employer desirous of ridding himself either of the employees or their representative can engage in the most provocative conduct without fear of redress except by way of a lengthy hearing before the Board and a subsequent admonition to thereafter `cease and desist' from such practices. In striking contrast to the relatively delicate treatment provided for such action by an employer, employees unwilling idly to countenance abuse, who resort to self-help under the circumstances are removed from the protection of the statute and lose `employee' status. An employer is at liberty under such circumstances freely to replace any employee bold enough to insist upon justice. The provision denies to the Board the exercise of any discretion to accommodate the equitable doctrine of `clean hands.' The provisions of the section are conclusive - the employee is subject to summary dismissal irrespective of the employer's conduct.\" S. Rep. No. 105 (Minority), Part 2, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. 21-22 (1947). \n\n[350 \nU.S. 270, 299]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","54":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMEAT CUTTERS v.

Come.\n\nJudson Harwood argued the cause for the Lannom Manufacturing Co., respondent. With him on the brief was Cecil Sims.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis is a companion case to Leedom v. International Union, ante, p. 145, decided this day. International Fur and Leather Workers Union\n1\n filed a charge with the National Labor Relations Board alleging that respondent Lannom Mfg. Co. had interfered with the rights of its employees guaranteed by the Act. This charge was filed \n\n[352 \nU.S. 153, 154]\n\u00a0\n in April 1951. A complaint was issued based on the charges in February 1952. At the hearing, Lannom sought to prove that certain 9 (h) affidavits filed by officers of the union were false. The trial examiner ruled, in accordance with the Board's practice, that that issue could not be litigated in the proceeding. The trial examiner recommended that an appropriate remedial order issue to correct the unfair labor practice which he found to exist. The Board in general sustained the trial examiner and issued a remedial order against Lannom, 103 N. L. R. B. 847. Prior to this order, the Board had been enjoined from taking administrative action requiring the union's officers to reaffirm their 9 (h) affidavits. Farmer v. United Electrical Workers, 93 U.S. App. D.C. 178, 211 F.2d 36. Accordingly the Board ruled, \"We are administratively satisfied that the Union was in compliance with Section 9 (h) at all times relevant hereto.\" 103 N. L. R. B., at 847, n. 2.\n\nIn August 1953 an indictment was returned against Ben Gold, an officer of the union, charging that the 9 (h) affidavit which he filed with the Board on August 30, 1950, was false. In 1954 Gold was convicted for that offense.\n2\n Thereafter, the Board ordered the union to show cause why its compliance status under the Act should not be altered, unless Gold were removed from office. The union re-elected Gold as its president. Shortly thereafter the Board declared the union out of compliance with 9 (h). 108 N. L. R. B. 1190, 1191. The union then obtained from the District Court for the District of Columbia a preliminary injunction enjoining the Board from altering or restricting the union's compliance status by reason of Gold's conviction. The Court of Appeals \n\n[352 \nU.S. 153, 155]\n\u00a0\n affirmed. Farmer v. International Fur & Leather Workers Union, 95 U.S. App. D.C. 308, 221 F.2d 862.\n\nThe Board sought a stay of the preliminary injunction pending decision by the Court of Appeals in the Farmer case. When the stay was denied, the Board petitioned the court below, pursuant to 10 (e) of the Act, for enforcement of the unfair labor practice order. Respondent Lannom Mfg. Co. moved for dismissal of the enforcement petition on the grounds of Gold's conviction for false filing under 9 (h). The union intervened and opposed the motion to dismiss.\n\nThe court below granted the motion to dismiss, holding that, since the falsity of the affidavit had been proved, the requirements of 9 (h) had not been met and no benefits should be accorded the union. We granted certiorari. \n351 \nU.S. 905\n.\n\nAs noted, the complaint in the unfair labor practice proceeding was issued in February 1952, more than twelve months after the affidavit of August 30, 1950. Section 9 (h) provides that no investigation shall be made or complaint issued on behalf of a union unless there is on file with the Board a non-Communist affidavit of each officer \"executed contemporaneously or within the preceding twelve-month period.\" There was no charge against Gold for filing a false affidavit in 1951. The Court of Appeals met that difficulty by presuming that a person who was a Communist in 1950 continued as such through 1951 and through the critical date of February 1952, in absence of evidence showing a change in the factual situation.\n3\n 226 F.2d 194, 198-199. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 153, 156]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe petitioner has also urged that Gold's conviction for filing a false affidavit could form no basis for holding the union in decompliance prior to the affirmance of Gold's conviction on appeal. At the time of the decision below, Gold's appeal was pending in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. As noted,\n4\n we have granted certiorari to review the affirmance of his conviction.\n\nFor the reasons stated in Leedom v. International Union, ante, p. 145, we conclude that the sole sanction for the filing of a false affidavit under 9 (h) is the criminal penalty imposed on the officer who files a false affidavit, not decompliance of the union nor the withholding of the benefits of the Act that are granted once the specified officer file their 9 (h) affidavits. Having so concluded, we find it unnecessary to reach the collateral phases of this controversy.\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In February 1955 this union merged with Amalgamated Meat Cutters & Butcher Workers of North America, petitioner in this case.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The judgment of conviction was affirmed by an equally divided Court of Appeals, sitting en banc.

Yet to indulge in the presumption that he was therefore guilty of committing a criminal offense a year later in filing the 1951 affidavit is further than I can go on the record before us.\" 226 F.2d, at 200.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Note 2, supra.\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, concurring.\n\nI agree that decompliance of the union is not a sanction authorized by 9 (h). But this case presents another consideration that cannot be overlooked in the due administration of justice and that, standing alone, would lead me to reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals. As stated below in the dissenting opinion of Judge Stewart:\n\n \"A court of competent jurisdiction has found that Gold's affidavit of August 30, 1950, was false. The critical date as to compliance with 9 (h) of the National Labor Relations Act as amended was the date of issuance of the Board's complaint. N. L. R. B. v. Dant, \n344 \nU.S. 375\n . . . . If the complaint had issued during the twelve month period while this false affidavit was in effect, the question before us would be clear cut. That, however, is not the case. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 153, 157]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n \"In August of 1951 Gold filed a new non-Communist affidavit, and it was during the effective period of that affidavit that the complaint in this case issued. No court has found that affidavit to be false. It is true that the Board found in 1954 that the Union was not at that time in compliance with 9 (h). Assuming the Board had power to make such a finding, and assuming further that it be considered a finding that the 1951 affidavit was false, it must, I should think, be supported, like any Board finding, by substantial evidence, considering the record as a whole. We have no such record before us. Indeed, it appears that the question of the truth or falsity of the 1951 affidavit has never been heard on the merits.

The Court of Appeals affirmed. While a review was pending in this Court, the Solicitor General moved that the case be remanded to the District Court for a determination as to the credibility of the testimony of one of the government witnesses at the trial. He stated that the Government believes that the testimony of this witness at the trial \"was entirely truthful and credible,\" but that, on the basis of information in its possession, the Government now has serious reason to doubt the truthfulness of testimony given by the same witness in other proceedings. Parts of the testimony of this witness in other proceedings were positively established as untrue, and the Solicitor General stated on the argument that he believed other parts to be untrue. Petitioners moved that the case be remanded to the District Court for a new trial Held: Solely on the basis of the Government's representations in its written motion and the statements of the Solicitor General during the argument on the motions, and without reaching any other issue, the Government's motion is denied, the judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded to the District Court with instructions to grant petitioners a new trial.

CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe decision here in passes only on the integrity of a criminal trial in the federal courts. It does not determine the guilt or innocence of the petitioners, and we do not reach other issues propounded in the lengthy briefs or which may be present in the trial record of 5,147 pages. The Solicitor General of the United States moved to remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings because of untruthful testimony given before other tribunal by Joseph D. Mazzei, a Government witness in this case. The counter-motion of petitioners asked for a new trial. The decision is based entirely upon the representations of the Government in its written motion and on the statements of the Solicitor General during the argument on the motions.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nThe petitioners were charged in a one-count indictment in the District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania with conspiracy to violate the Smith Act.\n2\n They \n\n[352 \nU.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n were convicted, and the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, sitting en banc, affirmed by a divided court. 223 F.2d 449. This Court granted the petition for writ of certiorari, \n350 \nU.S. 922\n, and the case was scheduled for argument on October 10, 1956.\n\nOn September 27, 1956, the Solicitor General of the United States filed a motion calling the attention of the Court to the testimony given in other proceedings by Mazzei, who was one of the seven witnesses for the Government in this case. In his motion, he stated that the Government, on the information in its possession, now has serious reason to doubt the truthfulness of Mazzei's testimony in those proceedings. While adhering to its position that \"the testimony given by Mazzei at the trial [in this case] was entirely truthful and credible,\" the motion stated that \"these incidents, taken cumulatively, lead us to suggest that the issue of his truthfulness at the trial of these petitioners should now be determined by the District Court after a hearing.\"\n\nThe material cited by the Government indicating the untruthfulness of Mazzei on occasions other than this trial can best be presented by setting forth verbatim the description of these incidents presented in the Motion of the Government to Remand:\n\n \"On June 18, 1953, Mazzei testified before the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, in Washington, D.C., that, at a meeting of the Civil Rights Congress on December 4, 1952, one Louis \n\n[352 \nU.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n Bortz told him that he, Bortz, had been `selected by the Communist Party to do a job in the liquidation of Senator Joseph McCarthy.' Mazzei further testified that the said Bortz conducted Communist Party classes in Pittsburgh to familiarize Party members with the handling of firearms and to instruct them in the construction of bombs.\n\n\n \"On November 14, 1952, Mazzei pleaded guilty to charges of adultery and bastardy in a Pennsylvania state court. This fact was brought out during his cross-examination at the petitioners' trial. On October 2, 1953 - after the completion of the trial - Mazzei filed a petition in the state court to have the guilty plea set aside. One of the grounds set forth in his petition was that he `was not guilty of the charge to which he was induced to plead * * * but did so only in his official capacity (as a Government informant) at the insistence of his superior in the FBI to avoid testifying.' At a hearing on the above petition on October 6, 1953, a Special Agent of the FBI denied Mazzei's allegations under oath. Mazzei's petition was dismissed by the court on October 6, 1953.\n\n\n \"In November 1953, Mazzei, at a secret proceeding, identified a certain Government official as a long-time active Communist Party member.\n\n\n \"On June 10 and 11, 1955, Mazzei testified before the Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security regarding possible Communist influences motivating attempts to discredit Justice Michael Musmanno of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. In the course of his testimony, Mazzei identified John J. Mullen, National Director, Political Action Committee, Steel Workers of America, as a member of the Communist Party in Pittsburgh during the period that Mazzei \n\n[352 \nU.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n was a Government informant. Mazzei also testified that since 1942 he met Mullen ten or fifteen times a year, as a fellow Communist Party member.\n\n\n \"On July 2, 1956, Mazzei testified in disbarment proceedings against one Leo Sheiner before the Circuit Court of the Eleventh Judicial Circuit of Florida, in Miami. On cross-examination, Mazzei reiterated his charge that he was induced to plead guilty to the adultery and bastardy charge in the Pennsylvania state court in November 1952 by an Agent of the FBI. Items of his testimony as to alleged Communist activity are as follows: - that he visited Dade County, Florida, on behalf of the Communist Party during each of the years from 1946 to 1952; that the Communist Party in Miami had attempted to lease a bus line which served the Opa-locka Air Base; that in 1948 the Communist Party made plans for the armed invasion of the United States on orders from the Soviet Union and that he, Mazzei, was selected to go to Miami in 1948 because it was a seaport; that he took courses in the Communist Party on sabotage, espionage, and handling arms and ammunition; that he was taught by officers of the Communist Party in Pittsburgh how to blow bridges, poison water in reservoirs, and to eliminate people; that he discussed with Sheiner in 1948 `knocking off' a Judge Holt (a Florida judge) whom they (presumably the Communist Party) were having trouble with, and importing one Louis Bortz, the strong-arm man for the Communist Party, to do the job; that he and the Communist Party had made plans to assassinate Senators, Congressmen, and even went to Washington and beat up a Senator; and that, to his knowledge, Sheiner was extensively engaged in Communist Party activities in 1945, 1947, 1950, 1951, and 1952. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n None of this testimony at the Florida proceeding is supported or corroborated by information in the possession of the Government.\n\n\n \"Mazzei likewise testified that the FBI arranged to get him into the Army so that he could watch a certain Communist Party member; that he never wore a uniform and that he was discharged the day after the Communist Party member he was to watch was discharged. In actual fact, Mazzei's career in the Army was the result of the operation of the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 and the FBI had nothing to do with his service in the armed forces. He also testified that sometimes the FBI paid him about $1,000 a month for expenses. From the period 1942 to 1952, according to the Bureau records, Mazzei was paid the total of $172.05 as expense money.\n\n\n \"Mazzei likewise testified that he had never been arrested in his life. In fact, he was arrested in connection with the paternity case brought against him in Pennsylvania by one Irene Corva. He has been arrested several times subsequent to this for his failure to make support payments to this woman.\"\n\n\n On the argument of the motion the Solicitor General, in response to questions by the Court, stated with commendable candor that he believed the testimony given by Mazzei on June 18, 1953, before the Senate Committee concerning \"the liquidation of Senator Joseph McCarthy\" was untrue. He likewise stated that he believed the testimony given by Mazzei on July 2, 1956, in the Circuit Court of Florida was untrue. And in addition to the Solicitor General's personal opinion, the text of the motion itself shows that the Department of Justice is certain that some of Mazzei's post-trial testimony was contrary to the facts. The Pennsylvania statement of \n\n[352 \nU.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n October 2, 1953, concerning his conviction of adultery and bastardy was controverted under oath at that hearing by an agent of the FBI. Mazzei again asserted in the Florida proceeding that he was induced to plead guilty to the adultery charge by an agent of the FBI. In the Florida testimony, he said that the FBI sometimes paid him a thousand dollars a month for expenses, whereas the records of the Bureau showed he was paid a total of $172.05 as expense money. He also testified there that the FBI arranged to put him in the Army to spy on a Party member, whereas the FBI had nothing to do with his Army service; he had been inducted in accordance with the Selective Service Act. All these discrepancies are pointed out in the motion, as quoted above.\n\nAs to his bizarre testimony in the Florida proceeding concerning sabotage, espionage, handling of arms and ammunition, and plots to assassinate Senators, Congressmen, and a state judge, the Government's motion suggests that none of it is worthy of belief by stating therein: \"None of this testimony at the Florida proceeding is supported or corroborated by information in the possession of the Government.\"\n\nAt the oral argument, however, the Solicitor General stated that although he believed all of this testimony to be untrue, he was not prepared to say the witness Mazzei was guilty of perjury in giving the testimony; that his untrue statements might have been caused by a psychiatric condition, and that such condition might have arisen subsequent to the time of this trial. The Solicitor General, in the light of this position, asked to have the argument on the main case stricken from the calendar and the case remanded to the District Court for a full consideration of the credibility of the testimony of witness Mazzei. Commendable as the action of the Solicitor General was in promptly bringing the matter to our \n\n[352 \nU.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n attention when it came to the attention of his office,\n3\n we do not believe the disposition of the case suggested by him should be made.\n\nEither this Court or the District Court should accept the statements of the Solicitor General as indicating the unreliability of this Government witness. The question of whether his untruthfulness in these other proceedings constituted perjury or was caused by a psychiatric condition can make no material difference here. Whichever explanation might be found to be correct in this regard, Mazzei's credibility has been wholly discredited by the disclosures of the Solicitor General. No other conclusion is possible. The dignity of the United States Government will not permit the conviction of any person on tainted testimony. This conviction is tainted, and there can be no other just result than to accord petitioners a new trial.\n\nIt must be remembered that we are not dealing here with a motion for a new trial initiated by the defense, under Rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, presenting untruthful statements by a Government witness subsequent to the trial as newly discovered evidence affecting his credibility at the trial. Such an allegation by the defense ordinarily will not support a motion for a new trial, because new evidence which is \"merely cumulative or impeaching\" is not, according to the often-repeated statement of the courts, an adequate basis for the grant of a new trial.\n4\n\u00a0\n\n[352 \nU.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n\n\nHere we have an entirely different situation. The witness Mazzei was a paid informer of the Government - he had been in its employ from 1942 to 1953 for the purpose of infiltrating the Communist Party and reporting the facts found. He testified in this case in that capacity, as a Government witness. It is the Government which now questions the credibility of its own witness because in other proceedings in the same field of activity he gave certain testimony - some parts of it positively established as untrue and other parts of it believed by the Solicitor General to be untrue. The Solicitor General conceded that without Mazzei's testimony in this case the conviction of two of the petitioners cannot stand, but he argued that as to the other three Mazzei's evidence may not have had a substantial effect. But the trial judge believed Mazzei's testimony was material against them for, over objection, he admitted it against all the defendants. There were only seven witnesses. The testimony of Mazzei, at least, gave flesh-and-blood reality to the mass of Communist literature read to the jury to show advocacy of violence by the Communist Party.\n5\n This being so, it cannot be determined \n\n[352 \nU.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n conclusively by any court that his testimony was insignificant in the general case against the defendants. Thus it has tainted the trial as to all petitioners. As we said last Term in Communist Party v. Subversive Activities Control Board;\n\n \"When uncontested challenge is made that a finding of subversive design by petitioner was in part the product of three perjurious witnesses, it does not remove the taint for a reviewing court to find that there is ample innocent testimony to support the Board's findings. If these witnesses in fact committed perjury in testifying in other cases on subject matter substantially like that of their testimony in the present proceedings, their testimony in this proceeding is inevitably discredited and the Board's determination must duly take this fact into account.\" \n351 \nU.S. 115, 124\n.\n\n\n There we remanded to the Subversive Activities Control Board for reconsideration of its original determination in \n\n[352 \nU.S. 1, 12]\n\u00a0\n the light of the record shorn of the tainted testimony. But there the Board, an administrative agency, was the original finder of fact. Here, on the other hand, in a criminal case, the original finder of fact was a jury. The district judge is not the proper agency to determine that there was sufficient evidence at the trial, other than that given by Mazzei, to sustain a conviction of any of the petitioners. Only the jury can determine what it would do on a different body of evidence, and the jury can no longer act in this case.\n6\n For this reason, as well as that stated in the preceding paragraph, if on a remand the District Court should rule that the verdict against some of the petitioners could stand, we would be obliged, on a subsequent appeal, to reverse and, at that late date, direct that a new trial be granted.\n7\n This case was instituted \n\n[352 \nU.S. 1, 13]\n\u00a0\n four and one-half years ago; petitioners have been proceeding in forma pauperis. The interests of justice could not be served by a remand that must prove futile.\n\nIt might be different if we could see in this case any factual issue upon which the District Court, on a remand, could make an unassailable finding that Mazzei's other falsehoods were differentiated from his testimony herein. But it is not within the realm of reason to expect the district judge to determine, as the Government indicated it would ask him to do, that the witness Mazzei testified truthfully in this case in 1953 as an undercover informer concerning the activities of the Communist conspiracy, yet concurrently appeared in the same role in another tribunal and testified falsely - possibly because of a psychiatric condition - about a plan by different members of the Communist conspiracy to assassinate a United States Senator.\n8\n That would be an unreasonable determination to make even though the judge might believe that Mazzei's bizarre testimony in 1956 concerning plans for the assassination of other officials, the destruction of bridges, training in sabotage and handling arms, and the poisoning of water in reservoirs, all to destroy the Government of the United States, was the product of a mental or emotional condition \n\n[352 \nU.S. 1, 14]\n\u00a0\n that had developed only after the time of this trial.\n\nMazzei, by his testimony, has poisoned the water in this reservoir, and the reservoir cannot be cleansed without first draining it of all impurity. This is a federal criminal case, and this Court has supervisory jurisdiction over the proceedings of the federal courts.\n9\n If it has any duty to perform in this regard, it is to see that the waters of justice are not polluted. Pollution having taken place here, the condition should be remedied at the earliest opportunity.\n\n\"The untainted administration of justice is certainly one of the most cherished aspects of our institutions. Its observance is one of our proudest boasts. This Court is charged with supervisory functions in relation to proceedings in the federal courts. See McNabb v. United States, \n318 \nU.S. 332\n. Therefore, fastidious regard for the honor of the administration of justice requires the Court to make certain that the doing of justice be made so manifest that only irrational or perverse claims of its disregard can be asserted.\" Communist Party v. Subversive Activities Control Board, \n351 \nU.S. 115, 124\n.\n\n\n The government of a strong and free nation does not need convictions based upon such testimony. It cannot afford to abide with them. The interests of justice call for a reversal of the judgments below with direction to grant the petitioners a new trial.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE BRENNAN took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Court directed that oral argument on the motions be heard at the time previously scheduled for the argument on the merits. \n352 \nU.S. 808\n. MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, believing the motion should be granted without argument, filed a dissent.\n\nAfter hearing argument on the motions, October 10, 1956, the Court recessed to consider the matter, following which its decision to order a new trial was announced from the bench. \n352 \nU.S. 862\n. Argument on the merits, therefore, was not heard. MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, MR. JUSTICE BURTON, and MR. JUSTICE HARLAN dissented from the denial of the Government's motion to remand.\n\nThis opinion has been written to amplify the decision announced October 10, 1956. It should be noted that MR. JUSTICE MINTON participated in the consideration and decision of the motions, voting in favor of the order of the Court. On October 15, 1956, prior to the writing of this opinion, he retired from the Court. Therefore he did not participate in the consideration of this opinion.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] It was alleged that between 1945 and the date of the indictment the petitioners had conspired to advocate the overthrow of the Government \n\n[352 \nU.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n of the United States by force and violence and to organize a society or group, the Communist Party, devoted to that purpose. The trial judge ruled that the organization charge was barred by the statute of limitations, but that evidence concerning the 1945 organization of the Communist Party, as well as earlier events, was admissible in determining whether petitioners had conspired to advocate violence.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The Solicitor General's motion stated that his office came into possession of \"the history of Mazzei's post-trial testimony\" less than ten days before the motion was filed. With one exception, the motion does not indicate when other units of the Department of Justice acquired their information of Mazzei's conduct.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] See, e. g., United States v. Johnson, 142 F.2d 588, 592, cert. dismissed, \n323 \nU.S. 806\n; United States v. Rutkin, 208 F.2d 647, \n\n[352 \nU.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n 654; United States v. Frankfeld, 111 F.

Johnson, \n327 \nU.S. 106, 110\n-111, n. 4 and n. 5.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Although we have not examined the evidence in this case, in view of the disposition made, we deem it appropriate to consider herein the nature of Mazzei's testimony, since petitioners' counter-motion referred us to the appropriate pages of the transcript. The same pages had also been cited in the main briefs of both parties in summarizing the evidence.\n\nMazzei testified quite specifically about statements by defendants Careathers and Dolsen, made in classes each had taught at a Communist Party school he had attended in 1943 or in private conversations each had had with him at that time.\n\nCareathers taught in his class, Mazzei testified, about the part \n\n[352 \nU.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n the Negro people would play in bringing about a revolution. [Tr. 1940-1941.] Dolsen told his class, with Careathers present, that the only way a revolution could come about would be by violent overthrow of the government, with the Communist Party helping. [Tr. 1923.] Mazzei related other details of Dolsen's teaching, and passages were read to the jury which he said Dolsen had read to the class from the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. [Tr. 1922-1923, 1936-1938.]\n\nMazzei told how Dolsen and Careathers had each given him private instruction after class, because each was unsatisfied with his understanding of a lesson in Dolsen's class. Mazzei related that each had told him in these separate private sessions that a revolution in this country could only come by armed violence, and that it would be with the help of the Communist Party and the Soviet Union. [Tr. 1940, 1943.] Mazzei also testified that Dolsen had told him, on an auto trip, that if a revolution came about, he would not hesitate to kill, as he had done in China, where he had worked with the Communist Party. [Tr. 1945.]\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Cf. Gordon v. United States, \n344 \nU.S. 414, 422\n-423.\n\nThe present situation is different from that in United States v. Flynn, 130 F. Supp. 412, reargument denied, 131 F. Supp. 742. There the defense moved for a new trial on the basis of an affidavit in which a witness recanted his testimony after the trial. The Government charged that the recantation, rather than the testimony it contradicted, was the lie. Hence there was a factual issue to be determined at the outset, unlike the present case, where there is no conflict between the trial testimony and the subsequent matter brought forward by the Government as bearing on credibility. This difference has been recognized by the courts as calling for the application of different tests in passing on a motion for new trial, even without the added distinction of this case that it is the Government which questions the witness's credibility. See, e. g., United States v. Johnson, 142 F.2d 588, 591-592, cert. dismissed, \n323 \nU.S. 806\n; United States v. Hiss, 107 F. Supp. 128, 136, aff'd, 201 F.2d 372. Therefore, we express no opinion as to the procedure followed by Judge Dimock in the Flynn case.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Cf. Remmer v. United States, \n347 \nU.S. 227, 348\n U.S. 904, \n350 \nU.S. 377\n.\n\nBecause the situation raised by the Solicitor General's motion is quite distinct from that of the ordinary defense motion for new trial, see pp. 9-11, supra, we would not consider ourselves bound on a \n\n[352 \nU.S. 1, 13]\n\u00a0\n review of the District Court's ruling in this situation by the limitations expressed with reference to the defense motion in United States v. Johnson, \n327 \nU.S. 106\n.\n\nSee also note 6, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] The trial of petitioners started February 24, 1953. Mazzei testified against petitioners on March 26, 27, and 30. It was on June 18 that he testified before the Senate Committee. On July 9, a motion for a mistrial was made on the basis of the prejudice alleged to be caused petitioners by the publicity given the June 18 testimony of Mazzei concerning the assassination of Senator McCarthy. Mistrial was denied. The jury found petitioners guilty on August 20. They were sentenced on August 25, on which date motions for new trial were denied.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Cf. McNabb v. United States, \n318 \nU.S. 332, 340\n-341; Thiel v. Southern Pacific Co., \n328 \nU.S. 217, 225\n. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 1, 15]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, with whom MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER and MR. JUSTICE BURTON join, dissenting.\n\nWhen the Court's order denying the Government's motion to remand, and granting the petitioners a new trial, was announced by THE CHIEF JUSTICE on October 10, MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, MR. JUSTICE BURTON and I dissented.\n1\n We reserved our right to file an opinion stating our reasons for thinking that the Government's motion should have been granted. This is that opinion.\n\nOn August 20, 1953, after a lengthy jury trial, petitioners were convicted of violating the Smith Act and the general federal conspiracy statute, 54 Stat. 670, 671, 18 U.S.C. 2385, 371, by conspiring to advocate the overthrow of the United States Government by force and violence. The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, sitting en banc, affirmed by a divided vote.\n2\n This Court granted certiorari.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nOn September 27, 1956, about two weeks before the case was scheduled for argument, the Solicitor General filed a motion asking us to remand the case to the District Court for a hearing as to the truthfulness and credibility of one Mazzei, a government informant and witness at the trial. The occasion for this motion was that the Solicitor General's office, some ten days before, had come into possession of information which led it seriously to doubt the correctness of certain testimony given by Mazzei in various independent proceedings, all but one of which occurred after the trial, as to his relations with Communists and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n4\n\u00a0\n\n[352 \nU.S. 1, 16]\n\u00a0\n In its motion papers the Government stated that while it still believed that Mazzei's testimony at the trial had been \"entirely truthful and credible,\" his post-trial testimony in these other proceedings was such as to \"lead us to suggest that the issue of his truthfulness at the trial of these petitioners should now be determined by the District Court after a hearing.\" Petitioners' answer to this motion was that, while they considered themselves entitled to a judgment of acquittal or a new trial on the basis of the Government's disclosures, disposition of the Government's motion should nevertheless await this Court's decision on the issues brought here by the writ of certiorari.\n\nOn October 8, the Court directed that the Government's motion be heard orally at the threshold of the main case. My brother FRANKFURTER, who felt that the motion should have been granted forthwith, filed a dissenting memorandum.\n5\n When the matter was heard by the Court on October 10, the positions taken by the Government and the defense were as follows: The Government was not yet prepared to say that Mazzei had committed \n\n[352 \nU.S. 1, 17]\n\u00a0\n perjury either at the trial or in any of the collateral proceedings.\n6\n Conceivably, the Solicitor General thought, it might turn out that Mazzei was a psychiatric case. The Solicitor General pointed out that the petitioners had \n\n[352 \nU.S. 1, 18]\n\u00a0\n not previously moved for a new trial on the grounds relied upon in the Government's motion, although much of the later information as to Mazzei was known to them at the time of their motion for reargument in the Court of Appeals. Even so, the Solicitor General felt that in the broader interests of justice it was his duty to pursue the matter as soon as it came to his knowledge that a cloud was cast upon Mazzei's truthfulness or credibility.\n7\n If he had been satisfied that Mazzei was a perjurer, \n\n[352 \nU.S. 1, 19]\n\u00a0\n the Solicitor General stated, he would have recommended that this Court reverse the convictions of two of the petitioners (Careathers and Dolsen). Since he was not so satisfied, he thought the proper procedure was to remand the case to the District Court for full exploration of the truthfulness and credibility of this witness.\n8\n As to the other three petitioners, the Solicitor General regarded Mazzei's trial testimony of so little importance that the trial court, even if it found Mazzei was a perjurer, would have to review the entire case against them before ordering a new trial. Petitioners' position was that if this Court was unwilling to hear the main case on the merits, it should, without more, deny the Government's motion and reverse the convictions with directions for acquittal or at least a new trial. At the conclusion of the oral argument on the motion to remand, the Court recessed \n\n[352 \nU.S. 1, 20]\n\u00a0\n to consider the matter, following which its decision denying the Government's motion was announced from the bench.\n\nWe are in full agreement that the Court properly refused to pass on the merits of the case until this cloud upon the integrity of the convictions had been dissolved. Communist Party v. Subversive Activities Control Board, \n351 \nU.S. 115\n. What we object to is that this Court itself should have undertaken to deal with the subtle and complicated issues presented by the Government's motion instead of sending the case back to the District Court for the determination of these issues after a full investigation. It is fitting that we state our reasons for this view.\n\n1. We believe that the reversal of these convictions represents an unprecedented and dangerous departure from sound principles of judicial administration. The Court has overturned the results of a complex, protracted, and expensive trial before any investigation has been made of the suspicions which the Solicitor General brought to the attention of the Court promptly after the facts giving rise to them came to his notice. We find the Court's justification of its summary action unconvincing.\n\nThe basic justification given is that \"either this Court or the District Court should accept the statements of the Solicitor General as indicating the unreliability of this Government witness.\" In effect, the Court has treated the case as if the Solicitor General had conceded the untrustworthiness of Mazzei's testimony at the trial. To us this reflects a misunderstanding of the Solicitor General's position. As to Mazzei's trial testimony, the Solicitor General - whose forthrightness and candor no one could doubt, and whose conduct in this situation has been commended by this Court - represented that the Government did not consider it yet had sufficient basis for regarding such testimony \n\n[352 \nU.S. 1, 21]\n\u00a0\n as untruthful. As to Mazzei's testimony in collateral proceedings, the Solicitor General, while stating his personal belief that some of it was untruthful, represented that he could not responsibly say whether such testimony involved perjury rather than psychopathic imbalance, and, if the latter, when that condition first arose or whether it was of such a character as to affect Mazzei's competency as a witness. In short, we think it abundantly clear that the Solicitor General conceded no more than that the situation was one that called for a thorough investigation.\n\nWe also observe that the Court finds that \"no other conclusion is possible\" than that \"Mazzei's credibility has been wholly discredited,\" and that some parts of his post-trial testimony have been \"positively established as untrue.\" We do not see how these conclusions can be reached in the face of the Government's representation that it still believes Mazzei's trial testimony to have been \"entirely truthful and credible,\" and without the production of any evidence, or the examination and cross-examination of Mazzei and those who contradicted him, as to the post-trial episodes which have been called in question. Nor can we agree with the manner in which the Court has dealt with the Solicitor General's contentions as to petitioners Mesarosh, Albertson and Weissman. The Court simply says that Mazzei's testimony against Careathers and Dolsen was of such a character that, having been admitted against all defendants, it tainted the whole trial. But we cannot understand how this can be said short of a painstaking appraisal of the entire record which the Court acknowledges it has not read. The Court was quite right not to read the record, for in our view this was not the business of this Court, but that of the District Court; but by the same token, we think, the decision as to whether a new trial was justified was also, in the first instance, the business of the District Court. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 1, 22]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn the Communist Party case, supra, where there were undenied charges of perjury, we did not undertake to resolve those charges here, but instead sent the case back to the Board for exploration. We think a similar course should have been followed in this case. The Court suggests that the situation presented here differs from that in the Communist Party case, in that there the Board was the trier of the facts, whereas here it was for the jury, not the court, to weigh the truthfulness and credibility of Mazzei's trial testimony. This, however, overlooks the fact that as a preliminary to a new trial it must first be determined whether any of Mazzei's collateral testimony, now drawn in question, so reflects upon the truthfulness or credibility of his trial testimony as to warrant submission of the case to a new jury. That preliminary determination has always been recognized as the function of the trial court. United States v. Johnson, \n327 \nU.S. 106\n; United States v. Troche, 213 F.2d 401; United States v. Rutkin, 208 F.2d 647; Gordon v. United States, 178 F.2d 896, cert. denied, \n339 \nU.S. 935\n.\n9\n\u00a0\n\nFinally, the Court suggests that a different result might have been required if it were dealing with a defense motion for a new trial. However, we fail to see why the Government's motion, which was prompted by a desire to ascertain the true facts in all their ramifications, and which is aimed at the possibility of a new trial, calls for a different result or procedure than a defense motion for a new trial based on similar suspicions.\n\n2. The District Court was the proper forum for the kind of investigation which should have been conducted here. This Court, and for that matter the Courts of Appeals, are \n\n[352 \nU.S. 1, 23]\n\u00a0\n ill-equipped for such a task. We need say no more than that appellate courts have no facilities for the examination of witnesses; nor in the nature of things can they have that intimate knowledge of the evidence and \"feel\" of the trial scene, which are so essential to sound judgment upon matters of such complexity and subtlety as those involved here, and which are possessed by the trial court alone.\n\n3. Certainly there is no room for doubting the Solicitor General's good faith in this matter, or for supposing that the conduct of the further proceedings below would fall short of the highest standards of criminal justice. We have the Solicitor General's assurance that all of the Government's information bearing upon Mazzei's truthfulness and credibility would be made available to the defense, subject to appropriate safeguards.\n10\n As to the end result, \n\n[352 \nU.S. 1, 24]\n\u00a0\n the Solicitor General stated that in his view the trial court would have to acquit petitioners Careathers and Dolsen if it found that Mazzei had perjured himself at the trial or had then been incompetent to testify, and as to the other petitioners might have to order a new trial.\n11\n We need not consider at this time whether the Solicitor General's statement exhausts all of the factors that might require a new trial. Suffice it to say that we regard the Solicitor General's approach to this difficult situation as unexceptionable; and it is hardly to be assumed that the District Court would not do its full duty or would fall into error. We need only add that had the Government's \n\n[352 \nU.S. 1, 25]\n\u00a0\n motion been granted this Court would no doubt have accompanied its remand with appropriate instructions to guide the District Court in coping with this complicated problem. And surely the fact that this case has been long-drawn-out does not justify short-circuiting normal and orderly judicial procedures. The procedure adopted in United States v. Flynn, 130 F. Supp. 412, 131 F. Supp. 742, commends itself to us as a proper means of dealing with problems such as those raised by the Solicitor General's motion. We do not, of course, even remotely imply that we give any tolerance to the notion that a criminal conviction found to be infected by tainted testimony should be allowed to stand. We do say that ascertainment of where the truth lies here requires the kind of probing that is beyond the facilities and practices of this Court.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons we dissent. We think that the Government's motion to remand should have been granted.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \n352 \nU.S. 862\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 223 F.2d 449.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] \n350 \nU.S. 922\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] One of these episodes took place before the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, in Washington, D.C., on June 18, 1953 (while the trial was still in progress). There Mazzei had testified that at a meeting of the Civil Rights Congress on December \n\n[352 \nU.S. 1, 16]\n\u00a0\n 4, 1952, one Louis Bortz (an alleged Communist Party functionary) told him that he, Bortz, had been \"selected by the Communist Party to do a job in the liquidation of Senator Joseph McCarthy.\" On the oral argument the Solicitor General told us that the Government was not prepared at the time of the trial to regard this testimony of Mazzei as a fabrication, because Bortz when questioned on this subject before the Senate Committee had pleaded his privilege, stating that the answers to the questions \"would\" incriminate him. It appears that Mazzei's Senate testimony was brought to the attention of the trial judge and that it was the basis of an unsuccessful defense motion for a mistrial. The Solicitor General further stated that it was not until the recent discovery of Mazzei's later testimony in the other post-trial collateral proceedings - particularly that given in certain Florida disbarment proceedings on July 2, 1956 - that his department began to have serious doubts as to Mazzei's truthfulness or credibility.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] \n352 \nU.S. 808\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] As to Mazzei's trial testimony, the Solicitor General stated: \"Before the witness [Mazzei] was presented to the [trial] court, his testimony was carefully appraised as to whether or not it was supported by any other material the Department had, and he was not contradicted. Although witnesses took the stand in behalf of the defendants his testimony was not contradicted at all, and that was one of the factors that bothered the Government in connection with these subsequent events that have caused us to conclude that this man's testimony should be carefully reexamined by the lower court in regard to validity at the time of the trial, because of what has occurred since, which, ordinarily, even though there was actual perjury, would not determine the validity of the testimony at the trial, depending upon what the circumstances were.\"\n\nAs to Mazzei's testimony in the collateral proceedings, the Solicitor General stated: \"We believe that his [1953 Senate] testimony in that regard [the McCarthy incident] was not credible in light of what happened later [in the Florida disbarment proceedings]. We do not know at this point whether or not there is something psychiatric about this situation. We are disturbed about that.\" The Solicitor General further stated that, while his \"personal belief is he [Mazzei] was not truthful\" in his testimony as to the McCarthy episode, \"I don't want it left on the record that I believe this man to be a perjurer, because I think in order to commit perjury you have to have the intent, and that is what disturbs me about this whole situation. I can't accept his testimony, over all these events [referring to Mazzei's Senate and Florida testimony], as being valid. But whether or not he knowingly does it with the intent [to commit perjury] is something else and that is what I can't follow through.\"\n\nAs to the possibility of Mazzei's being a psychopath: The Government's motion papers showed that in 1952 Mazzei had pleaded guilty to charges of adultery and bastardy in a Pennsylvania state court, and that this fact had been brought out at petitioners' trial. They further showed that in 1953, after petitioners' trial had ended, Mazzei had moved in the Pennsylvania court to set aside his former plea, alleging that he \"was not guilty of the charge to which he was induced to plead . . . but did so only in his official capacity (as a Government informant) at the insistence of his superior in the FBI \n\n[352 \nU.S. 1, 18]\n\u00a0\n to avoid testifying.\" These allegations, the Government informs us, were denied under oath by the F. B. I. and Mazzei's application to set aside his plea was denied by the Pennsylvania court. Further, the Government's motion papers here show that in the 1956 Florida disbarment proceedings Mazzei testified that the F. B. I. had arranged to get him into the Army so that he could watch a certain Communist Party member, whereas in fact Mazzei was drafted into the Army, and the F. B. I. had nothing to do with it. The Government states that in the same proceedings Mazzei testified that the F. B. I. paid him about $1,000 a month for expenses, whereas over the entire period from 1942 to 1952 the F. B. I. had paid him total expense money of only $172.05; and that Mazzei testified he had never been arrested, whereas in fact he had been arrested several times. As to these episodes the Solicitor General stated at the oral argument: \"It certainly seems to me that that is a very peculiar action, and that he [Mazzei] should have anticipated, even if he wanted to lie about it, that the FBI agent would be there promptly testifying to the facts. And so it is very unusual to me that a person normally, wanting to falsify, would do such a thing. But, I think the trial courts have examined into competency a good many times, and do it every day, and should be able to determine whether or not he was competent at the time.\" The Solicitor General also stated that he was \"disturbed about whether it [a psychopathic condition] occurred even back at the trial [of these petitioners], and I think the court should examine into that carefully.\" (The above, and similar quotations, are taken from the tape recording of the Solicitor General's oral argument before this Court, the writer's interpolations being indicated by brackets.)\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] As to this the Solicitor General stated: \"If I may say one word more in regard to that [the failure of the defense to move for a new trial], I feel that the obligation of the Government in a situation of \n\n[352 \nU.S. 1, 19]\n\u00a0\n this kind reaches far beyond the rights of these particular defendants, and it is its duty to this Court, and to the country, and it is our obligation in a situation of this kind, to try and see that justice is done. . . . We may be criticized for being too late, but I think it is never too late, to try to do justice. Having come to that conclusion [that the validity of this testimony is open to doubt], I think we should come before the courts, whichever one is proper, and try to get a correction of the wrong, if there is one.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] The Solicitor General stated: \"Well, we would have recommended that [reversal] to the Court if we had been satisfied ourselves that Mazzei's testimony at the time of trial - which we think was the determining point in the proper conduct of judicial proceedings - [was untruthful], . . . because we feel at least as to these two defendants [petitioners Careathers and Dolsen] there was no [other] basis for their conviction. But it is possible that something has happened to this man [Mazzei], that his uncontradicted testimony was valid at the time of trial, and it seemed to us that with a long case tried like this and the jury involved and the trial court and the courts of appeal, and so on, the proper thing to do was to send it back to the trial court for its examination carefully into this question to determine what the fact is, and then assume that he [the trial court] would do his duty, which I think he will, and have the case handled properly at the point.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Whatever may be the differences between the rules governing a motion for a new trial based upon recantation of trial testimony or other types of \"newly discovered\" evidence, ante, p. 12, n. 6, certainly none of those differences suggest that the trial court is not the proper tribunal for resolution of the issues presented by such a motion.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] In response to a question as to whether the defense would be furnished with all of the Government's information bearing on the truth of Mazzei's Senate testimony relating to the McCarthy incident, the Solicitor General stated: \"Well, that would depend on what the trial court thought should be done, I think, in the conduct of the case. The only reason I suggest that possibly it should not be made available to them is that in this whole problem there are several people involved who might get hurt by a public airing of their connection with this matter. And it would be too bad, and very unfortunate, if it wasn't handled so as not to injure those people when it isn't necessary to the proper handling of this problem. . . . We will do whatever this Court thinks we should do, but what I had in mind was to lay before the judge all of the information the Government has about the entire matter, and then he can sort out and protect the various innocent persons, who are described in the files, and should not be hurt in such a proceeding, and yet give them [the defendants] the benefit of the full and complete protection in such a proceeding as to what the facts are in this matter. . . . I had in mind that certain portions the judge would handle in camera so as to protect innocent people. And all others, that would reach into the merits of the situation, would certainly be handled by the court in such a way as to give all the parties an adequate opportunity to present their defense.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] The Solicitor General stated: \"Yes, without his [Mazzei's] testimony as to those defendants [Careathers and Dolsen], I do not think they could have been convicted. I think the court would have had to direct a verdict in their favor, at least. As to the other three defendants, there is practically no testimony by this witness. It is very slight. I could give it to the Court. . . . [It] seems to me the lower court would have to examine the situation and see . . . whether or not it [Mazzei's testimony] had an effect on the conviction of every one of the defendants. . . . It would seem to me that . . . the trial court could determine the extent of the effect that this witness might have had on the other defendants, because there was a large volume of testimony in regard to the other defendants that bore directly upon their participation in the conspiracy, and their overt acts; and the testimony of this witness was so limited as to even a reference - he said that they solicited money from him, two of them - and is so slight as to any direct connection with it, that it seems to me the court would have to weigh whether or not, under that situation, he would decide that there is a doubt in his mind, in which case I am sure he would [direct a new trial].\" In the absence of an exhaustive examination of the voluminous record, we are unable to understand how any adequate evaluation could be made of these considerations as to the petitioners Mesarosh, Albertson, and Weissman. When he was asked to \"assume\" that the trial court would find Mazzei to have been a perjurer, and his trial testimony to have been of importance in the conviction of these three petitioners, the Solicitor General promptly stated that he was \"satisfied\" that the court would set aside their convictions \"if he came to these conclusions.\"\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER.\n\nLess than six months ago, in Communist Party v. Control Board, \n351 \nU.S. 115\n, a case that raised important constitutional issues, this Court refused to pass on those \n\n[352 \nU.S. 1, 26]\n\u00a0\n issues when newly discovered evidence was alleged to demonstrate that the record out of which those issues arose was tainted. It did so in the following language:\n\n \"When uncontested challenge is made that a finding of subversive design by petitioner was in part the product of three perjurious witnesses, it does not remove the taint for a reviewing court to find that there is ample innocent testimony to support the Board's findings. If these witnesses in fact committed perjury in testifying in other cases on subject matter substantially like that of their testimony in the present proceedings, their testimony in this proceeding is inevitably discredited and the Board's determination must duly take this fact into account. We cannot pass upon a record containing such challenged testimony. . . .\" \n351 \nU.S., at 124\n-125.\n\n\n The Court in that case, over the protest of the Government, remanded the proceedings to the Subversive Activities Control Board so that it might consider the allegations against the witnesses and, if necessary, reassess the evidence purged of taint.\n\nIn this case, the Government itself has presented a motion to remand the case, alleging that one of its witnesses, Joseph Mazzei, since he testified in this case, \"has given certain sworn testimony (before other tribunals) which the Government, on the basis of the information in its possession, now has serious reason to doubt.\" Some of the occurrences on which the motion is based go back to 1953. (It should be noted that the petition for certiorari was filed in this Court on October 6, 1955.) Thus the action by the Government at this time may appear belated. This is irrelevant to the disposition of this motion. The fact is that the history of Mazzei's post-trial testimony did not come to the Solicitor General's \n\n[352 \nU.S. 1, 27]\n\u00a0\n notice until less than ten days before the presentation of this motion.\n*\n It would, I believe, have been a disregard of the responsibility of the law officer of the Government especially charged with representing the Government before this Court not to bring these disturbing facts to the Court's attention once they came to his attention.

It ought to be assumed that a Solicitor General would do this as a matter of course.\n\nThe Government in its motion sets forth the facts which lead it to urge remand. The Government lists five incidents of testimony by Mazzei between 1953 and 1956 about the activities of alleged Communists and about his own activities in behalf of the Federal Bureau of Investigation which it now \"has serious reason to doubt.\" The Government also notes that in the trial of this case Mazzei \"gave testimony which directly involved two of the petitioners, Careathers and Dolsen.\" Although the Government maintains \"that the testimony given by Mazzei at the trial was entirely truthful and credible,\" it deems the incidents it sets forth so significant that it asks that the issue of Mazzei's truthfulness be determined by the District Court after a hearing such as was held in a similar situation in United States v. Flynn, 130 F. Supp. 412.\n\nHow to dispose of the Government's motion raises a question of appropriate judicial procedure. The Court has concluded not to pass on the Solicitor General's motion \n\n[352 \nU.S. 1, 28]\n\u00a0\n at this time. It retains the motion to be heard at the outset of the argument of the case as heretofore set down. I deem it a more appropriate procedure that the motion be granted forthwith, with directions to the District Court to hear the issues raised by this motion. I feel it incumbent to state the reasons for this conviction. Argument can hardly disclose further information on which to base a decision on the motion. Furthermore, there may be controversy over the facts, and the judicial methods for sifting controverted facts are not available here. The basic principle of the Communist Party case that allegations of tainted testimony must be resolved before this Court will pass on a case is decisive. Indeed, the situation here is an even stronger one for application of that principle, for we have before us a statement by the Government that it \"now has serious reason to doubt\" testimony given in other proceedings by Mazzei, one of its specialists on Communist activities, and a further statement by the Government that Mazzei's testimony in this case \"directly involved two of the petitioners.\"\n\nThis Court should not even hypothetically assume the trustworthiness of the evidence in order to pass on other issues. There is more at stake here even than affording guidance for the District Court in this particular case. This Court should not pass on a record containing unresolved allegations of tainted testimony. The integrity of the judicial process is at stake. The stark issue of rudimentary morality in criminal prosecutions should not be lost in the melange of more than a dozen other issues presented by petitioners. And the importance of thus vindicating the scrupulous administration of justice as a continuing process far outweighs the disadvantage of possible delay in the ultimate disposition of this case. The case should be remanded now for a hearing before the trial judge.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] The motion for remand states: \"The complete details of Mazzei's testimony in Florida, as set forth in this motion, did not come to the attention of the Department of Justice until September 1956, and the history of Mazzei's post-trial testimony did not come to the Solicitor General's attention until less than ten days ago.\" \n\n[352 \nU.S. 1, 29]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","56":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMESAROSH v.

COMMISSIONER(1956)\nNo. 255\nArgued: March 1, 1956Decided: March 26, 1956\n\n\n\n\n In April 1924, petitioner leased land in New York City for 21 years, with an option to renew the lease for two further 21-year periods. In accordance with the terms of the lease, it erected a 22-story loft building at a cost of $3,000,000. The lease, as amended in 1935, provided for an annual rental of $118,840. Title to the building was in petitioner, but at the eventual termination of the lease it would vest, without payment, in the lessor, at the lessor's option. During the first 21-year period of the lease, petitioner fully depreciated the entire $3,000,000 cost of the building. In April 1945, it exercised its option to renew the lease until April 1966. In May 1945, it purchased the fee and obtained release from the obligations of the renewed lease, at a price of $2,100,000.

JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis case involves an interpretation of 23 (a) (1) (A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, as amended, 26 U.S.C. 23 (a) (1) (A), providing for the deduction from gross income, in computing net income, of all the \"ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred . . . in carrying on any trade or business . . . .\" The Commissioner determined a deficiency in petitioner's excess-profits tax for 1945; petitioner sought a redetermination of its liability in the Tax Court, which made the following findings of fact. In April 1924, petitioner leased land in New York City for 21 years, with an option to renew the lease for two further 21-year periods. In accordance with the terms of the lease, it erected a 22-story loft building at a cost of $3,000,000. The lease, as amended in 1935, provided for an annual rental of $118,840. Title to the building was in petitioner, but at the eventual termination of the lease it would vest, without payment, in the lessor, at the lessor's option. The lessor could also require petitioner to remove the building at that time. Petitioner had the obligation, in case of destruction of the building, to rebuild at its own cost. During the first 21-year period of the lease, petitioner fully depreciated the entire $3,000,000 cost of the building. In April 1945, it exercised its option to renew the lease until April 1966.\n\nIn May 1945, petitioner entered into an agreement with the owner whereby it purchased the fee and obtained release from the obligations of the renewed lease. The price paid was $2,100,000. The Tax Court also found that the value of the land, as unimproved, was $660,000 when purchased by petitioner in 1945.\n\nThe principal issues raised by petitioner relate to its attempt to deduct $1,440,000 - the difference between the \n\n[350 \nU.S. 456, 458]\n\u00a0\n purchase price under the May 1945 agreement and the 1945 value of the unimproved land - as an ordinary and necessary expense of doing business. The Tax Court held that the difference could not be so deducted, that the difference could not be amortized over the remaining term of the cancelled lease, and that no annual depreciation could be taken because the cost of the building had already been fully depreciated and the purchase price could not be separated into purchase price for building and purchase price for land. 21 T. C. 817. Six of the judges of the Tax Court dissented on the ground that \"[s]ome part of the purchase price should be allocated to the additional rights in the building acquired in the purchase . . . .\" 21 T. C., at 826.\n\nOn petition for review, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed and remanded. It affirmed the refusal to permit a deduction under 23 (a), but reversed the holding that no amount could be added to the asset value of the building for purposes of depreciation. Rejecting petitioner's argument that it should be allowed to amortize the $1,440,000 over the unexpired term of the cancelled lease, it accepted petitioner's alternative argument that depreciation over the remaining useful life of the building should be allowed. Stating that \"[o]n the present state of the record we cannot determine how much of the $2,100,000 purchase price is properly to be allocated to the land and how much to the building,\" it remanded the case to the Tax Court to fix the respective values. 221 F.2d 322, 324. Petitioner sought a writ of certiorari to review the disallowance of its claim for a deduction as a business expense or, alternatively, as amortization over the remaining period of the lease. The Government did not seek review of the allowance of depreciation of that portion of the purchase price allocable to the building over its remaining economic life. Because of the apparent conflict between the decision of the Court of Appeals for \n\n[350 \nU.S. 456, 459]\n\u00a0\n the Second Circuit in this case and the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Cleveland Allerton Hotel, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 166 F.2d 805, we granted certiorari, limited to the questions set forth in the margin.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nUnder the terms of the lease, petitioner had a 21-year lease on the land, with an option to renew, and similar rights in the building which it had constructed. Petitioner introduced evidence to show that the rent it was paying under the lease was greatly in excess of the fair rental value of the land as vacant, unimproved land. Petitioner contends that it already owned the building and that therefore the purchase agreement was entered into for the purpose of avoiding the excessive rentals of the lease. This transaction, it asserts, involved a current business expenditure, and the $1,440,000 in excess of the vacant land value represents what it was willing to pay to avoid this onerous lease.\n\nPetitioner's claim that it \"owned\" the building is based on a loose and misleading use of \"owned.\" The only way petitioner could continue to use the building after termination of the initial period of the lease was by renewing the lease, and the lease also circumscribed its control over the building. It could make use of the building for the remainder of its economic life, but only \n\n[350 \nU.S. 456, 460]\n\u00a0\n on payment of the stated rent. Petitioner's evidence with respect to the rental value of the land as unimproved is irrelevant. It was using the land as improved by the building; it was paying rent for the land as improved by the building. Petitioner tendered no evidence that it was paying excessive rent for what it was actually leasing. A complementary feature of the purchase of the lessor's interests in the land and building was the elimination of the obligation to pay rent on the improved land. The purchase price presumably reflected this situation. Whatever possible merit petitioner's contention might have were there proof of excessive purchase price can await such a case. The purchase price paid by petitioner represents the cost of acquiring the complete fee to the land and the building, and no deduction as an ordinary and necessary business expense can be taken.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nPetitioner claims that even if it cannot get a deduction as an ordinary and necessary business expense under 23 (a) or as a loss under 23 (f), it should be allowed to amortize the excess of the payment of $2,100,000 above the determined land value of $660,000 over the 21-year remaining term of the extinguished lease. What petitioner acquired in this transaction, however, were both rights with respect to the land and rights with respect to the building. The Tax Court has not yet fixed that amount of the purchase price which is allocable to the acquisition of rights in the land and that which is allocable to the acquisition of rights in the building. These rights are assets with useful lives having no reference to the term of the lease. Successive steps of securing or renewing \n\n[350 \nU.S. 456, 461]\n\u00a0\n a lease and then purchasing the reversion should not result in amortization over the term of the lease when the purchase of the whole fee at one time would result in depreciation over the useful life of the asset, if the asset acquired were a wasting asset.\n\nUnder petitioner's contention, if the purchase had been consummated in 1944 before the first term of the lease had expired, the whole amount of the purchase price not allocable to the land would be amortized in one year. But it should make no difference whether the lease is about to expire or has just been renewed. In the one case, the value of the reversion is enhanced and the value of the right to receive the rent fixed by the lease is depressed because the lease is near an end. In the other case, the value of the reversion is depressed and the value of the right to receive the fixed rent is enhanced because the lease has many years to run. But although there might possibly be some difference in bargaining power between the two situations, the sum total of the rights purchased is the same in each case. Petitioner has acquired two assets - land and a building - whose use it will have for the remainder of their useful lives, and petitioner therefore cannot amortize the cost allocable to the acquisition of the wasting asset over the term of the extinguished lease.\n\nAccordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, leaving to the Tax Court the allocation still to be made.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"1. Where a lessee, the owner of a valuable building on leased land, acquires the fee to the land to be relieved of what it considers to be the burdensome terms of a lease, may the lessee deduct the excess of the payment over the determined value of the land at the date of purchase as an ordinary expense of doing business under 23 (a) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1939 or under 23 (f) as a loss on a transaction entered into for profit and not compensated for by insurance or otherwise.\n\n\"2. In the alternative, may the lessee-petitioner consider the excess payment over the determined value of the land to be in the nature of a prepayment of rent for the remaining term of the extinguished lease and amortize such amount over 21 years?\" \n350 \nU.S. 820\n.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Petitioner asserted, but did not argue, the permissibility of the deduction of the $1,440,000 as a loss under 23 (f). Such an assertion is apparently premised on the assumption that the $1,440,000 represents the sum paid for commutation of the rent payments under an onerous lease, and further discussion of this argument is unnecessary. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 456, 462]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","58":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMINE WORKERS v.

Findling, Dominick L. Manoli and Norton J. Come filed a brief for the National Labor Relations Board, as amicus curiae, urging reversal.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BURTON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe question before us is whether, in the case of an employer subject to the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, a state court may enjoin peaceful picketing of the employer's premises, undertaken by its employees and their union for the purpose of obtaining recognition of that union as the employees' bargaining representative, when the union holds cards authorizing such representation concededly signed by a majority of the employees eligible to be represented, but has filed none of the data or affidavits described in 9 (f), (g) and (h) of that \n\n[351 \nU.S. 62, 64]\n\u00a0\n Act, as amended.\n1\n For the reasons hereafter stated, our answer is in the negative.\n\nIn 1953, the respondent, Arkansas Oak Flooring Company, a Delaware corporation with its main office in Pine \n\n[351 \nU.S. 62, 65]\n\u00a0\n Bluff, Arkansas, owned and operated a sawmill and flooring plant in Alexandria, Louisiana. The company was there engaged in interstate commerce and subject to the National Labor Relations Act, as amended. At the same \n\n[351 \nU.S. 62, 66]\n\u00a0\n time, District 50, United Mine Workers of America, here called the \"union,\" was an unincorporated labor organization which undertook to organize the company's eligible employees at its Alexandria plant. The union, however, did not file with the Secretary of Labor any of the financial or organizational data described in 9 (f) and (g) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, nor, with the National Labor Relations Board, any of the non-Communist affidavits described in 9 (h) of that Act. It contended that the company, nevertheless, should recognize it as the collective-bargaining representative of the Alexandria plant employees because it was authorized by more than a majority of such employees to represent them.\n\nAlthough for four years there had been no labor organization representing the plant employees, this union, by February 24, 1954, held applications for membership from 174 of the 225 eligible employees. Such applicants had elected officers and stewards and had authorized the union organizer to request the company to recognize the union as their collective-bargaining representative. On February 24, the organizer, accordingly, presented that request to the assistant superintendent of the plant. The latter, in the absence of any higher officer of the company, replied that the union was not recognized either by the National Labor Relations Board or by him, and that, if negotiations were desired, the union organizer should call the company's office at Pine Bluff. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 62, 67]\n\u00a0\n\n\nOn March 1, the petitioning employees struck for recognition of the union and set up a peaceful picket line of three employees. Two were placed in front of the plant and one at the side. They carried signs stating \"This Plant is on Strike\" or \"We want Recognition, District 50 UMWA.\"\n\nOn March 2, respondent sought a restraining order and injunction in the Ninth Judicial District for the Parish of Rapides, Louisiana. That court promptly issued an order restraining the above-described picketing by 11 named employees, the union and its organizer. The order was obeyed but the strike continued. On March 12 and 15, evidence was introduced, including, by that date, 179 applications for membership in the union, each of which authorized the union to represent the signer in negotiations and in the making of agreements as to wages, hours and conditions of work. The parties to the proceeding stipulated that each of those applications was signed by an employee of respondent. In the face of that record, the court nevertheless converted its restraining order into a temporary injunction and the defendants, who are the petitioners herein, appealed to the Supreme Court of Louisiana. While that appeal was pending, the trial court, on the same record, made its injunction permanent. Petitioners appealed that decision to the Supreme Court of Louisiana and the two appeals were consolidated. There the permanent injunction was sustained, one judge concurring specially and another dissenting, in part, on an issue not material here. 227 La. 1109, 81 So.2d 413.\n\nThe State Supreme Court's ground for sustaining the injunction was that the union, which sought to be recognized, had failed to file with the Secretary of Labor the financial and other data required by 9 (f) and (g), and had failed to file with the Labor Board the non-Communist affidavits required by 9 (h). The court held that the union, by failing to comply with 9 (f), (g) and (h), \n\n[351 \nU.S. 62, 68]\n\u00a0\n had precluded its certification by the Board, and that, accordingly, neither the employees nor the union had a right to picket the plant to induce the company to recognize the noncomplying union. The court, agreeing with respondent's theory, took the position that such recognition would be illegal and that picketing to secure it, therefore, was subject to restraint by a state court.\n2\n Rehearing was denied.\n\nBecause of the significance of that decision in relation to the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, we granted certiorari and invited the Solicitor General to file a brief setting forth the views of the National Labor Relations Board. \n350 \nU.S. 860\n. Such a brief was filed favoring a reversal.\n\nThere is no doubt that, if the union had filed the data and affidavits required by 9 (f), (g) and (h), the complaint, under the circumstances of this case, would have had to be dismissed by the state court for lack of jurisdiction, and that, if an injunction were sought through the National Labor Relations Board, the request would have had to be denied on the merits. Under those circumstances, the Board would have had jurisdiction of the issue to the exclusion of the state court. Garner v. Teamsters \n\n[351 \nU.S. 62, 69]\n\u00a0\n Union, \n346 \nU.S. 485\n, and see Weber v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., \n348 \nU.S. 468\n. In the absence of any bona fide dispute as to the existence of the required majority of eligible employees, the employer's denial of recognition of the union would have violated 8 (a) (5) of the Act.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nThe issue before us thus turns upon the effect of the union's choice not to file the information and affidavits described in 9 (f), (g) and (h). The state court misconceived that effect. The union's failure to file was not a confession of guilt of anything. It was merely a choice not to make public certain information. The Act prescribes no fine or penalty, in the ordinary sense, for failure to file the specified data and affidavits. The Act does not even direct that they be filed. The nearest to such a direction in the Act is the statement, in 9 (g), that it shall be \"the obligation\" of all labor organizations to file annual reports \"bringing up to date the information required to be supplied in the initial filing by subsection (f) (A) of this section, and to file with the Secretary of Labor and furnish to its members annually financial reports in the form and manner prescribed in subsection (f) (B) of 9 requires any initial filing to be made. Each merely describes what is required to be filed in the event that a labor organization elects to seek the advantages offered by subsection (f).\n\nCongress seeks to induce labor organizations to file the described data and affidavits by making various benefits of the Act strictly contingent upon such filing. See New \n\n[351 \nU.S. 62, 70]\n\u00a0\n Jersey Carpet Mills, Inc., 92 N. L. R. B. 604, 610. In particular, Congress makes the services of the Labor Board available to labor organizations only upon their filing of the specified data and affidavits.\n4\n By its noncompliance with 9 (f), (g) and (h), a union does not exempt itself from other applicable provisions of the Act.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nWhat, then, is the precise status of a labor organization that elects not to file some or all of the data or affidavits in question? It is significant that the effect of noncompliance is the same whether one or more of the filings are omitted. Accordingly, it simplifies the issue to assume a situation where a union has filed the non-Communist affidavits specified in 9 (h), but has chosen not \n\n[351 \nU.S. 62, 71]\n\u00a0\n to disclose the information called for by 9 (f) (A) (2) and (3) as to the salaries of its officers, or the manner in which they have been elected. There is no provision stating that, under those circumstances, the union may not represent an appropriate unit of employees if a majority of those employees give it authority so to do. Likewise, there is no statement precluding their employer from voluntarily recognizing such a noncomplying union as their bargaining representative. Section 8 (a) (5)\n6\n declares it to be an unfair labor practice for an employer \"to refuse to bargain collectively with the representatives of his employees, subject to the provisions of section 9 (a).\" (Emphasis supplied.) Section 9 (a),\n7\n which deals expressly with employee representation, says nothing as to how the employees' representative shall be chosen. See Lebanon Steel Foundry v. Labor Board, 76 U.S. App. D.C. 100, 103, 130 F.2d 404, 407. It does not make it a condition that the representative shall have complied \n\n[351 \nU.S. 62, 72]\n\u00a0\n with 9 (f), (g) or (h), or shall be certified by the Board, or even be eligible for such certification.\n8\n\u00a0\n\nLikewise, 7, which deals with the employees' rights to self-organization and representation, makes no reference to any need that the employees' chosen representative must have complied with 9 (f), (g) or (h).\n9\n Section 7 provides -\n\n \"Employees shall have the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities \n\n[351 \nU.S. 62, 73]\n\u00a0\n for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection, and shall also have the right to refrain from any or all of such activities except to the extent that such right may be affected by an agreement requiring membership in a labor organization as a condition of employment as authorized in section 8 (a) (3).\" 61 Stat. 140, 29 U.S.C. 157.\n10\n\u00a0\n\n\n Subsections (f), (g) and (h) of 9 merely describe advantages that may be gained by compliance with their conditions. The very specificity of the advantages to be gained and the express provision for the loss of these advantages imply that no consequences other than those so listed shall result from noncompliance.\n11\n\u00a0\n\nThe noncompliance of the union with 9 (f), (g) and (h) in the instant case precludes any right of the union to seek certification of its status by the Labor Board.\n12\n\u00a0\n\n[351 \nU.S. 62, 74]\n\u00a0\n Such elimination of the Board does not, however, eliminate the applicability of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, and does not settle the issue as to the right of the state court to enjoin the employees and their union from peacefully picketing the employer's plant for the purpose of securing recognition.\n\nThe industrial relations between the company and its employees nonetheless affect interstate commerce and come within the field occupied by the National Labor Relations Act, as amended. The Labor Board is but an agency through which Congress has authorized certain industrial relations to be supervised and enforced. The Act goes further. The instant employer, employees and union are controlled by its applicable provisions and all courts, state as well as federal, are bound by them.\n\nSection 7 recognizes the right of the instant employees \"to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing\" and leaves open the manner of choosing such representatives when certification does not apply. The employees have exercised that right through the action of substantially more than a majority of them authorizing the instant union to represent them.\n\nSection 9 (a) provides that representatives \"designated or selected for the purposes of collective bargaining by the majority of the employees in a unit appropriate for such purposes, shall be the exclusive representatives of all the employees in such unit for the purposes of collective bargaining in respect to rates of pay, wages, hours of employment, or other conditions of employment: . . . .\" That fits this situation precisely. It does not require the designated labor organization to disclose \n\n[351 \nU.S. 62, 75]\n\u00a0\n the salaries of its officers, or even to file non-Communist affidavits.\n\nUnder those sections and by virtue of the conceded majority designation of the union, the employer is obligated to recognize the designated union. Upon the employer's refusal to do so, the union, because of its noncompliance with 9 (f), (g) and (h), cannot resort to the Labor Board. It can, however, take other lawful action such as that engaged in here.\n\nThe company can, if it so wishes, lawfully recognize the union as the employees' representative. That being so, there is no reason why the employees, and their union under their authorization, may not, under 13, strike,\n13\n and, under 7, peacefully picket the premises of their employer to induce it thus to recognize their chosen representative. See West Texas Utilities Co. v. Labor Board, 87 U.S. App. D.C. 179, 185, 184 F.2d 233, 239, and the other cases cited in note 6, supra.\n14\n\u00a0\n\nSuch being the case, the state court is governed by the federal law which has been applied to industrial relations, like these, affecting interstate commerce and the state court erred in enjoining the peaceful picketing here practiced. A \"State may not prohibit the exercise of rights which the federal Acts protect.\" Weber v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., \n348 \nU.S. 468, 474\n, and see Garner v. Teamsters Union, \n346 \nU.S. 485, 494\n. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 62, 76]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe judgment of the Supreme Court of Louisiana, accordingly, is reversed and the case is remanded to it for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n    Reversed and remanded.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE HARLAN took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"SEC. 9.

The Supreme Court of Louisiana did not pass upon this contention. The record upon which the temporary and the permanent injunctions were granted contained concededly genuine applications for union membership and authorizations of representation from 179 of the 225 eligible employees. Accordingly, we do not now consider the questions that would have been presented if the union or the pickets had represented less than a majority of the eligible employees, or if there had been a bona fide dispute as to the existence of authorization from a majority of the eligible employees.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] \"SEC. 8.

Congress has not made compliance with the filing requirements of 9 (f), (g) and (h) a condition precedent to the obligation of an employer under 8 (a) (5) to bargain collectively with the chosen representative of the employees; such compliance is merely made a condition precedent to invoking the machinery of the Act for the investigation of a question concerning representation, or for the issuance of a complaint charging the commission of unfair labor practices.\" Labor Board v.

The Act does not proscribe bargaining with a noncomplying union; indeed, consonant with public policy, an employer may voluntarily recognize and deal with such a union. If Congress had intended the Act to have the effect urged by the Respondents, it easily could have inserted an express provision in the statute to accomplish such result. This, Congress did not do.\" Brookville Glove Co., supra, at 1549. The Board there held that the employer committed an unfair labor practice ( 8 (a) (3)) when it discharged employees who struck to induce their employer to recognize as their bargaining representative the same noncomplying union (United Mine Workers) which is a petitioner here. There also the union had been designated as their chosen representative by a majority of the eligible employees. See also, Rubin Bros. Footwear, Inc., 99 N. L. R. B. 610, 619; Labor Board v.

Subsection (c) of 9 so referred to relates to elections of collective-bargaining representatives under supervision of the Board.

JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, dissenting.\n\nAlthough my doubts are not shared by others, they have not been overcome, and the nature of the problem raised by this case makes it not inappropriate to express them.\n\nThe problem is the recurring difficulty of determining when a federal enactment bars the exercise of what otherwise would clearly be within the scope of a State's lawmaking power. There is, of course, no difficulty when Congress explicitly displaces state power. The perplexity arises in a situation like the present, where such displacement by the controlling federal power is attributed to implications or radiations of a federal statute.\n\nThe various aspects in which this problem comes before the Court are seldom easy of solution. Decisions ultimately depend on judgment in balancing overriding considerations making for the requirement of an exclusive nation-wide regime in a particular field of legal control and respect for the allowable area within which the forty-eight States may enforce their diverse notions of policy. The Court has heretofore adverted to the uncertainties in the accommodation of these interests of the Nation and the States in regard to industrial relations affecting interstate commerce - uncertainties inevitable in the present state of federal legislation.\n\nProper accommodation is dependent on an empiric process, on case-to-case determinations. Abstract propositions and unquestioned generalities do not furnish answers. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 62, 77]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn this case, the Court concludes that Louisiana law must yield to the dominance of the National Labor Relations Act. Presumably, what Louisiana has decreed in the judgment now reversed would be within Louisiana's power were it not for the argumentatively derived withdrawal of that power by the National Labor Relations Act, as amended. Over the years, the Court has found such withdrawal of state power from reasonable implications of what Congress wrote in the National Labor Relations Act in some cases and not in others. Withdrawal has been found to exist in at least two types of situations: (1) where state law interferes with federal rights conferred on employees by 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, e. g., Hill v. Florida, \n325 \nU.S. 538\n; (2) where state law makes inroads on the primary jurisdiction with which Congress has invested the National Labor Relations Board, e. g., Weber v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., \n348 \nU.S. 468\n. Here we are not concerned with the Board's primary jurisdiction. The issue is whether Louisiana, by enjoining, according to its law, a strike calculated to coerce respondent to bargain with a union which has not complied with the non-Communist and other reporting provisions, 9 (f), (g) and (h) of the Taft-Hartley Act, interferes with the protection afforded by 7 of that Act, where that union may represent a majority of employees.\n\nSection 7 grants employees the federal right to engage in concerted activities in furtherance of collective bargaining. A strike accompanied by peaceful picketing is a typical expression of such authorized concerted activity. Instances of special situations that are clearly outside of this protection are (1) where the aspect that the strike action takes constitutes a union unfair labor practice interdicted by the Taft-Hartley Act, or (2) where the strike is in violation of the federal criminal law. See Southern S. S. Co. v. Labor Board, \n316 \nU.S. 31\n. It \n\n[351 \nU.S. 62, 78]\n\u00a0\n would be self-contradictory for federal law to protect conduct which federal law brands as illegal. That is not this situation. A non-complying union, such as the petitioner, however vigorously it may assert non-compliance as a matter of principle, is not under condemnation of illegality by the Taft-Hartley Act, or any other federal law, if it employs economic pressure to achieve its goal. The explicit consequence which that Act attaches to non-compliance is that such a union is denied the advantages of the National Labor Relations Board - it cannot utilize that Board's machinery to obtain certification as the bargaining representative or to secure redress against unfair labor practices by an employer.\n\nThe policy of 9 is that of Congress and the wisdom of the policy is not our concern. But just as all fair implications must be given to 7, so it is equally incumbent to give to the scope of the non-Communist affidavit and other reporting requirements of 9 the reasonable direction of their meaning and purpose. So far as its own law-enforcement machinery for protecting the interests of employees is concerned, Congress designed to hamper non-conforming unions and to discriminate against them by denying them rights deemed of the utmost importance to trade unions. This being so, I find it rather difficult to conclude that, while visiting such consequences upon a non-conforming union in the federal domain of law enforcement, the Congress has impliedly withdrawn from the States the power to regulate such a union. In balancing these considerations, the weight of my judgment tips in favor of not finding in 7 of the Taft-Hartley Act an implied limitation upon power exercised by Louisiana in the circumstances of this case. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 62, 79]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","59":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMISSOURI PACIFIC RAILROAD COMPANY 5 1\/4% SECURED SERIAL(1956)\nNo. 568\nArgued: Decided: January 30, 1956\n\n\n  Mr. William H.

BUDD(1956)\nNo. 278\nArgued: Decided: March 26, 1956\n\n\n\n\n The Secretary of Labor sued under 17 of the Fair Labor Standards Act to enjoin respondents from violating the minimum wage and record-keeping provisions of the Act with respect to employees working in their tobacco-bulking plants in Quincy, Florida, which has a population in excess of 2,500. The bulking process takes from 4 to 8 months, requires a large amount of equipment, and substantially changes the physical properties and chemical content of the tobacco. Most farmers in the region have their tobacco processed by others. Two of the respondents process only tobacco grown on their own farms and the third processes only tobacco grown by others. Held: Respondents are not exempted by 13 (a) (10) or 13 (a) (6) from the minimum wage and record-keeping provisions of the Act. Pp. 474-482.\n\n (a) The Administrator's definition of \"area of production,\" within the meaning of 13 (a) (10), as including only plants located \"in the open country or in a rural community . . . not including any city, town or urban place of 2,500 or greater population\" and within a specified mileage distance from the source of 95% of its commodities, is sustained. Pp. 476-480.\n\n\n (b) Even when done by the grower, the bulking process is not \"preparation for market,\" within the meaning of 3 (f), and therefore not within the agricultural exemption of 13 (a) (6). Pp. 480-482.\n\n\n 221 F.2d 406, reversed.\n\n 114 F. Supp. 865, affirmed.\n\nBessie Margolin argued the cause for petitioner. With her on the brief were Solicitor General Sobeloff, Stuart Rothman and James R. Billingsley.\n\nMilton C. Denbo argued the cause for J. T. Budd, Jr. & Co. et al., respondents. With him on the brief was Philip Levy. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 473, 474]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMark F. Hughes argued the cause and filed a brief for the May Tobacco Co., respondent.\n\nBriefs of amici curiae urging affirmance were filed by John H. Todd, M. Richard Garstang and Joseph O. Parker for the National Grange et al., and Martin Burns and Allen Lauterbach for the American Farm Bureau Federation.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThese are actions brought by the Secretary of Labor under 17 of the Fair Labor Standards Act, 52 Stat. 1060, 63 Stat. 910, 29 U.S.C. 201, to enjoin respondents from violating the minimum wage, 6, and record-keeping provisions, 11, of the Act. The employees concerned work in tobacco-bulking plants operated by respondents in Quincy, Florida, which has a population in excess of 2,500. Respondents claim these employees are exempt from the Act. The District Court ruled against the respondents. 114 F. Supp. 865. The Court of Appeals reversed. 221 F.2d 406. We granted certiorari, \n350 \nU.S. 859\n, because of the importance of the problems presented and of the apparent conflicts between the decision below and Tobin v. Traders Compress Co., 199 F.2d 8, and Maneja v. Waialua Agricultural Co., \n349 \nU.S. 254\n.\n\nThe processing operations involve U.S. Type 62 Sumatra tobacco, a leaf tobacco used exclusively for cigar wrappers. This type of tobacco requires special cultivation. It is grown in fields that are completely enclosed and covered with cheesecloth shade. The leaves of the plant are picked in stages, as each matures. The leaves are taken immediately to a tobacco barn, located on the farm, where they are strung on sticks and dried by heat. Before the drying process is completed, the leaves are allowed to absorb moisture. Then they are dried again. There is some fermentation at this stage. But the treatment \n\n[350 \nU.S. 473, 475]\n\u00a0\n in the tobacco barns is essentially a drying operation during which the moisture content is reduced to between 10% and 25%.\n\nAt the end of the drying operation, the leaves are packed in boxes and taken from the farm to a bulking plant for further processing. At the bulking plant, the leaves are placed in piles, known as \"bulks,\" aggregating from 3,500 to 4,500 pounds of tobacco. This is the \"sweating\" or fermentation process which requires carefully controlled regulation of temperature and humidity. Proper heat control includes, among other things, breaking up the bulk, redistributing the tobacco, and adding water. Proper fermentation or aging requires the bulk to be reconstructed several times. The bulking process lasts from four to eight months, after which the tobacco is baled. The bulking process requires a large amount of equipment, including a steam-heated plant, platforms, thermometers, bulk covers, baling boxes and presses, baling mats and packing, sorting and grading tables. The bulking process substantially changes the physical properties and chemical content of the tobacco, improving the color, increasing combustibility, and eliminating the rawness and harshness of the freshly cured leaf.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of farmers in the region in litigation in this case have their tobacco processed by others. In that region there are 300 farmers who grow this type of tobacco. Of these, only 9 maintain and operate bulking plants; and only 5 maintain and operate bulking plants processing tobacco grown only by themselves. It appears that bulking cannot be economically done by the ordinary small farmer growing less than 100 acres. Of the 300 farmers in the present group, 80% grow less than 25 acres per year, while the majority grow from 1 1\/2 to 10 acres a year.\n\nRespondent Budd grows no tobacco itself and confines its operations to processing the tobacco grown on 263 \n\n[350 \nU.S. 473, 476]\n\u00a0\n acres by 52 farmers. Budd employs about 108 workers for bulking, sorting, grading, and baling tobacco.\n\nRespondent King Edward processes in the bulking plant involved in this litigation only tobacco produced on farms operated by it. (It has two other bulking plants that process tobacco purchased from other growers.) The bulking plant involved here is about 13 miles from King Edward's farms. A majority of the 120 employees in the bulking plant also work on King Edward's farms.\n\nMay has its own bulking plant and processes there only the tobacco which it grows on its own farms. This plant is about 10 miles from the farms. The employees, who work the farms, work in the bulking plant, being transported back and forth by May. Seventy are employed in the bulking plant.\n\nArea of Production. - Section 13 (a) of the Act creates several exemptions from the minimum wage and maximum hours provisions of the Act. One of those exemptions contained in 13 (a) (10) includes:\n\n\"any individual employed within the area of production (as defined by the Administrator), engaged in handling, packing, storing, ginning, compressing, pasteurizing, drying, preparing in their raw or natural state, or canning of agricultural or horticultural commodities for market, or in making cheese or butter or other dairy products.\"\n\n\n The Administrator's definition of \"area of production\" provides that a plant is within the \"area of production\" if it is located (1) \"in the open country or in a rural community,\" which is defined as not including \"any city, town or urban place of 2,500 or greater population,\" and (2) within a specified mileage distance from the source of 95% of its commodities.\n1\n\u00a0\n\n[350 \nU.S. 473, 477]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Court of Appeals, following its earlier decisions in Jenkins v. Durkin, 208 F.2d 941, and Lovvorn v. Miller, 215 F.2d 601, held that the regulation was invalid. It concluded that once \"geographic lines of the area of production have been established, the act makes the exemption effective within that area,\" and that any qualification by reason of size of the town where the establishment is located is invalid. 215 F.2d, at 603. For that conclusion the Court of Appeals found comfort in Addison v. Holly Hill Fruit Products, Inc., \n322 \nU.S. 607\n.\n\nHolly Hill involved one of the alternative definitions of \"area of production.\" That alternative defined \"area of production\" in geographic terms and then added another standard - whether the employee was in an establishment having no more than seven employees. We held that \". . . Congress did not leave it to the Administrator to decide whether within geographic bounds defined by him the Act further permits discrimination between establishment and establishment based upon the number of employees.\" Id., at 616. We said that the phrase \"area of production\" had \"plain geographic implications\" with which the size of a plant within the area was not consistent. Id., at 618. That definition, therefore, was struck down. But its alternative, substantially the one that is involved here, was not passed upon. In fact, we reserved decision in Holly Hill as to whether the population criterion, now presented for decision, was valid. Id., 610.\n\nWe think the present regulation is a valid definition of \"area of production.\" We think it valid by the standard we used in Holly Hill. In that case we said that \". . . `area' calls for delimitation of territory in relation to the complicated economic factors that operate between agricultural labor conditions and the labor market of enterprises concerned with agricultural commodities and \n\n[350 \nU.S. 473, 478]\n\u00a0\n more or less near their production.\" Id., at 613-614. The aim of Congress was to exempt employees \"employed in agriculture,\" 13 (a) (6), and those engaged in agricultural enterprises in the \"area of production,\" 13 (a) (10). That meant drawing a line between agricultural enterprises operating under rural-agricultural conditions and those subject to urban-industrial conditions. An individual working in an agricultural packing plant on the edge of Los Angeles is in a strikingly different environment from one doing the same work in a small town in the heart of Kansas. Nearness to a large city has relation to the problem of the Administrator in making his definition. For the proximity of the plant to a metropolitan center, like the size of the town where the plant is located, may make the decisive difference between an agricultural and an urban environment.\n2\n Likewise, nearness of the plant to its supplies cannot be considered an irrelevancy. For \"area\" is understandable in terms of nearness and \n\n[350 \nU.S. 473, 479]\n\u00a0\n farness. Distance is an important factor in any formula which seeks to treat more or less as a unity labor on farms and labor in agricultural enterprises in the \"area of production.\"\n3\n\u00a0\n\n[350 \nU.S. 473, 480]\n\u00a0\n\n\nNo definition of \"area of production\" could produce complete equality, for the variables are too numerous. The Administrator fulfills his role when he makes a reasoned definition. See Gray v. Powell, \n314 \nU.S. 402, 411\n. On no phase of this problem can we say that the Administrator proceeded capriciously or by the use of inadmissible standards. Experts might disagree over the desirability of one formula rather than another. It is enough for us that the expert stayed within the allowable limits. We think he did here and that the definition of \"area of production\" under 13 (a) (10) is a valid one.\n\nAgriculture. - The Court of Appeals held that the employees in the bulking plants of King Edward and May were exempt under 13 (a) (6) which covers \"any employee employed in agriculture.\" It relied on the broad definition of \"agriculture\" contained in 3 (f) of the Act which provides, in relevant part, that the term \"includes farming in all its branches and among other things includes . . . any practices (including any forestry or lumbering operations) performed by a farmer or on a farm as an incident to or in conjunction with such farming operations, including preparation for market, delivery to . . . market or to carriers for transportation to market.\" The work in the bulking plants, the court ruled, was \"preparation for market\" within the meaning of 3 (f).\n\nThe exemption of 13 (a) (6) read with 3 (f) covers large operators as well as small ones, as we recently said in Maneja v. Waialua Agricultural Co., supra, at 260. It also includes \"extraordinary methods\" of agriculture as well \n\n[350 \nU.S. 473, 481]\n\u00a0\n as the more conventional ones. Id., at 261. The question in the Waialua case was whether sugar milling was included in the agriculture exemption of 13 (a) (6). We said that it was necessary to look to all the facts surrounding the process to determine whether that process was incident to farming. Id., at 264-265. We held that sugar milling was not, even when done by the grower. We think like considerations indicate that in this case the agriculture operation does not extend through the bulking plants but ends, as the District Court ruled, with the delivery of the tobacco at the receiving platform of the bulking plant. That is the \"delivery . . . to market\" within the meaning of 3 (f) of the Act.\n\nIt is true that King Edward and May are farmers and process in their bulking plants only the tobacco they raise. It is also true that many employees who work their farms also work in their bulking plants. These are heavily stressed as indicia that bring the bulking plants into the agriculture exemption. But there are two other factors which in our view tip the scales the other way.\n\nFirst, tobacco farmers do not ordinarily perform the bulking operation. As already mentioned, of the 300 farmers who grow this type of tobacco in this area, only 9 maintain and operate their own bulking plants. The remaining farmers have their crops processed by others. The bulking operation is for the most part divorced from the cultivation of tobacco and from the drying operation in the tobacco barns on the farm. The bulking process for the most part is a separate processing stage.\n\nSecond, the bulking operation is a process which changes the natural state of the freshly cured tobacco as significantly as milling changes sugar cane. As indicated above, the bulking process changes and improves the leaf in many ways and turns it into an industrial product. What we said in Waialua concerning sugar milling is apt here: a process that results in such important changes is \n\n[350 \nU.S. 473, 482]\n\u00a0\n \"more akin to manufacturing than to agriculture.\" \n349 \nU.S., at 265\n.\n\nThe judgments of the Court of Appeals are reversed and those of the District Court affirmed.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\n   APPENDIX TO OPINION OF THE COURT.\n\n\n The Administrator defined \"area of production,\" as used in 13 (a) (10) of the Fair Labor Standards Act, as follows (29 CFR, c. V, 536.2):\n\n(a) An individual shall be regarded as employed in the \"area of production\" within the meaning of section 13 (a) (10) of the Fair Labor Standards Act in handling, packing, storing, ginning, compressing, pasteurizing, drying, preparing in their raw or natural state, or canning of agricultural or horticultural commodities for market, or in making cheese or butter or other dairy products:\n\n (1) If the establishment where he is employed is located in the open country or in a rural community and 95 percent of the commodities on which such operations are performed by the establishment come from normal rural sources of supply located not more than the following air line distances from the establishment:\n\n\n (i) With respect to the ginning of cotton - 10 miles;\n\n\n (ii) With respect to operations on fresh fruits and vegetables - 15 miles;\n\n\n (iii) With respect to the storing of cotton and any operations on commodities not otherwise specified in this subsection - 20 miles;\n\n\n (iv) With respect to the compressing and compress-warehousing of cotton, and operations on tobacco, grain, soybeans, poultry or eggs - 50 miles. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 473, 483]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n (b) For the purposes of this section:\n\n  (1) \"open country or rural community\" shall not include any city, town or urban place of 2,500 or greater population or any area within:\n\n\n (i) One air-line mile of any city, town, or urban place with a population of 2,500 up to but not including 50,000, or\n\n\n (ii) Three air-line miles of any city, town or urban place with a population of 50,000 up to but not including 500,000, or\n\n\n (iii) Five air-line miles of any city with a population of 500,000 or greater,\n\n\naccording to the latest available United States Census.\n\n\n (2) The commodities shall be considered to come from \"normal rural sources of supply\" within the specified distances from the establishment if they are received\n\n\n (i) from farms within such specified distances, or\n\n\n (ii) from farm assemblers or other establishments through which the commodity customarily moves, which are within such specified distances and located in the open country or in a rural community, or\n\n\n (iii) from farm assemblers or other establishments not located in the open country or in a rural community provided it can be demonstrated that the commodities were produced on farms within such specified distances.\n\n\n (3) The period for determining whether 95 percent of the commodities are received from normal rural sources of supply shall be the last preceding calendar month in which operations were carried on for two workweeks or more, except that until such time as an establishment has operated for such a \n\n[350 \nU.S. 473, 484]\n\u00a0\n calendar month the period shall be the time during which it has been in operation.\n\n\n (4) The percentage of commodities received from normal rural sources of supply within the specified distances shall be determined by weight, volume or other physical unit of measure, except that dollar value shall be used if different commodities received in the establishment are customarily measured in physical units that are not comparable.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The entire regulation is set forth in the Appendix to this opinion, post, p. 482.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] On this phase of the problem the Administrator said in his findings dated December 18, 1946:\n\n\"Although it is clear that any line attempting to distinguish between `urban-industrial' and `rural-agricultural' communities on the basis of population can at best be only an approximation, it is equally clear that none of the proposals advanced at the hearing would accomplish the objectives of such a test with as much accuracy as the 2,500 population test. As a class, places of 2,500 population or more are predominantly industrial, while places with populations of less than 2,500 are predominantly agricultural. A population limit of 2,500, moreover, has for over 35 years been the official dividing line between `rural' and `urban' employed by the Bureau of the Census in its studies. This dividing line has also been accepted and used in studies made by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, the Federal Emergency Relief Administration, the Works Progress Administration and other government agencies. It has furnished the definition of `rural' communities which has been the basis of studies of rural and urban communities by many sociologists. It has been incorporated into statute by the Congress of the United States in \n\n[350 \nU.S. 473, 479]\n\u00a0\n special legislation for rural communities.\n*\n To a very great extent the handling and processing of agricultural and horticultural commodities is carried on in the open country or in towns of less than 2,500. For example, only about 10% of grain elevators are located in towns of 2,500 or more. Only about 11% of cotton gins are located in such populated places. About two-thirds of all fresh fruit and vegetable canning and packing, cheese manufacturing and poultry and egg assembling are carried on in the open country or in towns of 2,500 or less.\n\n\n\"On the basis of all the evidence, it is my conclusion that a population test of 2,500, while not drawing a line between `urban-industrial' and `rural-agricultural' conditions with a fine precision, will come as close to accomplishing this objective as it is possible to come in a general rule applicable to many situations.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] The references were to 39 Stat. 356, 40 Stat. 1200.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] On this phase of the problem the Administrator said:\n\n\"The selection of appropriate distances for the different commodities and groups of commodities has been no easy task, and was accomplished only after carefully weighing and synthesizing a large variety of complicated economic factors. Among the many factors taken into consideration were the following: the kind of crop; the distances from which the establishments in each industry receive the agricultural or horticultural commodities upon which they perform the operations specified in the pertinent sections of the Act; the geography and topography of the various sections of the country in which the different commodities are normally produced; the location of the plants within these areas; the concentration of cultivation of the different commodities in various sections of the country; the pattern of concentration of agricultural production with respect to the location of the establishment; differences in practice as between single crop areas and diversified farming areas; the perishability of the commodities received; the extent to which the plants deal with a single commodity rather than a variety of commodities; the nature of the operations performed on the commodities received, including \n\n[350 \nU.S. 473, 480]\n\u00a0\n the degree of industrialization of the various operations; the number of hands or operations through which the particular commodity has moved since leaving the farm, including the possibility of passing increased labor costs back to the farmer; the marketing practices of the particular industries; and the wage rates paid, and overtime practices in the various communities concerned with particular commodities.\" \n\n[350 \nU.S. 473, 485]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","61":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMITCHELL v. KING PACKING CO.(1956)\nNo. 39\nArgued: Decided: January 30, 1956\n\n\n\n\n Knifemen employed in butchering and trimming meat in respondent's meat-packing plant spend time each workday in sharpening the knives which they use in their work. Such knife sharpening is necessary for the proper performance of the work, and respondent requires it to be done outside the scheduled eight-hour shift of these employees and provides a room and equipment for its accomplishment. Held: This activity is a \"principal,\" rather than a \"preliminary\" or \"postliminary,\" activity, within the meaning of 4 (a) (2) of the Portal-to-Portal Act, and it is compensable under the Fair Labor Standards Act. Steiner v. Mitchell, ante, p. 247. Pp. 260-263.\n\n 216 F.2d 618, reversed and remanded.\n\nBessie Margolin argued the cause for petitioner. With her on the brief were Solicitor General Sobeloff, Ralph S. Spritzer, Stuart Rothman and Sylvia S. Ellison.\n\nWillard S. Johnston argued the cause and filed a brief for respondent.\n\nMR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis case like Steiner v. Mitchell, ante, p. 247, raises an issue of coverage under the Fair Labor Standards Act, as amended by the Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947. with respect to work performed before or after the direct or productive labor for which the worker is primarily paid.\n\nThe District Court denied to the Secretary of Labor an injunction to enforce compliance with the Act, and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. 216 F.2d 618. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 260, 261]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe court below recognized a conflict with Steiner,\n1\n and, although holding that Section 4 controls the situation here, determined, contrary to the holding in the Steiner case, that \"the terms `preliminary' or `postliminary' cannot be interpreted so as to exclude [from the exemptions from the Act] all activity `indispensable to the performance of productive work.' To do so would deny effect to the intended meaning of the Portal-to-Portal Act.\"\n2\n We granted certiorari to resolve this conflict. \n349 \nU.S. 914\n.\n\nIn Steiner, for reasons therein set forth, we concluded that after the enforcement date of the Portal-to-Portal Act activities performed either before or after the regular work shift, on or off the production line, are compensable under the portal-to-portal provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act if those activities are an integral and indispensable part of the principal activities for which covered workmen are employed and are not specifically excluded by Section 4 (a) (1).\n\nThe only question to be determined in this case is whether the knife-sharpening activities of the employees of respondent King Packing Co. are within this classification.\n\nRespondent is an interstate meat packer engaged in slaughtering, butchering, dressing and distributing meat and meat products. It employs at its packing plant \n\n[350 \nU.S. 260, 262]\n\u00a0\n about 75 persons, of whom about one-third are knifemen, whose compensation rights are involved in this litigation. The knifemen perform various butchering operations, 12 or 14 of them working in the killing room and the others in the cutting room. Various knives and three types of electric saws are used in the butchering operations. Some of the knives are furnished by the knifemen under the terms of their employment. These are the boning, the shaving, the legging and the skinning or siding knives. The saws and the more expensive loin pulling, ham skinning, shoulder trimming and sparerib knives are furnished by respondent. All of the knives as well as the saws must be \"razor sharp\" for the proper performance of the work. Respondent's production manager and one of the knifemen testified a dull knife would slow down production which is conducted on an assembly line basis, affect the appearance of the meat as well as the quality of the hides, cause waste and make for accidents; \"that a knife to be of any practical value in a knife job has to be . . . sharp.\"\n\nThough the entire cost of keeping the saws in proper condition is borne by respondent, the knifemen are required to sharpen their own knives outside the scheduled shift of eight hours, and for this activity they are not compensated. The sharpening of these knives is done either before or after the work shift or during the lunch hour in a room equipped by respondent with an emery wheel and grindstone. A knifeman ordinarily sharpens from two to four knives a day. At the time a man is hired for, or promoted to, a knife job, it is understood that he will be required to sharpen knives. He is expected to perform that task as well as other tasks connected with the job.\n\nThe knifemen are paid by the hour and, excluding the knife-sharpening time in controversy, they work eight hours a day, five days a week. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 260, 263]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe believe the facts clearly demonstrate that the knife-sharpening activities of these workmen are an integral part of and indispensable to the various butchering activities for which they were principally employed, and that they must be compensated for by respondent in compliance with the Fair Labor Standards Act, as amended by the Portal-to-Portal Act, and as construed by us today in Steiner v.

Davis argued the cause for the United States. On the brief were Solicitor General Sobeloff, Assistant Attorney General Olney, Beatrice Rosenberg and Isabelle Cappello.\n\n\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\nThe United States filed a libel in the District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, under 3116 and 3321 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, 53 Stat. 362, 401, for the forfeiture of an automobile which had been used to transport nontax-paid whiskey. Petitioner, a finance company which had accepted an assignment of a conditional sales contract when the automobile was purchased, sought remission of the forfeiture to the extent \n\n[350 \nU.S. 488, 489]\n\u00a0\n of its interest under 18 U.S.C. 3617. That section provides that in a forfeiture proceeding the District Court \"shall have exclusive jurisdiction to remit\" the forfeiture, but that the court \"shall not allow\" remission unless the finance company (1) acquired its interest in good faith; (2) had no reason to believe that the automobile would be used in violation of the liquor laws; and (3),\n\n\"was informed in answer to [its] inquiry, at the headquarters of the sheriff, chief of police, principal Federal internal-revenue officer engaged in the enforcement of the liquor laws, or other principal local or Federal law-enforcement officer of the locality . . . that [the purchaser] had no . . . record or reputation [for violating laws of the United States or of any State relating to liquor].\"\n\n\n It is conceded that petitioner satisfied the first two requirements. As to the third, petitioner made a timely inquiry regarding the purchaser of the automobile to the state office of the Federal Alcohol and Tobacco Unit, from which it received the following reply:\n\n \"No record or reputation as a liquor law violator as of [the date of the inquiry]. This office does not keep a complete file of State and local arrests or prosecutions, and has no knowledge of the subject's reputation among State and local officers.\"\n\n\n It is conceded that the inquiry was made to an appropriate office and that, if the substance of the reply satisfied the statute, no further inquiries were required by the statute. The issue is whether the substance of the reply was adequate.\n\nThe reply received by petitioner was a form reply designed by the Internal Revenue Service expressly for the purpose of satisfying this statutory requirement. It had for years been accepted as compliance with the statute in administrative remissions and in forfeiture proceedings in \n\n[350 \nU.S. 488, 490]\n\u00a0\n other district courts. Nevertheless, the District Court denied remission on the ground that the reply did not satisfy the statute in that it expressly disclaimed any knowledge of the purchaser's record or reputation for state liquor law violations. 121 F. Supp. 265. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed, 218 F.2d 702, with one judge dissenting upon rehearing, 220 F.2d 279. We think the courts below misconstrued the reply. The first sentence affirmatively stated that the purchaser had no record or reputation in that office as a \"liquor law violator,\" and that statement was not limited to federal violations. The second sentence did not qualify the negative character of the reply but merely made clear that that office's knowledge was not unlimited.\n\nThe District Court also based its decision on the alternative ground that, even if the requirements of the statute were technically met, remission would be denied in the discretion of the court. The sole basis for that holding was that petitioner was \"put on notice\" by the reply that the purchaser might well have a record as a liquor law violator with the state authorities, and its failure to investigate further disclosed \"an indifference on its part which does not commend it to the equitable conscience of this court.\" We need not decide the extent of the District Court's discretionary power to deny remissions, since in any event we think there was no occasion for its exercise here. The very purpose of prescribing in detail in the statute the type of inquiry to be made was to avoid uncertainty over the extent of investigation necessary to protect finance companies against forfeitures. That purpose would be frustrated if a duty to investigate further could be grounded solely upon the alleged inadequacy of a reply clearly satisfying the statutory investigation requirements. In limiting the inquiry duty to any one of several offices. Congress must necessarily have contemplated \n\n[350 \nU.S. 488, 491]\n\u00a0\n that the records of one office only would be checked. It considered that adequate.\n\nThe judgment below is reversed and the cause is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n    Reversed and remanded.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER dissents. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 488, 492]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","63":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNELSON v. NEW YORK CITY(1956)\nNo. 30\nArgued: November 7, 1956Decided: December 10, 1956\n\n\n\n\n Under Title D, Chapter 17, of the New York City Administrative Code, the City proceeded to foreclose liens for unpaid water charges on two parcels of land held in trust by appellants. In accordance with the statute, notice was given by posting, publication and mailing notices to the trust estate. Because of the derelictions of a bookkeeper, these notices were not brought to the attention of appellants, and they claimed to have had no knowledge of the foreclosure proceedings until after judgments of foreclosure had been entered by default and the City had acquired title to the property. The City sold one parcel for an amount many times that of the unpaid water charges and retained all the proceeds. The value of the other parcel was many times the amount of the unpaid water charges, and the City retained title to it. Appellants moved to have the defaults opened, the deed to one parcel set aside and to recover the surplus proceeds from the sale of the other parcel. Such relief was denied. Held:\n\n 1. The City having taken steps to notify appellants of the arrearages and the foreclosure proceedings, and appellants' agent having received such notices, application of the statute did not deprive appellants of procedural due process. Pp. 107-109.\n\n\n (a) The City cannot be charged with responsibility for the misconduct of the appellants' bookkeeper nor for the carelessness of the managing trustee in overlooking notices of arrearages given on tax bills.

Since the statute requires that, when the strict foreclosure provisions of Title D, Chapter 17, are invoked, they must be used against all parcels in a section of the City on which charges have been outstanding for four years, appellants were not denied equal protection of the laws by failure of the City officials to resort to other remedies which would not necessarily have resulted in forfeiture of the entire value of their property.

Quel argued the cause for appellee. With him on the brief were Peter Campbell Brown, Harry E. O'Donnell, Benjamin Offner and Joseph Brandwen.\n\nMR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nAppellants challenge as violative of the Fourteenth Amendment the application of Title D, Chapter 17, of the New York City Administrative Code to two improved parcels of land owned by them as trustees. The statute is the counterpart, operative in the City of New York, of the state tax lien foreclosure statute that was before us last Term in Covey v. Town of Somers, \n351 \nU.S. 141\n.\n1\n\u00a0\n\n[352 \nU.S. 103, 105]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn 1950, the City proceeded to foreclose its lien on the first of these parcels, referred to as the 45th Avenue property, for water charges that had been unpaid for four years. These charges, for the years 1945 and 1946, amounted to $65;\n2\n the property was assessed at $6,000. The action was begun on May 20 with the filing of a list of 294 liened parcels, including the 45th Avenue property, in two sections of the Borough of Queens. Under the statute, this constituted the filing of a complaint.\n3\n The statute requires that notice of such a foreclosure proceeding be posted and published and a copy of the published notice mailed to the last known address of the owner of property sought to be foreclosed.\n4\n It is undisputed that the statutory notice requirements were satisfied in this case; a copy of the published notice was mailed to the address of the trust estate. However, appellants took no \n\n[352 \nU.S. 103, 106]\n\u00a0\n action during the 7 weeks allowed for redeeming the property through payment of back charges nor during the 20 additional days allowed for answering the City's complaint. Judgments of foreclosure were entered by default, and on August 22 the City acquired title to the parcel. The property was later sold to a private party for $7,000, the City retaining all the proceeds.\n\nOn December 17, 1951, a similar in rem foreclosure action was commenced against 1,704 parcels in four sections of the Borough of Brooklyn, including appellants' second parcel, referred to as the Powell Street property. The four-year-old water charges on this parcel amounted to $814.50;\n5\n the property was assessed at $46,000. Again the statutory notice requirements were satisfied, and again judgment of foreclosure was entered by default. The City acquired title to the Powell Street property on May 19, 1952, and still retains it.\n\nIn November 1952, the appellants offered to pay with interest and penalties all amounts owing to the City on the two parcels. The offer was refused, and the appellants instituted a plenary action to set aside the City's deed to the Powell Street property and to recover the surplus proceeds from the sale of the 45th Avenue property. The Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court affirmed the denial of the requested relief without prejudice to appellants' seeking to open their default by motions in the foreclosure proceedings. The appellants filed such motions, requesting the same relief they had sought in the plenary action. The case was submitted to the Supreme Court, Special Term, on opposing affidavits, and the motions were denied. The Special Term's orders were affirmed by the Appellate Division 284 App. Div. 894, 134 N. Y. S. 2d 597, and the Court of \n\n[352 \nU.S. 103, 107]\n\u00a0\n Appeals, 309 N. Y. 94. 127 N. E. 2d 827. The Court of Appeals amended its remittitur to show that the federal questions here presented were decided adversely to appellants. 309 N. Y. 801, 130 N. E. 2d 602.\n\n1. Appellants contend they received no actual notice of the foreclosure proceedings. The reason they assign is that the mailed notices were concealed by their trusted bookkeeper, who is also alleged to have concealed from them the nonpayment of the water charges. There is no claim that the bills for the water charges were not mailed to the estate. They assert that it was not until November 1952, when the judgments of foreclosure had long since become final, that they discovered the bookkeeper's derelictions, and thus were made aware of their loss. However, as we have said, it is not disputed that the notices were mailed to the proper address. Nor is this all. Appellants themselves placed in evidence as exhibits 1950-1951 and 1951-1952 real estate tax bills for the 45th Avenue property. These were concededly brought to the attention of appellant Gerald D. Nelson, the \"active\" or \"managing\" trustee. On the face of the bills appears the word \"ARREARS,\" with a prominent black arrow pointing to it and beneath the arrow the statement, \"The word ARREARS if it appears in the space indicated by the ARROW, means that, as of JUNE 30, 1950, previous TAXES, ASSESSMENTS or WATER CHARGES HAVE NOT BEEN RECORDED AS PAID. If these have not been paid since June 30, 1950, payment should be made IMMEDIATELY.\"\n6\n Furthermore, the \n\n[352 \nU.S. 103, 108]\n\u00a0\n City's assistant corporation counsel stated in his affidavit that the tax bills for the Powell Street property each year from 1946 to 1953 contained a notice that the property was in arrears. Appellant Nelson stated that the bookkeeper \"had been regularly presenting to deponent for payment all of the bills for real estate taxes which were paid through the first half of 1951-52 . . . .\"\n7\n It is clear that the City cannot be charged with responsibility for the misconduct of the bookkeeper in whom appellants misplaced their confidence nor for the carelessness of the managing trustee in overlooking notices of arrearages.\n\nAppellants make the further contention that the City officials should have known from the state of the records of the two parcels that mailed notice would probably be ineffective. That is, the fact that water charges were not paid while the much larger real estate taxes were paid should have indicated to the officials that something was amiss. They rely on Covey v. Town of Somers, supra. We cannot so hold. In the Covey case, there were uncontroverted allegations that the taxpayer, who lived on the foreclosed property, was known by the officials of a small community to be an incompetent, unable to understand the meaning of any notice served upon her; no attempt was made to have a committee appointed for her person or property until after entry of judgment of foreclosure in an in rem proceeding. The affidavit of the assistant corporation counsel here states that there are more than 834,000 tax parcels in the City, and on the facts of this case the City cannot be held to a duty to determine why a taxpayer neglects some taxes while paying others.\n\nWe conclude, therefore, that the City having taken steps to notify appellants of the arrearages and the foreclosure \n\n[352 \nU.S. 103, 109]\n\u00a0\n proceedings and their agent having received such notices, its application of the statute did not deprive appellants of procedural due process.\n\n2. Appellants also claim a denial of the equal protection of the laws in that the City officials had available to them other remedies for collecting taxes, which would not necessarily have resulted in forfeiture of the entire value of their property. Their theory is that the choice to proceed against their property under Title D, Chapter 17, was arbitrary. We find the contention without merit. The statute is explicit that when the strict foreclosure provisions of Title D, Chapter 17, are invoked, they must be used against all parcels in a section of the City on which charges have been outstanding for four years.\n8\n It is clear that the aim is to prevent precisely the kind of discrimination of which appellants complain. Appellants do not assert that the statute was not complied with in this regard.\n\n3. In their reply brief, appellants urged that by reasons of the City's retention of property, in one instance, and proceeds of sale in the other, far exceeding in value the amounts due, they are deprived of property without due process of law or have suffered a taking without just compensation. They called our attention to United States v. Lawton, \n110 \nU.S. 146\n. In affirming a judgment in favor of a foreclosed landowner for the surplus proceeds from the sale of his land, the Court there said: \"To withhold the \n\n[352 \nU.S. 103, 110]\n\u00a0\n surplus from the owner would be to violate the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution and to deprive him of his property without due process of law, or to take his property for public use without just compensation.\" \n110 \nU.S., at 150\n. However, the statute involved in that case had been construed in United States v. Taylor, \n104 \nU.S. 216\n, to require that the surplus be paid to the owner, and there the problem was treated as purely one of statutory construction without constitutional overtones.\n9\n But we do not have here a statute which absolutely precludes an owner from obtaining the surplus proceeds of a judicial sale. In City of New York v. Chapman Docks Co., 1 App. Div. 2d 895, 149 N. Y. S. 2d 679, an owner filed a timely answer in a foreclosure proceeding, asserting his property had a value substantially exceeding the tax due. The Appellate Division construed D17-12.0 of the statute\n10\n to mean that upon proof of this allegation a separate sale should be directed so that the owner might receive the surplus. What the City of New York has done is to foreclose real property for charges four years delinquent and, in the absence of timely action to redeem or to recover any surplus, retain the property or the entire proceeds of its sale. We hold that nothing in the Federal Constitution prevents this where the record shows adequate steps were taken to notify the owners of the charges due and the foreclosure proceedings.\n\nIt is contended that this is a harsh statute. The New York Court of Appeals took cognizance of this claim and \n\n[352 \nU.S. 103, 111]\n\u00a0\n spoke of the \"extreme hardships\" resulting from the application of the statute in this case. But it held, as we must, that relief from the hardship imposed by a state statute is the responsibility of the state legislature and not of the courts, unless some constitutional guarantee is infringed. In this connection, we note that the New York Legislature this year has ameliorated to some extent the severity of Title D, Chapter 17. Section D17-25.0 was added to the statute, permitting the reconveyance of property acquired and still held by the City upon payment of arrears, interest and the costs of foreclosure. The City concedes this amendment applies to the Powell Street property. Appellants have applied for a reconveyance of that property, and action has been held in abeyance pending the disposition of this appeal.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The statute, D17-1.0 et seq., enacted in 1948, provides for the judicial foreclosure of tax liens on real property. The city treasurer files in the appropriate county clerk's office a list of all parcels in a section or ward of the City on which tax liens have been unpaid for at least four years. Tax liens include unpaid taxes, assessments or water rents, interest and penalties. This filing constitutes the \n\n[352 \nU.S. 103, 105]\n\u00a0\n filing of a complaint and commences an action against the property. Provision is made for notice by posting, publication and mail. The notice must be mailed to the property owner at his last known address. The prescribed notice is to the effect that, unless the amount of unpaid tax liens, together with interest and penalties, are paid within 7 weeks or an answer interposed within 20 days thereafter, any person having the right to redeem or answer shall be foreclosed of all his right, title and interest and equity in and to the delinquent property. Provision is made for entry of a judgment of foreclosure awarding possession of the property to the City and directing execution of a deed conveying an estate in fee simple absolute to the City. The City may retain the property or sell it and retain the entire proceeds.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Appellants and the New York Court of Appeals used the figure $72.50. But the figures given in the affidavit of appellant Gerald D. Nelson (R. 68) yield a total of $65. Altogether, back charges, including those less than four years old, totaled $320.20. This includes $91.20 representing the second half of the 1948-1949 real estate taxes. No water charges were paid from 1945 on. All real estate taxes, with the exception noted, were paid.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] D17-5.0.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] D17-6.0.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] For the years 1945 through 1947. No water charges had been paid since 1945, and the second half 1948-1949 real estate tax was not paid. The total delinquency was $2,681. R. 13-14.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The date on the other bill was June 30, 1951. Appellants introduced the tax bills as a basis for an argument that the City's error in continuing to bill them after the City had acquired title to the 45th Avenue property lulled them into thinking that all was well, so that they took no steps to protect the Powell Street property. The effect of the notice of arrears should, it seems, have been quite the opposite.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] In addition, a deputy city collector annexed to his affidavit copies of letters sent to the trust estate on June 5 and July 9, 1951, advising that there had been double payments of the taxes on the 45th Avenue property.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] D17-5.0, which provides for the filing of lists of delinquent property, provides further, \"Each such list shall comprise all such parcels within a particular section or ward designated on the tax maps of the city, except those parcels excluded from such lists as hereinafter provided.\" The grounds for exclusion are (1) question raised as to the validity of the tax lien on the parcel, (2) and (3) accepted agreement to pay delinquent taxes in installments, and (4) tax lien on the property sold within two years and enforcement of the lien not completed.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] See also Chapman v.

JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis suit was brought by petitioner against respondent county and its treasurer for a declaratory judgment that petitioner was not required to pay certain state and county \"personal property\" taxes and for an injunction against the levy of such taxes on that property. The controlling facts are not in dispute. Petitioner is a Nebraska corporation organized primarily to provide housing for rent or sale. On January 18, 1951, petitioner entered into a contract with the Secretary of the Air Force to lease 63 acres of land and to build a housing project on Offutt Air Force Base in respondent county in accordance with specifications submitted to the Department of the Air Force and to be approved by the Federal Housing Commissioner.\n\nThe lease was for 75 years at a rental price of $100 per year. It provided that the \"buildings and improvements erected by the Lessee, constituting the aforesaid housing project, shall be and become, as completed, real estate and part of the leased land, and public buildings of the United States, leased to Lessee . . .\" and further provided that \"upon the expiration of this lease, or earlier termination, all improvements made upon the leased premises shall remain the property of the Government without compensation . . . .\" Petitioner was to lease all the units of the project to such military and civilian personnel at the Base as were designated by the Commanding Officer, \n\n[351 \nU.S. 253, 255]\n\u00a0\n on terms specified in the contract and at a maximum rent approved by the Federal Housing Administration and the Air Force. The Government was to provide fire and police protection to the project on a reimbursable basis. Petitioner had the right to permit public utilities to extend water, gas, sewer, telephone, and electric power lines onto the leased land in order to provide those services. Petitioner agreed to insure the buildings at its own expense, to permit Government inspection of the premises, and to comply with regulations prescribed by the Commanding Officer for military requirements for safety and security purposes, consistent with the use of the leased land for housing. Petitioner could not assign the lease without the written approval of the Secretary of the Air Force.\n\nThe preferred stock of petitioner was held by the Commissioner of the Federal Housing Administration which, acting under Title VIII of the National Housing Act (the Wherry Military Housing Act), 63 Stat. 570, insured a mortgage on the project after receiving a certificate from the Department of the Air Force that a housing project was necessary to provide adequate housing for civilian or military personnel. After the signing of the contract and the insurance of the mortgage, construction proceeded forthwith. Petitioner filed no county tax return, although the Attorney General of Nebraska had ruled that its interest in the project, including all of the \"personal property\" used therein, was taxable as \"personal property.\" On June 23, 1952, the county assessor of Sarpy County filed a schedule on behalf of petitioner, listing a taxable total of $825,685, itemized as \"Furniture & Fixtures - Tools & Equipment\"; \"Household Appliances\"; and \"Improvements on Leased Land.\" Petitioner never paid the resulting county and state taxes, and after the county treasurer threatened to issue the usual distress warrant to collect the taxes, petitioner brought this suit. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 253, 256]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe District Court of Sarpy County held that, since title to the buildings and improvements was in the United States, Nebraska and Sarpy County could not tax them. The Supreme Court of Nebraska reversed, holding that Congress had given Nebraska the right to tax petitioner's interest in the property and that for tax purposes, under Neb. Rev. Stat., Reissue 1950, 77-1209, petitioner was in fact and as a matter of law the owner of the property sought to be taxed. 160 Neb. 320, 70 N. W. 2d 382. Petitioner's attack on the Nebraska judgment raises serious questions of state-federal relations with respect to taxation of private housing developments on Government-owned land, and therefore we granted certiorari. \n350 \nU.S. 893\n.\n\nThis is another in a long series of cases in this Court dealing with the power of the States to tax property in private hands against a claim of exempt status deriving from an immunity of the Federal Government from state taxation. Offutt Air Force Base falls within the scope of Article I, 8, cl. 17 of the United States Constitution, providing that the Congress shall have power\n\n  \"To exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases  whatsoever, over such District [of Columbia] . . .  and to exercise like Authority over all Places purchased  by the Consent of the Legislature of the State  in which the same shall be, for the Erection of Forts.  Magazines, Arsenals, dock-Yards, and other needful  Buildings . . . .\"\n\n\n The course of construction of this provision cannot be said to have run smooth. The power of \"exclusive Legislation\" has been held to prohibit a state tax on private property located on a military base acquired pursuant to Art. I, 8, cl. 17. Surplus Trading Co. v. Cook, \n281 \nU.S. 647\n. On the other hand, the State may acquire the right to tax private interests within such a location \n\n[351 \nU.S. 253, 257]\n\u00a0\n by permission of Congress, see, e. g., the Buck Act, 54 Stat. 1059 (permitting state sales, use, and income taxes), and we have also held that the State may tax when the United States divests itself of proprietary interest over the area on which the tax is sought to be levied. S. R. A., Inc. v. Minnesota, \n327 \nU.S. 558\n; see also Baltimore Shipbuilding Co. v. Baltimore, \n195 \nU.S. 375\n.\n\nThe line of least resistance in analysis of our immediate problem is to ascertain whether Congress has given consent to the type of state taxation here asserted. The applicable congressional statutes are the Military Leasing Act of 1947 and the Wherry Military Housing Act of 1949 (adding Title VIII to the National Housing Act). The Military Leasing Act provides:\n\n\"That whenever the Secretary of War or the Secretary of the Navy shall deem it to be advantageous to the Government he is authorized to lease such real or personal property under the control of his Department as is not surplus to the needs of the Department within the meaning of the Act of October 3, 1944 (58 Stat. 765), and is not for the time required for public use, to such lessee or lessees and upon such terms and conditions as in his judgment will promote the national defense or will be in the public interest. Each such lease shall be for a period not exceeding five years unless the Secretary of the Department concerned shall determine that a longer period will promote the national defense or will be in the public interest. . . . Each such lease shall contain a provision permitting the Secretary of the Department concerned to revoke the lease at any time, unless the Secretary shall determine that the omission of such provision from the lease will promote the national defense or will be in the public interest. In any event each such lease shall be revocable by the Secretary \n\n[351 \nU.S. 253, 258]\n\u00a0\n of the Department concerned during a national emergency declared by the President. . . . The authority herein granted shall not apply to oil, mineral, or phosphate lands. . . .\n\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \"SEC. 6. The lessee's interest, made or created pursuant to the provisions of this Act, shall be made subject to State or local taxation. Any lease of property authorized under the provisions of this Act shall contain a provision that if and to the extent that such property is made taxable by State and local governments by Act of Congress, in such event the terms of such lease shall be renegotiated.\" 61 Stat. 774-776.\n\n\n Two years later, the Wherry Act provided:\n\n\"Whenever the Secretary of the Army, Navy, or Air Force determines that it is desirable to lease real property within the meaning of the Act of August 5, 1947 (61 Stat. 774), to effectuate the purposes of this title, the Secretary concerned is authorized to lease such property under the authority of said Act upon such terms and conditions as in his opinion will best serve the national interest without regard to the limitations imposed by said Act in respect to the term or duration of the lease, and the power vested in the Secretary of the Department concerned to revoke any lease made pursuant to said Act in the event of a national emergency declared by the President shall not apply. . . .\" 63 Stat. 570, 576.\n\n\n These two Acts interlock and must be read together. The reasonable relationship between them has been thus delineated by the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit:\n\n \"In our view this provision of the National Housing Act [the 1949 Act] merely permits leasing for \n\n[351 \nU.S. 253, 259]\n\u00a0\n military housing purposes, already covered by the general authorization of the 1947 Act, to be accomplished without regard to specified restrictions of the 1947 Act, when the elimination of these restrictions would serve the purposes of the Housing Act. Other provisions of the 1947 Act, including the language of Section 6 subjecting the lessee's interest to local taxation, apply to leases made under the authority of both Acts.\n\n\n \"We have not overlooked the argument for a narrower view of the scope of the 1947 Act based upon legislative history indicating that the primary purpose of that Act was to provide for the leasing of stand-by defense plants. But the language of the Act extends the leasing authority to all non-surplus property under the control of the Defense Department except oil, mineral, or phosphate lands (an exception which would be unnecessary if the Act applied only to defense plants). An additional indication that the 1947 Act encompasses the leasing of property generally is found in Section 2 which repeals the prior authority for the leasing of War Department property generally, 27 Stat. 321. The Senate Report expresses the reporting committee's understanding that this prior leasing statute was being `entirely superseded'. Sen. Rep. No. 626, 1947, 80th Cong. 1st Sess. [p. 3].\" Fort Dix Apartments Corp. v. Borough of Wrightstown, 225 F.2d 473. 475-476.\n\n\n We agree with this. To be sure, the 1947 Act does not refer specifically to property in an area subject to the power of \"exclusive Legislation\" by Congress. It does, however, govern the leasing of Government property generally and its permission to tax extends generally to all lessees' interests created by virtue of the Act. The legislative \n\n[351 \nU.S. 253, 260]\n\u00a0\n history indicates a concern about loss of revenue to the States and a desire to prevent unfairness toward competitors of the private interests that might otherwise escape taxation. While the latter consideration is not necessarily applicable where military housing is involved, the former is equally relevant to leases for military housing as for any other purpose.\n\nWe do not say that this is the only admissible construction of these Acts. We could regard Art. I, 8, cl. 17 as of such overriding and comprehensive scope that consent by Congress to state taxation of obviously valuable private interests located in an area subject to the power of \"exclusive Legislation\" is to be found only in explicit and unambiguous legislative enactment. We have not heretofore so regarded it, see S. R. A., Inc. v. Minnesota, \n327 \nU.S. 558\n; Baltimore Shipbuilding Co. v. Baltimore, \n195 \nU.S. 375\n, nor are we constrained by reason to treat this exercise by Congress of the \"exclusive Legislation\" power and the manner of construing it any differently from any other exercise by Congress of that power. This is one of those cases in which Congress has seen fit not to express itself unequivocally. It has preferred to use general language and thereby requires the judiciary to apply this general language to a specific problem. To that end we must resort to whatever aids to interpretation the legislation in its entirety and its history provide. Charged as we are with this function, we have concluded that the more persuasive construction of the statute, however flickering and feeble the light afforded for extracting its meaning, is that the States were to be permitted to tax private interests, like those of this petitioner, in housing projects located on areas subject to the federal power of \"exclusive Legislation.\" We do not hold that Congress has relinquished this power over these areas. We hold only that Congress, in the exercise of this power, has permitted \n\n[351 \nU.S. 253, 261]\n\u00a0\n such state taxation as is involved in the present case.\n\nPetitioner also argues that the state tax, measured by the full value of the buildings and improvements, is not on the \"lessee's interest\" but is on the full value of property owned by the Government. Labeling the Government as the \"owner\" does not foreclose us from ascertaining the nature of the real interests created and so does not solve the problem. See Millinery Center Building Corp. v. Commissioner, \n350 \nU.S. 456\n. The lease is for 75 years; the buildings and improvements have an estimated useful life of 35 years. The enjoyment of the entire worth of the buildings and improvements will therefore be petitioner's.\n\nPetitioner argues, however, that the Government has a substantial interest in the buildings and improvements, since the Government prescribed the maximum rents and determined the occupants, had voting interests in petitioner, provided services, and took the financial risks by insuring the project. Petitioner compares its own position to that of a \"managing agent.\" This characterization is an attempt by use of a phrase to make these facts fit an abstract legal category. This contention would certainly surprise a Congress which was interested in having private enterprise and not the Government conduct these housing projects. The Government may have \"title,\" but only a paper title, and, while it retained the controls described in the lease as a regulatory mechanism to prevent the ordinary operation of unbridled economic forces, this does not mean that the value of the buildings and improvements should thereby be partially allocated to it. If an ordinary private housing venture were being assessed for tax purposes, the value would not be allocated between an owner and the mortgage company which does his financing or between the owner and the State, which may fix rents and provide \n\n[351 \nU.S. 253, 262]\n\u00a0\n services. In the circumstances of this case, then, the full value of the buildings and improvements is attributable to the lessee's interest.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nPetitioner further argues that the tax on the appliances and furniture is invalid because petitioner owns those items, never bought them from the Government, and that therefore its interest was not \"made or created pursuant to the provisions of this Act [the Military Leasing Act of 1947].\" Here again using a label, that of \"owner,\" as descriptive of petitioner does not answer the question. It appears from the record that petitioner was required to supply the appliances for the housing project. petitioner and its tenants will have full use of them for the lease period and they or their replacements must be left on the property at the end of the lease. Petitioner's interest in the appliances, just like its interest in the buildings, is determined by its agreement with the Government and, keeping in mind the purpose of 6, we interpret that section as treating these items alike.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nFor these reasons the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nebraska must be\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The record before us is unclear whether the estimated useful life of all the appliances and furniture is less than the lease period. To the extent that the estimated useful life of any of these items extends beyond the term of the lease, the value attributable to such period must be excluded from the tax, since it represent the Government's ownership interest. In the present state of the record, however, petitioner's remedy, if any, is in the Nebraska courts, not here.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The record does not indicate clearly the relationship of the parties with respect to the furniture - valued at $205 in the total 1952 valuation of the taxable property at $825,685. This is a minor matter and we leave petitioner to seek redress in the Nebraska courts should the interests of the Government and petitioner in the furniture be significantly different from their interests in the appliances or buildings. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 253, 263]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom MR. JUSTICE REED, MR. JUSTICE BURTON, and MR. JUSTICE HARLAN concur, dissenting.\n\nThere are two reasons why I dissent in this case.\n\nFirst. The legislative history of the Wherry Act makes clear that the purpose of the legislation was to encourage military personnel to remain in the Armed Forces by providing clean, adequate, and inexpensive housing for them. H. R. Rep. No. 854, 81st Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 2, 4; S. Rep. No. 410, 81st Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 2, 4-5. There is nothing to indicate that Congress departed from the established practice (Surplus Trading Co. v. Cook, \n281 \nU.S. 647\n) and consented to local taxation on the federal enclaves. Taxation by local authorities of a housing project is one sure way of increasing its cost and hampering the federal program. If that had been intended, I would expect plain language revealing the purpose. The Court finds no plain language but relies only on adumbration and reasoning from elaborate implication. Yet the \"doctrine of sovereign immunity is so embedded in constitutional history and practice that this Court cannot subject the Government or its official agencies to state taxation without a clear congressional mandate.\" Kern-Limerick, Inc. v. Scurlock, \n347 \nU.S. 110, 122\n.\n\nTo be sure, the Wherry Act and the Military Leasing Act are intertwined and 6 of the Leasing Act makes the \"lessee's interest\" subject to local taxation. But the intertwining of the two Acts is very limited. Section 805 of the Wherry Act authorizes the Secretaries of the Armed Forces to make leases under the authority of the Leasing Act, without regard to the limitations imposed by it as respects the term or duration of the lease. But the authority to lease and the limitations imposed on leases are contained in 1 of the Leasing Act. Nothing in the language of 805 requires the balance of the Act to be \n\n[351 \nU.S. 253, 264]\n\u00a0\n incorporated. We strain beyond the normal demands of language to pull 6 of the Leasing Act into the Wherry Act. Section 807 of the Wherry Act deals with taxation. It allows local taxation of real property acquired by the Federal Housing Commissioner. I would suppose that if local taxation is specifically allowed in one instance, the waiver of immunity is limited, not general. We usurp the function of the lawmakers when we hold to the contrary.\n\nSecond. Even if the Wherry Act be read as including 6 of the Leasing Act, we should rebel at the application now given it. Section 6 of the Leasing Act, if applicable, only subjects the \"lessee's interest\" to local taxation. Yet the Court allows the local tax to be placed on the entire value of the property. Its justification apparently is the low annual rental charged by the United States to the lessee, the length of the lease, and the useful life of the buildings and improvements. The \"enjoyment of the entire worth\" of the property will be the lessee's, says the Court. The interest of the Federal Government is therefore nominal. For these reasons the \"lessee's interest\" is held to include the entire value of the property.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nThis formalism misses the entire point. The Government's stake here cannot be measured by bare legal title. It has vast and important interests in these projects. It owns the controlling stock in the lessee. It prescribes the maximum rentals. It determines what persons may occupy the living quarters. It assumes most of the financial risks of these housing projects by insuring the mortgagees. It provides police and fire protection, sewerage and water service, and access roads. The United \n\n[351 \nU.S. 253, 265]\n\u00a0\n States is not a mere lessor who, having leased the property, allows it to be managed by the lessee. The great decisions as to management are made by the Government. The lessee is, indeed, a managing agent.\n\nThe lease makes the buildings and improvements property of the United States. That reservation of title may not be challenged here as colorable. See Kern-Limerick, Inc. v. Scurlock, supra, 116-123. It was made to protect the large interests of the United States in low-cost housing on federal enclaves - a purpose now partially defeated by what we do today. For, once the local taxes are imposed, the rentals to the servicemen rise, unless the United States pays the bill. Ironically, the rents rise without the servicemen receiving more benefits of local government than even transients receive. The tax is a windfall to the local Nebraska authorities as the Federal Government provides the governmental services protective of the property taxed.\n2\n\u00a0\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] It is of interest that an effort was made in the Senate Committee on Armed Services to provide in the Leasing Act that when property was leased by the Government the entire value be subject to local taxation. See Hearings, Senate Committee on Armed Services on S. 1198, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 27-32. But that proposal was rejected by the Senate Committee.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Under the Buck Act, 54 Stat. 1059, as amended, 4 U.S.C. 104-110, residents of military reservations pay state sales, use, income, and gasoline taxes. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 253, 266]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","65":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPARR v. UNITED STATES(1956)\nNo. 320\nArgued: March 28, 1956Decided: June 11, 1956\n\n\n\n\n1. \nPetitioner was indicted in one division of the Federal District Court for the Southern District of Texas, and that Court granted his motion to transfer the case to another division, on the ground that local prejudice would prevent a fair trial in the division where he was indicted. Subsequently, the Government obtained a new indictment in another district for the same offenses and moved in the first court for dismissal of the first indictment. This motion was granted, and petitioner appealed. Held: The Court of Appeals was without jurisdiction, because there was no final judgment. Pp. 514-521.\n\n (a) Considering the first indictment alone, an appeal from its dismissal will not lie, because petitioner has not been aggrieved, even though he is left open to further prosecution. Pp. 516-517.\n\n\n (b) Viewing the two indictments together as parts of a single prosecution, dismissal of the first indictment was not a final order but only an interlocutory step in petitioner's prosecution. Pp. 518-519.\n\n\n (c) Dismissal of the first indictment does not come within the exceptions to the rule of \"finality,\" because lack of an appeal at this stage will not deny effective review of his claim that he was entitled to trial in the court to which his first indictment was transferred. Pp. 519-520.\n\n\n2. \nPetitioner's motion for leave to file in this Court an original petition for writs of mandamus and prohibition to the federal district courts of both districts, to require his trial in the court to which the first indictment was transferred, is denied. Pp. 520-521.\n\n 225 F.2d 329, affirmed.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Together with No. 202, Misc., Parr v. Rice, U.S. District Judge, et al., on motion for leave to file petition for writs of mandamus and prohibition.\n\nEverett L. Looney and Abe Fortas argued the cause for petitioner. With them on the brief in No. 320 and the motion in No. 202, Misc., were Thurman Arnold, Marvin K. Collie and Thomas E. James. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 513, 514]\n\u00a0\n\n\nGray Thoron argued the cause for the United States. With him on the brief for respondents were Solicitor General Sobeloff, Acting Assistant Attorney General Rice, Joseph M. Howard and Lawrence K. Bailey.\n\nOpinion of the Court by MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, announced by MR. JUSTICE BURTON.\n\nIn November 1954 petitioner was indicted in the Corpus Christi Division of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas for willfully attempting to evade federal income taxes by filing false returns for the years 1949, 1950 and 1951.\n1\n In April 1955 the District Court granted petitioner's motion to transfer the case to the Laredo Division of the Southern District, finding that petitioner, a prominent political figure, could not obtain a fair trial in the Corpus Christi Division because of local prejudice against him.\n2\n Deeming itself without power to transfer the case elsewhere than Laredo without the defendant's consent,\n3\n the District Court also found against the Government's claim that it would or \n\n[351 \nU.S. 513, 515]\n\u00a0\n might be under \"a severe handicap\" in trying the petitioner in Laredo.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nShortly thereafter, on May 3, 1955, the Government obtained a new indictment against petitioner in the Austin Division of the Western District of Texas for the same offenses.\n5\n The next day it moved in the Corpus Christi Division for leave to dismiss the first indictment.\n6\n This motion was granted over the vigorous opposition of the petitioner, and an order of dismissal was entered.\n7\n\u00a0\n\n[351 \nU.S. 513, 516]\n\u00a0\n Petitioner appealed to the Court of Appeals and, on the Government's motion, that court (one judge dissenting) dismissed the appeal upon the ground that the order appealed from was not a final order. 225 F.2d 329. We granted certiorari, directing that the case be heard both on the merits and on the question of appealability. \n350 \nU.S. 861\n. Since we conclude that the order in question was not appealable, we do not reach the merits.\n\n1. If the Corpus Christi indictment is viewed in isolation from the Austin indictment, an appeal from its dismissal will not lie because petitioner has not been aggrieved. Only one injured by the judgment sought to be reviewed can appeal, and, regarding the Corpus \n\n[351 \nU.S. 513, 517]\n\u00a0\n Christi proceeding as a separate prosecution, petitioner has not been injured by its termination in his favor. Lewis v. United States, \n216 \nU.S. 611\n.\n8\n So far as petitioner's standing to appeal is concerned, it makes no difference whether the dismissal still leaves him open to further prosecution, or whether, as petitioner contends, it bars his prosecution elsewhere than in Laredo because the transfer order operated to give him a vested right to be tried only there. The testing of the effect of the dismissal order must abide petitioner's trial, and only then, if convicted, will he have been aggrieved. Cf. Heike v. United States, \n217 \nU.S. 423\n.\n9\n\u00a0\n\n[351 \nU.S. 513, 518]\n\u00a0\n\n\n2. If the Corpus Christi and Austin indictments be viewed together as parts of a single prosecution, petitioner fares no better. For then the order dismissing the Corpus Christi indictment would not be a final order. The considerations underlying the historic requirement of \"finality\" in federal appellate procedure require no elaboration at this late date. See Cobbledick v. United States, \n309 \nU.S. 323\n. In general, a \"judgment\" or \"decision\" is final for the purpose of appeal only \"when it terminates the litigation between the parties on the merits of the case, and leaves nothing to be done but to enforce by execution what has been determined.\" St. Louis, I. M. & S. R. Co. v. Southern Express Co., \n108 \nU.S. 24, 28\n. This rule applies in criminal as well as civil cases. Berman v. United States, \n302 \nU.S. 211, 212\n-213.\n\nIt is argued that the order dismissing the Corpus Christi indictment was \"final\" because it (a) terminated the prosecution under that indictment, and (b) cannot be reviewed otherwise than upon this appeal. We think neither point well taken. \"Final judgment in a criminal case means sentence. The sentence is the judgment.\" Berman v. United States, supra, at p. 212. And viewing the two indictments together as a single prosecution, the Austin indictment being as it were a superseding indictment, petitioner has not yet been tried, much less convicted and sentenced. The order dismissing the Corpus Christi indictment was but an interlocutory step in this prosecution, and its review must await the conclusion of the \"whole matter litigated\" between the Government and the petitioner - namely, \"the right to convict the \n\n[351 \nU.S. 513, 519]\n\u00a0\n accused of the crime charged in the indictment.\" Heike v. United States, supra, at p. 429.\n\nNor is there substance to the claim that the Corpus Christi dismissal will not be reviewable if petitioner is convicted under the Austin indictment. If petitioner is correct in his contention that the Laredo transfer precluded the Government from proceeding elsewhere, he could not be tried in Austin, and, if petitioner preserves the point, he will certainly be entitled to have the Corpus Christi dismissal reviewed upon an appeal from a judgment of conviction under the Austin indictment. To hold this order \"final\" at this stage of the prosecution would defeat the long-standing statutory policy against piecemeal appeals.\n\n3. We also find untenable petitioner's secondary contention that, even if not final, the Corpus Christi dismissal falls within the exceptions to the rule of \"finality\" recognized by this Court in such cases as Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., \n337 \nU.S. 541\n, and Swift & Company Packers v. Compania Columbiana del Caribe, \n339 \nU.S. 684\n. In those cases, orders made during the course of a litigation were held appealable because they related to matters outside the stream of the main action and would not be subject to effective review as part of the final judgment in the action. Unlike the orders in those cases, this order was but a \"step toward final disposition of the merits of the case\" and will \"be merged in the final judgment.\" Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., supra, at p. 546. The lack of an appeal now will not \"deny effective review of a claim fairly severable from the context of a larger litigious process.\" Swift & Company Packers v. Compania Columbiana del Caribe, supra, at p. 689. True, the petitioner will have to hazard a trial under the Austin indictment before he can get a review of whether he should have been tried in Laredo under the Corpus Christi indictment, but \"bearing the \n\n[351 \nU.S. 513, 520]\n\u00a0\n discomfiture and cost of a prosecution for crime even by an innocent person is one of the painful obligations of citizenship.\" Cobbledick v. United States, supra, at p. 325.\n\n4. With his petition for certiorari, petitioner also filed a motion, Docket No. 202, Misc., for leave to file an original petition in this Court for writs of mandamus and prohibition to the Southern and Western District Courts, designed to require petitioner's trial in Laredo.\n10\n Although this application has stood in abeyance pending determination of the questions involved on the writ of certiorari, it is appropriate to dispose of it now, it having been fully argued in the present proceeding.\n\nWe think that extraordinary writs should not issue. Such writs may go only in aid of appellate jurisdiction. 28 U.S.C. 1651. The power to issue them is discretionary and it is sparingly exercised. Rule 30 of the Revised Rules of this Court and the cases cited therein. This is not a case where a court has exceeded or refused to exercise its jurisdiction, see Roche v. Evaporated Milk Assn., \n319 \nU.S. 21, 26\n, nor one where appellate review will be defeated if a writ does not issue, cf. Maryland v. Soper, \n270 \nU.S. 9, 29\n-30. Here the most that could be claimed is that the district courts have erred in ruling on matters within their jurisdiction. The extraordinary writs do not reach to such cases; they may not be used \n\n[351 \nU.S. 513, 521]\n\u00a0\n to thwart the congressional policy against piecemeal appeals. Roche v. Evaporated Milk Assn., supra, at p. 30.\n\nWe conclude that the Court of Appeals properly dismissed the appeal, and its judgment must be\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n The motion for leave to file a petition for writs of mandamus and prohibition in No. 202, Misc., is\n\n      Denied.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 145 (b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, 53 Stat. 62.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Fed.

Under 18 U.S.C. 3237, petitioner was indictable both in the Western District (where his returns were filed) and in the Southern District (where the returns were prepared and forwarded for filing).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Fed. Rules Crim. Proc., 48 (a): \"The Attorney General or the United States attorney may by leave of court file a dismissal of an indictment, information or complaint and the prosecution shall thereupon terminate. Such a dismissal may not be filed during the trial without the consent of the defendant.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] The petitioner opposed the motion on the ground that it was an attempt to circumvent the District Court's prior order transferring the case to Laredo. It is clear that the principal purpose of the Government in obtaining the Austin indictment was to avoid a trial in Laredo, which it regarded as \"the defendant's seat of political power,\" and that this purpose was made manifest to District Judge Kennerly who (together with Judge Allred) had acted on petitioner's earlier transfer application. In granting the motion to dismiss, Judge Kennerly stated: \"I reached the conclusion [upon petitioner's earlier motion to transfer the case to Laredo] that the case should not be tried in Corpus Christi, and that defendant's motion for change of venue should be granted. \"In reaching that conclusion, or rather in examining the record, I reached this further conclusion, that I gravely doubted whether in the administration of justice generally, the case should be tried in this district at all . . . . \"But when I came to examine the law, I found that I was without \n\n[351 \nU.S. 513, 516]\n\u00a0\n power to transfer the case outside of the Southern District of Texas . . . . If I had had that authority I would have sent it to Amarillo, or Sherman, or Texarkana, or some of those places as far removed from the scene of the troubles as I could, or as I could find. I would have done that not, as I say, to favor either the defendant or the Government, because I feel that justice in the case would be best administered by transferring the case to one of those places. \"But as stated, I could not do that as I understand the law. I then discovered that I could not transfer the case to any other division of the district except Laredo . . . . [S]o the case was transferred there. \"Now we come to this motion by the Government to dismiss the case because of the fact that a new indictment covering the same matter has been presented in the Western District . . . . \". . . evidently there is some discretion in the Court as to the matter of whether the case should or should not be dismissed. \"In twenty-four years on the bench in this district, I do not recall ever having at any time hesitated to dismiss a case when requested by the Government. That was of course under the old law, and under the present rules [sic]. If I have a discretion under the rules now as to whether this case should or should not be dismissed, I must exercise that discretion and allow it to be dismissed, because I do not think that the defendant, either in the hearing this morning or in this enormous record on the question of change of venue, has shown any reasons why the case should not be dismissed.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] It is suggested that the defendant in Lewis was held not to be aggrieved only because the statute of limitations prevented his reindictment. The Court alluded to that circumstance, however, only after holding that the defendant could not be \"legally aggrieved\" by being released from prosecution under the indictment; the bar of the statute of limitations was noted only in connection with a concluding observation that the case was moot in any event.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] To support his claim of aggrievement, petitioner, by way of analogy, relies upon four lower court decisions granting appeals from judgments of nonsuit in civil cases. In three of the cases, however, the defendant was asserting a right to a judgment in his favor on the merits, claimed to have been fully established prior to the nonsuit, and was obviously aggrieved by the loss of that judgment. Connecticut Fire Ins. Co. v. Manning, 177 F. 893 (C. A. 8th Cir.); Massachusetts Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Schmick, 58 F.2d 130 (C. A. 8th Cir.); Iowa-Nebraska L. & P. Co. v. Daniels, 63 F.2d 322 (C. A. 8th Cir.) In the fourth case, Cybur Lumber Co. v. Erkhart, 247 F. 284 (C. A. 5th Cir.), the plaintiff took a nonsuit only after a previous verdict in his favor had been reversed on appeal and the case had been remanded for a new trial with directions to direct a verdict for the defendant if the evidence was the same; the defendant claimed a right to a judgment if the plaintiff did not proceed to trial on the remand. In all of the cited cases, therefore, the defendant was asserting a right to a judgment on the basis of the progress of the action prior to the nonsuit - a substantial right going to the merits of the controversy of which he had been deprived \n\n[351 \nU.S. 513, 518]\n\u00a0\n by the nonsuit. No such circumstances are present here. Cf. Fed. Rules Crim. Proc., 48 (a): \". . . Such a dismissal may not be filed during the trial without the consent of the defendant.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] Petitioner had also been denied writs of mandamus and prohibition in the Court of Appeals, and the writ of certiorari brought up that ruling as well as the dismissal of the appeal. The prerogative writs sought in the Court of Appeals, however, were designed solely to stay the proceedings in the Western District pending the final disposition of the appeal and not to afford permanent relief. Since the Western District Court subsequently granted the Government's motion for such a stay, that part of the case on certiorari is now moot. Thus it is only petitioner's original application to this Court in No. 202, Misc., that is before us.\n\nMR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN, with whom MR. JUSTICE BLACK, MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS and MR. JUSTICE CLARK join, dissenting.\n\nThe petitioner, Parr, was indicted for income tax evasion in the United States District Court at Corpus Christi, Texas. He asked and obtained a transfer of the proceeding to Laredo, Texas, on the ground that he could not obtain a fair and impartial trial in Corpus Christi. The Government was dissatisfied with the transfer but had no right under law to ask that the case be transferred to some other district. In this situation, the Government conceived the idea of having Parr indicted at Austin, Texas, thereafter dismissing the case against him in Laredo. Parr protested on the ground that he had a right to be tried, if at all, in Laredo, the place where the District Court had already determined a fair trial could be obtained. His protest was overruled. Parr then appealed to the Court of Appeals. That court dismissed the appeal on the ground that there was no final appealable judgment under 28 U.S.C. 1291. The Court today affirms that holding without reaching the merits of the District Court's action in dismissing the indictment. We think the judgment is appealable under 1291 and \n\n[351 \nU.S. 513, 522]\n\u00a0\n that it was error for the District Court to dismiss the case in Laredo.\n\nThe dismissal of the indictment, if valid, was a \"final\" decision of the Laredo Court in that case. This is true even if a new indictment could be obtained in the Laredo District Court or in some other court. In fact, a new indictment was obtained in the Austin District Court before the Laredo Court dismissed the indictment in this case. But this new indictment made the dismissal of the Laredo indictment against Parr no less \"final.\" For the Laredo case, after dismissal, did not remain \"open, unfinished or inconclusive\"; nor was the decision dismissing it \"tentative, informal or incomplete.\" Cohen v. Beneficial Loan Corp., \n337 \nU.S. 541, 546\n. There was nothing interlocutory about the dismissal. It was not simply an indecisive step in the course of a case which might ultimately result in conviction of Parr. For if Parr is to be convicted on the charge made in the Laredo indictment, it will have to come from the institution of a new case. The time for Parr to appeal from the dismissal of this case against him in Laredo, if ever, was after its \"final\" disposition by the judge at Laredo. It would appear to be almost a fantastic interpretation of \"finality\" to hold otherwise.\n\nThe majority contend that, even if the dismissal had the requisite finality, petitioner may not appeal it because he was not aggrieved thereby, relying upon Lewis v. United States, \n216 \nU.S. 611\n. But that case should not control here, since no new indictment had been returned against Lewis before or after the dismissal of the indictment he sought to have reviewed, and an applicable statute of limitations barred any further effort to indict him. Here, a new indictment was returned against petitioner before the dismissal. If he had, as we believe he had, a right to be tried in Laredo or not at all, clearly he was aggrieved by the dismissal under the circumstances. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 513, 523]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt seems to be intimated, however, that Parr might be able to raise the question somehow after trial at Austin if he should be convicted in the new and different case brought there. This Court can write law to that effect. We do not think it should. We countenance plain harassment if we require Parr to be tried under what may turn out to be an invalid indictment at Austin before he can obtain appellate review of dismissal of the Laredo case. Should this occur, Parr would have been required to undergo two trials, one at Austin and another at Laredo. Section 1291 should not be construed so as to bring about such a result.\n\nWe think it was error for the District Court at Laredo to dismiss the case there. Rule 21 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure allows defendants to obtain changes of venue in order to get fair and impartial trial. No rule or statute grants such a privilege to the United States. The Government can and probably frequently does shop around to find a court it deems most favorable to try defendants. Here, the Government selected Corpus Christi as the forum in which to prosecute Parr, although, for the last 20 years preceding, the Government had filed all tax-evasion cases arising in that district in Austin. Here, after the Government's choice for trial was found by the District Court to be unfair to the defendant, and Laredo was found to provide a fair place for trial, the Government is being allowed to frustrate the court's selection of Laredo by filing a new indictment in a new case in Austin. We think the Government should not be allowed to circumvent the court's order in that fashion. Rule 21 (c) provides that, after transfer under that rule, \"the prosecution shall continue\" in the place to which the case has been transferred. There is no finding of any kind that the Government will not get a fair trial at Laredo. The finding was expressly \n\n[351 \nU.S. 513, 524]\n\u00a0\n to the contrary. The specific purpose of Rule 21 is to have trials that can be fair and impartial. The object of the Government here is to escape from a court where it has been decided after a full hearing that a fair and impartial trial will be given. There is no reason that we can see why Rule 21 should not be given its full effect by requiring trial to take place in the district court to which it has been removed in the interest of fairness. We would reverse this case. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 513, 525]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","66":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPENNSYLVANIA v.

CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe respondent Steve Nelson, an acknowledged member of the Communist Party, was convicted in the Court of Quarter Sessions of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, of a violation of the Pennsylvania Sedition Act\n1\n and sentenced to imprisonment for twenty years and to a fine of $10,000 and to costs of prosecution in the sum of $13,000. The Superior Court affirmed the conviction. 172 Pa. Super. 125, 92 A. 2d 431. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, recognizing but not reaching many alleged serious trial errors and conduct of the trial court infringing upon respondent's right to due process of law,\n2\n decided \n\n[350 \nU.S. 497, 499]\n\u00a0\n the case on the narrow issue of supersession of the state law by the Federal Smith Act.\n3\n In its opinion, the court stated:\n\n \"And, while the Pennsylvania statute proscribes  sedition against either the Government of the United  States or the Government of Pennsylvania, it is only  alleged sedition against the United States with which  the instant case is concerned. Out of all the voluminous  testimony, we have not found, nor has anyone  pointed to, a single word indicating a seditious  act or even utterance directed against the Government  of Pennsylvania.\"\n4\n\u00a0\n\n\n The precise holding of the court, and all that is before us for review, is that the Smith Act of 1940,\n5\n as amended in 1948,\n6\n which prohibits the knowing advocacy of the overthrow of the Government of the United States by force and violence, supersedes the enforceability of the Pennsylvania Sedition Act which proscribes the same conduct.\n\nMany State Attorneys General and the Solicitor General of the United States appeared as amici curiae for petitioner, and several briefs were filed on behalf of the respondent. Because of the important question of federal-state relationship involved, we granted certiorari. \n348 \nU.S. 814\n. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 497, 500]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt should be said at the outset that the decision in this case does not affect the right of States to enforce their sedition laws at times when the Federal Government has not occupied the field and is not protecting the entire country from seditious conduct. The distinction between the two situations was clearly recognized by the court below.\n7\n Nor does it limit the jurisdiction of the States where the Constitution and Congress have specifically given them concurrent jurisdiction, as was done under the Eighteenth Amendment and the Volstead Act. United States v. Lanza, \n260 \nU.S. 377\n. Neither does it limit the right of the State to protect itself at any time against sabotage or attempted violence of all kinds.\n8\n Nor does it prevent the State from prosecuting where the same act constitutes both a federal offense and a state offense under the police power, as was done in Fox v. Ohio, 5 How. 410, and Gilbert v. Minnesota, \n254 \nU.S. 325\n, relied upon by petitioner as authority herein. In neither of those cases did the state statute impinge on \n\n[350 \nU.S. 497, 501]\n\u00a0\n federal jurisdiction. In the Fox case, the federal offense was counterfeiting. The state offense was defrauding the person to whom the spurious money was passed. In the Gilbert case this Court, in upholding the enforcement of a state statute, proscribing conduct which would \"interfere with or discourage the enlistment of men in the military or naval forces of the United States or of the State of Minnesota,\" treated it not as an act relating to \"the raising of armies for the national defense, nor to rules and regulations for the government of those under arms [a constitutionally exclusive federal power]. It [was] simply a local police measure . . . .\"\n9\n\u00a0\n\nWhere, as in the instant case, Congress has not stated specifically whether a federal statute has occupied a field in which the States are otherwise free to legislate,\n10\n different \n\n[350 \nU.S. 497, 502]\n\u00a0\n criteria have furnished touchstones for decision. Thus,\n\n\"[t]his Court, in considering the validity of state laws in the light of . . . federal laws touching the same subject, has made use of the following expressions: conflicting; contrary to; occupying the field; repugnance; difference; irreconcilability; inconsistency; violation; curtailment; and interference. But none of these expressions provides an infallible constitutional test or an exclusive constitutional yardstick. In the final analysis, there can be no one crystal clear distinctly marked formula.\" Hines v. Davidowitz, \n312 \nU.S. 52, 67\n.\n\n\n And see Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., \n331 \nU.S. 218, 230\n-231. In this case, we think that each of several tests of supersession is met.\n\nFirst, \"[t]he scheme of federal regulation [is] so pervasive as to make reasonable the inference that Congress left no room for the States to supplement it.\" Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., \n331 \nU.S., at 230\n. The Congress determined in 1940 that it was necessary for it to re-enter the field of antisubversive legislation, which had been abandoned by it in 1921. In that year, it enacted the Smith Act which proscribes advocacy of the overthrow of any government - federal, state or local - by force and violence and organization of and knowing membership in a group which so advocates.\n11\n Conspiracy to commit any of these acts is punishable under the general criminal conspiracy provisions in 18 U.S.C. 371. The Internal Security Act of 1950 is aimed more directly at Communist organizations.\n12\n It distinguishes between \"Communist-action \n\n[350 \nU.S. 497, 503]\n\u00a0\n organizations\" and \"Communist-front organizations,\"\n13\n requiring such organizations to register and to file annual reports with the Attorney General giving complete details as to their officers and funds.\n14\n Members of Communist-action organizations who have not been registered by their organization must register as individuals.\n15\n Failure to register in accordance with the requirements of Sections 786-787 is punishable by a fine of not more than $10,000 for an offending organization and by a fine of not more than $10,000 or imprisonment for not more than five years or both for an individual offender - each day of failure to register constituting a separate offense.\n16\n And the Act imposes certain sanctions upon both \"action\" and \"front\" organizations and their members.\n17\n The Communist Control Act of 1954 declares \"that the Communist Party of the United States, although purportedly a political party, is in fact an instrumentality of a conspiracy to overthrow the Government of the United States\" and that \"its role as the agency of a hostile foreign power renders its existence a clear present and continuing danger to the security of the United States.\"\n18\n It also contains a legislative finding that the Communist Party is a \"Communist-action organization\" within the meaning of the Internal Security Act of 1950 and provides that \"knowing\" members of the Communist Party are \"subject to all the provisions and penalties\" of that Act.\n19\n It furthermore sets up a new classification of \"Communist-infiltrated organizations\"\n20\n\u00a0\n\n[350 \nU.S. 497, 504]\n\u00a0\n and provides for the imposition of sanctions against them.\n\nWe examine these Acts only to determine the congressional plan. Looking to all of them in the aggregate, the conclusion is inescapable that Congress has intended to occupy the field of sedition. Taken as a whole, they evince a congressional plan which makes it reasonable to determine that no room has been left for the States to supplement it. Therefore, a state sedition statute is superseded regardless of whether it purports to supplement the federal law. As was said by Mr. Justice Holmes in Charleston & Western Carolina R. Co. v. Varnville Furniture Co., \n237 \nU.S. 597, 604\n:\n\n \"When Congress has taken the particular subject-matter  in hand coincidence is as ineffective as opposition,  and a state law is not to be declared a help  because it attempts to go farther than Congress has  seen fit to go.\"\n\n\n Second, the federal statutes \"touch a field in which the federal interest is so dominant that the federal system [must] be assumed to preclude enforcement of state laws on the same subject.\" Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., \n331 \nU.S., at 230\n, citing Hines v. Davidowitz, supra.\n21\n Congress has devised an all-embracing program for resistance to the various forms of totalitarian aggression. Our external defenses have been strengthened, and a plan to \n\n[350 \nU.S. 497, 505]\n\u00a0\n protect against internal subversion has been made by it. It has appropriated vast sums, not only for our own protection, but also to strengthen freedom throughout the world. It has charged the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency with responsibility for intelligence concerning Communist seditious activities against our Government, and has denominated such activities as part of a world conspiracy. It accordingly proscribed sedition against all government in the nation - national, state and local. Congress declared that these steps were taken \"to provide for the common defense, to preserve the sovereignty of the United States as an independent nation, and to guarantee to each State a republican form of government . . . .\"\n22\n Congress having thus treated seditious conduct as a matter of vital national concern, it is in no sense a local enforcement problem. As was said in the court below:\n\n \"Sedition against the United States is not a local offense. It is a crime against the Nation. As such, it should be prosecuted and punished in the Federal courts where this defendant has in fact been prosecuted and convicted and is now under sentence.\n23\n It is not only important but vital that such prosecutions should be exclusively within the control of the Federal Government . . . .\"\n24\n\u00a0\n\n\n Third, enforcement of state sedition acts presents a serious danger of conflict with the administration of the federal program. Since 1939, in order to avoid a hampering of uniform enforcement of its program by sporadic local prosecutions, the Federal Government has urged \n\n[350 \nU.S. 497, 506]\n\u00a0\n local authorities not to intervene in such matters, but to turn over to the federal authorities immediately and unevaluated all information concerning subversive activities. The President made such a request on September 6, 1939, when he placed the Federal Bureau of Investigation in charge of investigation in this field:\n\n \"The Attorney General has been requested by me to instruct the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the Department of Justice to take charge of investigative work in matters relating to espionage, sabotage, and violations of the neutrality regulations.\n\n\n \"This task must be conducted in a comprehensive and effective manner on a national basis, and all information must be carefully sifted out and correlated in order to avoid confusion and irresponsibility.\n\n\n \"To this end I request all police officers, sheriffs, and all other law enforcement officers in the United States promptly to turn over to the nearest representative of the Federal Bureau of Investigation any information obtained by them relating to espionage, counterespionage, sabotage, subversive activities and violations of the neutrality laws.\"\n25\n\u00a0\n\n\n And in addressing the Federal-State Conference on Law Enforcement Problems of National Defense, held on August 5 and 6, 1940, only a few weeks after the passage of the Smith Act, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation said:\n\n \"The fact must not be overlooked that meeting the spy, the saboteur and the subverter is a problem that must be handled on a nation-wide basis. An isolated incident in the middle west may be of little significance, but when fitted into a national pattern \n\n[350 \nU.S. 497, 507]\n\u00a0\n of similar incidents, it may lead to an important revelation of subversive activity. It is for this reason that the President requested all of our citizens and law enforcing agencies to report directly to the Federal Bureau of Investigation any complaints or information dealing with espionage, sabotage or subversive activities. In such matters, time is of the essence. It is unfortunate that in a few States efforts have been made by individuals not fully acquainted with the far-flung ramifications of this problem to interject superstructures of agencies between local law enforcement and the FBI to sift what might be vital information, thus delaying its immediate reference to the FBI. This cannot be, if our internal security is to be best served. This is no time for red tape or amateur handling of such vital matters. There must be a direct and free flow of contact between the local law enforcement agencies and the FBI. The job of meeting the spy or saboteur is one for experienced men of law enforcement.\"\n26\n\u00a0\n\n\n Moreover, the Pennsylvania Statute presents a peculiar danger of interference with the federal program. For, as the court below observed:\n\n \"Unlike the Smith Act, which can be administered only by federal officers acting in their official capacities, indictment for sedition under the Pennsylvania statute can be initiated upon an information made by a private individual. The opportunity thus present for the indulgence of personal spite and hatred or for furthering some selfish advantage or ambition need only be mentioned to be appreciated. Defense of the Nation by law, no less than by arms, should be a public and not a private undertaking. It is \n\n[350 \nU.S. 497, 508]\n\u00a0\n important that punitive sanctions for sedition against the United States be such as have been promulgated by the central governmental authority and administered under the supervision and review of that authority's judiciary. If that be done, sedition will be detected and punished, no less, wherever it may be found, and the right of the individual to speak freely and without fear, even in criticism of the government, will at the same time be protected.\"\n27\n\u00a0\n\n\n In his brief, the Solicitor General states that forty-two States plus Alaska and Hawaii have statutes which in some form prohibit advocacy of the violent overthrow of established government. These statutes are entitled anti-sedition statutes, criminal anarchy laws, criminal syndicalist laws, etc. Although all of them are primarily directed against the overthrow of the United States Government, they are in no sense uniform. And our attention has not been called to any case where the prosecution has been successfully directed against an attempt to destroy state or local government. Some of these Acts are studiously drawn and purport to protect fundamental rights by appropriate definitions, standards of proof and orderly procedures in keeping with the avowed congressional purpose \"to protect freedom from those who would destroy it, without infringing upon the freedom of all our people.\" Others are vague and are almost wholly without such safeguards. Some even purport to punish mere membership in subversive organizations which the federal statutes do not punish where federal registration requirements have been fulfilled.\n28\n\u00a0\n\n[350 \nU.S. 497, 509]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWhen we were confronted with a like situation in the field of labor-management relations, Mr. Justice Jackson wrote:\n\n\"A multiplicity of tribunals and a diversity of procedures are quite as apt to produce incompatible or conflicting adjudications as are different rules of substantive law.\"\n29\n\u00a0\n\n\n Should the States be permitted to exercise a concurrent jurisdiction in this area, federal enforcement would encounter not only the difficulties mentioned by Mr. Justice Jackson, but the added conflict engendered by different criteria of substantive offenses.\n\nSince we find that Congress has occupied the field to the exclusion of parallel state legislation, that the dominant interest of the Federal Government precludes state intervention, and that administration of state Acts would conflict with the operation of the federal plan, we are convinced that the decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania is unassailable.\n\nWe are not unmindful of the risk of compounding punishments which would be created by finding concurrent state power. In our view of the case, we do not reach the question whether double or multiple punishment for the same overt acts directed against the United States has constitutional sanction.\n30\n Without compelling \n\n[350 \nU.S. 497, 510]\n\u00a0\n indication to the contrary, we will not assume that Congress intended to permit the possibility of double punishment. Cf. Houston v. Moore, 5 Wheat. 1, 31, 75; Jerome v.

Gilbert's remarks were made in a public meeting. They were resented by his auditors. There were protesting interruptions, also accusations and threats against him, disorder and intimations of violence. And such is not an uncommon experience. On such occasions feeling usually runs high and is impetuous; there is a prompting to violence and when violence is once yielded to, before it can be quelled, tragedies may be enacted. To preclude such result or a danger of it is a proper exercise of the power of the State.\" Id., at 331-332.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] Petitioner makes the subsidiary argument that 18 U.S.C. 3231 shows a congressional intention not to supersede state criminal statutes by any provision of Title 18. Section 3231 provides:\n\n\"The district courts of the United States shall have original jurisdiction, exclusive of the courts of the States, of all offenses against the laws of the United States.\n\n\n\"Nothing in this title shall be held to take away or impair the jurisdiction of the courts of the several States under the laws thereof.\"\n\n\n The office of the second sentence is merely to limit the effect of the jurisdictional grant of the first sentence.

JUSTICE BURTON and MR. JUSTICE MINTON join, dissenting.\n\nThe problems of governmental power may be approached in this case free from the varied viewpoints that focus on the problems of national security. This is a jurisdictional problem of general importance because it involves an asserted limitation on the police power of the States when it is applied to a crime that is punishable also by the Federal Government. As this is a recurring problem, it is appropriate to explain our dissent.\n\nCongress has not, in any of its statutes relating to sedition, specifically barred the exercise of state power to punish the same Acts under state law. And, we read the majority opinion to assume for this case that, absent federal legislation, there is no constitutional bar to punishment of sedition against the United States by both a State and the Nation.\n1\n The majority limits to the federal \n\n[350 \nU.S. 497, 513]\n\u00a0\n courts the power to try charges of sedition against the Federal Government.\n\nFirst, the Court relies upon the pervasiveness of the antisubversive legislation embodied in the Smith Act of 1940, 18 U.S.C. 2385, the Internal Security Act of 1950, 64 Stat. 987, and the Communist Control Act of 1954, 68 Stat. 775. It asserts that these Acts in the aggregate mean that Congress has occupied the \"field of sedition\" to the exclusion of the States. The \"occupation of the field\" argument has been developed by this Court for the Commerce Clause and legislation thereunder to prevent partitioning of this country by locally erected trade barriers. In those cases this Court has ruled that state legislation is superseded when it conflicts with the comprehensive regulatory scheme and purpose of a federal plan. Cloverleaf Butter Co. v. Patterson, \n315 \nU.S. 148\n. The two cases cited by the Court to support its argument that the broad treatment of any subject within the federal power bars supplemental action by States are of this nature. In our view neither case is apposite to the Smith Act. The Varnville case dealt with general regulation of interstate commerce making the originating carrier liable to the holder of its interstate bill of lading for damage caused by a common carrier of property. This Court held that the section through the federal commerce power superseded a state right of action against a nonoriginating carrier for damages and a penalty for injury occurring on another line. The pertinent section, 34 Stat. 595, 7, expressed a controlling federal policy for this commerce. The Rice case dealt with regulations of warehouses. We barred state action in that area because the Act declared that the authority it conferred \"shall be exclusive with respect to all persons securing a license\" under the Act. \n331 \nU.S., at 224\n and 233.\n\nBut the federal sedition laws are distinct criminal statutes that punish willful advocacy of the use of force \n\n[350 \nU.S. 497, 514]\n\u00a0\n against \"the government of the United States or the government of any State.\" These criminal laws proscribe certain local activity without creating any statutory or administrative regulation. There is, consequently, no question as to whether some general congressional regulatory scheme might be upset by a coinciding state plan.\n2\n In these circumstances the conflict should be clear and direct before this Court reads a congressional intent to void state legislation into the federal sedition acts.\n3\n Chief Justice Marshall wrote:\n\n  \"To interfere with the penal laws of a State, where  they . . . have for their sole object the internal  government of the country, is a very serious measure,  which Congress cannot be supposed to adopt lightly,  or inconsiderately. . . . It would be taken deliberately,  and the intention would be clearly and  unequivocally expressed.\" Cohens v. Virginia, 6  Wheat. 264, 443.\n\n\n Moreover, it is quite apparent that since 1940 Congress has been keenly aware of the magnitude of existing state legislation proscribing sedition. It may be validly assumed that in these circumstances this Court should not void state legislation without a clear mandate from Congress.\n4\n\u00a0\n\n[350 \nU.S. 497, 515]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe cannot agree that the federal criminal sanctions against sedition directed at the United States are of such a pervasive character as to indicate an intention to void state action.\n\nSecondly, the Court states that the federal sedition statutes touch a field \"in which the federal interest is so dominant\" they must preclude state laws on the same subject. This concept is suggested in a comment on Hines v. Davidowitz, \n312 \nU.S. 52\n, in the Rice case, at 230. The Court in Davidowitz ruled that federal statutes compelling alien registration preclude enforcement of state statutes requiring alien registration. We read Davidowitz to teach nothing more than that, when the Congress provided a single nation-wide integrated system of regulation so complete as that for aliens' registration (with fingerprinting, a scheduling of activities, and continuous information as to their residence), the Act bore so directly on our foreign relations as to make it evident that Congress intended only one uniform national alien registration system.\n5\n\u00a0\n\n[350 \nU.S. 497, 516]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe look upon the Smith Act as a provision for controlling incitements to overthrow by force and violence the Nation, or any State, or any political subdivision of either.\n6\n Such an exercise of federal police power carries, we think, no such dominancy over similar state powers as might be attributed to continuing federal regulations concerning foreign affairs or coinage, for example.\n7\n In the responsibility of national and local governments to protect themselves against sedition, there is no \"dominant interest.\" \n\n[350 \nU.S. 497, 517]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein we reside and are dependent upon the strength of both to preserve our rights and liberties. Both may enact criminal statutes for mutual protection unless Congress has otherwise provided. It was so held in Gilbert v. Minnesota, \n254 \nU.S. 325\n. In Gilbert the federal interest in raising armies did not keep this Court from permitting Minnesota to punish persons who interfered with enlistments (id., at 326), even though a comprehensive federal criminal law proscribed identical activity. 40 Stat. 553. We do not understand that case as does the majority. In our view this Court treated the Minnesota statute only alternatively as a police measure, p. 331. Minnesota made it unlawful to advocate \"that men should not enlist in the military or naval forces of the United States.\" It was contended, pp. 327-328, that the power to punish such advocacy was \"conferred upon Congress and withheld from the States.\" This Court ruled against the contention, saying:\n\n \"An army, of course, can only be raised and directed  by Congress, in neither has the State power, but it  has power to regulate the conduct of its citizens and  to restrain the exertion of baleful influences against  the promptings of patriotic duty to the detriment of  the welfare of the Nation and State. To do so is  not to usurp a National power, it is only to render  a service to its people, . . . .\" Id., at 330-331.\n8\n\u00a0\n\n[350 \nU.S. 497, 518]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n Thirdly, the Court finds ground for abrogating Pennsylvania's antisedition statute because, in the Court's view, the State's administration of the Act may hamper the enforcement of the federal law. Quotations are inserted from statements of President Roosevelt and Mr. Hoover, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, to support the Court's position. But a reading of the quotations leads us to conclude that their purpose was to gain prompt knowledge of evidence of subversive activities so that the federal agency could be fully advised. We find no suggestion from any official source that state officials should be less alert to ferret out or punish subversion. The Court's attitude as to interference seems to us quite contrary to that of the Legislative and Executive Departments. Congress was advised of the existing state sedition legislation when the Smith Act was enacted and has been kept current with its spread.\n9\n No declaration of exclusiveness followed. In this very case the Executive appears by brief of the Department of Justice, amicus curiae. The brief summarizes this point:\n\n  \"The administration of the various state laws has  not, in the course of the fifteen years that the federal  and state sedition laws have existed side by side, in  fact interfered with, embarrassed, or impeded the  enforcement of the Smith Act. The significance of  this absence of conflict in administration or enforcement \n\n[350 \nU.S. 497, 519]\n\u00a0\n  of the federal and state sedition laws will be  appreciated when it is realized that this period has  included the stress of wartime security requirements  and the federal investigation and prosecution under  the Smith Act of the principal national and regional  Communist leaders.\"\n10\n Id., at 30-31.\n\n\n Mere fear by courts of possible difficulties does not seem to us in these circumstances a valid reason for ousting a State from exercise of its police power. Those are matters for legislative determination.\n\nFinally, and this one point seems in and of itself decisive, there is an independent reason for reversing the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. The Smith Act appears in Title 18 of the United States Code, which Title codifies the federal criminal laws. Section 3231 of that Title provides:\n\n  \"Nothing in this title shall be held to take away  or impair the jurisdiction of the courts of the several  States under the laws thereof.\"\n\n\n That declaration springs from the federal character of our Nation. It recognizes the fact that maintenance of order and fairness rests primarily with the States. The section was first enacted in 1825 and has appeared successively in the federal criminal laws since that time.\n11\n This Court has interpreted the section to mean that States may provide concurrent legislation in the absence of explicit congressional intent to the contrary. Sexton v. California, \n189 \nU.S. 319, 324\n-325. The majority's position in this case \n\n[350 \nU.S. 497, 520]\n\u00a0\n cannot be reconciled with that clear authorization of Congress.\n\nThe law stands against any advocacy of violence to change established governments. Freedom of speech allows full play to the processes of reason. The state and national legislative bodies have legislated within constitutional limits so as to allow the widest participation by the law enforcement officers of the respective governments. The individual States were not told that they are powerless to punish local acts of sedition, nominally directed against the United States. Courts should not interfere. We would reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] No problem of double punishment exists in this case. See the Court's opinion, p. 499, and its last paragraph, p. 509. See United States v. Lanza, \n260 \nU.S. 377, 382\n; The Federalist, No. 32. Cf. Houston v.

Ohio, 5 How. 410, 432-435.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Forty-two States, along with Alaska and Hawaii, now have laws which penalize the advocacy of violent overthrow of the federal or state governments. Digest of the Public Record of Communism in the United States (Fund for the Republic, 1955) 266-306. In hearings before the House Judiciary Committee on the proposed Smith Act, both witnesses and members of the Committee made references to existing state sedition laws. Hearings before Subcommittee No. 3, Committee on the Judiciary, House of Representatives, on H. R. 5138, \n\n[350 \nU.S. 497, 515]\n\u00a0\n 76th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 7, 69, 83-85. Similar comment was heard in the congressional debates. 84 Cong. Rec. 10452. In fact, the Smith Act was patterned on the New York Criminal Anarchy Statute. Commonwealth v. Nelson, 377 Pa. 58, 86, 104 A. 2d 133, 147. The original text of the Smith Act is set out in the hearings before Subcommittee No. 3, supra, p. 1, and the New York Act may be read in Gitlow v. New York, \n268 \nU.S. 652, 654\n-655. Further evidence of congressional notice of state legislation may be found since the passage of the Smith Act. S. Rep. No. 1358, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., p. 9; H. R. Rep. No. 2980, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., p. 2; H. R. Rep. No. 1950, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 25-46 (Un-American Activities Committee). See 67 Harv. L. Rev. 1419, 1420; 40 Cornell L. Rev. 130, 133.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] In Allen-Bradley Local v. Board, \n315 \nU.S. 740, 749\n, we said:\n\n\"In the Hines case, a federal system of alien registration was held to supersede a state system of registration. But there we were dealing with a problem which had an impact on the general field of foreign relations. The delicacy of the issues which were posed alone raised grave questions as to the propriety of allowing a state system \n\n[350 \nU.S. 497, 516]\n\u00a0\n of regulation to function alongside of a federal system. In that field, any `concurrent state power that may exist is restricted to the narrowest of limits.' p. 68. Therefore, we were more ready to conclude that a federal Act in a field that touched international relations superseded state regulation than we were in those cases where a State was exercising its historic powers over such traditionally local matters as public safety and order and the use of streets and highways.\n\n\n The Davidowitz case is distinguishable on other grounds. Alien registration is not directly related to control of undesirable conduct; consequently there is no imperative problem of local law enforcement. 102 Pa. L. Rev., at 1091. There is also considerable legislative history behind the Alien Registration Act which suggests that Congress was trying to avoid overburdening of aliens; some features of the conflicting state law had been expressly rejected by Congress. \n312 \nU.S., at 71\n-73. See 39 Minn. L. Rev. 213. It should be noted also that the coincidence between the state and federal laws in the Davidowitz case was so great that no real purpose was served by the state law. 34 Boston U. L. Rev. 514, 517-518.\n\nStates are barred by the Constitution from entering into treaties and by 18 U.S.C. 953 from correspondence or intercourse with foreign governments with relation to their disputes or controversies with this Nation.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Such efforts may be punishable crimes. Dennis v. United States, \n341 \nU.S. 494, 508\n-510.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] It seems quite reasonable to believe \"that the exclusion principle is to be more strictly applied when the Congress acts in a field wherein the constitutional grant of power to the federal government is exclusive, as in its right to protect interstate commerce and to control international relations.\" Albertson v. Millard, 106 F. Supp. 635, 641.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Mr. Justice Brandeis, dissenting, emphasized the ruling here applicable thus:\n\n\"Congress has the exclusive power to legislate concerning the Army and the Navy of the United States, and to determine, among other things, the conditions of enlistment. . . .\n\n\n\". . . The States act only under the express direction of Congress. . . .\n\n\n\". . . As exclusive power over enlistments in the Army and the Navy of the United States and the responsibility for the conduct of war is vested by the Federal Constitution in Congress, legislation by \n\n[350 \nU.S. 497, 518]\n\u00a0\n a State on this subject is necessarily void unless authorized by Congress. . . .

After this motion was denied, respondent filed its answer to the complaint in which it again pressed its claim that the District Court lacked personal jurisdiction over it. Subsequently, however, respondent filed (1) a motion to amend its answer and to interplead; (2) a counterclaim; (3) a stipulation and order adding a party-plaintiff and amending the complaint and answer; and (4) a stipulation that judgment be entered against the alleged insured in favor of the additional party-plaintiff. The latter \n\n[350 \nU.S. 495, 496]\n\u00a0\n stipulation included the following provision, together with others consistent with it and confirmatory of its purpose:\n\n  \"1. That each of the parties to this stipulation  voluntarily submits to the jurisdiction of the above  entitled Court without service of process herein, the  same as if personal service had been obtained by each  against the other.\"\n\n\n Following a trial on the merits, judgment was entered against respondent, but the Court of Appeals, with one judge dissenting, reversed on the ground that respondent's motion to quash should have been granted. 226 F.2d 126.\n\nUpon examination of the record and the law, we conclude that the District Court had jurisdiction of the subject matter and that respondent, by its stipulation, waived any right to assert a lack of personal jurisdiction over it. We, therefore, reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case to it for further proceedings.\n\n   Reversed and remanded. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 495, 497]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","68":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPUTNAM v.

He wound up the corporation's affairs and liquidated its assets but did not terminate its corporate existence. Its assets were insufficient to pay its debts, and petitioner paid $9,005 of its debts in discharge of his obligation as guarantor. Held: In computing petitioner's income tax, this $9,005 loss was nonbusiness bad debt loss to be given short-term capital loss treatment under 23 (k) (4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939; and it was not fully deductible under 23 (e) (2) as a loss \"incurred in [a] transaction . . . for profit, though not connected with [his] trade or business.\" Pp. 83-93.\n\n 1. The loss sustained by a guarantor unable to recover from the debtor is by its very nature a loss from a bad debt to which the guarantor becomes subrogated upon discharging his liability as guarantor.

With him on the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Rice, Harry Baum and Joseph F. Goetten.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe petitioner, Max Putnam, in December 1948, paid $9,005.21 to a Des Moines, Iowa, bank in discharge of his obligation as guarantor of the notes of Whitehouse Publishing Company. That corporation still had a corporate existence at the time of the payment but had ceased doing business and had disposed of its assets eighteen months earlier. The question for decision is whether, in the joint income tax return filed by Putnam and his wife for 1948, Putnam's loss is fully deductible as a loss \"incurred in [a] transaction . . . for profit, though not connected with [his] trade or business\" within the meaning of 23 (e) (2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939,\n1\n or whether it is a nonbusiness bad debt within the \n\n[352 \nU.S. 82, 84]\n\u00a0\n meaning of 23 (k) (4) of the Code,\n2\n and therefore deductible only as a short-term capital loss.\n\nThe Commissioner determined that the loss was a nonbusiness bad debt to be given short-term capital loss treatment. The Tax Court\n3\n and the Court of Appeals\n4\n for the Eighth Circuit sustained his determination. Because of an alleged conflict with decisions of the Courts of Appeals of other circuits,\n5\n we granted certiorari.\n6\n\u00a0\n\nPutnam is a Des Moines lawyer who in 1945, in a venture not connected with his law practice,\n7\n organized Whitehouse Publishing Company with two others, a newspaperman and a labor leader, to publish a labor newspaper. Each incorporator received one-third of the issued capital stock, but Putnam supplied the property and cash with which the company started business. He also financed its operations, for the short time it was in business, through advances and guarantees of payment of salaries and debts. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 82, 85]\n\u00a0\n Just before the venture was abandoned, Putnam acquired the shares held by his fellow stockholders and in July 1947, as sole stockholder, wound up its affairs and liquidated its assets. The proceeds of sale were insufficient to pay the full amount due to the Des Moines bank on two notes given by the corporation and guaranteed by Putnam for moneys borrowed in August 1946 and March 1947.\n\nThe familiar rule is that, instanter upon the payment by the guarantor of the debt, the debtor's obligation to the creditor becomes an obligation to the guarantor, not a new debt, but, by subrogation, the result of the shift of the original debt from the creditor to the guarantor who steps into the creditor's shoes.\n8\n Thus, the loss sustained by the guarantor unable to recover from the debtor is by its very nature a loss from the worthlessness of a debt. This has been consistently recognized in the administrative and the judicial construction of the Internal Revenue laws\n9\n which, until the decisions of the \n\n[352 \nU.S. 82, 86]\n\u00a0\n Courts of Appeals in conflict with the decision below, have always treated guarantors' losses as bad debt losses.\n10\n The Congress recently confirmed this treatment in the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 by providing that a payment by a noncorporate taxpayer in discharge of his obligation as guarantor of certain noncorporate obligations \"shall be treated as a debt.\"\n11\n\u00a0\n\n[352 \nU.S. 82, 87]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThere is, then, no justification or basis for consideration of Putnam's loss under the general loss provisions of 23 (e) (2), i. e., as an ordinary nonbusiness loss sustained in a transaction entered into for profit. Congress has legislated specially in the matter of deductions of nonbusiness bad debt losses, i. e., such a loss is deductible only as a short-term capital loss by virtue of the special limitation provisions contained in 23 (k) (4). The decision of this Court in Spring City Co. v. Commissioner, \n292 \nU.S. 182\n, is apposite and controlling. There it was held that a debt excluded from deduction under 234 (a) (5) of the Revenue Act of 1918 was not to be regarded as a loss deductible under 234 (a) (4). Chief Justice Hughes said for the Court:\n\n \"Petitioner also claims the right of deduction under  234 (a) (4) of the Act of 1918 providing for the deduction of `Losses sustained during the taxable year and not compensated for by insurance or otherwise.' We agree with the decision below that this subdivision and the following subdivision (5) relating to debts are mutually exclusive. We so assumed, without deciding the point, in Lewellyn v. Electric Reduction Co., \n275 \nU.S. 243, 246\n. The making of the specific provision as to debts indicates that these were to be considered as a special class and that losses on debts were not to be regarded as falling under the preceding general provision. What was excluded from deduction under subdivision (5) cannot be regarded as allowed under subdivision (4). If subdivision (4) could be considered as ambiguous in this respect, the administrative construction which has been followed from the enactment of the statute - that subdivision (4) did not refer to debts - would be entitled to great weight. We see no reason for disturbing that construction.\" \n292 \nU.S., at 189\n. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 82, 88]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n Here also the statutory scheme is to be understood as meaning that a loss attributable to the worthlessness of a debt shall be regarded as a bad debt loss, deductible as such or not at all.\n\nThe decisions of the Courts of Appeals in conflict with the decision below turn upon erroneous premises.\n12\n It is said that the guarantor taxpayer who involuntarily acquires a worthless debt is in a position no different from the taxpayer who voluntarily acquires a debt known by him to be worthless. The latter is treated as having acquired no valid debt at all.\n13\n The situations are not analogous or comparable. The taxpayer who voluntarily buys a debt with knowledge that he will not be paid is rightly considered not to have acquired a debt but to have made a gratuity. In contrast the guarantor pays the creditor in compliance with the obligation raised by the law from his contract of guaranty. His loss arises not because he is making a gift to the debtor but because the latter is unable to reimburse him.\n\nNext it is assumed, at least in the Allen case, that a new obligation arises in favor of the guarantor upon his payment to the creditor. From that premise it is argued that such a debt cannot \"become\" worthless but is worthless from its origin, and so outside the scope of 23 (k). This misconceives the basis of the doctrine of subrogation, apart from the fact that, if it were true that the debt did not \"become\" worthless, the debt nevertheless would not be regarded as an ordinary loss under 23 (e). Spring City Co. v. Commissioner, supra. Under the doctrine of subrogation, payment by the guarantor, as we have seen, is treated not as creating a new debt and extinguishing the original debt, but as preserving the original debt and \n\n[352 \nU.S. 82, 89]\n\u00a0\n merely substituting the guarantor for the creditor. The reality of the situation is that the debt is an asset of full value in the creditor's hands because backed by the guaranty. The debtor is usually not able to reimburse the guarantor and in such cases that value is lost at the instant that the guarantor pays the creditor. But that this instant is also the instant when the guarantor acquires the debt cannot obscure the fact that the debt \"becomes\" worthless in his hands.\n\nFinally, the Courts of Appeals found support for their view in the following language taken from the opinion of this Court in Eckert v. Burnet, \n283 \nU.S. 140\n:\n\n \"The petitioner claims the right to deduct half that sum as a debt `ascertained to be worthless and charged off within the taxable year,' under the Revenue Act of 1926, c. 27, 214 (a) (7); 44 Stat. 9, 27.\n\n\n \"It seems to us that the Circuit Court of Appeals sufficiently answered this contention by remarking that the debt was worthless when acquired. There was nothing to charge off. The petitioner treats the case as one of an investment that later turns out to be bad. But in fact it was the satisfaction of an existing obligation of the petitioner, having, it may be, the consequence of a momentary transfer of the old notes to the petitioner in order that they might be destroyed. It is very plain we think that the words of the statute cannot be taken to include a case of that kind.\" \n283 \nU.S., at 141\n. (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n That statement did not imply a determination by this Court that the guarantor's loss was not to be treated as a bad debt.\n14\n This Court was not faced with the question \n\n[352 \nU.S. 82, 90]\n\u00a0\n in Eckert. The point decided by the case was that a guarantor reporting on a cash basis and discharging his guaranty, not by a cash payment, but by giving the creditor his promissory note payable in a subsequent year, was not entitled to a bad debt loss deduction in the year in which he gave the note. The true significance of the quoted language is that, although \"the debt was worthless when acquired,\" it could not be \"charged off\" within the taxable year as the promissory note given for its payment was not paid or payable within that year.\n15\n\u00a0\n\nThe objectives sought to be achieved by the Congress in providing short-term capital loss treatment for nonbusiness bad debts are also persuasive that 23 (k) (4) applies to a guarantor's nonbusiness debt losses. The \n\n[352 \nU.S. 82, 91]\n\u00a0\n section was part of the comprehensive tax program enacted by the Revenue Act of 1942 to increase the national revenue to further the prosecution of the great war in which we were then engaged.\n16\n It was also a means for minimizing the revenue losses attributable to the fraudulent practices of taxpayers who made to relatives and friends gifts disguised as loans.\n17\n Equally, however, the \n\n[352 \nU.S. 82, 92]\n\u00a0\n plan was suited to put nonbusiness investments in the form of loans on a footing with other nonbusiness investments. The proposal originated with the Treasury Department, whose spokesman championed it as a means \"to insure a fairer reflection of taxable income,\"\n18\n and the House Ways and Means Committee Report stated that the objective was \"to remove existing inequities and to improve the procedure through which bad-debt deductions are taken.\"\n19\n We may consider Putnam's case in the light of these revealed purposes. His venture into the publishing field was an investment apart from his law practice. The loss he sustained when his stock became worthless, as well as the losses from the worthlessness of the loans he made directly to the corporation, would receive capital loss treatment; the 1939 Code so provides as to nonbusiness losses both from worthless stock investments and from loans to a corporation, whether or not the loans are evidenced by a security.\n20\n It is clearly a \"fairer reflection\" of Putnam's 1948 taxable income to treat the instant loss similarly. There is no real or economic difference between the loss of an investment made in the form of a direct loan \n\n[352 \nU.S. 82, 93]\n\u00a0\n to a corporation and one made indirectly in the form of a guaranteed bank loan. The tax consequences should in all reason be the same, and are accomplished by 23 (k) (4).\n21\n The judgment is\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"SEC. 23.

Commissioner, 120 F.2d 159; American Cigar Co. v. Commissioner, 66 F.2d 425.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] The basis for this statement came from the opinion of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and was explained by that court in its later opinion in Shiman v. Commissioner, 60 F.2d 65, 67, as follows: \n\n[352 \nU.S. 82, 90]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\"Though there was no debt until Shiman paid the brokers, it then became such at once and was known to be worthless as soon as it arose; verbally at any rate there is no difficulty. Nor is there any reason to impute a purpose to except such cases; the loss is as real and unavoidable as though the debt had had some value for a season. The analogy of section 204 (b) is apt. We can see no ground therefore for question except some of the language used in Eckert v. Burnet, \n283 \nU.S. 140, 51\n S. Ct. 373, 75 L. Ed. 911, taken from our opinion in 42 F. (2d) 158. That was quite another situation. Eckert, the taxpayer, had been an accommodation endorser for a corporation which became insolvent. When called upon to pay he gave his note instead, not payable within the year. The court refused to allow the deduction, because Eckert was keeping his books on a cash basis, but it intimated that when he paid he might succeed; until then he had done no more than change the form of the obligation. Yet if it were enough to defeat him that the debt was `worthless when acquired,' the same objection ought to be good after he had paid; contrary to what was suggested. We cannot therefore think that the language so thrown out was intended as an authoritative statement by which we must be bound.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] See Helvering v. Price, \n309 \nU.S. 409\n. The requirement that the debt be \"ascertained to be worthless and charged off within the taxable year\" was superseded in the Revenue Act of 1942, 124 (a), by the requirement that the debt be one which \"becomes worthless within the taxable year.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] Chairman Doughton of the House Committee on Ways and Means opened the hearings on the bill which became the Revenue Act of 1942 with the statement: \". . . the meeting of the committee this morning is the first step in the consideration, preparation, and reporting of perhaps the largest tax bill that it has ever been the duty and responsibility of our committee to report.\n\n\"We are faced with revenue needs and a tax program of a magnitude unthought of in modern times, and we all realize it is necessary to raise every dollar of additional revenue that can be raised without seriously disturbing or shattering our national economy.\" Hearings before House Committee on Ways and Means on Revenue Revision of 1942, 77th Cong., 2d Sess. 1.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] Petitioners argue that this was its sole purpose and that the section should be construed as limited in application to such loans. The context of the segment of the House Ways and Means Committee Report discussing this objective does not support the petitioners' argument. H. R. Rep. No. 2333, 77th Cong., 2d Sess. 45:\n\n\"C. NONBUSINESS BAD DEBTS\n\n\n\"The present law gives the same tax treatment to bad debts incurred in nonbusiness transactions as it allows to business bad debts. An example of a nonbusiness bad debt would be an unrepaid loan to a friend or relative, while business bad debts arise in the course of the taxpayer's trade or business. This liberal allowance for nonbusiness bad debts has suffered considerable abuse through taxpayers making loans which they do not expect to be repaid. This practice is particularly prevalent in the case of loans to persons with respect to whom the taxpayer is not entitled to a credit for dependents. This situation has presented serious administrative difficulties because of the requirement of proof.\n\n\n\"The bill treats the loss from nonbusiness bad debts as a short-term capital loss. The effect of this provision is to take the loss fully into account, but to allow it to be used only to reduce capital gains. Like any other capital loss, however, the amount of such bad \n\n[352 \nU.S. 82, 92]\n\u00a0\n debt losses may be taken to the extent of $1,000 against ordinary income and the 5-year carry-over provision applies.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] Hearings before House Committee on Ways and Means on Revenue Revision of 1942, 77th Cong., 2d Sess. 90.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 19\n] H.

As Judge Stewart pointed out in his dissenting opinion in the Cudlip case, 220 F.2d, at 572:\n\n\"Had the petitioner made the necessary additional investment in the conventional form of subscribing for stock, his loss upon the failure of the corporation would have been a capital loss, 23 (g) (2), I. R. C. Had he made the investment in the form of a loan to the corporation evidenced by an instrument bearing interest coupons, his loss would likewise have been a capital loss, 23 (k) (2), I. R. C. Had he made the additional investment in the form of an ordinary \n\n[352 \nU.S. 82, 93]\n\u00a0\n loan to the corporation, his loss would likewise have been a capital loss, 23 (k) (4) I. R. C., Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Smith, supra.\n\n\n\"Because the petitioner happened instead to risk his money by guaranteeing the corporation's bank loans, the court now holds that the petitioner may take an ordinary loss, deductible in full from his ordinary income. Yet from the petitioner's viewpoint, the situation would have been precisely the same had he himself borrowed the money and then lent it to the corporation. It therefore seems to me that the result reached by the court in this case is significantly unrealistic.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 21\n] Upon this ground, contrary to the holding in Fox v. Commissioner, 190 F.2d 101, the guarantor's nonbusiness loss would receive short-term capital loss treatment despite the nonexistence of the debtor at the time of the guarantor's payment to the creditor.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, dissenting.\n\nBeing unreconciled to the Court's decision, which settles a conflict on this tax question among the Courts of Appeals and thus has an impact beyond the confines of this particular case, I must regretfully dissent.\n\nThe Court's approval of the Commissioner's treatment of petitioner's loss as one arising from a \"nonbusiness debt,\" within the meaning of 23 (k) (4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939,\n1\n instead of as a loss incurred in a \n\n[352 \nU.S. 82, 94]\n\u00a0\n \"transaction entered into for profit,\" under 23 (e) (2),\n2\n rests on what is, in my opinion, a strained application of the equitable doctrine of subrogation. No one contends that petitioner acquired the Company's debt to the lending Bank when he entered into the agreement guaranteeing payment of that indebtedness. Rather, the Government's basic argument, as taken from its brief, is this:\n\n \"The principle is well established, both generally and in the State of Iowa [where the guaranty was executed and performed], that a guarantor who is required to make payment under his guaranty contract succeeds to the rights of the creditor by subrogation. The law implies a promise on the part of the principal debtor to reimburse the guarantor, and the guarantor's payment is treated not as extinguishing the debt but as merely substituting the guarantor for the creditor. . . . Accordingly, while a guarantor by entering into the guaranty contract and making payment thereunder puts himself in a position where he may sustain a loss, it is only if, and to the extent that, the debt which he acquires by subrogation is worthless that he actually sustains a loss. Thus, if the guarantor, having made payment under his guaranty contract, is able to recover in full from the principal debtor, he clearly suffers no loss at all. It follows, therefore, that any loss, the existence and extent of which is wholly and directly dependent \n\n[352 \nU.S. 82, 95]\n\u00a0\n upon the worthlessness of a debt, should be attributed to the worthlessness of that debt, i. e., should be considered a bad debt loss.\"\n\n\n The Government then adds this footnote: \"So long as payment of a debt is guaranteed by a solvent guarantor, the insolvency of the principal debtor obviously does not render the debt worthless. Consequently, if the debt which a guarantor acquires by subrogation becomes worthless, it necessarily becomes worthless in the hands of the guarantor rather than in the hands of the original creditor.\"\n\nUpon analysis, the Government's argument comes down to this: when the petitioner honored his guaranty obligation his payment was offset by the acquisition of the creditor Bank's rights against the Company on its indebtedness; in the Bank's hands those rights were worth full value, since the Company's indebtedness was secured by the guaranty; therefore petitioner's loss should be attributed to the subrogation debt, which became worthless in his hands because no longer so secured.\n\nThis argument would have substance in a case where the principal debtor was not insolvent at the time the guaranty was fulfilled; for in such a case it could be said that the acquired debt was not without value in the guarantor's hands, and hence he should not be allowed a tax deduction until the debt turns out to be worthless. But when, as here, the debtor is insolvent at the very time the guarantor meets his obligation, it defies reality to attribute the guarantor's loss to anything other than the discharge of his guaranty obligation. To attribute that loss to the acquired debt in such a case requires one to conceive of the debt as having value at the moment of acquisition, but as withering to worthlessness the moment the guarantor touches it. That the same debt in the same millisecond can have both of these antagonistic \n\n[352 \nU.S. 82, 96]\n\u00a0\n characteristics is, for me, too esoteric a concept to carry legal consequences, even in the field of taxation.\n\nIt was this departure from reality which first led the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to reject the Commissioner's theory, as applied to a loss incurred by a widow upon a guaranty of her husband's brokerage account which she was called upon to honor long after his death and the winding up of his insolvent estate. Fox v. Commissioner, 190 F.2d 101. In that case the court, after referring to the \"illusory character\" of the subrogation claim which, the Tax Court held, she had acquired against her late husband upon her payment of the guaranty, went on to say, at pp. 103-104:\n\n\"She [the widow] argues that the court's theory of a debt against her husband's estate amounts to a subrogation forced upon her, contrary to the equitable spirit of the doctrine, to yield her an utterly worthless claim and a very real tax liability. . . . [W]e think her argument persuasive. . . . Clearly . . . the [guaranty] transaction was not then one involving a bad debt, since she had not even made the payment which alone would give rise to a claim in her favor. Nor could payment ten years later create a debt out of something less than even the proverbial stone. It is utterly unrealistic to consider the payment as one made in any expectation of recovery over of any legal claim for collection. Actually it was merely the fulfillment of her contractual obligation of the earlier date. The bad-debt provision thus had no direct application; only by straining the statutory language can we erect here a disembodied debt against an insolvent and long dead debtor.\"\n\n\n Being unable to differentiate the worthlessness of a subrogation debt claim against a nonexistent individual \n\n[352 \nU.S. 82, 97]\n\u00a0\n debtor from such a claim against an existent, but insolvent, corporate debtor, the Courts of Appeals, until the present case,\n3\n have consistently applied the reasoning of the Fox case to losses incurred on individual guaranties of corporate indebtedness where the corporation, though still in existence, was insolvent at the time the guaranty was honored. Pollak v. Commissioner, 209 F.2d 57;\n4\n Edwards v. Allen, 216 F.2d 794;\n5\n Cudlip v. Commissioner, 220 F.2d 565;\n6\n see also Ansley v. Commissioner, 217 F.2d 252.\n7\n The rationale of these four Courts of Appeals is, in my opinion, more convincing than that of the Commissioner, and I think this Court should have approved and followed it here by holding that this taxpayer's loss was fully deductible under 23 (e) (2) as a loss on a \"transaction entered into for profit,\" instead of regarding it as a \"nonbusiness debt\" loss, subject to capital loss treatment under 23 (k) (4).\n\nI cannot agree with the Court that either the circumstances under which 23 (k) (4) was enacted in 1942, or the provisions of 166 (f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954,\n8\n point to an opposite conclusion. Section 23 (k) (4) created a new category of debt losses, namely, \n\n[352 \nU.S. 82, 98]\n\u00a0\n \"nonbusiness debt\" losses, which were thenceforth to be given capital loss treatment instead of the full loss deduction theretofore accorded them.\n9\n The Court finds the \"objectives sought to be achieved by the Congress,\" through the enactment of this section, \"persuasive that 23 (k) (4) applies to a guarantor's nonbusiness debt losses,\" in that the \"section was part of the comprehensive tax program enacted by the Revenue Act of 1942 to increase the national revenue,\" in connection with World War II, and \"was suited to put nonbusiness investments in the form of loans on a footing with other nonbusiness investments.\" But it seems to me that the House Ways and Means Committee Report on the bill shows that 23 (k) (4) was aimed at a specific narrow objective, namely, that of reducing revenue loss from the deduction of \"family\" or \"friendly\" loans which were in reality gifts. The Report states:\n\n \"C. Nonbusiness Bad Debts.\n\n\n \"The present law gives the same tax treatment to bad debts incurred in nonbusiness transactions as it allows to business bad debts. An example of a nonbusiness bad debt would be an unrepaid loan to a friend or relative, while business bad debts arise in the course of the taxpayer's trade or business. This liberal allowance for nonbusiness bad debts has suffered considerable abuse through taxpayers making loans which they do not expect to be repaid. This practice is particularly prevalent in the case of loans to persons with respect to whom the taxpayer is not entitled to a credit for dependents. This situation has presented serious administrative difficulties because of the requirement of proof. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 82, 99]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n \"The bill treats the loss from nonbusiness bad debts as a short-term capital loss. The effect of this provision is to take the loss fully into account, but to allow it to be used only to reduce capital gains. Like any other capital loss, however, the amount of such bad debt losses may be taken to the extent of $1,000 against ordinary income and the 5-year carryover provision applies.\"\n10\n\u00a0\n\n\n I am unable to find in this, or in any of the other legislative history to which the Court refers, any clear intimation of a broad policy to analogize generally all types of nonbusiness loans to other forms of capital investment,\n11\n still less anything which indicates that guarantors' losses were considered as falling within the new section.\n12\n\u00a0\n\nLikewise I think that the Court's reliance on 166 (f) of the 1954 Code is misplaced. That section provides that an individual taxpayer's guaranty payment discharging the obligation of a noncorporate debtor \"shall be treated as a debt becoming worthless within such taxable year,\" and shall be deductible in full if (a) the proceeds of the guaranteed obligation were used \"in the trade or business of the borrower,\" and (b) that obligation was worthless at the time the guarantor made payment.\n13\n The Court says that by enacting this section Congress confirmed the administrative practice of treating guarantors' losses as \n\n[352 \nU.S. 82, 100]\n\u00a0\n bad debt losses, at least so far as guaranties of certain noncorporate obligations are concerned. I cannot agree, for again I think this section had a specific and limited purpose, which did not include the thrust which the Court now gives the section. That purpose, I think, was simply to permit deduction of certain guaranty payments that were not deductible at all under the 1939 Code. Payments now deductible under 166 (f) need not be made in the course of the guarantor's \"trade or business,\" nor need they be attributable to a transaction \"entered into for profit.\" They are deductible, it would seem, so long as the guarantor had some expectation of being repaid - so long, in other words, as the transaction was not a gift. Under prior law, such payments would not have been deductible as \"business\" debts, under 23 (k) (1),\n14\n or as losses on transactions \"entered into for profit,\" under 23 (e) (2), or even as \"nonbusiness\" debts under 23 (k) (4), since the Fox line of cases held that such payments do not give rise to \"debts.\" However, here again, as with the enactment of the 23 (k) (4) \"nonbusiness debt\" provision in 1942, Congress was concerned with fending against allowance of this type of deduction in cases of fictitious \"family\" or \"friendly\" guaranties. Hence it was unwilling to allow the deduction to all guarantors of individual borrowings. Considering guaranties of loans sought for business purposes to be free of such infirmities, Congress attempted to obviate abuse of 166 (f) by limiting its \n\n[352 \nU.S. 82, 101]\n\u00a0\n application to guaranties of loans the proceeds of which \"were used in the trade or business of the borrower.\"\n\nIn light of what seems to have been the particular congressional purpose, I think it strains 166 (f) to read it as broadly confirming the treatment of guaranty losses as bad debt losses.\n15\n Congress presumably knew of the Fox line of cases, supra, which had refused \"debt\" treatment to guarantors' losses, and it is not without significance that the Senate Report on 166 (f) stated: \"If the requirements of this section are not met, the taxpayer will, as under present law, be treated taxwise under whatever provisions of the code are applicable in the factual situation.\"\n16\n It is true that 166 (f) provides that any payment included therein \"shall be treated as a debt\"; but of more significance is the fact that the person claiming the deduction need not show that he in fact owned a \"debt\" or that such debt had \"become worthless during the taxable year\" - the requirement for deductibility of both business and nonbusiness bad debts under 23 (k) (1) and (4) - since \"for purposes of this section\" ( 166 (f)) the guarantor's loss is \"treated as\" a debt \"becoming worthless within such taxable year\" as the loss occurs. In other words, though assimilated to a \"debt\" loss, the loss arising from the guaranty payment in fact need have none of the attributes of a debt loss in order to be deductible. The primary thrust of \n\n[352 \nU.S. 82, 102]\n\u00a0\n 166 (f) was to make deductible some kinds of losses which were theretofore not deductible, and I think that drawing from the language of the Section a definitive characterization of such losses as \"debts\" involves a misplacing of emphasis.\n\nOf still greater significance is the fact that 166 (f) losses are deductible in full. This, it seems to me, is more consistent with the view that Congress did not intend to disturb the line of cases which, following Fox, gave a full deduction under 23 (e) (2) to losses on guaranties of corporate obligations, than it is with the Court's view that 166 (f) confirms Congress' intent that such losses should be only partially deductible as nonbusiness bad debts under 23 (k) (4). Otherwise we would have the anomalous result that under the 1954 Code individual guarantors of noncorporate obligations are given better treatment than those guaranteeing corporate obligations, even though the basic limitation which Congress imposed upon the deductibility of 166 (f) losses, namely, that the proceeds of the guaranteed obligation \"were used in the trade or business of the borrower,\" is always present in the case of a guaranty of a corporate obligation.\n\nIn short, I think that when the purposes and provisions of 166 (f) are taken together, it is quite evident that the section was intended to complement the decisions of these four Courts of Appeals,\n17\n and not to override them.\n\nFinally, the Government suggests that giving guarantors' losses the same capital loss treatment as nonbusiness debt losses would make for a better tax structure, since, it is argued, both kinds of losses are comparable to losses from investments, which receive capital loss treatment under both the 1939 and 1954 Codes.\n18\n Even if that be so, this would be a matter for Congress. Our duty is to take the statute as we find it. I would reverse.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"[ 23 (k)] (4) NON-BUSINESS DEBTS.\n\n\"In the case of a taxpayer, other than a corporation, if a nonbusiness debt becomes worthless within the taxable year, the loss resulting therefrom shall be considered a loss from the sale or exchange, during the taxable year, of a capital asset held for not more than 6 months.

JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis is a suit brought in the Nebraska courts by employees of the Union Pacific Railroad Co. against that company and labor organizations representing various groups of employees of the railroad to enjoin the application and enforcement of a union shop agreement entered into between the railroad company and the labor organizations. Plaintiffs are not members of any of the defendant labor organizations and desire not to join. Under the terms of the union shop agreement all employees of the railroad, as a condition of their continued employment, must become members of the specified union within 60 days and thereafter maintain that membership. It is alleged that failure on their part to join the union will mean the loss of their employment together with seniority, retirement, pension, and other rights. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 225, 228]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe employees claim that the union shop agreement violates the \"right to work\" provision of the Nebraska Constitution (Art. XV, 13), which provides:\n1\n\u00a0\n\n\"No person shall be denied employment because of membership in or affiliation with, or resignation or expulsion from a labor organization or because of refusal to join or affiliate with a labor organization; nor shall any individual or corporation or association of any kind enter into any contract, written or oral, to exclude persons from employment because of membership in or nonmembership in a labor organization.\"\n\n\n They ask for an injunction restraining the railroad company from enforcing and applying the union shop agreement.\n\nThe answers deny that the Nebraska Constitution and laws control and allege that the union shop agreement is authorized by 2, Eleventh of the Railway Labor Act, as amended, 64 Stat. 1238, 45 U.S.C. 152, Eleventh, which provides that, notwithstanding the law of \"any State,\" a carrier and a labor organization may make an agreement requiring all employees within a stated time to become members of the labor organization, provided there is no discrimination against any employee and provided \n\n[351 \nU.S. 225, 229]\n\u00a0\n that membership is not denied nor terminated \"for any reason other than the failure of the employee to tender the periodic dues, initiation fees, and assessments (not including fines and penalties) uniformly required as a condition of acquiring or retaining membership.\"\n2\n\u00a0\n\n[351 \nU.S. 225, 230]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Nebraska trial court issued an injunction. The Supreme Court of Nebraska affirmed. It held that the union shop agreement violates the First Amendment in that it deprives the employees of their freedom of association and violates the Fifth Amendment in that it requires the members to pay for many things besides the cost of collective bargaining. The Nebraska Supreme Court, therefore, held that there is no valid federal law to supersede the \"right to work\" provision of the Nebraska Constitution. 160 Neb. 669, 71 N. W. 2d 526. The case is here by appeal. 28 U.S.C. 1257 (1) and (2). We noted probable jurisdiction. \n350 \nU.S. 910\n. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 225, 231]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe union shop\n3\n provision of the Railway Labor Act was written into the law in 1951. Prior to that date the Railway Labor Act prohibited union shop agreements. 48 Stat. 1186, 45 U.S.C. 152, Fourth and Fifth; 40 Op. Atty. Gen. 254. Those provisions were enacted in 1934 when the union shop was being used by employers to establish and maintain company unions, \"thus effectively depriving a substantial number of employees of their right to bargain collectively.\" S. Rep. No. 2262, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., p. 3. By 1950, company unions in this field had practically disappeared. Id. Between 75 and 80% of railroad employees were members of labor organizations. H. R. Rep. No. 2811, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., p. 4. While nonunion members got the benefits of the collective bargaining of the unions, they bore \"no share of the cost of obtaining such benefits.\" Id., at 4. As Senator Hill, who managed the bill on the floor of the Senate, said, \"The question in this instance is whether those who enjoy the fruits and the benefits of the unions should make a fair contribution to the support of the unions.\" 96 Cong. Rec., Pt. 12, p. 16279.\n\nThe union shop provision of the Railway Labor Act is only permissive. Congress has not compelled nor required carriers and employees to enter into union shop agreements. The Supreme Court of Nebraska nevertheless took the view that justiciable questions under the First and Fifth Amendments were presented since Congress, by the union shop provision of the Railway Labor \n\n[351 \nU.S. 225, 232]\n\u00a0\n Act, sought to strike down inconsistent laws in 17 States. Cf. Hudson v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 242 N.C. 650, 89 S. E. 2d 441; Otten v. Baltimore & O. R. Co., 205 F.2d 58. The Supreme Court of Nebraska said, \"Such action on the part of Congress is a necessary part of every union shop contract entered into on the railroads as far as these 17 States are concerned for without it such contracts could not be enforced therein.\" 160 Neb., at 698, 71 N. W. 2d, at 547. We agree with that view. If private rights are being invaded, it is by force of an agreement made pursuant to federal law which expressly declares that state law is superseded. Cf. Smith v. Allwright, \n321 \nU.S. 649, 663\n. In other words, the federal statute is the source of the power and authority by which any private rights are lost or sacrificed.\n4\n Cf. Steele v. Louisville & N. R. Co., \n323 \nU.S. 192, 198\n-199, 204; Railroad Trainmen v. Howard, \n343 \nU.S. 768\n; Public Utilities Comm'n v. Pollak, \n343 \nU.S. 451, 462\n. The enactment of the federal statute authorizing union shop agreements is the governmental action on which the Constitution operates, though it takes a private agreement to invoke the federal sanction.\n\nAs already noted, the 1951 amendment, permitting the negotiation of union shop agreements, expressly allows those agreements notwithstanding any law \"of any State.\" 2, Eleventh.\n5\n A union agreement made pursuant to the Railway Labor Act has, therefore, the imprimatur of the federal law upon it and, by force of the Supremacy Clause of Article VI of the Constitution, could not be made illegal nor vitiated by any provision of the laws of a State. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 225, 233]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe come then to the merits.\n\nIn the absence of conflicting federal legislation, there can be no doubt that it is within the police power of a State to prohibit the union or the closed shop. We so held in Lincoln Union v. Northwestern Co., \n335 \nU.S. 525\n, and in American Federation of Labor v. American Sash Co., \n335 \nU.S. 538\n, against the challenge that local \"right to work\" laws, including Nebraska's, violated the requirements of due process. But the power of Congress to regulate labor relations in interstate industries is likewise well-established. Congress has authority to adopt all appropriate measures to \"facilitate the amicable settlement of disputes which threaten the service of the necessary agencies of interstate transportation.\" Texas & N. O. R. Co. v. Railway Clerks, \n281 \nU.S. 548, 570\n. These measures include provisions that will encourage the settlement of disputes \"by inducing collective bargaining with the true representative of the employees and by preventing such bargaining with any who do not represent them\" (Virginian R. Co. v. Federation, \n300 \nU.S. 515, 548\n), and that will protect the employees against discrimination or coercion which would interfere with the free exercise of their right to self-organization and representation. Labor Board v. Jones & Laughlin, \n301 \nU.S. 1, 33\n. Industrial peace along the arteries of commerce is a legitimate objective; and Congress has great latitude in choosing the methods by which it is to be obtained.\n\nThe choice by the Congress of the union shop as a stabilizing force seems to us to be an allowable one. Much might be said pro and con if the policy issue were before us. Powerful arguments have been made here that the long-run interests of labor would be better served by the development of democratic traditions in trade unionism without the coercive element of the union or the closed shop. Mr. Justice Brandeis, who had wide experience in labor-management relations prior to his appointment to \n\n[351 \nU.S. 225, 234]\n\u00a0\n the Court, wrote forcefully against the closed shop. He feared that the closed shop would swing the pendulum in the opposite extreme and substitute \"tyranny of the employee\" for \"tyranny of the employer.\"\n6\n But the question is one of policy with which the judiciary has no concern, as Mr. Justice Brandeis would have been the first to concede. Congress, acting within its constitutional powers, has the final say on policy issues. If it acts unwisely, the electorate can make a change. The task of the judiciary ends once it appears that the legislative measure adopted is relevant or appropriate to the constitutional power which Congress exercises. The ingredients of industrial peace and stabilized labor-management relations are numerous and complex. They may well vary from age to age and from industry to industry. What would be needful one decade might be anathema the next. The decision rests with the policy makers, not with the judiciary.\n\nIt is said that the right to work, which the Court has frequently included in the concept of \"liberty\" within the meaning of the Due Process Clauses (see Truax v. Raich, \n239 \nU.S. 33\n; Takahashi v. Fish & Game Commission, \n334 \nU.S. 410\n), may not be denied by the Congress. The question remains, however, whether the long-range interests of workers would be better served by one type of \n\n[351 \nU.S. 225, 235]\n\u00a0\n union agreement or another. That question is germane to the exercise of power under the Commerce Clause - a power that often has the quality of police regulations. See Cleveland v. United States, \n329 \nU.S. 14, 19\n. One would have to be blind to history to assert that trade unionism did not enhance and strengthen the right to work. See Webb, History of Trade Unionism; Gregory, Labor and the Law. To require, rather than to induce, the beneficiaries of trade unionism to contribute to its costs may not be the wisest course. But Congress might well believe that it would help insure the right to work in and along the arteries of interstate commerce. No more has been attempted here. The only conditions to union membership authorized by 2, Eleventh of the Railway Labor Act are the payment of \"periodic dues, initiation fees, and assessments.\" The assessments that may be lawfully imposed do not include \"fines and penalties.\" The financial support required relates, therefore, to the work of the union in the realm of collective bargaining. No more precise allocation of union overhead to individual members seems to us to be necessary. The prohibition of \"fines and penalties\" precludes the imposition of financial burdens for disciplinary purposes. If \"assessments\" are in fact imposed for purposes not germane to collective bargaining,\n7\n a different problem would be presented. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 225, 236]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWide-ranged problems are tendered under the First Amendment. It is argued that the union shop agreement forces men into ideological and political associations which violate their right to freedom of conscience, freedom of association, and freedom of thought protected by the Bill of Rights.\n8\n It is said that once a man becomes a \n\n[351 \nU.S. 225, 237]\n\u00a0\n member of these unions he is subject to vast disciplinary control\n9\n and that by force of the federal Act unions now can make him conform to their ideology. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 225, 238]\n\u00a0\n\n\nOn the present record, there is no more an infringement or impairment of First Amendment rights than there would be in the case of a lawyer who by state law is required to be a member of an integrated bar. It is argued that compulsory membership will be used to impair freedom of expression. But that problem is not presented by this record. Congress endeavored to safeguard against that possibility by making explicit that no conditions to membership may be imposed except as respects \"periodic dues, initiation fees, and assessments.\" If other conditions are in fact imposed, or if the exaction of dues, initiation fees, or assessments is used as a cover for forcing ideological conformity or other action in contravention of the First Amendment, this judgment will not prejudice the decision in that case. For we pass narrowly on 2, Eleventh of the Railway Labor Act. We only hold that the requirement for financial support of the collective-bargaining agency by all who receive the benefits of its work is within the power of Congress under the Commerce Clause and does not violate either the First or the Fifth Amendments. We express no opinion on the use of other conditions to secure or maintain membership in a labor organization operating under a union or closed shop agreement.\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] This constitutional provision is implemented by Neb. Rev. Stat., 1943, 48-217, which provides: \"Labor organizations; no denial of employment; closed shop not permitted. To make operative the provisions of Sections 13, 14 and 15 of Article 15 of the Constitution of Nebraska, no person shall be denied employment because of membership in or affiliation with, or resignation or expulsion from a labor organization or because of refusal to join or affiliate with a labor organization; nor shall any individual or corporation or association of any kind enter into any contract, written or oral, to exclude persons from employment because of membership in or nonmembership in a labor organization.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Section 2, Eleventh reads as follows: \"Eleventh. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Act, or of any other statute or law of the United States, or Territory thereof, or of any State, any carrier or carriers as defined in this Act and a labor organization or labor organizations duly designated and authorized to represent employees in accordance with the requirements of this Act shall be permitted - \"(a) to make agreements, requiring, as a condition of continued employment, that within sixty days following the beginning of such employment, or the effective date of such agreements, whichever is the later, all employees shall become members of the labor organization representing their craft or class: Provided, That no such agreement shall require such condition of employment with respect to employees to whom membership is not available upon the same terms and conditions as are generally applicable to any other member or with respect to employees to whom membership was denied or terminated for any reason other than the failure of the employee to tender the periodic dues, initiation fees, and assessments (not including fines and penalties) uniformly required as a condition of acquiring or retaining membership. \"(b) to make agreements providing for the deduction by such carrier or carriers from the wages of its or their employees in a craft or class and payment to the labor organization representing the craft or class of such employees, of any periodic dues, initiation fees, and assessments (not including fines and penalties) uniformly required as a condition of acquiring or retaining membership: Provided, That no such agreement shall be effective with respect to any individual employee until he shall have furnished the employer with a written assignment to the labor organization of such membership dues, initiation fees, and assessments, which shall be revocable in writing after the expiration of one year or upon the termination date of the applicable collective agreement, whichever occurs sooner. \"(c) The requirement of membership in a labor organization in an agreement made pursuant to subparagraph (a) shall be satisfied, as to both a present or future employee in engine, train, yard, or \n\n[351 \nU.S. 225, 230]\n\u00a0\n hostling service, that is, an employee engaged in any of the services or capacities covered in section 3, First (h) of this Act defining the jurisdictional scope of the First Division of the National Railroad Adjustment Board, if said employee shall hold or acquire membership in any one of the labor organizations, national in scope, organized in accordance with this Act and admitting to membership employees of a craft or class in any of said services; and no agreement made pursuant to subparagraph (b) shall provide for deductions from his wages for periodic dues, initiation fees, or assessments payable to any labor organization other than that in which he holds membership: Provided, however, That as to an employee in any of said services on a particular carrier at the effective date of any such agreement on a carrier, who is not a member of any one of the labor organizations, national in scope, organized in accordance with this Act and admitting to membership employees of a craft or class in any of said services, such employee, as a condition of continuing his employment, may be required to become a member of the organization representing the craft in which he is employed on the effective date of the first agreement applicable to him: Provided, further, That nothing herein or in any such agreement or agreements shall prevent an employee from changing membership from one organization to another organization admitting to membership employees of a craft or class in any of said services. \"(d) Any provisions in paragraphs Fourth and Fifth of section 2 of this Act, in conflict herewith are to the extent of such conflict amended.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The union shop is a variant of the closed shop, since union membership is required of every employee after the 60-day period designated in the Act. In 1954 the Bureau of Labor Statistics made an analysis of 1,716 collective-bargaining agreements in effect in industries not regulated by the Railway Labor Act. Of the 7,405,000 workers covered by the agreements studied, 64% were employed under union shop provisions. 78 Monthly Labor Review, No. 6, 649.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Once courts enforce the agreement the sanction of government is, of course, put behind them. See Shelley v. Kraemer, \n334 \nU.S. 1\n; Hurd v. Hodge, \n334 \nU.S. 24\n; Barrows v. Jackson, \n346 \nU.S. 249\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The parallel provision in 14 (b) of the Taft-Hartley Act (61 Stat. 151, 29 U.S.C. 164 (b)) makes the union shop agreement give way before a state law prohibiting it.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] See Mason, Brandeis, A Free Man's Life (1946), pp. 303-304, which quotes a letter of February 26, 1912, from Brandeis to Lincoln Steffens: \". . . But the American people should not, and will not, accept unionism if it involves the closed shop. They will not consent to the exchange of the tyranny of the employer for the tyranny of the employee. Unionism therefore cannot make a great advance until it abandons the closed shop; and it cannot accept the open shop as an alternative. The open shop means the destruction of the union. \"The advance of unionism demands therefore some relation between the employer and the employee other than either the closed or open shop, and I feel confident that we have found a solution in the preferential union shop.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] A number of appellant unions have broad powers to levy assessments for unspecified purposes. For example, the bylaws of the Railroad Yardmasters of America authorize the Executive Board to \"levy assessments upon all the members affected when in its opinion such assessments are necessary.\" 26. And 27 provides: \"Local lodges may levy such assessments upon their respective memberships as may be found necessary . . . .\" The General Committee of a Subordinate Division of the Order of Railroad Telegraphers is authorized \"to levy such assessments upon the members employed upon the transportation company over which it has jurisdiction as may be necessary to carry on its work.\" Subordinate Division Statutes, 42(H).

The constitution of one of appellant unions provides that no person shall be eligible for union office \"if such person associates himself with Communist, Fascist or similar organizations, or the Ku Klux Klan, or Columbians. Such eligibility shall likewise be denied where a person associates himself with, lends support or subscribes to the subversive doctrines of the organizations enumerated herein, similar organizations, or any organization or group that expounds or promotes any doctrine or philosophy inimical or subversive to the fundamental purposes of the constitution of the Government of the United States.\" Constitution of the Hotel & Restaurant Employees and Bartenders International Union, Art. XI, 18. The Constitution of the International Association of Machinists, Art. I, 5, provides: \"A member who advocates or encourages communism, fascism, \n\n[351 \nU.S. 225, 237]\n\u00a0\n nazism, or any other totalitarian philosophy, or who, by other actions, gives support to these `philosophies' or `isms' is not eligible to hold office in the I. A. M.\" B. The Grand Lodge Constitution of the Brotherhood Railway Carmen of America prohibits members from \"interfering with legislative matters affecting national, state, territorial, dominion or provincial legislation, adversely affecting the interests of our members.\" 64. The Constitution of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, another of the appellant unions, forbids any member from \"creating or attempting to create dissatisfaction or dissension among any of the members or among L.

The same article and section further prohibits any member from \"(15) Attending or participating in any gathering or meeting whatsoever, held outside meetings of a L.

JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, concurring.\n\nThe provision of law now challenged is the latest exercise by Congress of its power under the Commerce Clause to promote peaceful industrial relations in the \n\n[351 \nU.S. 225, 239]\n\u00a0\n functioning of interstate railroads and thereby to further the national well-being. A mere recital of the course of history in this important field goes a long way to indicate that the main point of attack against the Act of January 10, 1951, 64 Stat. 1238, raises questions not of constitutional validity but of policy in a domain of legislation peculiarly open to conflicting views of policy. These efforts constitute a body of empiric responses by Congress to new problems or new insight for dealing with old problems.\n\nThe course of legislation affecting industrial controversies on railroads flows through these statutes: the Act of October 1, 1888, 25 Stat. 501; the Erdman Act of June 1, 1898, 30 Stat. 424, growing out of the Pullman strike of 1894, see In re Debs, \n158 \nU.S. 564\n; the Newlands Act of July 15, 1913, 38 Stat. 103; the Adamson Law of September 3, 1916, 39 Stat. 721; Title III of the Transportation Act of 1920, 41 Stat. 456, 469; the Railway Labor Act of May 20, 1926, 44 Stat. 577; the Act of June 21, 1934, 48 Stat. 1185, amending the Railway Labor Act.\n\nNearly fifty years ago, the railroads successfully attacked the constitutionality of a vital feature of the Act of June 1, 1898, whereby Congress made it a criminal offense to bar employment in interstate railroads merely because of labor union membership. Adair v. United States, \n208 \nU.S. 161\n (1908). It is fair to say that this decision marks the nadir of denial to Congress of the power to regulate the conditions for assuring the Nation's dependence on the peaceful and effective operation of its railroads. The criticisms that the case aroused, see, e. g., Richard Olney, Discrimination Against Union Labor - Legal?, 42 Amer. L. Rev. 161 (1908), and Roscoe Pound, Liberty of Contract, 18 Yale L. J. 454 (1909), were reflected in later decisions of the Court. Neither the Commerce Clause nor the Due Process Clause was thereafter conceived, at least so far as they restrain railroad labor \n\n[351 \nU.S. 225, 240]\n\u00a0\n regulation, to be confined within such doctrinaire and frozen bounds as were confined the assumptions which underlay the decision in the Adair case. Thus, the Court sustained the Adamson Law, which was enacted to avert the threatened nation-wide railroad strike of 1916, Wilson v. New, \n243 \nU.S. 332\n (1917); Title III of the Transportation Act of 1920, Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Railroad Labor Board, \n261 \nU.S. 72\n (1923); and the Railway Labor Act of 1926, Texas & New Orleans R. Co. v. Brotherhood of Railway & Steamship Clerks, \n281 \nU.S. 548\n (1930); but see Railroad Retirement Board v. Alton R. Co., \n295 \nU.S. 330\n (1935).\n\nThe change in the Court's understanding of industrial problems, certainly as they affect railroads, in their bearing upon the country's commerce and all that thereby hangs, to no small degree reflected the changed attitude of the railroads towards the role of railroad labor unions in the discharge of the functions of railroads. As striking evidence as any of this important shift in opinion is the fact that the Railway Labor Act of 1926 came on the statute books through agreement between the railroads and the railroad unions on the need for such legislation. It is accurate to say that the railroads and the railroad unions between them wrote the Railway Labor Act of 1926 and Congress formally enacted their agreement. I doubt whether there is another instance in the history of important legislation in which acknowledgment was so candidly made by a President of the United States that agreement reached between industrial disputants regarding legislation appropriate for securing their peaceful relations should become law. \"I am informed,\" the President reported to Congress in his annual message of December 8, 1925, \"that the railroad managers and their employees have reached a substantial agreement as to what legislation is necessary to regulate and improve their relationship. Whenever they bring forward \n\n[351 \nU.S. 225, 241]\n\u00a0\n such proposals, which seem sufficient also to protect the interests of the public, they should be enacted into law.\" H. R. Doc. No. 2, 69th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 18. The President was Calvin Coolidge.\n\nWe have come full circle from the point of view in the Adair case. There the railroads, to repeat, successfully resisted an Act of Congress which outlawed what colloquially became known as the \"yellow-dog contract.\" We are now asked to declare it beyond the power of Congress to authorize railroads to enter into voluntary agreements with the unions to which the overwhelming proportion of railway employees belong whereby all their workers are required to belong to such unions, provided, of course, that the unions be open unions, i. e., that membership in the unions be available on ordinary, appropriate terms. It seems to me that the constitutional objections to this legislation were conclusively and compendiously answered by Mr. Justice Holmes in his dissent in Adair v. United States, supra:\n\n \"Where there is, or generally is believed to be, an  important ground of public policy for restraint the  Constitution does not forbid it, whether this court  agrees or disagrees with the policy pursued. It cannot  be doubted that to prevent strikes, and, so far  as possible, to foster its scheme of arbitration, might  be deemed by Congress an important point of policy,  and I think it impossible to say that Congress might  not reasonably think that the provision in question  would help a good deal to carry its policy along.  But suppose the only effect really were to tend to  bring about the complete unionizing of such railroad  laborers as Congress can deal with, I think that  object alone would justify the act. I quite agree  that the question what and how much good labor  unions do, is one on which intelligent people may \n\n[351 \nU.S. 225, 242]\n\u00a0\n  differ, - I think that laboring men sometimes attribute  to them advantages, as many attribute to  combinations of capital disadvantages, that really  are due to economic conditions of a far wider and  deeper kind - but I could not pronounce it unwarranted  if Congress should decide that to foster a  strong union was for the best interest, not only of  the men, but of the railroads and the country at  large.\" \n208 \nU.S., at 191\n-192.\n\n\n The Court has put to one side situations not now before us for which the protection of the First Amendment was earnestly urged at the bar. I, too, leave them to one side. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 225, 243]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","70":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nREA v. UNITED STATES(1956)\nNo. 30\nArgued: November 10, 1955Decided: January 16, 1956\n\n\n\n\n On the basis of evidence seized under an invalid federal search warrant, petitioner was indicted in a federal court for unlawful acquisition of marihuana. On his motion under Rule 41 (e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, this evidence was suppressed. Thereafter he was charged in a state court with possession of marihuana in violation of state law. Alleging that the evidence suppressed in the federal court was the basis of the state charge, petitioner moved in a federal court for an order enjoining the federal agent who had seized the evidence from transferring it to state authorities or testifying with respect thereto in the state courts. Held: The motion should have been granted. Pp. 214-218.\n\n 218 F.2d 237, reversed.\n\nJoseph A. Sommer argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief was Thomas F. McKenna.\n\nBeatrice Rosenberg argued the cause for the United States. With her on the brief were Solicitor General Sobeloff, Assistant Attorney General Olney and Marvin E. Frankel.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nPetitioner was indicted for the unlawful acquisition of marihuana in violation of 26 U.S.C. 2593 (a). The indictment, found in September 1953, was based on evidence obtained by a search warrant issued by a United States Commissioner, as authorized by Rule 41 (a) of the Rules of Criminal Procedure, in August 1953. Petitioner moved under Rule 41 (e) to suppress the evidence on the ground that the search warrant was improperly issued under Rule 41 (c) in that it was insufficient on its face, \n\n[350 \nU.S. 214, 215]\n\u00a0\n no probable cause existed, and the affidavit was based on unsworn statements.\n*\n The District Court granted the motion to suppress and, on the Government's later motion, dismissed the indictment. No motion for return of the evidence was made. The evidence seized was indeed contraband. Since the crime charged was a violation of a provision of the Internal Revenue Code, 28 U.S.C. 2463 was applicable. That section provides against the return of the property in the following words:\n\n \"All property taken or detained under any revenue law of the United States shall not be repleviable, but shall be deemed to be in the custody of the law and subject only to the orders and decrees of the courts of the United States having jurisdiction thereof.\" And see 26 U.S.C. 2598.\n\n\n After the District Court suppressed the evidence, a federal narcotics agent swore to a complaint before a New Mexico judge and caused a warrant for petitioner's arrest to issue. Petitioner has now been charged with being in possession of marihuana in violation of New Mexico law and awaits trial in the state court. The case against petitioner in the state court will be made by testimony of the federal agent based on the illegal search and on the evidence seized under the illegal federal warrant. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 214, 216]\n\u00a0\n That at least is the basis of the motion in the District Court to enjoin the federal narcotics agent from testifying in the state case with respect to the narcotics obtained in the illegal search and, if the evidence seized is out of the custody of the United States, to direct the agent to reacquire the evidence and destroy it or transfer it to other agents. The District Court denied the motion and the Court of Appeals affirmed. 218 F.2d 237. The case is here on a petition for certiorari which we granted because of the importance in federal law enforcement of the question presented. \n348 \nU.S. 958\n.\n\nThe briefs and oral argument have been largely devoted to constitutional questions. It is said, for example, that while the Fourth Amendment, as judicially construed, would bar the use of this evidence in a federal prosecution (Weeks v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 383\n), our decision in Wolf v. Colorado, \n338 \nU.S. 25\n, would permit New Mexico to use the evidence in its prosecution of petitioner. Moreover, it is said that to suppress the use of the evidence in the state criminal proceedings would run counter to our decision in Stefanelli v. Minard, \n342 \nU.S. 117\n.\n\nWe put all the constitutional questions to one side. We have here no problem concerning the interplay of the Fourth and the Fourteenth Amendments nor the use which New Mexico might make of the evidence. The District Court is not asked to enjoin state officials nor in any way to interfere with state agencies in enforcement of state law. Cf. Boske v. Comingore, \n177 \nU.S. 459\n. The only relief asked is against a federal agent, who obtained the property as a result of the abuse of process issued by a United States Commissioner. The property seized is contraband which Congress has made \"subject only to the orders and decrees of the courts of the United States having jurisdiction thereof,\" as provided in 28 U.S.C. 2463, already quoted. In this posture we have then a \n\n[350 \nU.S. 214, 217]\n\u00a0\n case that raises not a constitutional question but one concerning our supervisory powers over federal law enforcement agencies. Cf. McNabb v. United States, \n318 \nU.S. 332\n.\n\nA federal agent has violated the federal Rules governing searches and seizures - Rules prescribed by this Court and made effective after submission to the Congress. See \n327 \nU.S. 821\n et seq. The power of the federal courts extends to policing those requirements and making certain that they are observed. As stated in Wise v. Henkel, \n220 \nU.S. 556, 558\n, which involved an order directing the district attorney to return certain books and papers unlawfully seized:\n\n\". . . it was within the power of the court to take jurisdiction of the subject of the return and pass upon it as the result of its inherent authority to consider and decide questions arising before it concerning an alleged unreasonable exertion of authority in connection with the execution of the process of the court.\"\n\n\n No injunction is sought against a state official. The only remedy asked is against a federal agent who, we are told, plans to use his illegal search and seizure as the basis of testimony in the state court. To enjoin the federal agent from testifying is merely to enforce the federal Rules against those owing obedience to them.\n\nThe command of the federal Rules is in no way affected by anything that happens in a state court. They are designed as standards for federal agents. The fact that their violation may be condoned by state practice has no relevancy to our problem. Federal courts sit to enforce federal law; and federal law extends to the process issuing from those courts. The obligation of the federal agent is to obey the Rules. They are drawn for innocent and guilty alike. They prescribe standards for law enforcement. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 214, 218]\n\u00a0\n They are designed to protect the privacy of the citizen, unless the strict standards set for searches and seizures are satisfied. That policy is defeated if the federal agent can flout them and use the fruits of his unlawful act either in federal or state proceedings.\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rule 41 (c) provides in relevant part as follows:\n\n\"A warrant shall issue only on affidavit sworn to before the judge or commissioner and establishing the grounds for issuing the warrant. If the judge or commissioner is satisfied that grounds for the application exist or that there is probable cause to believe that they exist, he shall issue a warrant identifying the property and naming or describing the person or place to be searched. The warrant shall be directed to a civil officer of the United States authorized to enforce or assist in enforcing any law thereof or to a person so authorized by the President of the United States. It shall state the grounds or probable cause for its issuance and the names of the persons whose affidavits have been taken in support thereof.\"\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE HARLAN, whom MR. JUSTICE REED, MR. JUSTICE BURTON, and MR. JUSTICE MINTON join, dissenting.\n\nWithout discussion of the competing state and federal interests involved, the Court holds that a federal law enforcement officer should be enjoined from turning over to state authorities for use in a state prosecution evidence which he has obtained in contravention of the Fourth Amendment, and from giving testimony concerning the evidence in the state proceedings. This holding so far departs from the concepts which have hitherto been considered to govern state and federal relationships in this area that I am constrained to dissent.\n\n1. The holding that an injunction should issue against making available to New Mexico the evidence and testimony in question is rested on this Court's \"supervisory powers over federal law enforcement agencies.\" So far as I know, this is the first time it has been suggested that the federal courts share with the executive branch of the Government responsibility for supervising law enforcement activities as such. McNabb v. United States, \n318 \nU.S. 332\n, cited by the Court, stands for no such proposition. Indeed, in excluding the McNabb evidence in a federal trial, the Court was careful to say: \". . . we confine ourselves to our limited function as the court of ultimate review of the standards formulated and applied by federal courts in the trial of criminal cases. We are not concerned with law enforcement practices except in so far as courts themselves become instruments of law \n\n[350 \nU.S. 214, 219]\n\u00a0\n enforcement.\" \n318 \nU.S., at 347\n. I do not think that this case can be brought within McNabb simply because the enjoined evidence was seized under an invalid court process. Would the Court's decision have been different had there been no search warrant at all? Moreover, the Court has heretofore refused to extend the McNabb rule to state criminal trials. Stein v. New York, \n346 \nU.S. 156, 186\n-188; Gallegos v. Nebraska, \n342 \nU.S. 55, 63\n-64.\n\n2. Nor can this decision be supported under any general equity power. For although the federal courts undeniably have the power to issue an injunction in this case, they also have the discretion to withhold equitable relief when, on the balance, the power should not be exercised. On that basis, I think the decision cannot be reconciled with the rationale of Stefanelli v. Minard, \n342 \nU.S. 117\n. There, in a case brought under the Civil Rights Act, R. S. 1979, now 42 U.S.C. 1983, claiming violation of petitioner's rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, the Court refused to enjoin the use of state-seized evidence in a state prosecution, saying that \"the federal courts should refuse to intervene in State criminal proceedings to suppress the use of evidence even when claimed to have been secured by unlawful search and seizure.\" Id., at 120. That holding was based on the \"special delicacy of the adjustment to be preserved between federal equitable power and State administration of its own law.\" The same consideration is applicable here. The Court distinguishes Stefanelli because we are \"not asked to enjoin state officials nor in any way to interfere with state agencies in enforcement of state law.\" But this seems to me illusory, for, as the Court recognizes, the State's case against petitioner appears to depend wholly on the evidence in question; the injunction will operate quite as effectively, albeit indirectly, to stultify the state prosecution as if it had been issued directly against New Mexico or its officials. New Mexico's prosecution is at least as \n\n[350 \nU.S. 214, 220]\n\u00a0\n far advanced as was the state prosecution in Stefanelli. If New Mexico should now seek to subpoena the federal agent, would the Court permit him to honor the State's process? And if not, how could that properly be said not to impinge directly upon the New Mexico prosecution? Today's decision represents a reversal of the sound policy followed in Stefanelli; I can find no justification for it. It was not an abuse of discretion to withhold the relief here.\n\n3. It is said that the federal policies against unlawful searches and seizures will be flouted if a federal agent can \"use the fruits of his unlawful act either in federal or state proceedings.\" But this Court has already held that although the substance of the Fourth Amendment is \"implicit in `the concept of ordered liberty'\" and hence enforceable against the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, evidence unlawfully seized by a State can nevertheless be used in state prosecutions. Wolf v. Colorado, \n338 \nU.S. 25\n. That being so, I am unable to understand how an exercise of federal equity power designed to deny the State the use of this evidence can be squared with the policies underlying Wolf. The fact that the injunction operates only against evidence still in possession of the federal authorities and against testimony by a federal officer is for me not a sufficient answer, since the only difference I can see between the Wolf decision and Weeks v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 383\n, excluding in federal criminal trials evidence obtained in contravention of the Fourth Amendment, is the difference between state and federal courts; in each case, the substance of the constitutional command is the same, but the nature of enforcement varies with the forum. So that, had the petitioner here been convicted in the state courts by use of this evidence, I take it that Wolf means we would not have interfered, at least absent any showing of a more aggravated search and seizure than this record discloses. To say that \n\n[350 \nU.S. 214, 221]\n\u00a0\n federal interference is nevertheless justified at this point in the proceedings whenever the State has not yet obtained the evidence seems to me to make the matter simply a race between a state prosecution and a federal injunction proceeding. I do not believe that a rule dependent on the fortuitous circumstance of winning that race is a sound one in this important field of federal-state relations. If, on the other hand, the Court is now saying that it is the difference between the Fourth Amendment and the Fourteenth which requires this result - a conclusion disclaimed by the majority - then I would still regard the injunction as improvidently issued, since New Mexico should be given the first opportunity to suppress the evidence, with this Court sitting in review if the State improperly refuses to do so. Cf. Douglas v. Jeannette, \n319 \nU.S. 157\n.\n\nIn accommodating state and federal interests in criminal law enforcement, this Court has hitherto taken the view that the States should be left free to follow or not the federal exclusionary rule set forth in Weeks v. United States, supra. The present decision seems to me to be a step in the opposite and wrong direction. I think the judgment below should be affirmed. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 214, 222]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","71":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nREED v. PENNSYLVANIA R. CO.(1956)\nNo. 621\nArgued: May 1, 1956Decided: June 11, 1956\n\n\n\n\n Petitioner is a clerical employee of an interstate railroad whose duties consist of filing original tracings of all of the carrier's rolling stock, equipment and structures, from which tracings blueprints are made.

With him on the brief were Philip Price and Gordon W. Gerber. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 502, 503]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE MINTON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe question we have for decision here is whether petitioner, a clerical employee of respondent railroad, is within the coverage of the Federal Employers' Liability Act. 1, 35 Stat. 65, as amended, 53 Stat. 1404, 45 U.S.C. 51. Petitioner is employed entirely in respondent's office building in Philadelphia. Her duties consist of filing original tracings of all of respondent's engines, cars, parts, tracks, bridges, and other structures, from which blueprints of those items are made. There are some 325,000 tracings on file in the office in which petitioner works. Whenever an order for blueprints comes in from anywhere in respondent's system, it is petitioner's responsibility to fill the order by securing the correct tracings from the files. These she takes to the blueprint maker in the same office building. After the blueprints are made, it is petitioner's further duty to return the original tracings to the appropriate file. About 67% of the blueprints so made are sent to points outside pennsylvania. The files which petitioner attends are the sole depository of the original tracings of the structural details of all of respondent's rolling stock, trackage, and other equipment and installations, and as such represent a fund of documents without which maintenance of the operating system would be impossible.\n\nPetitioner was injured when a cracked window pane in her office blew in upon her. She brought suit for personal injury under the Federal Employers' Liability Act. On respondent's motion to dismiss, the District Court held that petitioner was not within the coverage of 1 of the Act and, there being no diversity of citizenship between the parties, dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction. The Court of Appeals affirmed. 227 F.2d 810. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 502, 504]\n\u00a0\n\n\n We granted certiorari because of the importance of the question presented in the administration of the Act. \n350 \nU.S. 965\n.\n\nAs originally enacted, 1 provided that every railroad, \"while engaging\" in interstate commerce,\n\n \"shall be liable in damages to any person suffering  injury while he is employed by such carrier in such  commerce . . . for such injury or death resulting in  whole or in part from the negligence of any of the  officers, agents, or employees of such carrier, or by  reason of any defect or insufficiency, due to its negligence,  in its cars, engines, appliances, machinery,  track, roadbed, works, boats, wharves, or other  equipment.\" 35 Stat. 65.\n\n\n A further paragraph was added to the section in 1939, and it is clear that two specific problems which the amendment sought at least to remedy were the results of this Court's holdings that, at the moment of his injury, the employee as well as the railroad had to be engaged in interstate commerce in order to come within the coverage of 1, and that employees engaged in construction of new facilities were not covered. S. Rep. No. 661, 76th Cong., 1st Sess. 2-3; Southern Pacific Co. v. Gileo, decided today, ante, p. 493. The amendment took the form of an expanded definition of \"person . . . employed\" in interstate commerce. The amendment reads:\n\n  \"Any employee of a carrier, any part of whose  duties as such employee shall be the furtherance of  interstate or foreign commerce; or shall, in any way  directly or closely and substantially, affect such commerce  as above set forth shall, for the purposes of  this Act, be considered as being employed by such  carrier in such commerce and shall be considered as  entitled to the benefits of this Act . . . .\" 53 Stat.  1404. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 502, 505]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n No argument is made that Congress could not constitutionally include petitioner within the coverage of the Act. The argument is that the amendment was narrowly drawn to remedy specific evils and that to construe it to include petitioner would amount to inclusion in the Act of virtually all railroad employees - a result which respondent assumes is unintended and undesirable. The argument takes several forms. First, it is said that \"commerce\" in the Act means only transportation and that petitioner is not employed in transportation. See Shanks v. Delaware, L. & W. R. Co., \n239 \nU.S. 556, 559\n-560. But the interstate commerce in which respondent is engaged is interstate transportation. If \"any part\" of petitioner's duties is in \"furtherance\" of or substantially affects interstate commerce, it also is in \"furtherance\" of or substantially affects interstate transportation. The test for coverage under the amendment is not whether the employee is engaged in transportation, but rather whether what he does in any way furthers or substantially affects transportation. Nor can we resolve the issue presented here in terms of whether or not clerical employees as a class are excluded from the benefits of the statute. The 1939 amendment was designed to obliterate fine distinctions as to coverage between employees who, for the purpose of this remedial legislation, should be treated alike. There is no meaningful distinction, in terms of whether the employee's duties are clerical or not, between petitioner and, for illustration, an assistant chief timekeeper, Straub v. Reading Co., 220 F.2d 177, or a messenger boy carrying waybills and grain orders between separate local offices and freight stations, Bowers v. Wabash R. Co., 246 S. W. 2d 535, or a lumber inspector hurt while inspecting ties at a lumber company, Ericksen v. Southern Pacific Co., 39 Cal. 2d 374, 246 P.2d 642 - all of whom have been held covered by the 1939 amendment. See also Lillie v. Thompson, \n332 \nU.S. 459\n. Nor are the benefits of the \n\n[351 \nU.S. 502, 506]\n\u00a0\n Act limited to those exposed to the special hazards of the railroad industry. The Act has not been so interpreted, and the 1939 amendment specifically affords protection to \"any employee\" whose duties bring him within that amendment. There is no basis in the language of 1 for confining liability of the railroad so as to exclude any class of railroad employees as a class. The benefits of the Act are not limited to those who have cinders in their hair, soot on their faces, or callouses on their hands. Section I cannot be interpreted to exclude petitioner from its benefits without further consideration of the function she performs and its impact on interstate commerce.\n\nWe think that the present petitioner is employed by the respondent in interstate commerce within the meaning of the 1939 amendment to 1. Although the amendment may have been prompted by a specific desire to obviate certain court-made rules limiting coverage, the language used goes far beyond that narrow objective. It evinces a purpose to expand coverage substantially as well as to avoid narrow distinctions in deciding questions of coverage. Under the amendment, it is the \"duties\" of the employee that must further or affect commerce, and it is enough if \"any part\" of those duties has the requisite effect. The statute commands us to examine the purpose and effect of the employee's function in the railroad's interstate operation, without limitation to nonclerical employees or determination on the basis of the employee's importance as an individual in the railroad's organization.\n\nHere respondent railroad has chosen to arrange its operations so that repairs and construction anywhere within its system which require blueprints must go through its Philadelphia office. No such work can be done without recourse to the files of 325,000 original tracings in petitioner's custody. Loss or misplacing of those tracings could promptly cause delay, confusion, or worse in the day-to-day operation of respondent's lines. If all employees \n\n[351 \nU.S. 502, 507]\n\u00a0\n who perform petitioner's duties were removed from service, respondent could not conduct its operations without a change in its organizational system. To recognize this is to attribute to petitioner neither an exaggerated nor an attenuated relationship to respondent's transportation system. The filing of tracings and the dispatch of blueprints taken from them comprise a direct link in the maintenance of respondent's lines and rolling stock. Together with the makers of blueprints, petitioner constitutes the means by which men throughout respondent's system obtain the information they must have to maintain the railroad's trains, equipment, track, and structures.\n\nThe very purpose of petitioner's job is to further physical maintenance of an interstate railroad system. Proper performance of her duties makes an obvious contribution to the maintenance of that system. We hold that the petitioner, by the performance of her duties, is furthering the interstate transportation in which the respondent is engaged. \"The word `furtherance' is a comprehensive term. Its periphery may be vague, but admittedly it is both large and elastic.\" Shelton v. Thomson, 148 F.2d 1, 3. Petitioner's duties here come within the confines of that concept.\n\nSimilarly, those duties which \"in any way directly or closely and substantially affect\" interstate commerce in the railroad industry must necessarily be marked out through the process of case-by-case adjudication. This definition and the \"furtherance\" definition of employment in interstate commerce in the 1939 amendment are set forth in the disjunctive. In some situations they may overlap. Here we hold that, for the reasons already given, performance of petitioner's duties has a close and substantial effect upon the operation of respondent's interstate activities. Cf. Overstreet v. North Shore Corp., \n318 \nU.S. 125\n. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 502, 508]\n\u00a0\n\n\nPetitioner's duties brought her within the coverage of 1 as amended, and the District Court therefore had jurisdiction over this suit under the Federal Employers' Liability Act. The judgment below is reversed and the cause remanded to the District Court for further proceedings.\n\n     Reversed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE BURTON dissents for the reasons stated below in the opinion of the Court of Appeals.\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, whom MR. JUSTICE REED and MR. JUSTICE HARLAN join, dissenting.\n\nDissenters are not empowered to define the scope of a decision, but the way they read it may induce dissent. So it is with what the Court has here written. The opinion does not state in terms that the Amendment of August 11, 1939, 53 Stat. 1404, to the Federal Employers' Liability Act of April 22, 1908, 35 Stat. 65, has so drastically changed the limited scope of that Act to those employees of an interstate carrier who are, more or less, directly concerned with its transportation operations as to make it reach all the employees of such interstate carrier whom Congress in the exercise of its constitutional power to regulate commerce may cover. I say the Court does not explicitly hold this, but it does hold that a clerical employee is covered by the terms of the Act because a \"part\" of her duties is in \"furtherance\" of interstate commerce. The Court reads the Amendment of 1939 to the Act of 1908 in a merely lexicographical sense. \"Furtherance\" means anything that furthers or helps forward; the petitioner was certainly charged with tasks that furthered or helped to forward the business of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, a carrier engaged in interstate commerce; ergo, the petitioner, having been injured while \"employed by such carrier in such commerce,\" \n\n[351 \nU.S. 502, 509]\n\u00a0\n has a right of action under the Amendment to the Employers' Liability Act.\n\nWere the Court to be as explicit as this, it would at least not open the door, as this decision inevitably does, to new litigation. It is not a juristic requirement that decisions be carried to their logical consequences. It is equally true that capricious distinctions should not be made. Yet they are invited when the rationale of a decision is left, if not cloudy, certainly unlimited. For myself, I do not see how the clerical employee here \"furthers\" the business of the Pennsylvania any more than do all the other clerical employees of the Pennsylvania, and the thousands upon thousands of clerical employees on the various railroads throughout the country, even though there may be differences in salary and hierarchical importance among such employees.\n\nAccordingly, clerical employees and other obviously non-transportation employees of railroads will bring suits under the Federal Employers' Liability Act when recovery thereunder will, by the law of chance, appear to lawyers advising them to be more advantageous than awards obtainable under state workmen's compensation acts. Indeed, if some employees may seek to avail themselves, for one reason or another, of a state workmen's compensation act, a carrier may resist, under the doctrine of New York Central R. Co. v. Winfield, \n244 \nU.S. 147\n by urging the exclusiveness of a remedy under the Federal Employers' Liability Act. Conversely, if suit is brought under that Act, carriers will doubtless resist, as they have in the past, on the ground that the particular clerical employee is not \"furthering\" its business sufficiently to constitute \"furtherance\" as intended by the Court in this case. It is not a silly exercise in prophecy to foretell that just as a mass, if indeed not a mess, of cases came before this Court prior to the 1939 Amendment, when the Court gave a much too constricted scope to the Act (see cases \n\n[351 \nU.S. 502, 510]\n\u00a0\n collected in Frankfurter and Landis, The Business of the Supreme Court, pp. 207-208), so a new series of sterile litigation will be stimulated by this decision.\n\nI part company with the Court not in its reading of English but in its assumption that the construction of the Amendment to the Federal Employers' Liability Act is merely a matter of reading English. The Act of August 11, 1939, is the last in a series of consistently developing statutes. As such, it is an organism, projected into the future out of its past. It is not merely a collection of words for abstract annotation out of the dictionary. The process of judicial construction must be mindful of the history of the legislation, of the purpose which infused it, of the difficulties which were encountered in effectuating this purpose, of the aims of those most active in relieving these difficulties. Above all, we should be mindful of the central concern of the body of enactments that constitute the Federal Employers' Liability Act throughout all the vicissitudes of the legislation. It would be redundant to detail these considerations in view of Judge Goodrich's opinion below. 227 F.2d 810. A few additional observations are pertinent.\n\nOf course, the Act of 1939 sought to remove hindrances that had revealed themselves in subjecting carriers to liability for injuries due to negligence. But the preoccupation of the whole course of this legislation was with protection to those who were peculiarly exposed to injuries because of the nature of their occupation, i. e., the hazardous business of railroading. A very important obstacle to recovery was the doctrine of the assumption of risk as part of the general law of negligence that was made the basis of the federal right. Congress abolished assumption of risk as a defense. See Tiller v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., \n318 \nU.S. 54\n. Another great difficulty derived from this Court's construction of the Commerce \n\n[351 \nU.S. 502, 511]\n\u00a0\n Clause whereby it confined application of the Federal Employers' Liability Act to injuries sustained by an employee if at the moment of injury his work was related to interstate transportation. This mode of approach derived from the Employers' Liability Cases, \n207 \nU.S. 463\n, and the Second Employers' Liability Cases, \n223 \nU.S. 1\n, and produced a series of decisions which led Judge Learned Hand to say \"The cases are full of casuistry . . . .\" Central R. Co. of New Jersey v. Monahan, 11 F.2d 212, 213.\n\nI agree with the Court in finding that the \"1939 amendment was designed to obliterate fine distinctions\"; but they were made by courts only in relation to employees who worked in the context of the hazardous business of transportation. The amendatory legislation was addressed to judicial distinctions affecting these transportation workers that bore no practical relation to the essential conditions of their employment; these distinctions never touched others in a totally different category of employment because the Federal Employers' Liability Act never remotely applied to them. In order to obliterate such \"fine distinctions.\" it is not necessary to jump over the moon and wipe out the basic distinction between those whose duties are tied to transportation, whatever may have been their precise work at the moment of injury, and those employees who are exposed by way of permanent occupation to no greater or different potential hazards than are the thousands upon thousands of like workers in offices other than those of railroads whom Congress has left to remedies under state law. It was on the presupposition of this cardinal distinction between transportation and non-transportation employees of railroads that the Federal Employers' Liability Act was amended in 1939. To make it apply to clerical workers who \"further,\" in a dictionary sense of the term, the interstate \n\n[351 \nU.S. 502, 512]\n\u00a0\n commerce business of railroads would have as much justification, but no more, as it would have for Congress to pass a Federal Employers' Liability Act for all employees who further large enterprises in the conduct of their interstate commerce. The whole course of history of the Federal Employers' Liability Act as well as due regard for the text of the Amendment of 1939, in its entire context, calls for affirmance of the decision below. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 502, 513]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","72":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nREID v. COVERT(1956)\nNo. 701\nArgued: May 3, 1956Decided: June 11, 1956\n\n\n\n\n Pursuant to Article 2(11) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the dependent wife of a United States Air Force sergeant was tried and convicted by a military court-martial in England for the murder of her husband there. She was sentenced to life imprisonment and brought to a federal prison in the United States. On appeal, her conviction was set aside, and she was transferred to the District of Columbia jail to await retrial by court-martial at an air base in Washington, D.C. While there, she petitioned the local federal district court for a writ of habeas corpus, claiming that she was not subject to military jurisdiction because Article 2 (11) was unconstitutional. The court ordered the writ to issue, directed to the Superintendent of the jail, and he appealed directly to this Court. Held:\n\n 1. Article 2 (11) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice is constitutional. Kinsella v. Krueger, ante, p. 470. P. 488.\n\n\n 2. As custodian of a federal prisoner, the Superintendent of the jail is an officer or employee of the United States for purposes of 28 U.S.C. 1252, and this Court has jurisdiction of his direct appeal under that section. Pp. 489-490.\n\n\n 3. Military jurisdiction, once validly attached, continues until final disposition of the case. Therefore, jurisdiction of the Air Force to try appellee by court-martial under Article 2 (11) was not lost by her return to the United States and delivery to the custody of civilian authorities.

With him on the brief were Solicitor General Sobeloff, Assistant Attorney General Olney, Beatrice Rosenberg and Richard J. Blanchard.\n\nFrederick Bernays Wiener argued the cause and filed a brief for appellee. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 487, 488]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nMrs. Clarice Covert was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment by a military court-martial which tried her at a United States Air Force base in England for the murder of her husband, an Air Force sergeant. She was brought to the United States and confined in the Federal Reformatory for Women, Alderson, West Virginia. On appeal, the United States Court of Military Appeals set aside her conviction on grounds not material here, and she was transferred to the District of Columbia jail to await a rehearing by court-martial at Bolling Air Force Base, Washington, D.C. While there she filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, alleging that she was not subject to court-martial jurisdiction because Article 2 (11) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, 50 U.S.C. 552, was unconstitutional. The District Court ordered the writ to issue, and the Government appealed directly to this Court. Postponing the question of jurisdiction until a hearing on the merits, \n350 \nU.S. 985\n, we scheduled this case for argument with Kinsella v. Krueger, ante, p. 470, decided this day.\n\nAt the outset, appellee questions the jurisdiction of this Court to hear the case on direct appeal from the District Court. For reasons hereafter stated, we conclude that we have jurisdiction.\n\nAppellee's principal argument on the merits is answered by our decision in Kinsella v. Krueger, ante, p. 470. It is also contended, however, that whatever jurisdiction the military may have had to try Mrs. Covert by court-martial under Article 2 (11) was lost by her return to the United States and delivery to the custody of civilian authorities. We conclude that in the circumstances of this case this argument is without merit. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 487, 489]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nThe question of our jurisdiction involves an interpretation of 28 U.S.C. 1252:\n\n  \"Any party may appeal to the Supreme Court from  an interlocutory or final judgment, decree or order  of any court of the United States . . . holding an  Act of Congress unconstitutional in any civil action,  suit, or proceeding to which the United States or  any of its agencies, or any officer or employee thereof,  as such officer or employee, is a party.\"\n\n\n It is conceded that, in issuing the writ of habeas corpus, the District Court held an Act of Congress unconstitutional. Appellee's sole contention is that appellant, the Superintendent of the District of Columbia jail, does not come within the requirement of 1252 that \"the United States, or any of its agencies, or any officer or employee thereof, as such officer or employee,\" be a party.\n\nThe Superintendent is responsible to the Director of the Department of Corrections of the District of Columbia, who in turn is selected by the Board of Commissioners of the District. Reorganization Order No. 34, D.C. Code, 1951, App. to Title 1, Supp. III, p. 34. The Commissioners are appointed by the President and are officers of the United States under Art. II, 2, of the Constitution. The Superintendent has a statutory duty to \"receive and keep in the Washington Asylum and Jail all prisoners committed thereto for offenses against the United States.\" D.C. Code, 1951, 24-410. Mrs. Covert was placed in the District jail on orders of the Air Force, because there are no accommodations for women prisoners at Bolling Air Force Base, where the rehearing of her trial by court-martial is scheduled.\n\nIt has long been settled that an officer, while holding prisoners for the United States, is the \"keeper of the \n\n[351 \nU.S. 487, 490]\n\u00a0\n United States,\" Randolph v. Donaldson, 9 Cranch 76, 86, and, as such, is an officer of the United States. Since appellant was required to \"receive and keep\" prisoners of the United States, he is, to that extent, an officer of the United States. It is not necessary to say, and we do not say, that the District of Columbia in these circumstances is an \"agency\" of the United States. For, whether the Government should maintain its own jail in the District of Columbia, or utilize the local facilities, is simply a matter of administrative convenience, and it would do violence to the purpose of Congress to provide a \"prompt review of the constitutionality of federal acts,\" Fleming v. Rhodes, \n331 \nU.S. 100, 104\n, to interpret 1252 restrictively. For all practical purposes, the District of Columbia jail is, in this case, the \"jail of the United States,\" Randolph v. Donaldson, supra, and the Superintendent is its keeper. As the custodian of Mrs. Covert, a federal prisoner, appellant is an officer or employee of the United States for purposes of 1252.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nOn the merits, Mrs. Covert contends that Article 2 (11) should be restricted geographically, and therefore military jurisdiction over her expired upon her return to the United States. She also contends that, as a civilian, she is no longer subject to the Code, since she is not in \"custody of the armed forces\" under Article 2 (7).\n\nAn entirely different case might be presented if Mrs. Covert had terminated her status as a person \"accompanying the armed forces without the continental limits of the United States\" by returning to this country voluntarily. But that is not this case. The issue here is whether we should create an exception to the general rule that jurisdiction of a tribunal, once acquired, continues until final disposition. At the time of her court-martial \n\n[351 \nU.S. 487, 491]\n\u00a0\n in England, Mrs. Covert was subject to military jurisdiction under Article 2 (11), Kinsella v. Krueger, ante, p. 470. Her transfer under orders of the Air Force was in furtherance of that jurisdiction. To accept Mrs. Covert's argument would result in the anomalous situation that military jurisdiction, validly exercised under Article 2 (11), would be defeated by the imposition of a sentence under Article 58, 50 U.S.C. 639, which provides for confinement \"in any penal or correctional institution under the control of the United States, or which the United States may be allowed to use.\" It would be unreasonable to hold that the services retained jurisdiction of military prisoners that they kept in foreign countries but lost jurisdiction of prisoners confined in penal institutions in the United States.\n\nNor is jurisdiction defeated by reversal of Mrs. Covert's conviction and the ordering of a rehearing. The military courts have recognized rehearings to be but continuations of the original proceedings, United States v. Padilla, 5 C. M. R. 31, 42; United States v. Moore, 5 C. M. R. 438, 444; United States v. Milbourne, 15 C. M. R. 527, 528; and the legislative history of Article 63 of the Code bears out the fact that they were so intended by Congress. H. R. Rep. No. 491, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 30; S. Rep. No. 486, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 27.\n\nWe also note that this case is clearly distinguishable from Toth v. Quarles, \n350 \nU.S. 11\n. Toth had returned to the United States and been honorably discharged months before the specifications were filed charging him with an offense committed while a soldier in Korea. The Air Force had relinquished all jurisdiction over Toth before any charge was filed against him. But here, Mrs. Covert was charged, tried, convicted, sentenced and imprisoned pursuant to a valid exercise of court-martial jurisdiction while she was concededly within the \n\n[351 \nU.S. 487, 492]\n\u00a0\n provisions of Article 2 (11). We are not deciding here when, in other circumstances, Article 2 (11) jurisdiction may terminate. In this case we hold only that military jurisdiction, once validly attached, continues until final disposition of the case.\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\n [For reservation of MR.

JUSTICE BLACK announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion, in which THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, and MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN join.\n\nThese cases raise basic constitutional issues of the utmost concern. They call into question the role of the military under our system of government. They involve the power of Congress to expose civilians to trial by military tribunals, under military regulations and procedures, for offenses against the United States thereby depriving them of trial in civilian courts, under civilian laws and procedures and with all the safeguards of the Bill of Rights. These cases are particularly significant because for the first time since the adoption of the Constitution wives of soldiers have been denied trial by jury in a court of law and forced to trial before courts-martial.\n\nIn No. 701 Mrs. Clarice Covert killed her husband, a sergeant in the United States Air Force, at an airbase in England. Mrs. Covert, who was not a member of the armed services, was residing on the base with her husband at the time. She was tried by a court-martial for murder under Article 118 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ).\n1\n The trial was on charges preferred by Air Force personnel and the court-martial was composed of Air Force officers. The court-martial asserted jurisdiction over Mrs. Covert under Article 2 (11) of the UCMJ,\n2\n which provides:\n\n \"The following persons are subject to this code:\n\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \"(11) Subject to the provisions of any treaty or agreement to which the United States is or may be a party or to any accepted rule of international law, \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n all persons serving with, employed by, or accompanying the armed forces without the continental limits of the United States . . . .\"\n\n\n Counsel for Mrs. Covert contended that she was insane at the time she killed her husband, but the military tribunal found her guilty of murder and sentenced her to life imprisonment. The judgment was affirmed by the Air Force Board of Review, 16 CMR 465, but was reversed by the Court of Military Appeals, 6 USCMA 48, because of prejudicial errors concerning the defense of insanity. While Mrs. Covert was being held in this country pending a proposed retrial by court-martial in the District of Columbia, her counsel petitioned the District Court for a writ of habeas corpus to set her free on the ground that the Constitution forbade her trial by military authorities. Construing this Court's decision in United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, \n350 \nU.S. 11\n, as holding that \"a civilian is entitled to a civilian trial\" the District Court held that Mrs. Covert could not be tried by court-martial and ordered her released from custody. The Government appealed directly to this Court under 28 U.S.C. 1252. See \n350 \nU.S. 985\n.\n\nIn No. 713 Mrs. Dorothy Smith killed her husband, an Army officer, at a post in Japan where she was living with him. She was tried for murder by a court-martial and despite considerable evidence that she was insane was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment. The judgment was approved by the Army Board of Review, 10 CMR 350, 13 CMR 307, and the Court of Military Appeals, 5 USCMA 314. Mrs. Smith was then confined in a federal penitentiary in West Virginia. Her father, respondent here, filed a petition for habeas corpus in a District Court for West Virginia. The petition charged that the court-martial was without jurisdiction because Article 2 (11) of the UCMJ was unconstitutional insofar as it authorized the trial of civilian dependents accompanying \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n servicemen overseas. The District Court refused to issue the writ, 137 F. Supp. 806, and while an appeal was pending in the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit we granted certiorari at the request of the Government, \n350 \nU.S. 986\n.\n\nThe two cases were consolidated and argued last Term and a majority of the Court, with three Justices dissenting and one reserving opinion, held that military trial of Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Covert for their alleged offenses was constitutional. \n351 \nU.S. 470, 487\n. The majority held that the provisions of Article III and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments which require that crimes be tried by a jury after indictment by a grand jury did not protect an American citizen when he was tried by the American Government in foreign lands for offenses committed there and that Congress could provide for the trial of such offenses in any manner it saw fit so long as the procedures established were reasonable and consonant with due process. The opinion then went on to express the view that military trials, as now practiced, were not unreasonable or arbitrary when applied to dependents accompanying members of the armed forces overseas. In reaching their conclusion the majority found it unnecessary to consider the power of Congress \"To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces\" under Article I of the Constitution.\n\nSubsequently, the Court granted a petition for rehearing, \n352 \nU.S. 901\n. Now, after further argument and consideration, we conclude that the previous decisions cannot be permitted to stand. We hold that Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Covert could not constitutionally be tried by military authorities.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nAt the beginning we reject the idea that when the United States acts against citizens abroad it can do so free of the Bill of Rights. The United States is entirely \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n a creature of the Constitution.\n3\n Its power and authority have no other source. It can only act in accordance with all the limitations imposed by the Constitution.\n4\n When the Government reaches out to punish a citizen who is abroad, the shield which the Bill of Rights and other parts of the Constitution provide to protect his life and liberty should not be stripped away just because he happens to be in another land. This is not a novel concept. To the contrary, it is as old as government. It was recognized long before Paul successfully invoked his right as a Roman citizen to be tried in strict accordance with Roman law. And many centuries later an English historian wrote:\n\n \"In a Settled Colony the inhabitants have all the rights of Englishmen. They take with them, in the first place, that which no Englishman can by expatriation put off, namely, allegiance to the Crown, the duty of obedience to the lawful commands of the Sovereign, and obedience to the Laws which Parliament may think proper to make with reference to such a Colony. But, on the other hand, they take with them all the rights and liberties of British Subjects; all the rights and liberties as against the Prerogative of the Crown, which they would enjoy in this country.\"\n5\n\u00a0\n\n\n The rights and liberties which citizens of our country enjoy are not protected by custom and tradition alone, they have been jealously preserved from the encroachments \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n of Government by express provisions of our written Constitution.\n6\n\u00a0\n\nAmong those provisions, Art. III, 2 and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments are directly relevant to these cases. Article III, 2 lays down the rule that:\n\n \"The Trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury; and such Trial shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed within any State, the Trial shall be at such Place or Places as the Congress may by Law have directed.\"\n\n\n The Fifth Amendment declares:\n\n \"No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; . . . .\"\n\n\n And the Sixth Amendment provides:\n\n \"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed . . . .\"\n\n\n The language of Art. III, 2 manifests that constitutional protections for the individual were designed to restrict the United States Government when it acts outside of this country, as well as here at home. After declaring that all criminal trials must be by jury, the section states that when a crime is \"not committed within any State, the Trial shall be at such Place or Places as the Congress may by Law have directed.\" If \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n this language is permitted to have its obvious meaning,\n7\n 2 is applicable to criminal trials outside of the States as a group without regard to where the offense is committed or the trial held.\n8\n From the very first Congress, federal statutes have implemented the provisions of 2 by providing for trial of murder and other crimes committed outside the jurisdiction of any State \"in the district where the offender is apprehended, or into which he may first be brought.\"\n9\n The Fifth and Sixth Amendments, like Art. III, 2, are also all inclusive with their sweeping references to \"no person\" and to \"all criminal prosecutions.\"\n\nThis Court and other federal courts have held or asserted that various constitutional limitations apply to the Government when it acts outside the continental United States.\n10\n While it has been suggested that only \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n those constitutional rights which are \"fundamental\" protect Americans abroad,\n11\n we can find no warrant, in logic or otherwise, for picking and choosing among the remarkable collection of \"Thou shalt nots\" which were explicitly fastened on all departments and agencies of the Federal Government by the Constitution and its Amendments. Moreover, in view of our heritage and the history of the adoption of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, it seems peculiarly anomalous to say that trial before a civilian judge and by an independent jury picked from the common citizenry is not a fundamental right.\n12\n As Blackstone wrote in his Commentaries:\n\n\". . . the trial by jury ever has been, and I trust ever will be, looked upon as the glory of the English law. And if it has so great an advantage over others in regulating civil property, how much must that advantage be heightened when it is applied to criminal cases! . . . [I]t is the most transcendent privilege which any subject can enjoy, or wish for, that he cannot be affected either in his property, his \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n liberty, or his person, but by the unanimous consent of twelve of his neighbours and equals.\"\n13\n\u00a0\n\n\n Trial by jury in a court of law and in accordance with traditional modes of procedure after an indictment by grand jury has served and remains one of our most vital barriers to governmental arbitrariness. These elemental procedural safeguards were embedded in our Constitution to secure their inviolateness and sanctity against the passing demands of expediency or convenience.\n\nThe keystone of supporting authorities mustered by the Court's opinion last June to justify its holding that Art. III, 2, and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments did not apply abroad was In re Ross, \n140 \nU.S. 453\n. The Ross case is one of those cases that cannot be understood except in its peculiar setting; even then, it seems highly unlikely that a similar result would be reached today. Ross was serving as a seaman on an American ship in Japanese waters. He killed a ship's officer, was seized and tried before a consular \"court\" in Japan. At that time, statutes authorized American consuls to try American citizens charged with committing crimes in Japan and certain other \"non-Christian\" countries.\n14\n These \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n statutes provided that the laws of the United States were to govern the trial except:\n\n\". . . where such laws are not adapted to the object, or are deficient in the provisions necessary to furnish suitable remedies, the common law and the law of equity and admiralty shall be extended in like manner over such citizens and others in those countries; and if neither the common law, nor the law of equity or admiralty, nor the statutes of the United States, furnish appropriate and sufficient remedies, the ministers in those countries, respectively, shall, by decrees and regulations which shall have the force of law, supply such defects and deficiencies.\"\n15\n\u00a0\n\n\n The consular power approved in the Ross case was about as extreme and absolute as that of the potentates of the \"non-Christian\" countries to which the statutes applied. Under these statutes consuls could and did make the criminal laws, initiate charges, arrest alleged offenders, try them, and after conviction take away their liberty or their life - sometimes at the American consulate. Such a blending of executive, legislative, and judicial powers in one person or even in one branch of the Government is ordinarily regarded as the very acme of absolutism.\n16\n Nevertheless, the Court sustained Ross' conviction by the consul. It stated that constitutional \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 12]\n\u00a0\n protections applied \"only to citizens and others within the United States, or who are brought there for trial for alleged offences committed elsewhere, and not to residents or temporary sojourners abroad.\"\n17\n Despite the fact that it upheld Ross' conviction under United States laws passed pursuant to asserted constitutional authority, the Court went on to make a sweeping declaration that \"[t]he Constitution can have no operation in another country.\"\n18\n\u00a0\n\nThe Ross approach that the Constitution has no applicability abroad has long since been directly repudiated by numerous cases.\n19\n That approach is obviously erroneous if the United States Government, which has no power except that granted by the Constitution, can and does try citizens for crimes committed abroad.\n20\n Thus the Ross case rested, at least in substantial part, on a fundamental misconception and the most that can be said in support of the result reached there is that the consular court jurisdiction had a long history antedating the adoption of the Constitution. The Congress has recently buried the consular system of trying Americans.\n21\n We are not willing to jeopardize the lives and liberties of Americans by disinterring it. At best, the Ross case should be left as a relic from a different era.\n\nThe Court's opinion last Term also relied on the \"Insular Cases\" to support its conclusion that Article III and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments were not applicable \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 13]\n\u00a0\n to the trial of Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Covert.\n22\n We believe that reliance was misplaced. The \"Insular Cases,\" which arose at the turn of the century, involved territories which had only recently been conquered or acquired by the United States. These territories, governed and regulated by Congress under Art. IV, 3,\n23\n had entirely different cultures and customs from those of this country. This Court, although closely divided,\n24\n ruled that certain constitutional safeguards were not applicable to these territories since they had not been \"expressly or impliedly incorporated\" into the Union by Congress. While conceding that \"fundamental\" constitutional rights applied everywhere,\n25\n the majority found that it would disrupt long-established practices and would be inexpedient to require a jury trial after an indictment by a grand jury in the insular possessions.\n26\n\u00a0\n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 14]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe \"Insular Cases\" can be distinguished from the present cases in that they involved the power of Congress to provide rules and regulations to govern temporarily territories with wholly dissimilar traditions and institutions whereas here the basis for governmental power is American citizenship. None of these cases had anything to do with military trials and they cannot properly be used as vehicles to support an extension of military jurisdiction to civilians. Moreover, it is our judgment that neither the cases nor their reasoning should be given any further expansion. The concept that the Bill of Rights and other constitutional protections against arbitrary government are inoperative when they become inconvenient or when expediency dictates otherwise is a very dangerous doctrine and if allowed to flourish would destroy the benefit of a written Constitution and undermine the basis of our Government. If our foreign commitments become of such nature that the Government can no longer satisfactorily operate within the bounds laid down by the Constitution, that instrument can be amended by the method which it prescribes.\n27\n But we have no authority, or inclination, to read exceptions into it which are not there.\n28\n\u00a0\n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 15]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nAt the time of Mrs. Covert's alleged offense, an executive agreement was in effect between the United States and Great Britain which permitted United States' military courts to exercise exclusive jurisdiction over offenses committed in Great Britain by American servicemen or their dependents.\n29\n For its part, the United States agreed that these military courts would be willing and able to try and to punish all offenses against the laws of Great Britain by such persons. In all material respects, the same situation existed in Japan when Mrs. Smith \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 16]\n\u00a0\n killed her husband.\n30\n Even though a court-martial does not give an accused trial by jury and other Bill of Rights protections, the Government contends that Art. 2 (11) of the UCMJ, insofar as it provides for the military trial of dependents accompanying the armed forces in Great Britain and Japan, can be sustained as legislation which is necessary and proper to carry out the United States' obligations under the international agreements made with those countries. The obvious and decisive answer to this, of course, is that no agreement with a foreign nation can confer power on the Congress, or on any other branch of Government, which is free from the restraints of the Constitution.\n\nArticle VI, the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, declares:\n\n \"This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; . . . .\"\n\n\n There is nothing in this language which intimates that treaties and laws enacted pursuant to them do not have to comply with the provisions of the Constitution. Nor is there anything in the debates which accompanied the drafting and ratification of the Constitution which even suggests such a result. These debates as well as the history that surrounds the adoption of the treaty provision in Article VI make it clear that the reason treaties were not limited to those made in \"pursuance\" of the Constitution was so that agreements made by the United States under the Articles of Confederation, including the important peace treaties which concluded the Revolutionary \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 17]\n\u00a0\n War, would remain in effect.\n31\n It would be manifestly contrary to the objectives of those who created the Constitution, as well as those who were responsible for the Bill of Rights - let alone alien to our entire constitutional history and tradition - to construe Article VI as permitting the United States to exercise power under an international agreement without observing constitutional prohibitions.\n32\n In effect, such construction would permit amendment of that document in a manner not sanctioned by Article V. The prohibitions of the Constitution were designed to apply to all branches of the National Government and they cannot be nullified by the Executive or by the Executive and the Senate combined.\n\nThere is nothing new or unique about what we say here. This Court has regularly and uniformly recognized the supremacy of the Constitution over a treaty.\n33\n For example, in Geofroy v. Riggs, \n133 \nU.S. 258, 267\n, it declared:\n\n\"The treaty power, as expressed in the Constitution, is in terms unlimited except by those restraints which are found in that instrument against the action of the government or of its departments, and those arising from the nature of the government itself and of that of the States. It would not be contended that it extends so far as to authorize what the Constitution forbids, or a change in the character of the \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 18]\n\u00a0\n government or in that of one of the States, or a cession of any portion of the territory of the latter, without its consent.\"\n\n\n This Court has also repeatedly taken the position that an Act of Congress, which must comply with the Constitution, is on a full parity with a treaty, and that when a statute which is subsequent in time is inconsistent with a treaty, the statute to the extent of conflict renders the treaty null.\n34\n It would be completely anomalous to say that a treaty need not comply with the Constitution when such an agreement can be overridden by a statute that must conform to that instrument.\n\nThere is nothing in Missouri v. Holland, \n252 \nU.S. 416\n, which is contrary to the position taken here. There the Court carefully noted that the treaty involved was not inconsistent with any specific provision of the Constitution. The Court was concerned with the Tenth Amendment which reserves to the States or the people all power not delegated to the National Government. To the extent that the United States can validly make treaties, the people and the States have delegated their power to the National Government and the Tenth Amendment is no barrier.\n35\n\u00a0\n\nIn summary, we conclude that the constitution in its entirety applied to the trials of Mrs. Smith and Mrs. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 19]\n\u00a0\n Covert. Since their court-martial did not meet the requirements of Art. III, 2 or the Fifth and Sixth Amendments we are compelled to determine if there is anything within the Constitution which authorizes the military trial of dependents accompanying the armed forces overseas.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nArticle I, 8, cl. 14 empowers Congress \"To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces.\" It has been held that this creates an exception to the normal method of trial in civilian courts as provided by the Constitution and permits Congress to authorize military trial of members of the armed services without all the safeguards given an accused by Article III and the Bill of Rights.\n36\n But if the language of Clause 14 is given its natural meaning,\n37\n the power granted does not extend to civilians - even though they may be dependents living with servicemen on a military base.\n38\n The term \"land and naval Forces\" refers to persons \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 20]\n\u00a0\n who are members of the armed services and not to their civilian wives, children and other dependents. It seems inconceivable that Mrs. Covert or Mrs. Smith could have been tried by military authorities as members of the \"land and naval Forces\" had they been living on a military post in this country. Yet this constitutional term surely has the same meaning everywhere. The wives of servicemen are no more members of the \"land and naval Forces\" when living at a military post in England or Japan than when living at a base in this country or in Hawaii or Alaska.\n\nThe Government argues that the Necessary and Proper Clause when taken in conjunction with Clause 14 allows Congress to authorize the trial of Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Covert by military tribunals and under military law. The Government claims that the two clauses together constitute a broad grant of power \"without limitation\" authorizing Congress to subject all persons, civilians and soldiers alike, to military trial if \"necessary and proper\" to govern and regulate the land and naval forces. It was on a similar theory that Congress once went to the extreme of subjecting persons who made contracts with the military to court-martial jurisdiction with respect to frauds related to such contracts.\n39\n In the only judicial test a Circuit Court held that the legislation was patently unconstitutional. Ex parte Henderson, 11 Fed. Cas. 1067, No. 6,349.\n\nIt is true that the Constitution expressly grants Congress power to make all rules necessary and proper to govern and regulate those persons who are serving in the \"land and naval Forces.\" But the Necessary and Proper \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 21]\n\u00a0\n Clause cannot operate to extend military jurisdiction to any group of persons beyond that class described in Clause 14 - \"the land and naval Forces.\" Under the grand design of the Constitution civilian courts are the normal repositories of power to try persons charged with crimes against the United States. And to protect persons brought before these courts, Article III and the Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Amendments establish the right to trial by jury, to indictment by a grand jury and a number of other specific safeguards. By way of contrast the jurisdiction of military tribunals is a very limited and extraordinary jurisdiction derived from the cryptic language in Art. I, 8, and, at most, was intended to be only a narrow exception to the normal and preferred method of trial in courts of law.\n40\n Every extension of military jurisdiction is an encroachment on the jurisdiction of the civil courts, and, more important, acts as a deprivation of the right to jury trial and of other treasured constitutional protections. Having run up against the steadfast bulwark of the Bill of Rights, the Necessary and Proper Clause cannot extend the scope of Clause 14.\n\nNothing said here contravenes the rule laid down in McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, at 421, that:\n\n\"Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the constitution, are constitutional.\" \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 22]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n In McCulloch this Court was confronted with the problem of determining the scope of the Necessary and Proper Clause in a situation where no specific restraints on governmental power stood in the way. Here the problem is different. Not only does Clause 14, by its terms, limit military jurisdiction to members of the \"land and naval Forces,\" but Art. III, 2 and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments require that certain express safeguards, which were designed to protect persons from oppressive governmental practices, shall be given in criminal prosecutions - safe-guards which cannot be given in a military trial. In the light of these as well as other constitutional provisions, and the historical background in which they were formed, military trial of civilians is inconsistent with both the \"letter and spirit of the constitution.\"\n\nFurther light is reflected on the scope of Clause 14 by the Fifth Amendment. That Amendment which was adopted shortly after the Constitution reads:\n\n \"No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; . . . .\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n Since the exception in this Amendment for \"cases arising in the land or naval forces\" was undoubtedly designed to correlate with the power granted Congress to provide for the \"Government and Regulation\" of the armed services, it is a persuasive and reliable indication that the authority conferred by Clause 14 does not encompass persons who cannot fairly be said to be \"in\" the military service.\n\nEven if it were possible, we need not attempt here to precisely define the boundary between \"civilians\" and members of the \"land and naval Forces.\" We recognize \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 23]\n\u00a0\n that there might be circumstances where a person could be \"in\" the armed services for purposes of Clause 14 even though he had not formally been inducted into the military or did not wear a uniform. But the wives, children and other dependents of servicemen cannot be placed in that category, even though they may be accompanying a serviceman abroad at Government expense and receiving other benefits from the Government.\n41\n We have no difficulty in saying that such persons do not lose their civilian status and their right to a civilian trial because the Government helps them live as members of a soldier's family.\n\nThe tradition of keeping the military subordinate to civilian authority may not be so strong in the minds of this generation as it was in the minds of those who wrote the Constitution. The idea that the relatives of soldiers could be denied a jury trial in a court of law and instead be tried by court-martial under the guise of regulating the armed forces would have seemed incredible to those men, in whose lifetime the right of the military to try soldiers for any offenses in time of peace had only been grudgingly conceded.\n42\n The Founders envisioned the \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 24]\n\u00a0\n army as a necessary institution, but one dangerous to liberty if not confined within its essential bounds. Their fears were rooted in history. They knew that ancient republics had been overthrown by their military leaders.\n43\n They were familiar with the history of Seventeenth Century England, where Charles I tried to govern through the army and without Parliament. During this attempt, contrary to the Common Law, he used courts-martial to try soldiers for certain non-military offenses.\n44\n\u00a0\n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 25]\n\u00a0\n This court-martialing of soldiers in peacetime evoked strong protests from Parliament.\n45\n The reign of Charles I was followed by the rigorous military rule of Oliver Cromwell. Later, James II used the Army in his fight \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 26]\n\u00a0\n against Parliament and the people. He promulgated Articles of War (strangely enough relied on in the Government's brief) authorizing the trial of soldiers for non-military crimes by courts-martial.\n46\n This action hastened the revolution that brought William and Mary to the throne upon their agreement to abide by a Bill of Rights which, among other things, protected the right of trial by jury.\n47\n It was against this general background that two of the greatest English jurists, Lord Chief Justice Hale and Sir William Blackstone - men who exerted considerable influence on the Founders - expressed sharp hostility to any expansion of the jurisdiction of military courts. For instance, Blackstone went so far as to assert:\n\n\"For martial law, which is built upon no settled principles, but is entirely arbitrary in its decisions, is, as Sir Matthew Hale observes, in truth and reality no law, but something indulged rather than allowed as a law. The necessity of order and discipline in an army is the only thing which can give it countenance; \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 27]\n\u00a0\n and therefore it ought not to be permitted in time of peace, when the king's courts are open for all persons to receive justice according to the laws of the land.\"\n48\n\u00a0\n\n\n The generation that adopted the Constitution did not distrust the military because of past history alone. Within their own lives they had seen royal governors sometimes resort to military rule. British troops were quartered in Boston at various times from 1768 until the outbreak of the Revolutionary War to support unpopular royal governors and to intimidate the local populace. The trial of soldiers by courts-martial and the interference of the military with the civil courts aroused great anxiety and antagonism not only in Massachusetts but throughout the colonies. For example, Samuel Adams in 1768 wrote:\n\n\". . . [I]s it not enough for us to have seen soldiers and mariners forejudged of life, and executed within the body of the county by martial law? Are citizens \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 28]\n\u00a0\n to be called upon, threatened, ill-used at the will of the soldiery, and put under arrest, by pretext of the law military, in breach of the fundamental rights of subjects, and contrary to the law and franchise of the land? . . . Will the spirits of people as yet unsubdued by tyranny, unawed by the menaces of arbitrary power, submit to be governed by military force? No! Let us rouse our attention to the common law, - which is our birthright, our great security against all kinds of insult and oppression . . . .\"\n49\n\u00a0\n\n\n Colonials had also seen the right to trial by jury subverted by acts of Parliament which authorized courts of admiralty to try alleged violations of the unpopular \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 29]\n\u00a0\n \"Molasses\" and \"Navigation\" Acts.\n50\n This gave the admiralty courts jurisdiction over offenses historically triable only by a jury in a court of law and aroused great resentment throughout the colonies.\n51\n As early as 1765 delegates from nine colonies meeting in New York asserted in a \"Declaration of Rights\" that trial by jury was the \"inherent and invaluable\" right of every citizen in the colonies.\n52\n\u00a0\n\nWith this background it is not surprising that the Declaration of Independence protested that George III had \"affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power\" and that Americans had been deprived in many cases of \"the benefits of Trial by Jury.\"\n53\n And those who adopted the Constitution embodied their profound fear and distrust of military power, as well as their determination to protect trial by jury, in the Constitution and its Amendments.\n54\n Perhaps they \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 30]\n\u00a0\n were aware that memories fade and hoped that in this way they could keep the people of this Nation from having to fight again and again the same old battles for individual freedom.\n\nIn light of this history, it seems clear that the Founders had no intention to permit the trial of civilians in military courts, where they would be denied jury trials and other constitutional protections, merely by giving Congress the power to make rules which were \"necessary and proper\" for the regulation of the \"land and naval Forces.\" Such a latitudinarian interpretation of these clauses would be at war with the well-established purpose of the Founders to keep the military strictly within its proper sphere, subordinate to civil authority. The Constitution does not say that Congress can regulate \"the land and naval Forces and all other persons whose regulation might have some relationship to maintenance of the land and naval Forces.\" There is no indication that the Founders contemplated setting up a rival system of military courts to compete with civilian courts for jurisdiction over civilians who might have some contact or relationship with the armed forces. Courts-martial were not to have concurrent jurisdiction with courts of law over non-military America.\n\nOn several occasions this Court has been faced with an attempted expansion of the jurisdiction of military courts. Ex parte Milligan, 4 Wall. 2, one of the great landmarks in this Court's history, held that military authorities were without power to try civilians not in the military or naval service by declaring martial law in an area where the civil \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 31]\n\u00a0\n administration was not deposed and the courts were not closed.\n55\n In a stirring passage the Court proclaimed:\n\n \"Another guarantee of freedom was broken when Milligan was denied a trial by jury. The great minds of the country have differed on the correct interpretation to be given to various provisions of the Federal Constitution; and judicial decision has been often invoked to settle their true meaning; but until recently no one ever doubted that the right of trial by jury was fortified in the organic law against the power of attack. It is now assailed; but if ideas can be expressed in words, and language has any meaning, this right - one of the most valuable in a free country - is preserved to everyone accused of crime who is not attached to the army, or navy, or militia in actual service.\"\n56\n\u00a0\n\n\n In Duncan v. Kahanamoku, \n327 \nU.S. 304\n, the Court reasserted the principles enunciated in Ex parte Milligan and reaffirmed the tradition of military subordination to civil authorities and institutions. It refused to sanction the military trial of civilians in Hawaii during wartime despite government claims that the needs of defense made martial law imperative.\n\nJust last Term, this Court held in United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, \n350 \nU.S. 11\n, that military courts could not constitutionally try a discharged serviceman for an offense which he had allegedly committed while in the armed forces. It was decided (1) that since Toth was a civilian he could not be tried by military court-martial,\n57\n\u00a0\n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 32]\n\u00a0\n and (2) that since he was charged with murder, a \"crime\" in the constitutional sense, he was entitled to indictment by a grand jury, jury trial, and the other protections contained in Art. III, 2 and the Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Amendments. The Court pointed out that trial by civilian courts was the rule for persons who were not members of the armed forces.\n\nThere are no supportable grounds upon which to distinguish the Toth case from the present cases. Toth, Mrs. Covert, and Mrs. Smith were all civilians. All three were American citizens. All three were tried for murder. All three alleged crimes were committed in a foreign country. The only differences were: (1) Toth was an ex-serviceman while they were wives of soldiers; (2) Toth was arrested in the United States while they were seized in foreign countries. If anything, Toth had closer connection with the military than the two women for his crime was committed while he was actually serving in the Air Force. Mrs. Covert and Mrs. Smith had never been members of the army, had never been employed by the army, had never served in the army in any capacity. The Government appropriately argued in Toth that the constitutional basis for court-martialing him was clearer than for court-martialing wives who are accompanying their husbands abroad.\n58\n Certainly Toth's conduct as a soldier bears a closer relation to the maintenance of order and discipline in the armed forces than the conduct of these wives. The fact that Toth was arrested here while the \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 33]\n\u00a0\n wives were arrested in foreign countries is material only if constitutional safeguards do not shield a citizen abroad when the Government exercises its power over him. As we have said before, such a view of the Constitution is erroneous. The mere fact that these women had gone overseas with their husbands should not reduce the protection the Constitution gives them.\n\nThe Milligan, Duncan and Toth cases recognized and manifested the deeply rooted and ancient opposition in this country to the extension of military control over civilians. In each instance an effort to expand the jurisdiction of military courts to civilians was repulsed.\n\nThere have been a number of decisions in the lower federal courts which have upheld military trial of civilians performing services for the armed forces \"in the field\" during time of war.\n59\n To the extent that these cases can be justified, insofar as they involved trial of persons who were not \"members\" of the armed forces, they must rest on the Government's \"war powers.\" In the face of an actively hostile enemy, military commanders necessarily have broad power over persons on the battlefront. From a time prior to the adoption of the Constitution the extraordinary circumstances present in an area of actual fighting have been considered sufficient to permit punishment of some civilians in that area by military courts under military rules.\n60\n But neither Japan \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 34]\n\u00a0\n nor Great Britain could properly be said to be an area where active hostilities were under way at the time Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Covert committed their offenses or at the time they were tried.\n61\n\u00a0\n\nThe Government urges that the concept \"in the field\" should be broadened to reach dependents accompanying the military forces overseas under the conditions of world tension which exist at the present time. It points out how the \"war powers\" include authority to prepare defenses and to establish our military forces in defensive posture about the world. While we recognize that the \"war powers\" of the Congress and the Executive are \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 35]\n\u00a0\n broad,\n62\n we reject the Government's argument that present threats to peace permit military trial of civilians accompanying the armed forces overseas in an area where no actual hostilities are under way.\n63\n The exigencies which have required military rule on the battlefront are not present in areas where no conflict exists. Military trial of civilians \"in the field\" is an extraordinary jurisdiction and it should not be expanded at the expense of the Bill of Rights. We agree with Colonel Winthrop, an expert on military jurisdiction, who declared: \"a statute cannot be framed by which a civilian can lawfully be made amenable to the military jurisdiction in time of peace.\"\n64\n (Emphasis not supplied.)\n\nAs this Court stated in United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, \n350 \nU.S. 11\n, the business of soldiers is to fight and prepare to fight wars, not to try civilians for their alleged crimes. Traditionally, military justice has been a rough form of justice emphasizing summary procedures, \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 36]\n\u00a0\n speedy convictions and stern penalties with a view to maintaining obedience and fighting fitness in the ranks. Because of its very nature and purpose the military must place great emphasis on discipline and efficiency. Correspondingly, there has always been less emphasis in the military on protecting the rights of the individual than in civilian society and in civilian courts.\n\nCourts-martial are typically ad hoc bodies appointed by a military officer from among his subordinates. They have always been subject to varying degrees of \"command influence.\"\n65\n In essence, these tribunals are simply executive tribunals whose personnel are in the executive chain of command. Frequently, the members of the court-martial must look to the appointing officer for promotions, advantageous assignments and efficiency ratings - in short, for their future progress in the service. Conceding to military personnel that high degree of honesty and sense of justice which nearly all of them undoubtedly have, the members of a court-martial, in the nature of things, do not and cannot have the independence of jurors drawn from the general public or of civilian judges.\n66\n\u00a0\n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 37]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe recognize that a number of improvements have been made in military justice recently by engrafting more and more of the methods of civilian courts on courts-martial. In large part these ameliorations stem from the reaction of civilians, who were inducted during the two World Wars, to their experience with military justice. Notwithstanding the recent reforms, military trial does not give an accused the same protection which exists in the civil courts. Looming far above all other deficiencies of the military trial, of course, is the absence of trial by jury before an independent judge after an indictment by a grand jury. Moreover the reforms are merely statutory; Congress - and perhaps the President - can reinstate former practices, subject to any limitations imposed by the Constitution, whenever it desires.\n67\n As yet it has not been clearly settled to what extent the Bill of Rights and other protective parts of the Constitution apply to military trials.\n68\n\u00a0\n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 38]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt must be emphasized that every person who comes within the jurisdiction of courts-martial is subject to military law - law that is substantially different from the law which governs civilian society. Military law is, in many respects, harsh law which is frequently cast in very sweeping and vague terms.\n69\n It emphasizes the iron hand of discipline more that it does the even scales of justice. Moreover, it has not yet been definitely established to what extent the President, as Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces, or his delegates, can promulgate, supplement or change substantive military law as well as the procedures of military courts in time of peace, or in time of war.\n70\n In any event, Congress has given the President broad discretion to provide the rules governing military trials.\n71\n For example, in these very cases a technical manual issued under the President's name with regard to the defense of insanity in military trials was of critical importance in the convictions of Mrs. Covert and Mrs. Smith. If the President can provide \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 39]\n\u00a0\n rules of substantive law as well as procedure, then he and his military subordinates exercise legislative, executive and judicial powers with respect to those subject to military trials. Such blending of functions in one branch of the Government is the objectionable thing which the draftsmen of the Constitution endeavored to prevent by providing for the separation of governmental powers.\n\nIn summary, \"it still remains true that military tribunals have not been and probably never can be constituted in such way that they can have the same kind of qualifications that the Constitution has deemed essential to fair trials of civilians in federal courts.\"\n72\n In part this is attributable to the inherent differences in values and attitudes that separate the military establishment from civilian society. In the military, by necessity, emphasis must be placed on the security and order of the group rather than on the value and integrity of the individual.\n\nIt is urged that the expansion of military jurisdiction over civilians claimed here is only slight, and that the practical necessity for it is very great.\n73\n The attitude appears to be that a slight encroachment on the Bill of Rights and other safeguards in the Constitution need cause little concern. But to hold that these wives could be tried by the military would be a tempting precedent. Slight encroachments create new boundaries from which legions of power can seek new territory to capture. \"It may be that it is the obnoxious thing in its mildest and least repulsive form; but illegitimate and unconstitutional \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 40]\n\u00a0\n practices get their first footing in that way, namely, by silent approaches and slight deviations from legal modes of procedure. This can only be obviated by adhering to the rule that constitutional provisions for the security of person and property should be liberally construed. A close and literal construction deprives them of half their efficacy, and leads to gradual depreciation of the right, as if it consisted more in sound than in substance. It is the duty of courts to be watchful for the constitutional rights of the citizen, and against any stealthy encroachments thereon.\"\n74\n Moreover we cannot consider this encroachment a slight one. Throughout history many transgressions by the military have been called \"slight\" and have been justified as \"reasonable\" in light of the \"uniqueness\" of the times. We cannot close our eyes to the fact that today the peoples of many nations are ruled by the military.\n\nWe should not break faith with this Nation's tradition of keeping military power subservient to civilian authority, a tradition which we believe is firmly embodied in the Constitution. The country has remained true to that faith for almost one hundred seventy years. Perhaps no group in the Nation has been truer than military men themselves. Unlike the soldiers of many other nations, they have been content to perform their military duties in defense of the Nation in every period of need and to perform those duties well without attempting to usurp power which is not theirs under our system of constitutional government.\n\nOurs is a government of divided authority on the assumption that in division there is not only strength but freedom from tyranny. And under our Constitution courts of law alone are given power to try civilians for \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 41]\n\u00a0\n their offenses against the United States. The philosophy expressed by Lord Coke, speaking long ago from a wealth of experience, is still timely:\n\n\"God send me never to live under the Law of Conveniency or Discretion. Shall the Souldier and Justice Sit on one Bench, the Trumpet will not let the Cryer speak in Westminster-Hall.\"\n75\n\u00a0\n\n\n In No. 701, Reid v. Covert, the judgment of the District Court directing that Mrs. Covert be released from custody is\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n In No. 713, Kinsella v. Krueger, the judgment of the District Court is reversed and the case is remanded with instructions to order Mrs. Smith released from custody.\n\n    Reversed and remanded.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE WHITTAKER took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 50 U.S.C. 712.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 50 U.S.C. 552 (11).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Martin v.

Bidwell, \n182 \nU.S. 244\n, the first of the \"Insular Cases\" was decided over vigorous dissents from Mr. Chief Justice Fuller, joined by Justices Harlan, Brewer, and Peckham, and from Mr. Justice Harlan separately. The four dissenters took the position that all the restraints of the Bill of Rights and of other parts of the Constitution were applicable to the United States Government wherever it acted. This was the position which the Court had consistently followed prior to the \"Insular Cases.\" See, e. g., Thompson v. Utah, \n170 \nU.S. 343\n; Callan v. Wilson, \n127 \nU.S. 540\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 25\n] As to the great significance of the right to trial by jury see text at note 13, supra, and the authorities referred to in that note.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 26\n] Later the Court held that once a territory become \"incorporated\" all of the constitutional protections became \"applicable.\" See, e. g., Rassmussen v. United States, \n197 \nU.S. 516, 520\n-521.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 27\n] It may be said that it is difficult to amend the Constitution. To some extent that is true. Obviously the Founders wanted to guard against hasty and ill-considered changes in the basic charter of government. But if the necessity for alteration becomes pressing, or if the public demand becomes strong enough, the Constitution can and has been promptly amended. The Eleventh Amendment was ratified within less than two years after the decision in Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419. And more recently the Twenty-First Amendment, repealing nationwide prohibition, became part of the Constitution within ten months after congressional action. On the average it has taken the States less than two years to ratify each of the twenty-two amendments which have been made to the Constitution.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 28\n] In 1881, Senator Carpenter, while attacking the consular courts \"as a disgrace to this nation\" because they deprived citizens of the \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 15]\n\u00a0\n \"fundamental and essential\" rights to indictment and trial by jury, declared: \"If we are too mean as a nation to pay the expense of observing the Constitution in China, then let us give up our concessions in China and come back to as much of the Constitution as we can afford to carry out.\" 11 Cong.

S. 2846, which by its terms gives the foreign nation primary jurisdiction to try dependents accompanying American servicemen for offenses which are violations of the law of both the foreign nation and the United States. Art. VII, 1 (b), 3 (a). The foreign nation has exclusive criminal jurisdiction over dependents for offenses which only violate its laws. Art. VII, 2 (b).

Generally, see Note, 70 Harv. L. Rev. 1043.

In the opinion of the author, such a range of control is certainly beyond the power of Congress under [the Constitution. The Fifth Amendment] clearly distinguishes the military from the civil class as separate communities. It recognizes no third class which is part civil and part military . . . and it cannot be perceived how Congress can create such a class, without a disregard of the letter and spirit of the organic law.\" Winthrop, Military Law and Precedents (2d ed., Reprint 1920), 106.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 39\n] 12 Stat. 696. For debates showing sharp attacks on the constitutionality of this legislation see Cong. Globe, 37th Cong., 3d Sess. 952-958. The legislation was subsequently repealed. Rev. Stat. (1878 ed.) 1342, 5596.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 40\n] As the Government points out in its brief on rehearing: \"The clause granting Congress power to make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces was included in the final draft of the Constitution without either discussion or debate. . . . Neither the original draft presented to the convention nor the draft submitted by the `Committee of Detail' contained the clause. 5 Elliot's Debates 130, 379.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 41\n] Most of the benefits received by dependents accompanying servicemen overseas are also enjoyed by those accompanying servicemen in this country - for example, quarters, commissary privileges, medical benefits, free transportation of household effects and so forth.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 42\n] In the Mutiny Acts, first passed in 1688, 1 Will. & Mar., c. 5, the English Parliament reluctantly departed from the Common Law, see note 44, infra, and granted the Army authority in time of peace to try soldiers - initially for only the offenses of mutiny and desertion in time of civil insurrection. In the beginning this limited court-martial jurisdiction was granted only for periods of four months; later it was granted from year to year. See 1 Clode, Military Forces of the Crown, 19-21, 55-61, 76-78, 142-166, 499-501, 519-520. Initially the Mutiny Acts did not apply to the American Colonies. In 1713, Parliament, for the first time, authorized the trial of soldiers by courts-martial during peacetime in the overseas dominions. 12 \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 24]\n\u00a0\n Anne, c. 13, 43; 1 Geo. I, c. 34. See the British War Office, Manual of Military Law (7th ed. 1929), 10-14. For colonial reaction to military trial of soldiers in this country in the period preceding the revolution see text at note 49 and the authorities referred to there. It was not until 1863 that Congress first authorized the trial of soldiers, in wartime, for civil crimes such as murder, arson, rape, etc., by courts-martial. 12 Stat. 736. Previously the soldiers had been turned over to state authorities for trial in state courts. In Coleman v. Tennessee, \n97 \nU.S. 509\n, this Court declined to construe the 1863 statute as depriving civilian courts of a concurrent jurisdiction to try soldiers for crimes. The Court said: \"With the known hostility of the American people to any interference by the military with the regular administration of justice in the civil courts, no such intention should be ascribed to Congress in the absence of clear and direct language to that effect.\" Id., at 514.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 43\n] Washington warned that \"Mercenary Armies . . . have at one time or another subverted the liberties of almost all the Countries they have been raised to defend . . . .\" 26 Writings of Washington (Fitzpatrick ed.) 388. Madison in The Federalist, No. 41, cautioned: \"[T]he liberties of Rome proved the final victim to her military triumphs; and . . . the liberties of Europe, as far as they ever existed, have, with few exceptions, been the price of her military establishments.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 44\n] The Common Law made no distinction between the crimes of soldiers and those of civilians in time of peace. All subjects were tried alike by the same civil courts so \"if a life-guardsman deserted, he could only be sued for breach of contract, and if he struck his officer he was only liable to an indictment or an action of battery.\" 2 Campbell, Lives of the Chief Justices (1st ed. 1849), 91. In time of \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 25]\n\u00a0\n war the Common Law recognized an exception that permitted armies to try soldiers \"in the field.\" The pages of English history are filled with the struggle of the common-law courts and Parliament against the jurisdiction of military tribunals. See, for example, 8 Richard II, c. 5; 13 Richard II, cc. 2, 5; 1 Henry IV, c. 14; 18 Henry VI, c. 19; 3 Car. I, c. 1. See 3 Rushworth, Historical Collections, App. 76-81. During the Middle Ages the Court of the Constable and Marshal exercised jurisdiction over offenses committed by soldiers in time of war and over cases \"of Death or Murder committed beyond the Sea.\" Hale, History and Analysis of the Common Law of England (1st ed. 1713), 37-42. As time passed the jurisdiction of this court was steadily narrowed by Parliament and the common-law courts so that Lord Chief Justice Hale (1609-1676) could write that the court \"has been long disused upon great Reasons.\" Hale, supra, 42. As the Court of the Constable and Marshal fell into disuse and disrepute jurisdiction over soldiers in time of war was assumed by commissions appointed by the King or by military councils. In Mostyn v. Fabrigas, 1 Cowp. 161, at 176, Lord Mansfield observed that \"tradesmen who followed the train [of the British Army at Gibraltar], were not liable to martial law.\" (The distinction between the terms \"martial law\" and \"military law\" is of relatively recent origin. Early writers referred to all trials by military authorities as \"martial law.\")\n\n\n[\nFootnote 45\n] In 1627, the Petition of Right, 3 Car. I, c. 1 (Pickering, Vol. VII, p. 319, 1763) protested: \"nevertheless of late time divers commissions under your Majesty's great seal have issued forth, by which certain persons have been assigned and appointed commissioners with power and authority to proceed within the land, according to the justice of martial law, against such soldiers or mariners, or other dissolute persons joining with them, as should commit any murder, robbery, felony, mutiny or other outrage or misdemeanor whatsoever, and by such summary course and order as is agreeable to martial law, and as is used in armies in time of war, to proceed to the trial and condemnation of \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 26]\n\u00a0\n such offenders, and them to cause to be executed and put to death according to the law martial: .  .  .  .  . \"[Your Majesty's subjects] do therefore humbly pray your most excellent Majesty . . . that the aforesaid commissions, for proceeding by martial law, may be revoked and annulled; and that hereafter no commissions of like nature may issue forth to any person or persons whatsoever to be executed as aforesaid, lest by colour of them any of your Majesty's subjects be destroyed, or put to death contrary to the laws and franchise of the land.\" See also 1 Clode, Military Forces of the Crown, 18-20, 424-425.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 46\n] These Articles are set out in Winthrop, Military Law and Precedents (2d ed., Reprint 1920), 920. James II also removed Lord Chief Justice Herbert and Sir John Holt (later Lord Chief Justice) from the bench for holding that military trials in peacetime were illegal and contrary to the law of the land. See 2 Campbell, Lives of the Chief Justices (1st ed. 1849), 90-93, 129.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 47\n] 1 Will. & Mar., c. 2.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 48\n] 1 Blackstone's Commentaries 413. And Hale in much the same vein wrote: \"First, That in Truth and Reality [martial law] is not a Law, but something indulged rather than allowed as a Law; the Necessity of Government, Order and Discipline in an Army, is that only which can give those Laws a Countenance, . . . . \"Secondly, This indulged Law was only to extend to Members of the Army, or to those of the opposite Army, and never was so much indulged as intended to be (executed or) exercised upon others; for others who were not listed under the Army had no Colour of Reason to be bound by Military Constitutions, applicable only to the Army; whereof they were not Parts, but they were to be order'd and govern'd according to the Laws to which they were subject, though it were a Time of War. \"Thirdly, That the Exercise of Martial Law, whereby any Person should lose his Life or Member, or Liberty, may not be permitted in Time of Peace, when the Kings Courts are open for all Persons to receive Justice, according to the Laws of the Land.\" Hale, History and Analysis of the Common Law of England (1st ed. 1713), 40-41.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 49\n] 1 Wells, The Life and Public Services of Samuel Adams, 231.

In June 1775, General Gage, then Royal Governor of Massachusetts Colony, declared martial law in Boston and its environs.

Declaration of Causes of Taking Up Arms, in 2 American Archieves, Fourth Series (Force ed.), 1865, 1868. In November 1775, Norfolk, Virginia, also was placed under martial law by the Royal Governor. The Virginia Assembly denounced this imposition of the \"most execrable of all systems, the law martial,\" as in \"direct violation of the Constitution, and the laws of this country.\" 4 id., 81-82. And the Constitution adopted by the Provincial Congress of South Carolina on March 26, 1776, protested: \". . . governors and others bearing the royal commission in the colonies [have] . . . dispensed with the law of the land, and substituted the law martial in its stead; . . . .\" Thorpe, The Federal and State Constitutions, 3242.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 50\n] 4 Geo.

We have examined all the cases of military trial of civilians by the \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 34]\n\u00a0\n British or American Armies prior to and contemporaneous with the Constitution that the Government has advanced or that we were able to find by independent research. Without exception these cases appear to have involved trials during wartime in the area of battle - \"in the field\" - or in occupied enemy territory. Even in these areas there are only isolated instances of military trial of \"dependents\" accompanying the armed forces. Apparently the normal method of disciplining camp followers was to expel them from the camp or to take away their ration privileges.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 61\n] Experts on military law, the Judge Advocate General and the Attorney General have repeatedly taken the position that \"in the field\" means in an area of actual fighting. See, e. g., Winthrop, Military Law and Precedents (2d ed., Reprint 1920), 100-102; Davis, Military Law (3d ed. 1915), 478-479; Dudley, Military Law and the Procedures of Courts-Martial (2d ed. 1908), 413-414; 14 Op.

Article 2 (10) of the UCMJ, 50 U.S.C. 552 (10), provides that in time of war persons serving with or accompanying the armed forces in the field are subject to court-martial and military law. We believe that Art. 2 (10) sets forth the maximum historically recognized extent of military jurisdiction over civilians under the concept of \"in the field.\" The Government does not attempt - and quite appropriately so - to support military jurisdiction over Mrs. Smith or Mrs. Covert under Art. 2 (10).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 62\n] Even during time of war the Constitution must be observed. Ex parte Milligan, 4 Wall. 2, at 120, declares: \"The Constitution of the United States is a law for rulers and people, equally in war and in peace, and covers with the shield of its protection all classes of men, at all times, and under all circumstances. No doctrine, involving more pernicious consequences, was ever invented by the wit of man than that any of its provisions can be suspended during any of the great exigencies of government.\" Also see Hamilton v. Kentucky Distilleries Co., \n251 \nU.S. 146, 156\n; United States v. Commodities Trading Corp., \n339 \nU.S. 121, 125\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 63\n] Madsen v. Kinsella, \n343 \nU.S. 341\n, is not controlling here. It concerned trials in enemy territory which had been conquered and held by force of arms and which was being governed at the time by our military forces. In such areas the Army commander can establish military or civilian commissions as an arm of the occupation to try everyone in the occupied area, whether they are connected with the Army or not.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 64\n] Winthrop, Military Law and Precedents (2d ed., Reprint 1920), 107.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 65\n] See Hearings before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Armed Services on S. 857 and H.

The officer who convenes the court-martial also has final authority to determine whether charges will be brought in the first place and to pick the board of inquiry, the prosecutor, the defense counsel, and the law officer who serves as legal adviser to the court-martial.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 66\n] Speaking of the imperative necessity that judges be independent, Hamilton declared: \". . . [L]iberty can have nothing to fear from the judiciary alone, but would have every thing to fear from its union with either of the other departments; . . . nothing can contribute so much to its firmness and independence as permanency in office, this quality \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 37]\n\u00a0\n may therefore be justly regarded as an indispensable ingredient in its constitution, and, in a great measure, as the citadel of the public justice and the public security.\" The Federalist, No. 78.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 67\n] The chief legal officers of the armed services have already recommended to Congress that certain provisions of the UCMJ which were designed to provide protection to an accused should be repealed or limited in the interest of military order and efficiency.

The exception in the Fifth Amendment, of course, provides that grand jury indictment is not required in cases subject to military trial and this exception has been read over into the Sixth Amendment so that the requirements of jury trial are inapplicable. Ex parte Quirin, \n317 \nU.S. 1, 40\n. In Swaim v. United States, \n165 \nU.S. 553\n, this Court held that the President or commanding officer had power to return a case to a court-martial for an \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 38]\n\u00a0\n increase in sentence. If the double jeopardy provisions of the Fifth Amendment were applicable such a practice would be unconstitutional. Cf. Kepner v. United States, \n195 \nU.S. 100\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 69\n] For example, Art. 134, UCMJ, 50 U.S.C. 728 provides: \"Though not specifically mentioned in this [Code], all disorders and neglects to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces, all conduct of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces . . . shall be taken cognizance of . . . and punished at the discretion of [a court-martial].\" In 1942 the Judge Advocate General ruled that a civilian employee of a contractor engaged in construction at an Army base could be tried by court-martial under the predecessor of Article 134 for advising his fellow employees to slow down at their work.

JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, concurring in the result.\n\nThese cases involve the constitutional power of Congress to provide for trial of civilian dependents accompanying members of the armed forces abroad by court-martial in capital cases. The normal method of trial of federal offenses under the Constitution is in a civilian tribunal. Trial of offenses by way of court-martial, with all the characteristics of its procedure so different from the forms and safeguards of procedure in the conventional courts, is an exercise of exceptional jurisdiction, arising from the power granted to Congress in Art. I, 8, cl. 14, of the Constitution of the United States \"To make Rules for the Government and Regulation \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 42]\n\u00a0\n of the land and naval Forces.\" Dynes v. Hoover, 20 How. 65; see Toth v. Quarles, \n350 \nU.S. 11\n; Winthrop, Military Law and Precedents (2d ed. 1896), 52. Article 2 (11) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, 64 Stat. 107, 109, 50 U.S.C. 552 (11), and its predecessors were passed as an exercise of that power, and the agreements with England and Japan recognized that the jurisdiction to be exercised under those agreements was based on the relation of the persons involved to the military forces. See the agreement with Great Britain, 57 Stat. 1193, E. A. S. No. 355, and the United States of America (Visiting Forces) Act, 1942, 5 & 6 Geo. VI, c. 31; and the 1952 Administrative Agreement with Japan, 3 U.S. Treaties and Other International Agreements 3341, T. I. A. S. 2492.\n\nTrial by court-martial is constitutionally permissible only for persons who can, on a fair appraisal, be regarded as falling within the authority given to Congress under Article I to regulate the \"land and naval Forces,\" and who therefore are not protected by specific provisions of Article III and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. It is of course true that, at least regarding the right to a grand jury indictment, the Fifth Amendment is not unmindful of the demands of military discipline.\n1\n Within the scope of appropriate construction, the phrase \"except in cases arising in the land and naval Forces\" has been assumed also to modify the guaranties of speedy and public trial \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 43]\n\u00a0\n by jury. And so, the problem before us is not to be answered by recourse to the literal words of this exception. The cases cannot be decided simply by saying that, since these women were not in uniform, they were not \"in the land and naval Forces.\" The Court's function in constitutional adjudications is not exhausted by a literal reading of words. It may be tiresome, but it is nonetheless vital, to keep our judicial minds fixed on the injunction that \"it is a constitution we are expounding.\" M'Culloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 407. Although Winthrop, in his treatise, states that the Constitution \"clearly distinguishes the military from the civil class as separate communities\" and \"recognizes no third class which is part civil and part military - military for a particular purpose or in a particular situation, and civil for all other purposes and in all other situations . . .,\" Winthrop, Military Law and Precedents (2d ed. 1896), 145, this Court, applying appropriate methods of constitutional interpretation, has long held, and in a variety of situations, that in the exercise of a power specifically granted to it, Congress may sweep in what may be necessary to make effective the explicitly worded power. See Jacob Ruppert v. Caffey, \n251 \nU.S. 264\n, especially 289 et seq.; Purity Extract Co. v. Lynch, \n226 \nU.S. 192, 201\n; Railroad Commission v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. Co., \n257 \nU.S. 563, 588\n. This is the significance of the Necessary and Proper Clause, which is not to be considered so much a separate clause in Art. I, 8, as an integral part of each of the preceding 17 clauses. Only thus may be avoided a strangling literalness in construing a document that is not an enumeration of static rules but the living framework of government designed for an undefined future. M'Culloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316; Hurtado v. California, \n110 \nU.S. 516, 530\n-531.\n\nEverything that may be deemed, as the exercise of an allowable judgment by Congress, to fall fairly within the \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 44]\n\u00a0\n conception conveyed by the power given to Congress \"To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces\" is constitutionally within that legislative grant and not subject to revision by the independent judgment of the Court. To be sure, every event or transaction that bears some relation to \"the land and naval Forces\" does not ipso facto come within the tolerant conception of that legislative grant. The issue in these cases involves regard for considerations not dissimilar to those involved in a determination under the Due Process Clause. Obviously, the practical situations before us bear some relation to the military. Yet the question for this Court is not merely whether the relation of these women to the \"land and naval Forces\" is sufficiently close to preclude the necessity of finding that Congress has been arbitrary in its selection of a particular method of trial. For, although we must look to Art. I, 8, cl. 14, as the immediate justifying power, it is not the only clause of the Constitution to be taken into account. The Constitution is an organic scheme of government to be dealt with as an entirety. A particular provision cannot be dissevered from the rest of the Constitution. Our conclusion in these cases therefore must take due account of Article III and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. We must weigh all the factors involved in these cases in order to decide whether these women dependents are so closely related to what Congress may allowably deem essential for the effective \"Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces\" that they may be subjected to court-martial jurisdiction in these capital cases, when the consequence is loss of the protections afforded by Article III and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.\n\nWe are not concerned here even with the possibility of some alternative non-military type of trial that does \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 45]\n\u00a0\n not contain all the safeguards of Article III and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. We must judge only what has been enacted and what is at issue. It is the power actually asserted by Congress under Art. I, 8, cl. 14, that must now be adjudged in the light of Article III and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. In making this adjudication, I must emphasize that it is only the trial of civilian dependents in a capital case in time of peace that is in question. The Court has not before it, and therefore I need not intimate any opinion on, situations involving civilians, in the sense of persons not having a military status, other than dependents. Nor do we have before us a case involving a non-capital crime. This narrow delineation of the issue is merely to respect the important restrictions binding on the Court when passing on the constitutionality of an Act of Congress. \"In the exercise of that jurisdiction, it is bound by two rules, to which it has rigidly adhered, one, never to anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it; the other never to formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied. These rules are safe guides to sound judgment. It is the dictate of wisdom to follow them closely and carefully.\" Steamship Co. v. Emigration Commissioners, \n113 \nU.S. 33, 39\n.\n\nWe are also not concerned here with the substantive aspects of the grant of power to Congress to \"make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces.\" What conduct should be punished and what constitutes a capital case are matters for congressional discretion, always subject of course to any specific restrictions of the Constitution. These cases involve the validity of procedural conditions for determining the commission of a crime in fact punishable by death. The taking of life is irrevocable. It is in capital cases especially \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 46]\n\u00a0\n that the balance of conflicting interests must be weighted most heavily in favor of the procedural safeguards of the Bill of Rights. Thus, in Powell v. Alabama, \n287 \nU.S. 45, 71\n, the fact \"above all that they stood in deadly peril of their lives\" led the Court to conclude that the defendants had been denied due process by the failure to allow them reasonable time to seek counsel and the failure to appoint counsel. I repeat. I do not mean to imply that the considerations that are controlling in capital cases involving civilian dependents are constitutionally irrelevant in capital cases involving civilians other than dependents or in non-capital cases involving dependents or other civilians. I do say that we are dealing here only with capital cases and civilian dependents.\n\nThe Government asserts that civilian dependents are an integral part of our armed forces overseas and that there is substantial military necessity for subjecting them to court-martial jurisdiction. The Government points out that civilian dependents go abroad under military auspices, live with military personnel in a military community, enjoy the privileges of military facilities, and that their conduct inevitably tends to influence military discipline.\n\nThe prosecution by court-martial for capital crimes committed by civilian dependents of members of the armed forces abroad is hardly to be deemed, under modern conditions, obviously appropriate to the effective exercise of the power to \"make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces\" when it is a question of deciding what power is granted under Article I and therefore what restriction is made on Article III and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. I do not think that the proximity, physical and social, of these women to the \"land and naval Forces\" is, with due regard to all that has been put before us, so clearly demanded by the effective \"Government and Regulation\" \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 47]\n\u00a0\n of those forces as reasonably to demonstrate a justification for court-martial jurisdiction over capital offenses.\n\nThe Government speaks of the \"great potential impact on military discipline\" of these accompanying civilian dependents. This cannot be denied, nor should its implications be minimized. But the notion that discipline over military personnel is to be furthered by subjecting their civilian dependents to the threat of capital punishment imposed by court-martial is too hostile to the reasons that underlie the procedural safeguards of the Bill of Rights for those safeguards to be displaced. It is true that military discipline might be affected seriously if civilian dependents could commit murders and other capital crimes with impunity. No one, however, challenges the availability to Congress of a power to provide for trial and punishment of these dependents for such crimes.\n2\n The method of trial alone is in issue. The Government suggests that, if trial in an Article III court subject to the restrictions of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments is the only alternative, such a trial could not be held abroad practicably, and it would often be equally impracticable to transport all the witnesses back to the United States for trial. But, although there is no need to pass on that issue in this case, trial in the United States is obviously not the only practical alternative and other alternatives may raise different constitutional questions. The Government's own figures for the Army show that the total number of civilians (all civilians \"serving with, employed by, or accompanying the armed forces\" overseas and not merely civilian dependents) for whom general courts-martial for alleged \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 48]\n\u00a0\n murder were deemed advisable\n3\n was only 13 in the 7 fiscal years, 1950-1956. It is impossible to ascertain from the figures supplied to us exactly how many persons were tried for other capital offenses, but the figures indicate that there could not have been many. There is nothing to indicate that the figures for the other services are more substantial. It thus appears to be a manageable problem within the procedural restrictions found necessary by this opinion.\n\nA further argument is made that a decision adverse to the Government would mean that only a foreign trial could be had. Even assuming that the NATO Status of Forces Agreement, 4 U.S. Treaties and Other International Agreements 1792, T. I. A. S. 2846, covering countries where a large part of our armed forces are stationed, gives jurisdiction to the United States only through its military authorities, this Court cannot speculate that any given nation would be unwilling to grant or continue such extraterritorial jurisdiction over civilian dependents in capital cases if they were to be tried by some other manner than court-martial. And, even if such were the case, these civilian dependents would then \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 49]\n\u00a0\n merely be in the same position as are so many federal employees and their dependents and other United States citizens who are subject to the laws of foreign nations when residing there.\n4\n See also the NATO Status of Forces Agreement, supra, Art. VII, 2, 3.\n\nThe Government makes the final argument that these civilian dependents are part of the United States military contingent abroad in the eyes of the foreign nations concerned and that their conduct may have a profound effect on our relations with these countries, with a consequent effect on the military establishment there. But the argument that military court-martials in capital cases are necessitated by this factor assumes either that a military court-martial constitutes a stronger deterrent to this sort of conduct or that, in the absence of such a trial, no punishment would be meted out and our foreign policy thereby injured. The reasons why these considerations carry no conviction have already been indicated.\n\nI therefore conclude that, in capital cases, the exercise of court-martial jurisdiction over civilian dependents in time of peace cannot be justified by Article I, considered in connection with the specific protections of Article III and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.\n\nSince the conclusion thus reached differs from what the Court decided last Term, a decent respect for the judicial process calls for re-examination of the two grounds that then prevailed. The Court sustained its action on the \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 50]\n\u00a0\n authority of the cases dealing with the power of Congress to \"make all needful Rules and Regulations\" for the Territories, reinforced by In re Ross, \n140 \nU.S. 453\n, in which this Court, in 1891, sustained the criminal jurisdiction of a consular court in Japan.\n5\n These authorities grew out of, and related to, specific situations very different from those now here. They do not control or even embarrass the problem before us.\n\nLegal doctrines are not self-generated abstract categories. They do not fall from the sky; nor are they pulled out of it. They have a specific juridical origin and etiology. They derive meaning and content from the circumstances that gave rise to them and from the purposes they were designed to serve. To these they are bound as is a live tree to its roots. Doctrines like those expressed by the Ross case and the series of cases beginning with American Insurance Co. v. Canter, 1 Pet. 511, must be placed in their historical setting. They cannot be wrenched from it and mechanically transplanted into an alien, unrelated context without suffering mutilation or distortion. \"If a precedent involving a black horse is applied to a case involving a white horse, we are not excited. If it were an elephant or an animal ferae naturae or a chose in action, then we would venture into thought. The difference might make a difference. We really are concerned about precedents chiefly when their facts differ somewhat from the facts in the case at bar. Then there is a gulf or hiatus that has to be bridged by a concern for principle and a concern for practical results and practical wisdom.\" Thomas Reed Powell, Vagaries and Varieties in Constitutional Interpretation, \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 51]\n\u00a0\n 36. This attitude toward precedent underlies the whole system of our case law. It was thus summarized by Mr. Justice Brandeis: \"It is a peculiar virtue of our system of law that the process of inclusion and exclusion, so often employed in developing a rule, is not allowed to end with its enunciation and that an expression in an opinion yields later to the impact of facts unforeseen.\" Jaybird Mining Co. v. Weir, \n271 \nU.S. 609, 619\n (dissenting). Especially is this attitude to be observed in constitutional controversies.\n\nThe territorial cases relied on by the Court last Term held that certain specific constitutional restrictions on the Government did not automatically apply in the acquired territories of Florida, Hawaii, the Philippines, or Puerto Rico. In these cases, the Court drew its decisions from the power of Congress to \"make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory . . . belonging to the United States,\" for which provision is made in Art. IV, 3. The United States from time to time acquired lands in which many of our laws and customs found an uncongenial soil because they ill accorded with the history and habits of their people. Mindful of all relevant provisions of the Constitution and not allowing one to frustrate another - which is the guiding thought of this opinion - the Court found it necessary to read Art. IV, 3, together with the Fifth and Sixth Amendments and Article III in the light of those circumstances. The question arose most frequently with respect to the establishment of trial by jury in possessions in which such a system was wholly without antecedents. The Court consistently held with respect to such \"Territory\" that congressional power under Art. IV, 3, was not restricted by the requirement of Art. III, 2, cl. 3, and the Sixth Amendment of providing trial by jury.\n\n \"If the right to trial by jury were a fundamental right which goes wherever the jurisdiction of the \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 52]\n\u00a0\n United States extends, or if Congress, in framing laws for outlying territory belonging to the United States, was obliged to establish that system by affirmative legislation, it would follow that, no matter what the needs or capacities of the people, trial by jury, and in no other way, must be forthwith established, although the result may be to work injustice and provoke disturbance rather than to aid the orderly administration of justice. If the United States, impelled by its duty or advantage, shall acquire territory peopled by savages, and of which it may dispose or not hold for ultimate admission to Statehood, if this doctrine is sound, it must establish there the trial by jury. To state such a proposition demonstrates the impossibility of carrying it into practice. Again, if the United States shall acquire by treaty the cession of territory having an established system of jurisprudence, where jury trials are unknown, but a method of fair and orderly trial prevails under an acceptable and long-established code, the preference of the people must be disregarded, their established customs ignored and they themselves coerced to accept, in advance of incorporation into the United States, a system of trial unknown to them and unsuited to their needs. We do not think it was intended, in giving power to Congress to make regulations for the territories, to hamper its exercise with this condition.\" Dorr v. United States, \n195 \nU.S. 138, 148\n.\n6\n\u00a0\n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 53]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n The \"fundamental right\" test is the one which the Court has consistently enunciated in the long series of cases - e. g., American Ins. Co. v. Canter, 1 Pet. 511; De Lima v. Bidwell, \n182 \nU.S. 1\n; Downes v. Bidwell, \n182 \nU.S. 244\n; Dorr v. United States, \n195 \nU.S. 138\n, Balzac v. Porto Rico, \n258 \nU.S. 298\n - dealing with claims of constitutional restrictions on the power of Congress to \"make all needful Rules and Regulations\" for governing the unincorporated territories. The process of decision appropriate to the problem led to a detailed examination of the relation of the specific \"Territory\" to the United States. This examination, in its similarity to analysis in terms of \"due process,\" is essentially the same as that to be made in the present cases in weighing congressional power to make \"Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces\" against the safeguards of Article III and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.\n\nThe results in the cases that arose by reason of the acquisition of exotic \"Territory\" do not control the present cases, for the territorial cases rest specifically on Art. IV, 3, which is a grant of power to Congress to deal with \"Territory\" and other Government property. Of course the power sought to be exercised in Great Britain and Japan does not relate to \"Territory.\"\n7\n The Court's \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 54]\n\u00a0\n opinions in the territorial cases did not lay down a broad principle that the protective provisions of the Constitution do not apply outside the continental limits of the United States. This Court considered the particular situation in each newly acquired territory to determine whether the grant to Congress of power to govern \"Territory\" was restricted by a specific provision of the Constitution. The territorial cases, in the emphasis put by them on the necessity for considering the specific circumstances of each particular case, are thus relevant in that they provide an illustrative method for harmonizing constitutional provisions which appear, separately considered, to be conflicting.\n\nThe Court last Term relied on a second source of authority, the consular court case, In re Ross, \n140 \nU.S. 453\n. Pursuant to a treaty with Japan, Ross, a British subject but a member of the crew of a United States ship, was tried and convicted in a consular court in Yokohama for murder of a fellow seaman while the ship was in Yokohama harbor. His application for a writ of habeas corpus to a United States Circuit Court was denied, 44 F. 185, and on appeal here, the judgment was affirmed. This Court set forth the ground of the Circuit Court, \"the long and uniform acquiescence by the executive, administrative and legislative departments of the government in the validity of the legislation,\" \n140 \nU.S., at 461\n, and then stated:\n\n \"The Circuit Court might have found an additional ground for not calling in question the legislation of Congress, in the uniform practice of civilized governments for centuries to provide consular tribunals in other than Christian countries . . . for the \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 55]\n\u00a0\n trial of their own subjects or citizens for offences committed in those countries, as well as for the settlement of civil disputes between them; and in the uniform recognition, down to the time of the formation of our government, of the fact that the establishment of such tribunals was among the most important subjects for treaty stipulations. . . .\n\n\n  .  .  .  .   .\n\n\n \"The treaty-making power vested in our government extends to all proper subjects of negotiation with foreign governments. It can, equally with any of the former or present governments of Europe, make treaties providing for the exercise of judicial authority in other countries by its officers appointed to reside therein.\n\n\n \"We do not understand that any question is made by counsel as to its power in this respect. His objection is to the legislation by which such treaties are carried out . . . .\n\n\n \". . . By the Constitution a government is ordained and established `for the United States of America,' and not for countries outside of their limits. The guarantees it affords against accusation of capital or infamous crimes, except by indictment or presentment by a grand jury, and for an impartial trial by a jury when thus accused, apply only to citizens and others within the United States, or who are brought there for trial for alleged offences committed elsewhere, and not to residents or temporary sojourners abroad. . . . The Constitution can have no operation in another country. When, therefore, the representatives or officers of our government are permitted to exercise authority of any kind in another country, it must be on such conditions as the two countries may agree, the laws of neither one being obligatory upon the other. The deck of a private \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 56]\n\u00a0\n American vessel, it is true, is considered for many purposes constructively as territory of the United States, yet persons on board of such vessels, whether officers, sailors, or passengers, cannot invoke the protection of the provisions referred to until brought within the actual territorial boundaries of the United States. . . .\" \n140 \nU.S., at 462\n-464.\n\n\n One observation should be made at the outset about the grounds for decision in Ross. Insofar as the opinion expressed a view that the Constitution is not operative outside the United States - and apparently Mr. Justice Field meant by \"United States\" all lands over which the United States flag flew, see John W. Burgess, How May the United States Govern Its Extra-Continental Territory?, 14 Pol. Sci. Q.1 (1899) - it expressed a notion that has long since evaporated. Governmental action abroad is performed under both the authority and the restrictions of the Constitution - for example, proceedings before American military tribunals, whether in Great Britain or in the United States, are subject to the applicable restrictions of the Constitution. See opinions in Burns v. Wilson, \n346 \nU.S. 137\n.\n\nThe significance of the Ross case and its relevance to the present cases cannot be assessed unless due regard is accorded the historical context in which that case was decided. Ross is not rooted in any abstract principle or comprehensive theory touching constitutional power or its restrictions. It was decided with reference to a very particular, practical problem with a long history. To be mindful of this does not attribute to Mr. Justice Field's opinion some unavowed historical assumption. On behalf of the whole Court, he spelled out the considerations that controlled it:\n\n \"The practice of European governments to send officers to reside in foreign countries, authorized to \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 57]\n\u00a0\n exercise a limited jurisdiction over vessels and seamen of their country, to watch the interests of their countrymen and to assist in adjusting their disputes and protecting their commerce, goes back to a very early period, even preceding what are termed the Middle Ages. . . . In other than Christian countries they were, by treaty stipulations, usually clothed with authority to hear complaints against their countrymen and to sit in judgment upon them when charged with public offences. After the rise of Islamism, and the spread of its followers over eastern Asia and other countries bordering on the Mediterranean, the exercise of this judicial authority became a matter of great concern. The intense hostility of the people of Moslem faith to all other sects, and particularly to Christians, affected all their intercourse, and all proceedings had in their tribunals. Even the rules of evidence adopted by them placed those of different faith on unequal grounds in any controversy with them. For this cause, and by reason of the barbarous and cruel punishments inflicted in those countries, and the frequent use of torture to enforce confession from parties accused, it was a matter of deep interest to Christian governments to withdraw the trial of their subjects, when charged with the commission of a public offence, from the arbitrary and despotic action of the local officials. Treaties conferring such jurisdiction upon these consuls were essential to the peaceful residence of Christians within those countries and the successful prosecution of commerce with their people.\" \n140 \nU.S., at 462\n-463.\n\n\n \"It is true that the occasion for consular tribunals in Japan may hereafter be less than at present, as every year that country progresses in civilization and in the assimilation of its system of judicial procedure \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 58]\n\u00a0\n to that of Christian countries, as well as in the improvement of its penal statutes; but the system of consular tribunals . . . is of the highest importance, and their establishment in other than Christian countries, where our people may desire to go in pursuit of commerce, will often be essential for the protection of their persons and property.\" Id., at 480.\n8\n\u00a0\n\n\n It is important to have a lively sense of this background before attempting to draw on the Ross case. Historians have traced grants of extraterritorial rights as far back as the permission given by Egypt in the 12th or 13th century B. C. to the merchants of Tyre to establish factories on the Nile and to live under their own law and practice their own religion. Numerous other instances of persons living under their own law in foreign lands existed in the later pre-Christian era and during the Roman Empire and the so-called Dark and Middle Ages - Greeks in \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 59]\n\u00a0\n Egypt, all sorts of foreigners in Rome, inhabitants of Christian cities and states in the Byzantine Empire, the Latin kingdoms of the Levant, and other Christian cities and states, Mohammedans in the Byzantine Empire and China, and many others lived in foreign lands under their own law. While the origins of this extraterritorial jurisdiction may have differed in each country, the notion that law was for the benefit of the citizens of a country and its advantages not for foreigners appears to have been an important factor. Thus, there existed a long-established custom of extraterritorial jurisdiction at the beginning of the 15th century when the complete conquest of the Byzantine Empire by the Turks and the establishment of the Ottoman Empire substantially altered political relations between Christian Europe and the Near East. But commercial relations continued, and in 1535 Francis I of France negotiated a treaty with Suleiman I of Turkey that provided for numerous extraterritorial rights, including criminal and civil jurisdiction over all disputes among French subjects. 1 Ernest Charriere, Negociations de la France dans le Levant 283. Other nations and eventually the United States in 1830, 8 Stat. 408, later negotiated similar treaties with the Turks. (For a more complete history of the development of extraterritorial rights and consular jurisdiction see 1 Calvo, Le Droit International Theorique et Pratique (5th ed., Rousseau, 1896), 2-18, 2 id., 9-12; Hinckley, American Consular Jurisdiction in the Orient, 1-9; 1 Miltitz, Manuel des Consuls passim; Ravndal, The Origin of the Capitulations and of the Consular Institution, S.

No longer were strangers to be denied the advantages of local law. Indeed, territorial sovereignty meant the exercise of sovereignty over all residents within the borders of the state, and the system of extraterritorial consular jurisdiction tended to die out among Christian nations in the 18th and 19th centuries. But a new justification was found for the continuation of that jurisdiction in those countries whose systems of justice were considered inferior, and it was this strong feeling with respect to Moslem and Far Eastern countries that was reflected, as we have seen, in the Ross opinion.\n\nUntil 1842, China had asserted control over all foreigners within its territory, Shih Shun Liu, op. cit. supra, 76-89, but, as a result of the Opium War, Great Britain negotiated a treaty with China whereby she obtained consular offices in five open ports and was granted extraterritorial rights over her citizens. On July 3, 1844, Caleb Cushing negotiated a similar treaty on behalf of the United States. 8 Stat. 592. In a letter to Secretary of State Calhoun, he explained: \"I entered China with the formed general conviction that the United States ought not to concede to any foreign state, under any circumstances, jurisdiction over the life and liberty of a citizen of the United States, unless that foreign state be of our own family of nations, - in a word, a Christian state.\" Quoted in 7 Op. Atty. Gen. 495, 496-497. Later treaties continued the extraterritorial rights of the United States, and the Treaty of 1903 contained the following article demonstrating the purpose of those rights:\n\n \"The Government of China having expressed a strong desire to reform its judicial system and to bring it into accord with that of Western nations, the \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 61]\n\u00a0\n United States agrees to give every assistance to such reform and will also be prepared to relinquish extraterritorial rights when satisfied that the state of the Chinese laws, the arrangements for their administration, and other considerations warrant it in doing so.\" 33 Stat. 2208, 2215.\n\n\n The first treaty with Japan was negotiated by Commodore Perry in 1854. 11 Stat. 597. It opened two ports, but did not provide for any exercise of judicial powers by United States officials. Under the Treaty of 1857, 11 Stat. 723, such power was given, and later treaties, which opened up further Japanese cities for trade and residence by United States citizens, retained these rights. The treaty of 1894, effective on July 17, 1899, however, ended these extraterritorial rights and Japan, even though a \"non-Christian\" nation, came to occupy the same status as Christian nations. 29 Stat. 848. The exercise of criminal jurisdiction by consuls over United States citizens was also provided for, at one time or another, in treaties with Borneo, 10 Stat. 909, 910; Siam, 11 Stat. 683, 684; Madagascar, 15 Stat. 491, 492; Samoan Islands, 20 Stat. 704; Korea, 23 Stat. 720, 721; Tonga Islands, 25 Stat. 1440, 1442, and, by virtue of most-favored-nation clauses, in treaties with Tripoli, 8 Stat. 154; Persia, 11 Stat. 709; the Congo, 27 Stat. 926; and Ethiopia, 33 Stat. 2254. The exercise of criminal jurisdiction was also provided for in a treaty with Morocco, 8 Stat. 100, by virtue of a most-favored-nation clause and by virtue of a clause granting jurisdiction if \"any . . . citizens of the United States . . . shall have any disputes with each other.\" The word \"disputes\" has been interpreted by the International Court of Justice to comprehend criminal as well as civil disputes. France v. United States, I. C. J. Reports 1952, pp. 176, 188-189. The treaties with Algiers, 8 Stat. 133, 224, 244; Tunis, 8 Stat. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 62]\n\u00a0\n 157; and Muscat, 8 Stat. 458, contained similar \"disputes\" clauses.\n9\n\u00a0\n\nThe judicial power exercised by consuls was defined by statute and was sweeping:\n\n \"Jurisdiction in both criminal and civil matters shall, in all cases, be exercised and enforced in conformity with the laws of the United States, which are hereby, so far as is necessary to execute such treaties, respectively, and so far as they are suitable to carry the same into effect, extended over all citizens of the United States in those countries, and over all others to the extent that the terms of the treaties, respectively, justify or require. But in all cases where such laws are not adapted to the object, or are deficient in the provisions necessary to furnish suitable remedies, the common law and the law of equity and admiralty shall be extended in like manner over such citizens and others in those countries; and if neither the common law, nor the law of equity or admiralty, nor the statutes of the United States, furnish appropriate and sufficient remedies, the ministers in those countries, respectively, shall, by decrees and regulations which shall have the force of law, supply such defects and deficiencies.\" Rev. Stat. 4086.\n\n\n The consuls, then, exercised not only executive and judicial power, but legislative power as well.\n\nThe number of people subject to the jurisdiction of these courts during their most active periods appears to \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 63]\n\u00a0\n have been fairly small. In the Chronicle & Directory for China, Japan, & the Philippines, for the year 1870, there is a listing of the total number of foreign, not just United States, residents in these three places. The list is 81 pages long, with a total of some 4,500 persons. (Pp. 54-134.) This same publication gives the following information about Japan: \"The number of foreigners settled in Japan is as yet very small. At the end of the year 1862, the foreign community at Kanagawa, the principal of the three ports of Japan open to aliens, consisted of . . . thirty-eight Americans . . . and in the latter part of 1864 the permanent foreign residents at Kanagawa had increased to 300, not counting soldiers, of which number . . . about 80 [were] Americans . . . . At Nagasaki, the second port of Japan thrown open to foreign trade by the government, the number of alien settlers was as follows on the 1st of January, 1866: - . . . American citizens 32 . . . . A third port opened to European and American traders, that of Hakodadi, in the north of Japan, was deserted, after a lengthened trial, by nearly all the foreign merchants settled there . . . .\" (Appendix, p. 353.) The Statesman's Yearbook of 1890 shows: China at the end of 1888: 1,020 Americans (p. 411); Japan in 1887: 711 Americans (p. 709); Morocco, 1889 estimate: \"The number of Christians is very small, not exceeding 1,500.\" (P. 739.) The Statesman's Yearbook of 1901 shows: China at the end of 1899: 2,335 Americans (p. 484); Japan, December 31, 1898, just before the termination of our extraterritorial rights: 1,165 Americans (p. 809); Morocco: \"The number of Christians does not exceed 6,000; the Christian population of Tangier alone probably amounts to 5,000.\" (P. 851.) These figures of course do not include those civilians temporarily in the country coming within consular jurisdiction. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 64]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe consular court jurisdiction, then, was exercised in countries whose legal systems at the time were considered so inferior that justice could not be obtained in them by our citizens. The existence of these courts was based on long-established custom and they were justified as the best possible means for securing justice for the few Americans present in those countries. The Ross case, therefore, arose out of, and rests on, very special, confined circumstances, and cannot be applied automatically to the present situation, involving hundreds of thousands of American citizens in countries with civilized systems of justice. If Congress had established consular courts or some other non-military procedure for trial that did not contain all the protections afforded by Article III and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments for the trial of civilian dependents of military personnel abroad, we would be forced to a detailed analysis of the situation of the civilian dependent population abroad in deciding whether the Ross case should be extended to cover such a case. It is not necessary to do this in the present cases in view of our decision that the form of trial here provided cannot constitutionally be justified.\n\nThe Government, apparently recognizing the constitutional basis for the decision in Ross, has, on rehearing, sought to show that civilians in general and civilian dependents in particular have been subject to military order and discipline ever since the colonial period. The materials it has submitted seem too episodic, too meager, to form a solid basis in history, preceding and contemporaneous with the framing of the Constitution, for constitutional adjudication. What has been urged on us falls far too short of proving a well-established practice - to be deemed to be infused into the Constitution - of court-martial jurisdiction, certainly not in capital cases, over such civilians in time of peace.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces . . . .\" Article 2 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice provides: \"The following persons are subject to this code: . . . (11) Subject to the provisions of any treaty or agreement to which the United States is or may be a party or to any accepted rule of international law, all persons serving with, employed by, or accompanying the armed forces without the continental limits of the United States . . . .\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Article III, 2, cl. 3, provides that \"The Trial of all Crimes . . . when not committed within any State . . . shall be at such Place or Places as the Congress may by Law have directed.\" Since 1790, 1 Stat. 113-114, Congress has provided for such trial in the district where the offender is found (apprehended) or first brought. See 18 U.S.C. 3238.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Under Article 19 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, 64 Stat. 114, 50 U.S.C. 579, a special court-martial may impose any punishment not forbidden by the Code \"except death, dishonorable discharge, dismissal, confinement in excess of six months, hard labor without confinement in excess of three months, forfeiture of pay exceeding two-thirds pay per month, or forfeiture of pay for a period exceeding six months.\" Under Art. 20, 64 Stat. 114, 50 U.S.C. 580, a summary court-martial may impose any punishment not forbidden by the Code \"except death, dismissal, dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge, confinement in excess of one month, hard labor without confinement in excess of forty-five days, restriction to certain specified limits in excess of two months, or forfeiture of pay in excess of two-thirds of one month's pay.\" In order to impose a punishment in excess of these limits, a general court-martial must be convened under Art. 18, 64 Stat. 114, 50 U.S.C. 578.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] A Report of the Joint Committee on Reduction of Nonessential Federal Expenditures on Federal Personnel and Pay indicates that the executive agencies of the Federal Government, excluding the Department of Defense, alone employed 51,027 persons outside the continental United States in February 1957, excluding employees of the Panama Canal. S. Com. Print No. 157, 85th Cong., 1st Sess. Although these figures include \"some foreign nationals,\" they nevertheless indicate a substantial number of United States citizens subject to foreign law. See 103 Cong. Rec. 5313-5316.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Having based the constitutionality of Article 2 (11) on these grounds, the Court concluded, \"we have no need to examine the power of Congress `To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces' under Article I of the Constitution.\" \n351 \nU.S. 470, 476\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] In Hawaii v. Mankichi, \n190 \nU.S. 197\n, the Court rested its decision on an interpretation of the joint resolution of Congress annexing the Hawaiian Islands. The Court held that the act of annexation did not of its own force require indictment by grand jury and a trial by a Sixth Amendment jury. Implicit in this holding was the assumption that such indictment and trial were not constitutionally required in Hawaii. This assumption was based on a recognition \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 53]\n\u00a0\n that the act should not be construed as \"imposing upon the islands every provision of a Constitution, which must have been unfamiliar to a large number of their inhabitants, and for which no previous preparation had been made . . . .\" Id., at 215-216.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] For a statement of the applicable law before the question arose with respect to lands outside the continental limits of the United States, see Thompson v. Utah, \n170 \nU.S. 343, 347\n: \"It is equally beyond question that the provisions of the National Constitution relating to trials by jury for crimes and to criminal prosecutions apply to the Territories of the United States.\" But see Mormon Church v. United States, \n136 \nU.S. 1, 44\n: \"Doubtless Congress, in legislating for the Territories would be subject to those fundamental limitations in favor of personal rights which are formulated in the \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 54]\n\u00a0\n Constitution and its amendments; but these limitations would exist rather by inference and the general spirit of the Constitution from which Congress derives all its powers, than by any express and direct application of its provisions.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] This feeling about the \"non-Christian\" nations of the world was widely shared. In his \"Jubilee of the Constitution,\" delivered on the 50th anniversary of the inauguration of George Washington, John Quincy Adams said: \"The Declaration of Independence recognised the European law of nations, as practised among Christian nations, to be that by which they considered themselves bound, and of which they claimed the rights. This system is founded upon the principle, that the state of nature between men and between nations, is a state of peace. But there was a Mahometan law of nations, which considered the state of nature as a state of war - an Asiatic law of nations, which excluded all foreigners from admission within the territories of the state . . . . With all these different communities, the relations of the United States were from the time when they had become an independent nation, variously modified according to the operation of those various laws. It was the purpose of the Constitution of the United States to establish justice over them all.\" Adams, Jubilee of the Constitution, 73. See also the views of Secretary of State Hamilton Fish, quoted in \n351 \nU.S., at 484\n-485.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] On August 1, 1956, the President approved Public Law 856, 84th Cong., 2d Sess., providing for the relinquishment by the President, at such time as he deemed appropriate, of the consular jurisdiction of the United States in Morocco, the only foreign country where United States consuls continued to exercise such jurisdiction. 70 Stat. 773. The jurisdiction was relinquished on October 6, 1956. N. Y. Times, Oct. 8, 1956, p. 1, col. 6. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 65]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, concurring in the result.\n\nI concur in the result, on the narrow ground that where the offense is capital, Article 2 (11)\n1\n cannot constitutionally be applied to the trial of civilian dependents of members of the armed forces overseas in times of peace.\n\nSince I am the only one among today's majority who joined in the Court's opinions of June 11, 1956, which sustained the court-martial jurisdiction in these cases, \n351 \nU.S. 470, 487\n, I think it appropriate to state the reasons which led to my voting, first, to rehear these cases, \n352 \nU.S. 901\n, and, now, to strike down that jurisdiction.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nThe petitions for rehearing which were filed last summer afforded an opportunity for a greater degree of reflection upon the difficult issues involved in these cases than, at least for me, was possible in the short interval between the argument and decision of the cases in the closing days of last Term.\n2\n As a result I became satisfied that this court-martial jurisdiction could in any event not be sustained upon the reasoning of our prior opinion. In essence, that reasoning was this: (1) Under In re Ross, \n140 \nU.S. 453\n, and the Insular Cases,\n3\n the requirement of a trial by an Article III court and the other specific safeguards of Article III and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments are not applicable to the trial of American citizens outside the United States; (2) there is thus no express constitutional prohibition against the use of courts-martial \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 66]\n\u00a0\n for such trials abroad; (3) the choice of a court-martial in cases such as these was \"reasonable,\" because of these women's connection with the military, and therefore satisfied due process; (4) the court-martial jurisdiction was thus constitutional. I have since concluded that this analysis was not sound, for two reasons:\n\n(1) The underlying premise of the prior opinion, it seems to me, is that under the Constitution the mere absence of a prohibition against an asserted power, plus the abstract reasonableness of its use, is enough to establish the existence of the power. I think this is erroneous. The powers of Congress, unlike those of the English Parliament, are constitutionally circumscribed. Under the Constitution Congress has only such powers as are expressly granted or those that are implied as reasonably necessary and proper to carry out the granted powers. Hence the constitutionality of the statute here in question must be tested, not by abstract notions of what is reasonable \"in the large,\" so to speak, but by whether the statute, as applied in these instances, is a reasonably necessary and proper means of implementing a power granted to Congress by the Constitution. To say that the validity of the statute may be rested upon the inherent \"sovereign powers\" of this country in its dealings with foreign nations seems to me to be no more than begging the question. As I now see it, the validity of this court-martial jurisdiction must depend upon whether the statute, as applied to these women, can be justified as an exercise of the power, granted to Congress by Art. I, 8, cl. 14 of the Constitution, \"To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces.\" I can find no other constitutional power to which this statute can properly be related. I therefore think that we were wrong last Term in considering that we need not decide \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 67]\n\u00a0\n the case in terms of the Article I power. In my opinion that question squarely confronts us.\n\n(2) I also think that we were mistaken in interpreting Ross and the Insular Cases as standing for the sweeping proposition that the safeguards of Article III and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments automatically have no application to the trial of American citizens outside the United States, no matter what the circumstances. Aside from the questionable wisdom of mortgaging the future by such a broad pronouncement, I am satisfied that our prior holding swept too lightly over the historical context in which this Court upheld the jurisdiction of the old consular and territorial courts in those cases. I shall not repeat what my brother FRANKFURTER has written on this subject, with which I agree. But I do not go as far as my brother BLACK seems to go on this score. His opinion, if I understand it correctly, in effect discards Ross and the Insular Cases as historical anomalies. I believe that those cases, properly understood, still have vitality, and that, for reasons suggested later, which differ from those given in our prior opinions, they have an important bearing on the question now before us.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nI come then to the question whether this court-martial jurisdiction can be justified as an exercise of Congress' Article I power to regulate the armed forces.\n\nAt the outset, I cannot accept the implication of my brother BLACK'S opinion that this Article I power was intended to be unmodified by the Necessary and Proper Clause of the Constitution,\n4\n and that therefore this power \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 68]\n\u00a0\n is incapable of expansion under changing circumstances. The historical evidence, in fact, shows quite the opposite. True, the records of the time indicate that the Founders shared a deep fear of an unchecked military branch. But what they feared was a military branch unchecked by the legislature, and susceptible of use by an arbitrary executive power.\n5\n So far as I know, there is no evidence at all that the Founders intended to limit the power of the people, as embodied in the legislature, to make such laws in the regulation of the land and naval forces as are necessary to the proper functioning of those forces. In other words, there is no indication that any special limitation on the power of Congress, as opposed to the power of the executive, was subsumed in the grant of power to govern the land and naval forces. Alexander Hamilton, indeed, stated exactly the opposite:\n6\n\u00a0\n\n \"The authorities essential to the common defense are these: to raise armies; to build and equip fleets; to prescribe rules for the government of both; to direct their operations; to provide for their support. These powers ought to exist without limitation, because it is impossible to foresee or define the extent and variety of national exigencies, or the correspondent extent and variety of the means which may be necessary to satisfy them. The circumstances that endanger the safety of nations are infinite, and for this reason no constitutional shackles can wisely be \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 69]\n\u00a0\n imposed on the power to which the care of it is committed. This power ought to be coextensive with all the possible combinations of such circumstances; and ought to be under the direction of the same councils which are appointed to preside over the common defense.\n\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \". . . Shall the Union be constituted the guardian of the common safety? Are fleets and armies and revenues necessary to this purpose? The government of the Union must be empowered to pass all laws, and to make all regulations which have relation to them. . . .\n\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \"Every view we may take of the subject, as candid inquirers after truth, will serve to convince us, that it is both unwise and dangerous to deny the federal government an unconfined authority, as to all those objects which are intrusted to its management. . . . A government, the constitution of which renders it unfit to be trusted with all the powers which a free people ought to delegate to any government, would be an unsafe and improper depositary of the national interests. Wherever these can with propriety be confided, the coincident powers may safely accompany them.\"\n\n\n No less an authority than Chief Justice Marshall, in McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, has taught us that the Necessary and Proper Clause is to be read with all the powers of Congress, so that \"where the law is not prohibited, and is really calculated to effect any of the objects entrusted to the government, to undertake here to inquire into the degree of its necessity, would be to pass the line which circumscribes the judicial department, and to tread on legislative ground.\" Id., at 423. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 70]\n\u00a0\n\n\nI think it no answer to say, as my brother BLACK does, that \"having run up against the steadfast bulwark of the Bill of Rights, the Necessary and Proper Clause cannot extend the scope of [Art. I] Clause 14.\" For that simply begs the question as to whether there is such a collision, an issue to which I address myself below.\n\nFor analytical purposes, I think it useful to break down the issue before us into two questions: First, is there a rational connection between the trial of these army wives by court-martial and the power of Congress to make rules for the governance of the land and naval forces; in other words, is there any initial power here at all? Second, if there is such a rational connection, to what extent does this statute, though reasonably calculated to subserve an enumerated power, collide with other express limitations on congressional power; in other words, can this statute, however appropriate to the Article I power looked at in isolation, survive against the requirements of Article III and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments? I recognize that these two questions are ultimately one and the same, since the scope of the Article I power is not separable from the limitations imposed by Article III and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. Nevertheless I think it will make for clarity of analysis to consider them separately.\n\n\nA.\n\n\n\nI assume, for the moment, therefore, that we may disregard other limiting provisions of the Constitution, and examine the Article I power in isolation. So viewed, I do not think the courts-martial of these army wives can be said to be an arbitrary extension of congressional power.\n\nIt is suggested that historically the Article I power was intended to embody a rigid and unchangeable self-limitation, namely, that it could apply only to those \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 71]\n\u00a0\n in the actual service of the armed forces.\n7\n I cannot agree that this power has any such rigid content. First of all, the historical evidence presented by the Government convinces me that, at the time of the adoption of the Constitution, military jurisdiction was not thought to be rigidly limited to uniformed personnel. The fact is that it was traditional for \"retainers to the camp\" to be subjected to military discipline, that civilian dependents encamped with the armies were traditionally regarded as being in that class, and that the concept was not strictly limited to times of war.\n8\n Indeed, the British, who are no less sensitive than we to maintaining the supremacy of civil justice, have recently enacted a law comparable to the statute involved here.\n9\n\u00a0\n\nThinking, as I do, that Article I, still taking it in isolation, must be viewed as supplemented by the Necessary and Proper Clause, I cannot say that the court-martial jurisdiction here involved has no rational connection with the stated power. The Government, it seems to me, has \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 72]\n\u00a0\n made a strong showing that the court-martial of civilian dependents abroad has a close connection to the proper and effective functioning of our overseas military contingents. There is no need to detail here the various aspects of this connection, which have been well dealt with in the dissenting opinion of my brother CLARK. Suffice it to say that to all intents and purposes these civilian dependents are part of the military community overseas,\n10\n are so regarded by the host country, and must be subjected to the same discipline if the military commander is to have the power to prevent activities which would jeopardize the security and effectiveness of his command.\n11\n The matter has been well summarized by General Palmer, Commander of the Eighth Army, stationed in Japan:\n\n \"Jurisdiction by courts-martial over all civilians accompanying the Army overseas is essential because of the manner in which U.S. Armed Forces personnel \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 73]\n\u00a0\n live in their overseas military communities. In this command, almost all personnel serving in or accompanying the U.S. Armed Forces live in or near separate, closely-knit U.S. military communities which are basically under the control, administration and supervision of the local U.S. Commander who is in turn responsive to the normal military chain of command. This responsibility which is vested in the military commander extends to the administration and supervision of the operation and use of all facilities and major activities of the community including the proper control of occupants and users which is inherent in such supervision overseas. In the absence of a supporting judicial system responsive to the same government as the military, such as is the case existing in the United States and overseas possessions, and as the law enforcement requirement stems primarily from the immediate unalterable responsibilities of the overseas commander and his subordinate commanders, it is essential that the commander be vested with the law enforcement authority commensurate with his responsibilities.\"\n\n\n It seems to me clear on such a basis that these dependents, when sent overseas by the Government, become pro tanto a part of the military community. I cannot say, therefore, that it is irrational or arbitrary for Congress to subject them to military discipline. I do not deal now, of course, with the problem of alternatives to court-martial jurisdiction; all that needs to be established at this stage is that, viewing Art. I, 8, cl. 14 in isolation, subjection of civilian dependents overseas to court-martial jurisdiction can in no wise be deemed unrelated to the power of Congress to make all necessary and proper laws to insure the effective governance of our overseas land and naval forces. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 74]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nB.\n\n\n\nI turn now to the other side of the coin. For no matter how practical and how reasonable this jurisdiction might be, it still cannot be sustained if the Constitution guarantees to these army wives a trial in an Article III court, with indictment by grand jury and jury trial as provided by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.\n\nWe return, therefore, to the Ross question: to what extent do these provisions of the Constitution apply outside the United States?\n\nAs I have already stated, I do not think that it can be said that these safeguards of the Constitution are never operative without the United States, regardless of the particular circumstances. On the other hand, I cannot agree with the suggestion that every provision of the Constitution must always be deemed automatically applicable to American citizens in every part of the world. For Ross and the Insular Cases do stand for an important proposition, one which seems to me a wise and necessary gloss on our Constitution. The proposition is, of course, not that the Constitution \"does not apply\" overseas, but that there are provisions in the Constitution which do not necessarily apply in all circumstances in every foreign place. In other words, it seems to me that the basic teaching of Ross and the Insular Cases is that there is no rigid and abstract rule that Congress, as a condition precedent to exercising power over Americans overseas, must exercise it subject to all the guarantees of the Constitution, no matter what the conditions and considerations are that would make adherence to a specific guarantee altogether impracticable and anomalous. To take but one example: Balzac v. Porto Rico, \n258 \nU.S. 298\n, is not good authority for the proposition that jury trials need never be provided for American citizens tried by \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 75]\n\u00a0\n the United States abroad; but the case is good authority for the proposition that there is no rigid rule that jury trial must always be provided in the trial of an American overseas, if the circumstances are such that trial by jury would be impractical and anomalous. In other words, what Ross and the Insular Cases hold is that the particular local setting, the practical necessities, and the possible alternatives are relevant to a question of judgment, namely, whether jury trial should be deemed a necessary condition of the exercise of Congress' power to provide for the trial of Americans overseas.\n\nI think the above thought is crucial in approaching the cases before us. Decision is easy if one adopts the constricting view that these constitutional guarantees as a totality do or do not \"apply\" overseas. But, for me, the question is which guarantees of the Constitution should apply in view of the particular circumstances, the practical necessities, and the possible alternatives which Congress had before it. The question is one of judgment, not of compulsion. And so I agree with my brother FRANKFURTER that, in view of Ross and the Insular Cases, we have before us a question analogous, ultimately, to issues of due process; one can say, in fact, that the question of which specific safeguards of the Constitution are appropriately to be applied in a particular context overseas can be reduced to the issue of what process is \"due\" a defendant in the particular circumstances of a particular case.\n\nOn this basis, I cannot agree with the sweeping proposition that a full Article III trial, with indictment and trial by jury, is required in every case for the trial of a civilian dependent of a serviceman overseas. The Government, it seems to me, has made an impressive showing that at least for the run-of-the-mill offenses committed by dependents overseas, such a requirement would \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 76]\n\u00a0\n be as impractical and as anomalous as it would have been to require jury trial for Balzac in Porto Rico.\n12\n Again, I need not go into details, beyond stating that except for capital offenses, such as we have here, to which, in my opinion, special considerations apply, I am by no means ready to say that Congress' power to provide for trial by court-martial of civilian dependents overseas is limited by Article III and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 77]\n\u00a0\n Where, if at all, the dividing line should be drawn among cases not capital, need not now be decided. We are confronted here with capital offenses alone; and it seems to me particularly unwise now to decide more than we have to. Our far-flung foreign military establishments are a new phenomenon in our national life, and I think it would be unfortunate were we unnecessarily to foreclose, as my four brothers would do, our future consideration of the broad questions involved in maintaining the effectiveness of these national outposts, in the light of continuing experience with these problems.\n\nSo far as capital cases are concerned, I think they stand on quite a different footing than other offenses. In such cases the law is especially sensitive to demands for that procedural fairness which inheres in a civilian trial where the judge and trier of fact are not responsive to the command of the convening authority. I do not concede that whatever process is \"due\" an offender faced with a fine or a prison sentence necessarily satisfies the requirements of the Constitution in a capital case. The distinction is by no means novel, compare Powell v. Alabama, \n287 \nU.S. 45\n, with Betts v. Brady, \n316 \nU.S. 455\n; nor is it negligible, being literally that between life and death. And, under what I deem to be the correct view of Ross and the Insular Cases, it is precisely the kind of distinction which plays a large role in the process of weighing the competing considerations which lead to sound judgment upon the question whether certain safeguards of the Constitution should be given effect in the trial of an American citizen abroad. In fact, the Government itself has conceded that one grave offense, treason, presents a special case: \"The gravity of this offense is such that we can well assume that, whatever difficulties may be involved in trial far from the scene of the offense . . . the trial should be in our courts.\" I see no reason for not applying the same principle to any case where a civilian \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 78]\n\u00a0\n dependent stands trial on pain of life itself. The number of such cases would appear to be so negligible that the practical problems of affording the defendant a civilian trial would not present insuperable problems.\n\nOn this narrow ground I concur in the result in these cases.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 50 U.S.C. 552 (11).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The cases were argued on May 3, 1956, and decided on June 11, 1956.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Downes v. Bidwell, \n182 \nU.S. 244\n; Hawaii v. Mankichi, \n190 \nU.S. 197\n; Dorr v. United States, \n195 \nU.S. 138\n; Balzac v. Porto Rico, \n258 \nU.S. 298\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Article I, 8, cl. 18 of the Constitution provides that Congress shall have the power \"to make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Thus, proposals to limit the size of the standing army in times of peace to a specific number of men in the Constitution were defeated at the Constitutional Convention. See 5 Elliot's Debates 442-443 (\"no room for . . . distrust of the representatives of the people\"). See also The Federalist, No. 24: \"[T]he whole power of raising armies was lodged in the Legislature, not in the Executive; . . . this legislature was to be a popular body, consisting of the representatives of the people periodically elected . . . .\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The Federalist, No. 23.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] To be sure, the opinion does \"recognize that there might be circumstances where a person could be `in' the armed services for purposes of [Art. I, 8] Clause 14 even though he had not formally been inducted into the military or did not wear a uniform.\" It continues, however, to state categorically that \"wives, children and other dependents of servicemen cannot be placed in that category . . . .\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] The essential element was thought to be, not so much that there be war, in the technical sense, but rather that the forces and their retainers be \"in the field.\" The latter concept, in turn, would seem to have extended to any area where the nature of the military position and the absence of civil authority made military control over the whole camp appropriate. See, in general, Blumenthal, Women Camp Followers of the American Revolution. The British history is the same. See, in particular, Samuel, Historical Account of the British Army and of the Law Military, pp. 691-692.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Army Act, 1955, 3 & 4 Eliz. II, c. 18, 209; and see Fifth Schedule, id., at 219.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] These dependents are taken abroad only because their presence is deemed necessary to the morale and proper functioning of our armies overseas. They are transported at government expense, carry passports identifying them as service dependents, are admitted to the host country without visas, use military payment certificates, and receive the benefit of army postal facilities and privileges. They enjoy the tax exemptions and customs benefits of the military. They are treated at service hospitals, their children go to schools maintained by the Government, and they share with the military the recreational facilities provided by the Government. They are housed and furnished heat, light, fuel, water, and telephone service by the military, as well as receiving transportation, food, and clothing from military sources.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] This necessity is particularly acute with regard to peculiarly \"military\" and \"local\" offenses which must be dealt with swiftly and effectively. Thus security regulations at these military installations must be enforced against civilian dependents as well as servicemen; the same is true of base traffic violations, black marketeering, and misuse of military customs and post-exchange privileges.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] The practical circumstances requiring some sort of disciplinary jurisdiction have already been adverted to, supra, pp. 71-73. These circumstances take on weight when viewed in light of the alternatives available to Congress - certainly a crucial question in weighing the need for dispensing with particular constitutional guarantees abroad. What are these alternatives? (1) One is to try all offenses committed by civilian dependents abroad in the United States. But the practical problems in the way of such a choice are obvious and overwhelming. To require the transportation home for trial of every petty black marketeer or violator of security regulations would be a ridiculous burden on the Government, quite aside from the problems of persuading foreign witnesses to make the trip and of preserving evidence. It can further be deemed doubtful in the extreme whether foreign governments would permit crimes punishable under local law to be tried thousands of miles away in the United States. (2) Civilian trial overseas by the United States also presents considerable difficulties. If juries are required, the problem of jury recruitment would be difficult. Furthermore, it is indeed doubtful whether some foreign governments would accede to the creation of extraterritorial United States civil courts within their territories - courts which by implication would reflect on the fairness of their own tribunals and which would smack unpleasantly of consular courts set up under colonial \"capitulations.\" (3) The alternative of trial in foreign courts, in at least some instances, is no more palatable. Quite aside from the fact that in some countries where we station troops the protections granted to criminal defendants compare unfavorably with out own minimum standards, the fact would remain that many of the crimes involved - particularly breaches of security - are not offenses under foreign law at all, and thus would go completely unpunished. Add to this the undesirability of foreign police carrying out investigations in our military installations abroad, and it seems to me clear that this alternative does not commend itself.\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK, with whom MR. JUSTICE BURTON joins, dissenting.\n\nThe Court today releases tow women from prosecution though the evidence shows that they brutally killed their husbands, both American soldiers, while stationed with them in quarters furnished by our armed forces on its military installations in foreign lands. In turning these women free, it declares unconstitutional an important section of an Act of Congress governing our armed forces. Furthermore, four of my brothers would specifically over-rule and two would impair the long-recognized vitality of an old and respected precedent in our law, the case of In re Ross, \n140 \nU.S. 453\n (1891), cited by this Court with approval in many opinions and as late as 1929 by a unanimous Court\n1\n in Ex parte Bakelite Corp., \n279 \nU.S. 438, 451\n. And, finally, the Court reverses, sets aside, and overrules two majority opinions and judgments of this Court in these same cases, reported in \n351 \nU.S., at 470\n and 487, and entered on June 11, 1956, less than 12 months ago. In substitute therefor it enters no opinion whatever for the Court. It is unable to muster a majority. Instead, there are handed down three opinions. But, worst of all, it gives no authoritative guidance as to what, if anything, the Executive or the Congress may do to remedy the distressing situation in which they now find themselves. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 79]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE BURTON and I remain convinced that the former opinions of the Court are correct and that they set forth valid constitutional doctrine under the long-recognized cases of this Court. The opinions were neither written nor agreed to in haste and they reflect the consensus of the majority reached after thorough discussion at many conferences. In fact, the cases were here longer both before and after argument than many of the cases we decide. We adhere to the views there expressed since we are convinced that through them we were neither \"mortgaging the future,\" as is claimed, nor foreclosing the present, as does the judgment today. We do not include a discussion of the theory upon which those former judgments were entered because we are satisfied with its handling in the earlier opinions. See \n351 \nU.S., at 470\n and 487.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nBefore discussing the power of the Congress under Art. I, 8, cl. 14, of the constitution it is well to take our bearings. These cases do not involve the jurisdiction of a military court-martial sitting within the territorial limits of the United States. Nor are they concerned with the power of the Government to make treaties or the legal relationship between treaties and the Constitution. Nor are they concerned with the power of Congress to provide for the trial of Americans sojourning, touring, or temporarily residing in foreign nations. Essentially, we are to determine only whether the civilian dependents of American servicemen may constitutionally be tried by an American military court-martial in a foreign country for an offense committed in that country. Congress has provided in Article 2 (11) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, 64 Stat. 109, 50 U.S.C. 552 (11), that they shall be so tried in those countries with which we have an implementing treaty. The question therefore is whether \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 80]\n\u00a0\n this enactment is reasonably related to the power of Congress \"To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces.\" U.S. Const., Art. I, 8, cl. 14.\n\nHistorically, the military has always exercised jurisdiction by court-martial over civilians accompanying armies in time of war. Over 40 years ago this jurisdiction was declared by Congress to include \"all persons accompanying or serving with the armies of the United States without the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.\"\n2\n Art. of War 2 (d), 39 Stat. 651. Article 2 (11) of the present Uniform Code of Military Justice was taken without material change from this provision of the Articles of War. At the time of enactment of the earlier provision Congress was plainly concerned with the maintenance of discipline and morale of American expeditionary forces composed of both military and civilian personnel. As pointed out in the Senate Report to the Sixty-fourth Congress at the time Article 2 (d) was adopted:\n\n\"The existing articles are further defective in that they do not permit the disciplining of these three classes of camp followers in time of peace in places to which the civil jurisdiction of the United States does not extend and where it is contrary to international policy to subject such persons to the local jurisdiction, or where, for other reasons, the law of the local jurisdiction is not applicable, thus leaving these classes practically without liability to punishment for their unlawful acts under such circumstances - as, for example, . . . where such forces so \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 81]\n\u00a0\n accompanied are engaged in the nonhostile occupation of foreign territory, as was the case during the intervention of 1906-7 in Cuba.\" S. Rep. No. 130, 64th Cong., 1st Sess. 37-38.\n\n\n Since that time the power of Congress to make civilians amenable to military jurisdiction under such circumstances has been considered and sustained by this Court and other federal courts in a number of cases. In Madsen v. Kinsella, \n343 \nU.S. 341\n (1952), we sustained the jurisdiction of a military commission to try a civilian wife for the murder of her husband in Germany in 1949. Unlike Mrs. Smith, the petitioner in Madsen contended that a military court-martial had exclusive jurisdiction to try her pursuant to Article of War 2 (d), the predecessor of Article 2 (11). In upholding the constitutionality of trial by a military commission, we pointed out that its jurisdiction was concurrent with that of the military court-martial, \n343 \nU.S., at 345\n, and that the jurisdiction of both stemmed directly from Article 2 (d), \n343 \nU.S., at 361\n.\n\nIt is contended that no holding on the validity of court-martial jurisdiction over civilians was necessary to our decision in Madsen and that the case itself is distinguishable because occupied territory was involved and hence the action of Congress could be supported under the War Power. It is true that our reference to concurrent court-martial jurisdiction - when both petitioner and the Government agreed to it - was a concomitant to that decision, but our recognition of the power of Congress to authorize military trial of civilians under the circumstances provided for in Article 2 (d) was essential to the judgment. \n343 \nU.S., at 361\n. Madsen was factually very similar to the present case, and in terms of the relevant considerations involved it is practically indistinguishable. In Madsen, as here, the crime involved was murder of a serviceman by a dependent wife living as a civilian with \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 82]\n\u00a0\n our armed forces in a foreign country. In both cases jurisdiction was exercised by a military tribunal pursuant to an Act of Congress authorizing such jurisdiction over all persons accompanying the armed forces outside the territorial jurisdiction of the United States. The distinction that in one case the trial was by court-martial and in the other by a military commission is insubstantial. The contention that jurisdiction could be sustained in Madsen under the War Power of Congress but that this power is unavailable to authorize jurisdiction in Smith is likewise without merit.\n3\n Aside from the fact that this Court has never restricted so narrowly the action that Congress might take under the War Power, see Ashwander v. T. V. A., \n297 \nU.S. 288\n (1936), and Silesian-American Corp. v. Clark, \n332 \nU.S. 469\n (1947), there is as much, if not more, justification for employment of the War Power in Japan in 1952 as in Germany in 1949. At the time Mrs. Smith's crime was committed, Japan was the logistics and aviation base for actual hostilities then being waged in Korea, just across the Sea of Japan. And in 1949, Germany, after four years of peaceful and uneventful occupation, could hardly be considered an area where Congress could act only under its War Power. But the salient feature common to both countries was that the problems of maintaining control, morale, and discipline of our military contingents located there were substantially identical. These problems were not appreciably affected by the fact that one instance occurred during an occupation and the other shortly after a peace treaty had been signed.\n\nEarlier, in Duncan v. Kahanamoku, \n327 \nU.S. 304, 313\n (1946), this Court had recognized the \"well-established \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 83]\n\u00a0\n power of the military\" to exercise jurisdiction over persons directly connected with the armed forces, and this power has been repeatedly recognized in cases decided in the lower federal courts. See United States ex rel. Mobley v. Handy, 176 F.2d 491 (1949); Perlstein v. United States, 151 F.2d 167 (1945); Grewe v. France, 75 F. Supp. 433 (1948); In re Berue, 54 F. Supp. 252 (1944); Hines v. Mikell, 259 F. 28 (1919); Ex parte Jochen, 257 F. 200 (1919); Ex parte Falls, 251 F. 415 (1918); Ex parte Gerlach, 247 F. 616 (1917). See also United States v. Burney, 6 U.S.C. M. A. 776, 21 C. M. R. 98 (1956).\n\nIn considering whether Article 2 (11) is reasonably necessary to the power of Congress to provide for the government of the land and naval forces we note, as relevant, certain other considerations. As a nation we have found it necessary to the preservation of our security in the present day to maintain American forces in 63 foreign countries throughout the world. In recent years the services have recognized that the presence of wives and families at many of these foreign bases is essential to the maintenance of the morale of our forces. This policy has received legislative approval and the tremendous expense to the Government involved in the transportation and accommodation of dependents overseas is considered money well spent. It is not for us to question this joint executive and legislative determination. The result, however, has been the creation of American communities of mixed civilian and military population on military bases throughout the world. These civilians are dependent on the military for food, housing, medical facilities, transportation, and protection. Often they live in daily association in closely knit groups nearly isolated from their surroundings. It cannot be denied that disciplinary problems have been multiplied and complicated by this influx of civilians onto military bases, and Congress has provided that military personnel and civilians \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 84]\n\u00a0\n alike shall be governed by the same law administered by the same courts.\n\nConcerning the effect of civilian activities under such circumstances on the discipline and morale of the armed services, we have found no better statement than that of Judge Latimer of the United States Court of Military Appeals where the constitutionality of Article 2 (11) was upheld in the recent case of United States v. Burney, 6 U.S.C. M. A. 776, 21 C. M. R. 98 (1956). Referring to the combat readiness of an overseas command, Judge Latimer stated:\n\n\"[I]t is readily ascertainable that black market transactions, trafficking in habit-forming drugs, unlawful currency circulation, promotion of illicit sex relations, and a myriad of other crimes which may be perpetrated by persons closely connected with one of the services, could have a direct and forceful impact on the efficiency and discipline of the command. One need only view the volume of business transacted by military courts involving, for instance, the sale and use of narcotics in the Far East, to be shocked into a realization of the truth of the previous statement. If the Services have no power within their own system to punish that type of offender, then indeed overseas crime between civilians and military personnel will flourish and that amongst civilians will thrive unabated and untouched. A few civilians plying an unlawful trade in military communities can, without fail, impair the discipline and combat readiness of a unit. At best, the detection and prosecution of crime is a difficult and time-consuming business, and we have grave doubts that, in faraway lands, the foreign governments will help the cause of a military commander by investigating the seller or user of habit-forming drugs, or assist him in deterring \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 85]\n\u00a0\n American civilians from stealing from their compatriots, or their Government, or from misusing its property.\" 6 U.S.C. M. A., at 800, 21 C. M. R., at 122.\n\n\n In addition, it is reasonable to provide that the military commander who bears full responsibility for the care and safety of those civilians attached to his command should also have authority to regulate their conduct. Moreover, all members of an overseas contingent should receive equal treatment before the law. In their actual day-to-day living they are a part of the same unique communities, and the same legal considerations should apply to all. There is no reason for according to one class a different treatment than is accorded to another. The effect of such a double standard on discipline, efficiency, and morale can easily be seen.\n\nIn United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, \n350 \nU.S. 11\n (1955), the Court recognized this necessity. There Art. I, 8, cl. 14, was \"given its natural meaning\" and \"would seem to restrict court-martial jurisdiction to persons who are actually members or part of the armed forces.\" (Emphasis added.) Id., at 15. The Court went on to say:\n\n\"It is impossible to think that the discipline of the Army is going to be disrupted, its morale impaired, or its orderly processes disturbed, by giving ex-servicemen the benefit of a civilian court trial when they are actually civilians. . . . Court-martial jurisdiction sprang from the belief that within the military ranks there is need for a prompt, ready-at-hand means of compelling obedience and order. But Army discipline will not be improved by court-martialing rather than trying by jury some civilian ex-soldier who has been wholly separated from the service for months, years or perhaps decades. Consequently considerations of discipline provide no excuse for new \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 86]\n\u00a0\n expansion of court-martial jurisdiction at the expense of the normal and constitutionally preferable system of trial by jury.\" Id., at 22-23.\n\n\n These women were as much \"a part\" of the military installation as were their husbands. Upon attack by an enemy they would be so treated; all foreign governments so recognized them at all times; and, in addition, it has been clearly shown, unlike in Toth, that \"the discipline of the Army is going to be disrupted, its morale impaired, or its orderly processes disturbed\" by excluding them from the provisions of the Uniform Code. Every single one of our major military commanders over the world has filed a statement to this effect in this case. We should not substitute our views as to this necessity for the views of those charged with the responsibility of the protection of such far-flung outposts of the free world. The former minority, however, repudiates this underlying basis of the opinion in Toth, namely, that where disciplinary measures are necessary to the regulation of the armed forces the Congress does have constitutional power to make rules. In my opinion the rules it has made are necessary to the regulation of the land and naval forces and the means chosen, the Uniform Code, is in no way an unreasonable one.\n\nThere remains the further consideration of whether this provision is \"`the least possible power adequate to the end proposed.'\" United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, supra, at 23. This is the strict standard by which we determine the scope of constitutional power of Congress to authorize trial by court-martial. A study of the problem clearly indicates that the use of the Uniform Code of Military Justice was really the only practicable alternative available.\n\nWhile it was conceded before this Court that Congress could have established a system of territorial or consular \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 87]\n\u00a0\n courts to try offenses committed by civilian dependents abroad, the action of four of my brothers who would overrule and two who would impair the vitality of In re Ross, supra, places this alternative in jeopardy. Territorial courts have been used by our Government for over a century and have always received the sanction of this Court until today. However, in the light of all of the opinions of the former minority here, the use of a system of territorial or consular courts is now out of the question. Moreover, Congress probably had concluded to abandon this system before the Uniform Code was adopted, since a short time thereafter the jurisdiction of the last of our territorial or consular courts was terminated. 70 Stat. 773.\n\nAnother alternative the Congress might have adopted was the establishment of federal courts pursuant to Article III of the Constitution. These constitutional courts would have to sit in each of the 63 foreign countries where American troops are stationed at the present time. Aside from the fact that the Constitution has never been interpreted to compel such an undertaking, it would seem obvious that it would be manifestly impossible. The problem of the use of juries in common-law countries alone suffices to illustrate this. Obviously the jury could not be limited to those who live within the military installation. To permit this would be a sham. A jury made up of military personnel would be tantamount to the personnel of a court-martial to which the former minority objects. A jury composed of civilians residing on the military installation is subject to the same criticism. If the jury is selected from among the local populace, how would the foreign citizens be forced to attend the trial? And perchance if they did attend, language barriers in non-English-speaking countries would be nigh insurmountable. Personally, I would much prefer, as did Mrs. Madsen, that my case be tried before a \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 88]\n\u00a0\n military court-martial of my own countrymen. Moreover, we must remember that the agreement of the foreign country must be obtained before any American court could sit in its territory. In noncommon-law countries, if such courts were permitted to sit - a doubtful possibility - our jury system would be tossed about like a cork on unsettled waters.\n\nLikewise, trial of offenders by an Article III court in this country, perhaps workable in some cases, is equally impracticable as a general solution to the problem. The hundreds of petty cases involving black-market operations, narcotics, immorality, and the like, could hardly be brought here for prosecution even if the Congress and the foreign nation involved authorized such a procedure. Aside from the tremendous waste of the time of military personnel and the resultant disruptions, as well as the large expenditure of money necessary to bring witnesses and evidence to the United States, the deterrent effect of the prosecution would be nil because of the delay and distance at which it would be held. Furthermore, compulsory process is an essential to any system of justice. The attendance of foreign nationals as witnesses at a judicial proceeding in this country could rest only on a voluntary basis and depositions could not be required. As a matter of international law such attendance could never be compelled and the court in such a proceeding would be powerless to control this vital element in its procedure. In short, this solution could only result in the practical abdication of American judicial authority over most of the offenses committed by American civilians in foreign countries.\n\nThe only alternative remaining - probably the alternative that the Congress will now be forced to choose - is that Americans committing offenses on foreign soil be tried by the courts of the country in which the offense is committed. Foreign courts have exclusive jurisdiction \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 89]\n\u00a0\n under the principles of international law and many nations enjoy concurrent jurisdiction with the American military authorities pursuant to Article VII of the Agreement Regarding Status of Forces of Parties to the North Atlantic Treaty.\n4\n Where the American military authorities do have jurisdiction, it is only by mutual agreement with the foreign sovereign concerned and pursuant to carefully drawn agreements conditioned on trial by the American military authorities. Typical of these agreements was the one concluded between the United States and Japan on February 28, 1952, and in force at the time one of these cases arose. Under this and like agreements, the jurisdiction so ceded to the United States military courts will surely be withdrawn if the services are impotent to exercise it. It is clear that trial before an American court-martial in which the fundamentals of due process are observed is preferable to leaving American servicemen and their dependents to the widely varying standards of justice in foreign courts throughout the world. Under these circumstances it is untenable to say that Congress could have exercised a lesser power adequate to the end proposed.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nMy brothers who are concurring in the result seem to find some comfort in that for the present they void an Act of Congress only as to capital cases. I find no distinction in the Constitution between capital and other cases. In fact, at argument all parties admitted there could be no valid difference. My brothers are careful not to say that they would uphold the Act as to offenses less than capital. They unfortunately leave that decision for \n\n[354 \nU.S. 1, 90]\n\u00a0\n another day. This is disastrous to proper judicial administration as well as to law enforcement. The Congress and the Executive Department are entitled to know whether a court-martial may be constitutionally utilized to try an offense less than capital. If so, then all that is necessary is to eliminate capital punishment insofar as Article 2 (11) offenses are concerned. I deeply regret that the former minority does not, now that it has become the majority, perform the high duty that circumstance requires. Both the Congress and the Executive are left only to conjecture as to whether they should \"sack\" Article 2 (11) and require all dependents to return and remain within this country or simply eliminate capital punishment from all offenses under the Article. The morale of our troops may prevent the former and certainly the abstention of this Court prohibits the latter. All that remains is for the dependents of our soldiers to be prosecuted in foreign courts, an unhappy prospect not only for them but for all of us.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Court was composed of Chief Justice Taft and Associate Justices Holmes, Van Devanter, McReynolds, Brandeis, Sutherland, Butler, Sanford, and Stone. Mr. Justice Van Devanter wrote the opinion for the Court.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] An interesting and authoritative treatment of court-martial jurisdiction over camp followers is found in Blumenthal, Women Camp Followers of the American Revolution (1952).

Without informing petitioner or his counsel, the judge related the incident to the district attorney, and it was referred to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. During a recess in the trial, an F. B. I. agent interrogated the juror about the matter, and the juror did not know the purpose or result of this investigation until a month after the end of the trial. Immediately after the trial, the juror told another juror that he \"had been under a terrific pressure.\" Held: On the record in this case, it cannot be said that the juror was not affected in his freedom of action as a juror; and petitioner is entitled to a new trial. Pp. 377-382.\n\n 222 F.2d 720, judgment vacated and case remanded for new trial.\n\nLeslie C. Gillen argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief were John R. Golden and Spurgeon Avakian.\n\nJohn R. Benney argued the cause for the United States. With him on the brief were Solicitor General Sobeloff, Assistant Attorney General Holland and Joseph M. Howard.\n\nMR. JUSTICE MINTON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis case is here for the third time. Petitioner was convicted on four counts of wilfully attempting to evade and defeat federal income taxes. When this case was first here we knew nothing about the facts concerning the phase of the case now before us. It was alleged \n\n[350 \nU.S. 377, 378]\n\u00a0\n in the petitioner's motion and affidavits supporting his motion for a new trial that during the trial one juror, Smith, had been approached by one Satterly, an outsider, with a suggestion that the juror could make some easy money if he would make a deal with petitioner Remmer. It was further alleged by the petitioner that the juror reported the matter to the trial judge, who in turn reported it to the district attorney, who, with the judge's approval, called in the Federal Bureau of Investigation - all of which was unknown to the petitioner until he read about it in the newspaper after the jury had returned its verdict finding him guilty. The Government did not deny these allegations. We sent the case back to the District Court with directions to hold a hearing, with the petitioner and counsel present, to determine from the facts whether or not communication with the juror by the outsider and the events that followed were prejudicial and, therefore, harmful to the petitioner, and, if so, to grant a new trial. \n347 \nU.S. 227\n. On remand, the District Court held a hearing and found the incidents to be free of harm. 122 F. Supp. 673. Thereafter, this Court remanded the entire record to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to consider the whole case in the light of our recent net-worth decisions. \n348 \nU.S. 904\n. The Court of Appeals reviewed the whole record and affirmed the petitioner's conviction in a per curiam opinion. 222 F.2d 720.\n\nThe case is here again on certiorari, limited to the question of the effect of the extraneous communications with the juror upon the petitioner's right to a fair trial. \n350 \nU.S. 820\n. The District Court read our opinion and mandate to mean that \"the incident complained of\" to be inquired into at the hearing was the purpose and effect of the F. B. I. investigation. The District Court found that the purpose of the F. B. I. investigation was not to examine Smith's conduct, but rather to determine whether \n\n[350 \nU.S. 377, 379]\n\u00a0\n Satterly had committed an offense. The court further found that the F. B. I. agent's discussion with Smith had \"no effect whatever upon the judgment, or the integrity or state of mind\" of Smith, whom the court found to be a \"forthright and honest man.\" On the basis of these two findings, the court concluded:\n\n \"Consequently, the court finds that `the incident complained of' was entirely harmless so far as the petitioner was concerned and did not have the slightest bearing upon the integrity of the verdict nor the state of mind of the foreman of the jury, or any of the members of the jury. Thus any presumption of prejudice is conclusively dispelled. . . .\"\n\n\n The District Court's limit of our mandate, it seems to us, is hardly warranted by the language of the opinion, even though the language might well have been more explicit. It was our intention that the entire picture should be explored and the incident complained of and to be examined included Satterly's communication with the juror and the impact thereof upon him then, immediately thereafter, and during the trial, taken together with the fact that the F. B. I. was investigating a circumstance involving the juror and the fact that the juror never knew all during the balance of the trial what the outcome of that investigation was. Thus we stated: \"In a criminal case, any private communication, contact, or tampering, directly or indirectly, with a juror during a trial about the matter pending before the jury is, for obvious reasons, deemed presumptively prejudicial, if not made in pursuance of known rules of the court . . . with full knowledge of the parties.\" \n347 \nU.S., at 229\n. We also pointed out that the record we had before us did not reflect what in fact transpired, \"or whether the incidents that may have occurred were harmful or harmless.\" Ibid. It was the paucity of information relating to the entire situation \n\n[350 \nU.S. 377, 380]\n\u00a0\n coupled with the presumption which attaches to the kind of facts alleged by petitioner which, in our view, made manifest the need for a full hearing. Nevertheless, there is sufficient evidence in the record relating to the total situation, including both the Satterly and the F. B. I. contacts, which makes it unnecessary to remand the case for further consideration. We will consider the evidence free from what we think are the unduly narrow limits of the question as viewed by the District Court.\n\nThe evidence shows that three weeks after the trial started, juror Smith, who is a real estate and insurance broker, was visited in his home by Satterly and his wife about an insurance policy. Satterly had been employed in a gambling house in Nevada as a dealer of craps. The petitioner was or had been engaged in the operation of gambling houses in Nevada. The Satterlys had met the Smiths socially at a hunting lodge. Smith and Satterly seated themselves in one end of a large room and their wives were seated in the other end of the room, a convenient arrangement if an approach was to be made. Satterly made substantially the following remark: \"I know Bones Remmer very well. He sold Cal-Neva for $850,000 and really got about $300,000 under the table which he daresn't touch. Why don't you make a deal with him?\" Smith vigorously reminded Satterly that he was on the jury and that he could not talk about the case. Nothing more was said. Smith was disturbed. As he later testified, \"I always felt, whether Mr. Satterly said it in so many words or not, I always felt that money was involved; otherwise why would any question be put to me.\" So disturbed was Smith that he told the trial judge about it. The judge's reaction, at least as he manifested it to Smith, was that the Satterly conversation should be regarded as a joke. But the judge related the incident to the district attorney and they decided to refer the matter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Shortly thereafter, \n\n[350 \nU.S. 377, 381]\n\u00a0\n during a recess, an F. B. I. agent called on Smith at his place of business. Smith testified that the agent explained the purpose of this visit as follows: \"He told me that he had been instructed to come and interview me relative to this conversation I had with Mr. Satterly. . . . To check and see whether there was anything to this or not.\" On direct examination the agent testified: \"I told him I had been requested to conduct an investigation relating to his talk with Mr. Satterly and the possibility of improper approach.\" In reply to questions put by the District Court, the agent testified that he had explained to Smith that the purpose of his investigation was to examine Satterly's conduct. Satterly was never interviewed by the F. B. I. during its investigation. It was not until a month after the trial had ended that the Government determined that further investigation or criminal prosecution was unwarranted.\n\nDriving home after the trial with two other jurors, Smith mentioned that there was some question as to whether he had been approached during the trial and that he had reported the incident to the trial judge. He thanked one of the jurors on dropping her at her home, \"because I have been under a terrific pressure . . . Sometime I will discuss it.\"\n\nWe think this evidence, covering the total picture, reveals such a state of facts that neither Mr. Smith nor anyone else could say that he was not affected in his freedom of action as a juror. From Smith's testimony it is quite evident that he was a disturbed and troubled man from the date of the Satterly contact until after the trial. Proper concern for protecting and preserving the integrity of our jury system dictates against our speculating that the F. B. I. agent's interview with Smith, whatever the Government may have understood its purpose to be, dispersed the cloud created by Satterly's communication. As he sat on the jury for the remainder of the long trial \n\n[350 \nU.S. 377, 382]\n\u00a0\n and as he cast his ballot, Smith was never aware of the Government's interpretation of the events to which he, however unwillingly, had become a party. He had been subjected to extraneous influences to which no juror should be subjected, for it is the law's objective to guard jealously the sanctity of the jury's right to operate as freely as possible from outside unauthorized intrusions purposefully made.\n\nThe unduly restrictive interpretation of the question by the District Court had the effect of diluting the force of all the other facts and circumstances in the case that may have influenced and disturbed Smith in the untrammeled exercise of his judgment as a juror. We hold that on a consideration of all the evidence uninfluenced by the District Court's narrow construction of the incident complained of, petitioner is entitled to a new trial.\n\nThe Court of Appeals' judgment is vacated and the case is remanded to the District Court with directions to grant a new trial.\n\n    It is so ordered.\n\n\nMR. \nCHIEF JUSTICE WARREN and MR. JUSTICE HARLAN took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 377, 383]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","75":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nREX TRAILER CO. v. UNITED STATES(1956)\nNo. 46\nArgued: December 5, 1955Decided: January 9, 1956\n\n\n\n\n In an action based on 26 (b) (1) of the Surplus Property Act of 1944, the United States recovered $2,000 on each of five counts of a complaint charging petitioner with fraudulent purchases of motor vehicles. Petitioner had previously pleaded nolo contendere to a 5-count indictment arising out of the same five transactions and paid fines aggregating $25,000. Held:\n\n 1. The recovery under 26 (b) (1) is civil in nature and did not put petitioner twice in jeopardy in violation of the Fifth Amendment. Pp. 148-152.\n\n\n 2. The failure of the Government to allege specific damages did not preclude the recovery here. Pp. 152-153.\n\n\n 3. On the record in this case, it cannot be said that the measure of recovery fixed by Congress in the Act is so unreasonable or excessive that it transformed the civil remedy into a criminal penalty. Pp. 153-154.\n\n\n 218 F.2d 880, affirmed.\n\nGustave H. Dongus argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief was Bernard Stroyman.\n\nMelvin Richter argued the cause for the United States. With him on the brief were Solicitor General Sobeloff and Assistant Attorney General Burger.\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nPetitioner contends that this action brought by the Government to recover $2,000 on each of five counts of a complaint based on 26 (b) (1) of the Surplus Property Act of 1944\n1\n places it twice in jeopardy in violation \n\n[350 \nU.S. 148, 149]\n\u00a0\n of the Fifth Amendment. In an earlier proceeding it had pleaded nolo contendere to a five-count indictment bottomed on the same five transactions and paid fines in the aggregate amount of $25,000. In the present case the District Court granted the Government's motion for summary judgment, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, 218 F.2d 880. We granted certiorari, \n349 \nU.S. 937\n, to resolve an asserted conflict between the decisions of the Courts of Appeals.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nAt the close of World War II the Government was faced with the problem of disposing of vast quantities of surplus war materials. A large part of this property, valued at many billions of dollars, was needed to satisfy the civilian demand caused by wartime shortages in consumer goods. To facilitate and regulate the orderly \n\n[350 \nU.S. 148, 150]\n\u00a0\n disposal of this property, Congress passed the Surplus Property Act of 1944, 58 Stat. 765. The stated purposes of this statute included the re-establishment of returning veterans in business, agricultural, or professional life, the discouragement of speculation in surplus property, and the elimination of unusual and excessive profits to speculators. The concern of Congress for returning veterans is emphasized by its 1946 Amendment to the Act, 60 Stat. 168, which gave veterans a priority for the purchase of surplus property, second only to that of the Federal Government, and authorized the Administrator to assign the highest priority to veterans for the purchase of certain items. This legislation thus afforded veterans an opportunity to purchase goods not available elsewhere at a fair price and on good credit terms. The benefits were of great value to the millions of men and women returning to civilian life just after the war.\n\nWith this background in mind we may turn to the facts of the present case. In June 1947 the Rex Trailer Company purchased five motor vehicles from the War Assets Administration at Tinker Field, Oklahoma. Rex had only a nonpriority right of purchase under the Surplus Property Act; but, by the fraudulent use of the names of five persons possessing veteran priority rights, it was able to purchase the vehicles. Admittedly, the terms of the statute were violated, but the record does not show petitioner's gain from the fraud. The United States limited itself to the recovery of the sum of $2,000 for each of the five overt acts alleged in its complaint.\n\nPetitioner's sole contention is that 26 (b) (1) provides a criminal penalty and, having once been convicted and fined for the transactions in question, it cannot again be subjected to punishment. The only question for our decision, then, is whether 26 (b) (1) is civil or penal, for \"Congress may impose both a criminal and civil sanction in respect to the same act or omission; for the double \n\n[350 \nU.S. 148, 151]\n\u00a0\n jeopardy clause prohibits merely punishing twice, or attempting a second time to punish criminally, for the same offense.\" Helvering v. Mitchell, \n303 \nU.S. 391, 399\n.\n\nWe conclude that the recovery here is civil in nature. The Government has the right to make contracts and hold and dispose of property, and, for the protection of its property rights, it may resort to the same remedies as a private person. Cotton v. United States, 11 How. 229. Liquidated damages are a well-known remedy, and in fact Congress has utilized this form of recovery in numerous situations. In all building contracts, for example, Congress has required the insertion of a liquidated-damage clause which \"shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties\" without proof of \"actual or specific damages sustained . . . .\" 32 Stat. 326, 40 U.S.C. 269. Liquidated-damage provisions, when reasonable, are not to be regarded as penalties, United States v. United Engineering & Contracting Co., \n234 \nU.S. 236, 241\n, and are therefore civil in nature.\n\nIn 26 of the Surplus Property Act, Congress has provided three alternative remedies. The first provides a recovery of $2,000 plus double the amount of the damage sustained; the second permits a recovery \"as liquidated damages\" of twice the consideration agreed upon; the third permits the Government to recover the property and retain \"as liquidated damages\" the consideration it received. These alternative remedies are set out in three consecutively numbered subsections of 26 (b). All three were recognized as civil remedies by Congress before the bill was passed.\n3\n and the conclusion is inescapable \n\n[350 \nU.S. 148, 152]\n\u00a0\n that each was of the same nature and designed to serve the same purpose. Further, Congress provided in 26 (d) that: \"[t]he civil remedies provided in this section shall be in addition to all other criminal penalties and civil remedies provided by law.\"\n\nThe case of United States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess, \n317 \nU.S. 537\n, involved a provision of the False Claims Act, R. S. 5438, 3490, 31 U.S.C. 231, essentially the equivalent of 26 (b) (1).\n4\n In Marcus, as here, the defendant had pleaded nolo contendere in an earlier criminal prosecution based on the same transaction. This Court rejected the petitioner's contention of double jeopardy and held that the statute involved was remedial and not penal, since it was unable to say that the provision for $2,000 plus double damages would \"do more than afford the government complete indemnity for the injuries done it.\" \n317 \nU.S., at 549\n. In concluding, it recognized that \"[t]he inherent difficulty of choosing a proper specific sum which would give full restitution was a problem for Congress.\" \n317 \nU.S., at 552\n.\n\nIt is insisted, however, that the failure of the Government to allege specific damages precludes recovery here. But there is no requirement, statutory or judicial, that specific damages be shown, and this was recognized by \n\n[350 \nU.S. 148, 153]\n\u00a0\n the Court in Marcus.\n5\n The Government's recovery here is comparable to the recovery under liquidated-damage provisions which fix compensation for anticipated loss. As this Court recognized in Priebe & Sons v. United States, \n332 \nU.S. 407, 411\n-412, liquidated damages \"serve a particularly useful function when damages are uncertain in nature or amount or are unmeasurable, as is the case in many government contracts. . . .\" And the fact that no damages are shown is not fatal. Section 26 (b) (1) merely accomplishes the intended result of Congress by authorizing a separate proceeding for the recovery of a lump sum in damages.\n\nIt is obvious that injury to the Government resulted from the Rex Trailer Company's fraudulent purchase of trucks. It precluded bona fide sales to veterans, decreased the number of motor vehicles available to Government agencies, and tended to promote undesirable speculation.\n6\n The damages resulting from this injury may be difficult or impossible to ascertain, but it is the \n\n[350 \nU.S. 148, 154]\n\u00a0\n function of liquidated damages to provide a measure of recovery in such circumstances. On this record it cannot be said that the measure of recovery fixed by Congress in the Act is so unreasonable or excessive that it transformed what was clearly intended as a civil remedy into a criminal penalty.\n\n       Affirmed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER concurs in the judgment substantially for the reasons given by him in his opinion in support of the Marcus decision. \n317 \nU.S., at 553\n.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 26 of the Surplus Property Act of 1944, 58 Stat. 765, 780, 50 U.S.C. App. (1946 ed.) 1635, provided in pertinent part:\n\n\"(b) Every person who shall use or engage in or cause to be used or engaged in any fraudulent trick, scheme, or device, for the purpose of securing or obtaining, or aiding to secure or obtain, for any person \n\n[350 \nU.S. 148, 149]\n\u00a0\n any payment, property, or other benefits from the United States or any Government agency in connection with the disposition of property under this Act; or who enters into an agreement, combination, or conspiracy to do any of the foregoing -\n\n\n\"(1) shall pay to the United States the sum of $2,000 for each such act, and double the amount of any damage which the United States may have sustained by reason thereof, together with the costs of suit; or\n\n\n\"(2) shall, if the United States shall so elect, pay to the United States, as liquidated damages, a sum equal to twice the consideration agreed to be given by such person to the United States or any Government agency; or\n\n\n\"(3) shall, if the United States shall so elect, restore to the United States the property thus secured and obtained and the United States shall retain as liquidated damages any consideration given to the United States or any Government agency for such property.\n\n.   .   .  .   .\n\n\n\n\"(d) The civil remedies provided in this section shall be in addition to all other criminal penalties and civil remedies provided by law.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] In considering whether the statute of limitations contained in 28 U.S.C. 2462 applied to 26 (b) (1) of the Surplus Property Act, the Fifth Circuit held 26 (b) (1) to be a civil remedy in United States v. Weaver. 207 F.2d 796, 797, and the Sixth Circuit held it to be penal in United States v. Witherspoon, 211 F.2d 858.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] In referring to these provisions, the Senate Committee on Military Affairs described them as providing for \"the civil liability of persons who engage in false, fraudulent, or fictitious activities, or conceal or misrepresent material facts, or act with intent to defraud the United States . . . . The United States is given the option of electing among three different measures of damages.\" S. Rep. No. 1057, 78th Cong., 2d Sess. 13-14.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The False Claims Act provides that the defrauder \"shall forfeit and pay to the United States the sum of $2,000, and, in addition, double the amount of damages which the United States may have sustained by reason of the doing or committing such act, together with the costs of suit; and such forfeiture and damages shall be sued for in the same suit.\" United States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess, holding this provision to provide a compensatory civil remedy, was decided on January 18, 1943. The Surplus Property Act, which employed virtually identical language in 26 (b) (1), was enacted on October 3, 1944. Under these circumstances it would be very difficult to say that these words which provided a civil remedy in the False Claims Act were not intended to provide the same kind of remedy in the Surplus Property Act.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] On several of the projects involved in the Marcus case, fraud was discovered by the Government in time for payments to be withheld. At trial in the District Court defendants urged that there could be no recovery of a penalty or forfeiture in these instances where no actual damage could be shown. The District Court held that failure to show actual damage in these instances would not preclude recovery under the statute. United States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess, 41 F. Supp. 197, 218. The judgment of the District Court was affirmed here. See United States v. Rohleder, 157 F.2d 126, 129.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] It seems quite probable that there is also an element of unjust enrichment to the Rex Trailer Company from its fraudulent purchases. The record is silent on this point and we have not considered it in arriving at our decision, but the fact that Rex was willing to resort to fraud to purchase the vehicles at the veteran's price strongly suggests an unfair gain from the purchases. The price for sales to priority purchasers was fixed by regulations published in 32 CFR (1946 Supp.) 8302.8 (d), 8302.11, which provided: \"Disposal agencies shall fix the fair value at which property shall be acquired by priority claimants. Such a fair value shall not be greater \n\n[350 \nU.S. 148, 154]\n\u00a0\n than the lowest price which is offered to any trade level at the time of acquisition by the priority claimant, or where the fair value is fixed after examining competitive bids, it shall not be greater than the lowest acceptable bid.\" \n\n[350 \nU.S. 148, 155]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","76":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nRYAN CO. v. PAN-ATLANTIC CORP.(1956)\nNo. 4\nArgued: Decided: January 9, 1956\n\n\n\n\n Without signing a formal stevedoring contract or an express indemnity agreement, a stevedoring contractor agreed to perform all stevedoring operations required by a shipowner in the latter's coastwise service. Under this agreement, the contractor loaded a ship at Georgetown, S. C., with a mixed cargo, including rolls of pulpboard, and unloaded it in navigable water at a pier in Brooklyn, N. Y. During the unloading, a longshoreman employed by the contractor was injured by a roll of pulpboard which had been insufficiently secured when stored by the contractor in Georgetown. Under the Longshoremen's Act, the contractor's insurance carrier paid the longshoreman compensation and furnished him medical services, without any formal award by the Deputy Commissioner. Claiming that, because of unsafe stowage of the cargo, the ship was unseaworthy and that the shipowner had neglected to furnish him with a safe place to work, the longshoreman sued the shipowner and obtained a judgment for a much larger sum, from which the contractor's insurance carrier was to be reimbursed for the amount it had advanced to the longshoreman. Held: On the shipowner's third-party complaint against the contractor, the shipowner was entitled to reimbursement from the contractor for the amount of the judgment against the shipowner. Pp. 125-135.\n\n 1. Section 5 of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, which provides that the liability of an employer prescribed in 4 \"shall be exclusive and in place of all other liability of such employer to the employee,\" does not preclude assertion by the shipowner of the contractor's contractual liability to it, though the contractor was also the employer of the injured longshoreman. Pp. 128-132.\n\n\n 2. Even in the absence of an express agreement of indemnity, the contractor was obligated to reimburse the shipowner for damages caused it by the contractor's breach of its contract to stow the cargo properly and safely.

With him on the brief were Solicitor General Sobeloff, Assistant Attorney General Burger, Paul A. Sweeney and Herman Marcuse.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BURTON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis case presents two questions as to the liability of a stevedoring contractor to reimburse a shipowner for damages paid by the latter to one of the contractor's longshoremen on account of injuries received by him in the course of his employment on shipboard. 1. The first question is whether the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act\n1\n precludes a shipowner from asserting such a liability. 2. The second is whether the liability exists where a contractor, without entering into an express agreement of indemnity, contracts to perform a shipowner's stevedoring operations and the longshoreman's injuries are caused by the contractor's unsafe stowage of the ship's cargo. For the reasons hereafter stated, we answer the first question in the negative and the second in the affirmative.\n\nIn 1949, respondent, Pan-Atlantic Steamship Corporation, a Delaware corporation, operated the SS. Canton \n\n[350 \nU.S. 124, 126]\n\u00a0\n Victory in the American coastwise trade under a bareboat charter. As evidenced by letters, but without a formal stevedoring contract or an express indemnity agreement, respondent secured, for that year, the agreement of petitioner, Ryan Stevedoring Co., Inc., an Alabama corporation, to perform all stevedoring operations required by respondent in its coastwise service. Pursuant to that contract, petitioner loaded the Canton Victory at Georgetown, South Carolina, with mixed cargo. This included pulpboard, such as is used in making corrugated paper and paper bags, shipped in rolls 4 feet wide and 3 to 5 feet long. Petitioner stowed some of these rolls side-by-side on the floor of Hatch No. 3 and \"nested\" others above them by placing the upper rolls in the troughs between the lower ones. To immobilize the rolls, it was necessary to secure or \"chock\" the bottom tier with wedges or with miscellaneous pieces of wood known as \"dunnage.\" There is little evidence as to what took place when the rolls were stowed at Georgetown but it was the uniform practice of petitioner's longshoremen to stow such cargo under the immediate direction of their hatch foremen, while respondent's cargo officers supervised the loading of the entire ship and had authority to reject unsafe stowage.\n\nA few days later, on July 20, 1949, in navigable water at a pier in Brooklyn, New York, petitioner engaged in unloading these rolls. While one of petitioner's Brooklyn longshoremen, Frank Palazzolo, was working in Hatch No. 3, one roll, weighing about 3,200 pounds, broke loose from the others, struck him violently and severely injured his left leg. There is no evidence that he was negligent. On the other hand, it appears that the rolls in Hatch No. 3 had been insufficiently secured when stowed by petitioner in Georgetown. This is established by the absence of proper wedges and dunnage holding the rolls in place at the time of the accident. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 124, 127]\n\u00a0\n\n\nPetitioner's insurance carrier under the Longshoremen's Act paid Palazzolo $2,940 compensation and furnished him medical services costing $9,857.36, all without any formal award by the Deputy Commissioner. As permitted by 33 of that Act, Palazzolo sued the respondent-shipowner in the Supreme Court of New York.\n2\n He claimed that the unsafe stowage of the cargo, which caused his injuries, established either the unseaworthiness of the ship, or the shipowner's negligence in failing to furnish him with a safe place to work, or both. The shipowner removed the case to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York and filed a third-party complaint against petitioner. By stipulation, Palazzolo's case against the shipowner was tried to a jury, which returned a verdict in his favor for $75,000. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 124, 128]\n\u00a0\n The District Court entered judgment on the jury verdict. From the above sum, petitioner's insurance carrier was to be reimbursed for the $12,797.36 it had advanced because of Palazzolo's injuries.\n\nAlso by stipulation, the shipowner's third-party complaint was submitted on the same record to the judge who had presided over Palazzolo's case. He dismissed the complaint. 111 F. Supp. 505. The Court of Appeals affirmed Palazzolo's judgment but reversed the dismissal of the third-party complaint and directed that judgment be entered for the shipowner. 211 F.2d 277. Petitioner, the stevedoring contractor, contends that the order reversing the dismissal of the impleader suit is erroneous. Because of the wide application of the case and the conflicting views that have been expressed on the issues, we granted certiorari. \n348 \nU.S. 813\n. The United States filed a brief as amicus curiae in support of the shipowner and took part in the oral argument. \n348 \nU.S. 948\n. The judgment was affirmed by an equally divided Court, \n349 \nU.S. 901\n, but the case was restored to the docket for reargument before a full Court, \n349 \nU.S. 926\n.\n\n1. \nThe first question is whether the Longshoremen's  Compensation Act precludes the assertion by a shipowner  of a stevedoring contractor's liability to it,  where the contractor is also the employer of the  injured longshoreman.\n\nNeither court below discussed this question, although petitioner presented it to them. Petitioner's argument is based upon the following provision in the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act:\n\n \"SEC. 5. The liability of an employer prescribed in section 4 [for compensation] shall be exclusive and in place of all other liability of such employer to the employee, his legal representative, husband or wife, \n\n[350 \nU.S. 124, 129]\n\u00a0\n parents, dependents, next of kin, and anyone otherwise entitled to recover damages from such employer at law or in admiralty on account of such injury or death, except that if an employer fails to secure payment of compensation as required by this Act, an injured employee, or his legal representative in case death results from the injury, may elect to claim compensation under this Act, or to maintain an action at law or in admiralty for damages on account of such injury or death. . . .\" (Emphasis supplied.) 44 Stat. 1426, 33 U.S.C. 905.\n\n\n The obvious purpose of this provision is to make the statutory liability of an employer to contribute to its employee's compensation the exclusive liability of such employer to its employee, or to anyone claiming under or through such employee, on account of his injury or death arising out of that employment. In return, the employee, and those claiming under or through him, are given a substantial quid pro quo in the form of an assured compensation, regardless of fault, as a substitute for their excluded claims. On the other hand, the Act prescribes no quid pro quo for a shipowner that is compelled to pay a judgment obtained against it for the full amount of a longshoreman's damages.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nSection 5 of the Act expressly excludes the liability of the employer \"to the employee,\" or others, entitled to recover \"on account of such [employee's] injury or death.\" Therefore, in the instant case, it excludes the \n\n[350 \nU.S. 124, 130]\n\u00a0\n liability of the stevedoring contractor to its longshoreman, and to his kin, for damages on account of the longshoreman's injuries. At the same time, however, 5 expressly preserves to each employee a right to recover damages against third persons.\n4\n It thus preserves the right, which Palazzolo has exercised, to recover damages from the shipowner in the present case. The Act nowhere expressly excludes or limits a shipowner's right, as a third person, to insure itself against such a liability either by a bond of indemnity, or the contractor's own agreement to save the shipowner harmless. Petitioner's agreement in the instant case amounts to the latter for, as will be shown, it is a contractual undertaking to stow the cargo \"with reasonable safety\" and thus to save the shipowner harmless from petitioner's failure to do so.\n\nIn the face of a formal bond of indemnity this statute clearly does not cut off a shipowner's right to recover from a bonding company the reimbursement that the indemnitor, for good consideration, has expressly contracted to pay. Such a liability springs from an independent contractual right. It is not an action by or on behalf of the employee and it is not one to recover damages \"on account of\" an employee's \"injury or death.\" It is a simple action to recover, under a voluntary and self-sufficient contract, a sum measured by foreseeable damages occasioned to the shipowner by the injury or death of a longshoreman on its ship.\n\nA like result occurs where a shipowner sues, for breach of warranty, a supplier of defective ship's gear that has caused injury or death to a longshoreman using it in the course of his employment on shipboard. And a like liability for breach of contract accrues to a shipowner against a stevedoring contractor in any instance when the \n\n[350 \nU.S. 124, 131]\n\u00a0\n latter's improper stowage of cargo causes an injury on shipboard to some one other than one of its employees. The coincidence that the loading contractor here happens to be the employer of the injured longshoreman makes no difference in principle. While the Compensation Act protects a stevedoring contractor from actions brought against it by its employee on account of the contractor's tortious conduct causing injury to the employee, the contractor has no logical ground for relief from the full consequences of its independent contractual obligation, voluntarily assumed to the shipowner, to load the cargo properly. See American Stevedores v. Porello, \n330 \nU.S. 446\n; Crawford v. Pope & Talbot, 206 F.2d 784, 792-793; Brown v. American-Hawaiian S. S. Co., 211 F.2d 16; Rich v. United States, 177 F.2d 688; United States v. Arrow Stevedoring Co., 175 F.2d 329.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nThe shipowner's action here is not founded upon a tort or upon any duty which the stevedoring contractor owes to its employee. The third-party complaint is grounded upon the contractor's breach of its purely consensual obligation \n\n[350 \nU.S. 124, 132]\n\u00a0\n owing to the shipowner to stow the cargo in a reasonably safe manner. Accordingly, the shipowner's action for indemnity on that basis is not barred by the Compensation Act.\n6\n\u00a0\n\n2. \nThe other question is whether, in the absence of an  express agreement of indemnity, a stevedoring contractor  is obligated to reimburse a shipowner for  damages caused it by the contractor's improper stowage  of cargo.\n\nThe answer to this is found in the precise ground of the shipowner's action. By hypothesis, its action is not based on a bond of indemnity such as it may purchase by way of insurance, or may require of its stevedoring contractor, and which expressly undertakes to save the shipowner harmless. If the shipowner did hold such an express agreement of indemnity here, it is not disputed that it would be enforceable against the indemnitor. On the other hand, the shipowner's action for indemnity here is not based merely on the ground that the shipowner and contractor each is responsible in some related degree for the tortious stowage of cargo that caused injury to Palazzolo. Such an action, brought without reliance \n\n[350 \nU.S. 124, 133]\n\u00a0\n upon contractual undertakings, would present the bald question whether the stevedoring contractor or the shipowner, because of their respective responsibilities for the unsafe stowage, should bear the ultimate burden of the injured longshoreman's judgment. That question has been widely discussed elsewhere in terms of the relative responsibility of the parties for the tort, and those discussions has dealt with concepts of primary and secondary or active and passive tortious conduct.\n7\n Because respondent in the instant case relies entirely upon petitioner's contractual obligation, we do not meet the question of a noncontractual right of indemnity or of the relation of the Compensation Act to such a right.\n\nThe shipowner's claim here also is not a claim for contribution from a joint tortfeasor. Consequently, the considerations which led to the decision in Halcyon Lines v. Haenn Ship Corp., \n342 \nU.S. 282\n, are not applicable. See American Mutual Liability Ins. Co. v. Matthews, 182 F.2d 322.\n\nThe shipowner here holds petitioner's uncontroverted agreement to perform all of the shipowner's stevedoring operations at the time and place where the cargo in question was loaded. That agreement necessarily includes petitioner's obligation not only to stow the pulp rolls, but to stow them properly and safely. Competency and safety of stowage are inescapable elements of the service undertaken. This obligation is not a quasi-contractual obligation implied in law or arising out of a noncontractual relationship. It is of the essence of petitioner's stevedoring contract. It is petitioner's warranty of workmanlike service that is comparable to a manufacturer's \n\n[350 \nU.S. 124, 134]\n\u00a0\n warranty of the soundness of its manufactured product. The shipowner's action is not changed from one for a breach of contract to one for a tort simply because recovery may turn upon the standard of the performance of petitioner's stevedoring service.\n8\n\u00a0\n\nThe Court of Appeals has stated that the liability of petitioner in this case is for the performance of its obligation to stow the rolls on board ship \"in a reasonably safe manner.\" 211 F.2d, at 279. That court also has affirmed the decision of the District Court which was based upon the verdict of the jury that petitioner's improper stowage of the rolls produced either the unseaworthiness of the ship, or the hazardous working condition which is the basis for the shipowner's liability to Palazzolo.\n\nPetitioner suggests that, because the shipowner had an obligation to supervise the stowage and had a right to reject unsafe stowage of the cargo and did not do so, it now should be barred from recovery from the stevedoring contractor of any damage caused by that contractor's uncorrected failure to stow the rolls \"in a reasonably safe manner.\" Accepting the facts and obligations as above stated, the shipowner's present claim against the contractor should not thereby be defeated. Whatever may have been the respective obligations of the stevedoring contractor and of the shipowner to the injured longshoreman for proper stowage of the cargo, it is clear that, as between themselves, the contractor, as the warrantor of its own services, cannot use the shipowner's failure to discover and correct the contractor's own breach \n\n[350 \nU.S. 124, 135]\n\u00a0\n of warranty as a defense. Respondent's failure to discover and correct petitioner's own breach of contract cannot here excuse that breach.\n9\n\u00a0\n\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals, accordingly, is\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 44 Stat. 1424 et seq., as amended, 33 U.S.C. 901 et seq.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] \"SEC. 33.

JUSTICE CLARK concur, dissenting.\n\nThe petitioner, Ryan Stevedoring Company, is an employer subject to the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act.\n1\n Section 5 of that Act completely abolished all rights of longshoremen to sue their employers for injuries resulting from negligence of the employer or his employees. The Act substituted for old tort remedies a prescribed schedule of compensation for employees' injuries or death which was declared to be \"exclusive and in place of all other liability of such employer to the employee . . . and anyone otherwise entitled to recover damages from such employer at law or in admiralty on account of such injury or death . . . .\" I think the Court's holding today breaks promises the Act made both to employers and employees. My view requires a more detailed statement of the facts and circumstances of this case than appears in the Court's opinion.\n\nPalazzolo, an employee of Ryan, the stevedore, was injured while unloading cargo on a ship owned by the respondent, Pan-Atlantic Steamship Corporation. As authorized by 33 Palazzolo elected to sue the shipowner rather than accept a compensation award. In his complaint \n\n[350 \nU.S. 124, 136]\n\u00a0\n he charged that his injury was solely due to the negligent manner in which a number of heavy rolls of paper pulp had been stowed, or to the resulting unseaworthiness of the vessel. One of these rolls weighing about 3,200 pounds had broken loose from its position and seriously injured Palazzolo. The shipowner answered denying the allegations of negligence and unseaworthiness. At the same time the shipowner filed a complaint of its own against Ryan, the stevedore, alleging that any injury Palazzolo had received was solely attributable to the negligent manner in which the stevedore's employees had stowed the rolls of pulp. On this basis the shipowner asked the court to compel the stevedore to reimburse the shipowner for any judgment Palazzolo might obtain against the shipowner. Palazzolo's case against the shipowner was submitted to a jury; the shipowner's claim for reimbursement by the stevedore was tried by the judge largely on the same evidence and issues submitted to the jury. The facts in summary were these:\n\nThe stevedore's employees loaded the rolls of pulp in Georgetown, South Carolina, and four or five days later different employees of the same stevedore unloaded them in New York. This was pursuant to a general contract under which Ryan had agreed to perform the shipowner's stevedoring services along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. The terms of the contract were set out in written memorandums prepared by the shipowner and agreed to by the stevedore. These memorandums contained a simple agreement to do the stevedoring for an agreed compensation plus, in some circumstances, cost of the stevedore's insurance. There was nothing further from which it could possibly be inferred that Ryan would be under a duty to indemnify the shipowner for losses resulting from any negligent stowage by Ryan's employees. To prevent injuries to cargo, crew and longshoremen, it \n\n[350 \nU.S. 124, 137]\n\u00a0\n is necessary and customary to put some kind of props or supports under or against the heavy pulp rolls to keep them stationary until such time as they are unloaded. Some witnesses testified that a thick, heavy, strong piece of lumber cut into a special wedge shape, called a \"chock,\" is a satisfactory kind of support under the rolls. Failure to use \"chocks\" may, as testified by one of the ship's officers, permit the rolls to run \"rampant.\" Other witnesses testified that in addition to chocking, safety required that wooden floors be placed between the layers of rolls. All agreed, however, that indiscriminate scraps of wood called \"dunnage\" are wholly inadequate supports. All but one witness who testified swore that the roll that broke loose and injured Palazzolo in New York had nothing but \"dunnage\" under or against it. The lone exception was the ship's officer who swore that he saw wedges under the rolls in New York. No one testified that wooden floors were used or that they were made available by the shipowner. There was testimony that this shipowner never used chocks or wooden flooring and that in New York the longshoremen had looked for chocks but none were to be found on the ship. An officer of the shipowner testified that he was on the ship in Georgetown, South Carolina, while it was being loaded; that it was his primary duty to watch and see that the rolls were properly stowed and chocked; that he did watch; that chocks were available as part of the ship's \"gear\"; that he saw chocks, not dunnage, put under the rolls; that had any attempt been made to stow the rolls without using chocks he would have tried to stop the stevedore; that \"the stevedores and the chief officer and the mate on watch generally cooperate and work together in the stowage in the overall stowage of the cargo.\" Thus the uncontradicted testimony of the ship's officer was sufficient to support a finding that he as a representative of the ship actively joined in stowing the rolls in the way in \n\n[350 \nU.S. 124, 138]\n\u00a0\n which they arrived at New York. And other evidence was sufficient to support a finding that the cargo arrived in New York unprotected by chocks.\n\nThese issues were properly submitted to the jury by the judge in his charge. He told the jury that it could not find the ship unseaworthy on account of the way in which the goods were unloaded in New York. The issue thus revolved around stowage in South Carolina which was actively supervised by the ship's officers. The court submitted to the jury the questions, among others, as to whether the ship had available for use proper equipment to stow these dangerous rolls and whether the ship's officers were guilty of negligent loading and stowage in South Carolina. The jury gave Palazzolo a verdict for $75,000. The trial judge found in deciding the shipowner's indemnity claim against the stevedore that the ship's officer present at the stowage \"did not properly perform his admitted duty to supervise the safe and careful loading of the vessel,\" although he had \"authority to remedy the condition or halt the work.\" 111 F. Supp. 505, 507. He concluded from this and other findings\n2\n that the ship and the stevedore were \"joint-tortfeasors\" and therefore declined to order the stevedore to reimburse the shipowner.\n\nThe Court of Appeals held that there was adequate evidence to support the jury's finding that the shipowner was negligent and that the ship was unseaworthy because of the defectively stowed rolls. That court nevertheless held that the stevedore had to reimburse the shipowner for its loss despite the findings of the jury and the trial court that the loss occurred because of the shipowner's \n\n[350 \nU.S. 124, 139]\n\u00a0\n negligence.\n3\n The Court of Appeals justified imposing payment of the $75,000 verdict on the stevedore on the ground that Palazzolo's injury was due to the \"sole,\" \"primary,\" or \"active\" negligence of the stevedore's employees. But the court's suggestion that the injury could have been due to the \"sole\" negligence of the stevedore is answered by the part of the court's opinion holding that there was adequate evidence to support the jury and trial court findings that the shipowner itself was negligent. Use of the words \"primary\" and \"active\" seems to indicate that the Court of Appeals believed it should look at this cold record and find for itself whether the stevedore's employees or the ship's employees were guilty of this type of negligence. I do not agree that the Court of Appeals should make such findings. And if the Court of Appeals' cryptic statements about \"sole,\" \"active\" and \"primary\" can be considered as upsetting any of the findings of the trial court, I think the Court of Appeals' action should be set aside as clearly erroneous. McAllister v. United States, \n348 \nU.S. 19\n.\n\nI have set out the evidence in some detail because I think it shows almost beyond doubt that this stevedoring company is being required to pay a $75,000 verdict \"on account of\" injuries to an employee received in the line of that employee's duties. This is at least $60,000 more than it would have to pay under the Longshoremen's \n\n[350 \nU.S. 124, 140]\n\u00a0\n Act. That Act was revolutionary in its field. It took away from longshoremen the right to sue their employers for negligence and substituted a fixed schedule of compensation for injuries regardless of fault. Many workers and employers opposed the compensation scheme. The workers deplored loss of their chance to get big tort verdicts. But Congress thought it best to give them a more certain and less expensive recovery, even though far less in amount than some tort recoveries might be. Many employers preferred to take their chance on defeating employees' damage suits under the old tort system. The idea of \"liability without fault\" was abhorrent to them. Congress weighed the conflicting interests of employers and employees and struck what was considered to be a fair and constitutional balance.\n4\n Injured employees thereby lost their chance to get large tort verdicts against their employers, but gained the right to get a sure though frequently a more modest recovery. However, 33 did leave employees a chance to recover extra tort damages from third persons who negligently injured them. And while Congress imposed absolute liability on employers, they were also accorded counterbalancing advantages. They were no longer to be subjected to the hazards of large tort verdicts. Under no circumstances were they to be held liable to their own employees for more than the compensation clearly fixed in the Act. Thus employers were given every reason to believe they could buy their insurance and make other business arrangements on the basis of the limited Compensation Act liability. More than that, 33 of the Act also provides that for compensation paid an employee an employer shall himself be reimbursed or indemnified out of any money collected as a result of an employee's claim for negligent injury by a \n\n[350 \nU.S. 124, 141]\n\u00a0\n third person. But the end result here is that this employer is actually mulcted in damages because its employee successfully prosecuted a third-party action. Liability is thus imposed because of the negligence of the employer's other employees. This the Act forbids. Whether called \"common-law indemnity,\" \"contribution,\" \"subrogation,\" or any other name, the result is precisely the same. The employer has to pay more \"on account of\" an injury to his employee than Congress said he should.\n\nI agree, of course, that if the employer here had made a contract, oral or written, agreeing to hold this shipowner harmless or to indemnify the shipowner against liability for injuries to petitioner's employees caused by the shipowner's negligence in whole or in part, the contract would have been valid and indemnity could have been obtained. For the Longshoremen's Act does not forbid employers under it to make independent agreements to indemnify others. But I think there is not the slightest support in this record for a finding that any such contract was made. No such allegation was made in the shipowner's complaint. And the shipowner's counsel was careful to stipulate during the course of the trial that his action was not based on a contract but on common-law indemnity.\n5\n I recognize that common-law indemnity may \n\n[350 \nU.S. 124, 142]\n\u00a0\n sometimes arise where two people commit a tort or wrong which hurts the same person. As between wrongdoers the courts will under some circumstances impose the total liability on the \"primary\" or \"active\" wrongdoer, apparently meaning the wrongdoer the court deems to be the most negligent. But indemnity so imposed is plainly \"on account of\" the negligence of the wrongdoer or his employees. The Act expressly forbids such a recovery by \"anyone\" from a stevedoring company \"on account\" of an injury to one of its longshoremen. Plainly, common-law indemnity should not be used to fasten such a liability on a stevedoring company. I suppose it is for this reason that the Court purports to find an actual contract to indemnify and thus decides the case on an issue neither presented in the complaint nor considered by the trial court.\n\nA genuine contract as distinguished from a liability imposed by law, sometimes called a \"quasi-contract,\" requires mutual agreement of the parties. It is for this reason that the courts have frequently said that the cardinal rule in the interpretation of contracts is that the intention of the parties should be ascertained and enforced.\n6\n And courts do not ordinarily stretch language in order to \n\n[350 \nU.S. 124, 143]\n\u00a0\n find that one person has agreed to indemnify another when the latter negligently hurts someone.\n7\n Special caution should be used in construing contracts so as to impose indemnity liability on companies not engaged in the business of writing indemnity insurance.\n\nI think there is not a shred of evidence to support the Court's inference that this stevedore voluntarily agreed to give up the limited liability which the Longshoremen's Act was deliberately designed to afford. The Court finds nothing to support such a conclusion except that the stevedore agreed to do a stevedoring job. From that the Court implies that it was to do a good workmanlike job. From there it takes the next step - which should be more difficult than it appears to be - and says that the stevedoring company also agreed to give up its immunity under the Act and pay any judgments that might be rendered in favor of the stevedore's employees against the shipowner for its negligence. The precise scope of the indemnity which the Court finds the stevedore intended to assume is left in doubt. Are we to assume that the stevedore agreed to an unlimited liability for indemnity without regard to the comparative or qualitative proportions of negligence as between its employees and the employees of the shipowner? Are we even to assume that the stevedore deliberately and intentionally agreed to indemnify the shipowner upon a court's finding that the stevedore's negligence was the \"sole,\" \"primary,\" or \"active\" cause of injury? Findings of fact based on these standards are never easy. And in efforts to formulate a common-law indemnity remedy courts themselves have groped considerably in trying to give meaning to the terms \"primary\" and \"active.\" Is an understanding of the different nuances of \"sole,\" \"primary\" and \"active\" to be attributed to stevedoring companies in judicial rewriting of \n\n[350 \nU.S. 124, 144]\n\u00a0\n work contracts so as to make them indemnity contracts? Surely before this Court determines the existence of a contract and the scope of its coverage the case should be sent back to the trial court so that these issues could be determined after a full hearing on the facts. The issues were not tried in the District Court and not tried in the Court of Appeals. The issues have never been tried. In American Stevedores, Inc. v. Porello, \n330 \nU.S. 446\n, we remanded a case to the trial court for a hearing on evidence as to the scope of a contract of indemnity even though it was written. Here there is not even an oral contract to indemnify. Before creating a contract it might be appropriate to follow the course we did in Porello. Or is the Court rejecting this phase of Porello? Cf. Halcyon Lines v. Haenn Ship Ceiling & Refitting Corp., \n342 \nU.S. 282, 284\n.\n\nFinally, the Court's action here not only deprives the employer of his limited liability, it makes the right of employees to recover damages from third parties a barren promise. Section 33 of the Act provides two ways for an injured employee to obtain damages from a negligent third person: (1) The employee may elect to waive statutory compensation from his employer and sue the negligent third person directly for damages. (2) If the employee accepts a compensation award the employer may sue the third person as statutory assignee of the employee's claim, but all the employer recovers in excess of the amount of the compensation award must be paid over to the employee. Palazzolo was able to make an election and bring his own suit because his employer was financially interested in the outcome of his case and therefore advanced money to Palazzolo to sustain him during his injury until his case against the third party could be tried. The Court takes away all incentive for employers to follow this course in the future. Hereafter stevedoring companies under circumstances like this will \n\n[350 \nU.S. 124, 145]\n\u00a0\n know that it is decidedly to their advantage that no third-party actions be brought. An employer like Ryan will hereafter know that if he or his employee prosecutes a claim against a third party and obtains a judgment for the employee's benefit, every dime of the judgment will have to be paid by the employer himself. Human nature and habits being what they are, employers will not be eager to finance suits against themselves. Injured longshoremen are not ordinarily wealthy enough to support themselves without work pending the trial of lengthy lawsuits. Yet if an employee accepts a compensation award only his employer can bring suit against the third person, and the employer will not be overly anxious to sue himself. It has been suggested that we can expect the courts to protect employees under such circumstances. In other words, the employee who has accepted compensation must go into court to protect himself against his employer before he goes into court to protect his claim against a third party who has negligently injured him. I cannot believe Congress would have given employers such complete control over these suits if it had thought the employers could be held liable for everything recovered. The actual effect of the Court's holding is this: The employer as an assignee of an employee's claim will know that if he wins a lawsuit, he loses a lawsuit. This knowledge will not give him a yearning anxiety to file suit. Even though he yields to the call of duty and files the lawsuit, he might not be exceedingly anxious to write a good complaint. His other pleadings might not be all that a zealous lawyer would desire. Although the employer must pay the judgment, his will be the opening argument to the jury. And when the last word is said in the closing argument, it will be made by counsel who knows that if he persuades the jury to give his client a verdict his client will have to pay it. Counsel will also know that if he happens to lose the case his client will \n\n[350 \nU.S. 124, 146]\n\u00a0\n be the winner. Such is the state of affairs brought about by the Court's holding that this employer intended to make a contract which would subject him to the very liability that Congress had abolished.\n\nThere has been considerable disagreement in this Court and among other courts about three of our recent holdings, Seas Shipping Co. v. Sieracki, \n328 \nU.S. 85\n; Halcyon Lines v. Haenn Ship Ceiling & Refitting Corp., \n342 \nU.S. 282\n; and Pope & Talbot, Inc. v. Hawn, \n346 \nU.S. 406\n. In each of these cases a worker in the same position as Palazzolo sued a shipowner alleging negligence and unseaworthiness. Judgments were obtained against the shipowners. We held in the Halcyon case that the shipowner could not under the common-law doctrine of \"contribution\" force injured employees' employers to pay part of the judgment against the shipowner. The Sieracki and Halcyon cases were reaffirmed in Pope & Talbot. In that case we refused to permit a shipowner to shift part of his loss to the injured person's employer on his argument that the employer, who was under the Longshoremen's Act, negligently contributed to the injury. We rejected the contention on the ground that if accepted it \"would frustrate this [Act's] purpose to protect employers who are subjected to absolute liability by the Act.\" \n346 \nU.S., at 412\n. The Court's opinion today provides a way under which by simple change of words and remedial formulas the results reached in our three former cases can be undermined. Employees like Sieracki and Palazzolo will find it practically impossible to get their cases for injuries against third persons tried in a court. And a shipowner who wants to shift liability wholly to a stevedoring company can do so by a very simple method. He can allege that the stevedoring company intentionally made a contract agreeing to indemnify him under circumstances like those in this case; that allegation will be automatically proved by simply establishing the fact that \n\n[350 \nU.S. 124, 147]\n\u00a0\n the stevedoring company contracted to do some work on the ship; the result will be that the employer is wholly deprived of the protection of limited liability which the Act was intended to provide. And while this will be accomplished under the name of \"contract,\" it will really be achieved because the Court has announced as an absolute principle of law that without regard to whether a stevedoring company intends to agree to indemnify, it has so agreed if it agrees to do a job. Thus by indirection rights of longshoremen and their employers recognized by this Court in Sieracki, Halcyon, and Pope & Talbot are taken away. In effect the Sieracki case is rejected.\n\nI would reverse this case.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 44 Stat. 1424, as amended, 33 U.S.C. 901.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The trial court also found that the ship's officer \"in the exercise of reasonable care should have discovered and corrected\" the defective stowage conditions. Had this been the only ship's negligence found it might be material in considering the question of common-law indemnity. But this Court relies on contractual indemnity.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Even though the question of unseaworthiness was also submitted to the jury, it depended wholly upon whether there was negligent stowage. Under the undisputed testimony of the ship's officer the jury and judge had to find that the shipowner was guilty of negligence if the stevedore was. Moreover, if the shipowner failed to provide the proper gear in the way of chocks or lumber, the shipowner was guilty of negligence whether the stevedore was or not. In this case, therefore, the shipowner's negligence and unseaworthiness were one and the same thing. And if the shipowner failed to supply needed gear in the way of chocks or lumber, it would have been permissible to find that this was the \"sole\" cause of Palazzolo's injuries.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] See Crowell v.

CO.(1956)\nNo. 282\nArgued: Decided: April 9, 1956\n\n\n\n\n On the record in this case, a suit under the Jones Act to recover for the death of a tugboat fireman who disappeared while working at night on four unlighted, icy and undermanned tugboats and whose drowned body was found later partly clothed and clutching a flashlight, the evidence was sufficient to go to the jury on the issues of whether respondent was negligent in failing to provide the deceased with a safe place to work and whether such negligence was the proximate cause of his death; and the trial court erred in directing a verdict for respondent. Pp. 523-527.\n\n 222 F.2d 540, reversed.\n\nNathan Baker argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioner.\n\nJoseph P. Allen argued the cause and filed a brief for respondent.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe petitioner brought this suit for damages under the Jones Act,\n1\n alleging that her husband while employed by the respondent railroad as a tug fireman was drowned because of the negligent failure of respondent to provide him with a safe place to work. The District Judge directed the jury to return a verdict for the defendant, stating, \"There is some evidence of negligence, and there is an accidental death. But there is not a shred of evidence connecting the two.\" The Court of Appeals affirmed, saying that while the evidence was \"perhaps at most only doubtfully sufficient to present a jury question as to \n\n[350 \nU.S. 523, 524]\n\u00a0\n defendant's breach of duty\" it failed to show \"where the accident occurred\" or \"that it was proximately caused by any default on the part of the defendant.\"\n2\n\u00a0\n\nThe jury trial \"is part and parcel of the remedy afforded railroad workers under the Employers Liability Act,\" which the Jones Act makes applicable to those working as petitioner's husband was here.\n3\n The Seventh Amendment to the Constitution provides that \"the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.\"\n4\n We granted certiorari to consider the failure of the District Court to let this case go to the jury. \n350 \nU.S. 882\n.\n\nWhile some facts were in dispute there was evidence from which a jury could have found: On Christmas Day 1949, at about 5:15 p. m., the deceased, Schulz, reported for work on his job at Pier H, Jersey City, New Jersey, and was assigned to work on four tugboats docked side by side there. He went immediately to check the boats without waiting to change from his street to his working clothes. Returning to the pier alongside the tugs about seven o'clock, Schulz reported that he had finished his checking and was now going back to the boats to change to his work clothes and proceed with his other duties there. He was last seen alive walking in the direction of the nearest tug. At 1:25 a. m., a supervisor found Schulz was not on the boats. His street clothes were hanging in the upper engine room where the tug attendants usually changed clothes. His lunch package was also there. Three of the tugs were at all times wholly unlighted and dark; one was partially illuminated by \n\n[350 \nU.S. 523, 525]\n\u00a0\n spotlights from the pier. The night was cold - 10 above zero - and there was some ice on the tugs. Because the company did not have enough workers that night properly to perform the duties that were required Schulz had to try to take care of all four tugs by himself. To do this he had to step from one boat to another in the dark except for such limited illumination as he could obtain from a flashlight. Several weeks after Schulz disappeared from the boats his body was found in the water near an adjacent pier. He was clothed in nothing but shorts and socks. A flashlight was in his hand. He had drowned. It is conceded that the deceased was not under the influence of alcohol when he came to the boat, that he did not commit suicide, that there was no foul play, and that he met his death by accident. The evidence showed that he was a capable and experienced workman who had been employed by the defendant for several years.\n\nIn considering the scope of the issues entrusted to juries in cases like this, it must be borne in mind that negligence cannot be established by direct, precise evidence such as can be used to show that a piece of ground is or is not an acre. Surveyors can measure an acre. But measuring negligence is different. The definitions of negligence are not definitions at all, strictly speaking. Usually one discussing the subject will say that negligence consists of doing that which a person of reasonable prudence would not have done, or of failing to do that which a person of reasonable prudence would have done under like circumstances. Issues of negligence, therefore, call for the exercise of common sense and sound judgment under the circumstances of particular cases. \"[W]e think these are questions for the jury to determine. We see no reason, so long as the jury system is the law of the land, and the jury is made the tribunal to decide disputed questions of fact, why it should not decide such questions \n\n[350 \nU.S. 523, 526]\n\u00a0\n as these as well as others.\" Jones v. East Tennessee, V. & G. R. Co., \n128 \nU.S. 443, 445\n (1888).\n\nIn this case petitioner is entitled to recover if her husband's death resulted \"in whole or in part\"\n5\n from defendant's negligence. Fair-minded men could certainly find from the foregoing facts that defendant was negligent in requiring Schulz to work on these dark, icy and undermanned boats. And reasonable men could also find from the discovery of Schulz's half-robed body with a flashlight gripped in his hand that he slipped from an unlighted tug as he groped about in the darkness attempting to perform his duties.\n6\n But the courts below took this case from the jury because of a possibility that Schulz might have fallen on a particular spot where there happened to be no ice, or that he might have fallen from the one boat that was partially illuminated by shore lights. Doubtless the jury could have so found (had the court allowed it to perform its function) but it would not have been compelled to draw such inferences.\n7\n For \"The very essence of its function is to select from among conflicting inferences and conclusions that which it considers most reasonable.\"\n8\n Fact finding does not require mathematical certainty.\n9\n Jurors are supposed to reach their conclusions on the basis of common sense, common understanding and fair beliefs, grounded on evidence consisting of direct statements by witnesses or proof of circumstances from which inferences can fairly be drawn. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 523, 527]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe think the evidence was sufficient to require submission of the case to the jury, and that it was error not to do so.\n\n     Reversed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE REED, MR.

MACKEY(1956)\nNo. 34\nArgued: February 28, 1956Decided: June 11, 1956\n\n\n\n\n In a multiple claims action, the Federal District Court expressly directed that judgment be entered for the defendant on two, but less than all, of the claims presented. The court also expressly determined that there was no just reason for delay in making the entry. On appeal from that judgment, the Court of Appeals upheld its jurisdiction and denied a motion to dismiss, relying upon 28 U.S.C. 1291 and Rule 54 (b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, as amended in 1946. Held: The appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals is sustained, and its judgment denying the motion to dismiss the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction is affirmed. Pp. 428-438.\n\n (a) Rule 54 (b), as amended, does not relax the finality required of each decision, as an individual claim, to render it appealable, but does provide a practical means of permitting an appeal to be taken from one or more final decisions on individual claims, in multiple claims actions, without waiting for final decisions to be rendered on all the claims in the case. Pp. 434-435.\n\n\n (b) The application of the amended rule is limited expressly to multiple claims actions in which \"one or more but less than all\" of the multiple claims have been finally decided and are found otherwise to be ready for appeal. P. 435.\n\n\n (c) The amended rule requires that for \"one or more but less than all\" multiple claims to become appealable, the District Court must make both \"an express determination that there is no just reason for delay\" and \"an express direction for the entry of judgment.\" Pp. 435-436.\n\n\n (d) In this case, each of the claims dismissed was a \"claim for relief\" within the meaning of Rule 54 (b), and the dismissal of each constituted a \"final decision\" on the individual claim. P. 436.\n\n\n (e) The claims adjudged by the District Court could properly be decided independently of the claims which the court did not adjudge. P. 436.\n\n\n (f) Amended Rule 54 (b) does not constitute an unauthorized extension of 28 U.S.C. 1291, since the District Court cannot, in \n\n[351 \nU.S. 427, 428]\n\u00a0\n the exercise of its discretion, treat as \"final\" that which is not \"final\" within the meaning of 1291. Pp. 436-437.\n\n\n (g) In the exercise of its discretion under amended Rule 54 (b), the District Court may release for appeal final decisions upon one or more, but less than all, claims in multiple claims actions; and any abuse of that discretion is reviewable by the Court of Appeals. P. 437.\n\n\n (h) Rule 54 (b), as amended, does not supersede any statute controlling appellate jurisdiction; and it scrupulously recognizes the statutory requirement of a \"final decision\" under 1291 as a basic requirement for an appeal to the Court of Appeals. P. 438.\n\n\n (i) Rule 54 (b), as amended, is valid in both its \"affirmative\" and \"negative\" aspects. The rule is not rendered invalid because, through its \"affirmative\" operation, a final decision may be released for appeal to the Court of Appeals at a time when, under prior law, it would not have been appealable.

With him on a brief for Mackey, respondent, was John Paul Stevens.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BURTON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis action, presenting multiple claims for relief, was brought by Mackey and another in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, in 1953. The court expressly directed that judgment be entered for the defendant, Sears, Roebuck & Co., on two, but less than all, of the claims presented. It also expressly determined that there was no just reason for delay in making the entry. After Mackey's notice of appeal from that judgment to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, Sears, Roebuck & Co. moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction. The Court of Appeals upheld its jurisdiction and denied the \n\n[351 \nU.S. 427, 429]\n\u00a0\n motion, relying upon 28 U.S.C. 1291 and Rule 54 (b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, as amended in 1946. 218 F.2d 295. Because of the importance of the issue in determining appellate jurisdiction and because of a conflict of judicial views on the subject,\n1\n we granted certiorari. \n348 \nU.S. 970\n. For the reasons hereafter stated, we sustain the Court of Appeals and its appellate jurisdiction.\n\nAlthough we are here concerned with the present appealability of the judgment of the District Court and not with its merits, we must examine the claims stated in the complaint so as to consider adequately the issue of appealability.\n\nThe complaint contains six counts. We disregard the fifth because it has been abandoned and the sixth because it duplicates others. The claims stated in Counts I and II are material and have been dismissed without leave to amend. The claim contained in Count III and that in amended Count IV are at issue on the answers filed by Sears, Roebuck & Co. The appeal before us is from a \n\n[351 \nU.S. 427, 430]\n\u00a0\n judgment striking out Counts I and II without disturbing Counts III and IV, and the question presented is whether such a judgment is presently appealable when the District Court, pursuant to amended Rule 54 (b), has made \"an express determination that there is no just reason for delay\" and has given \"an express direction for the entry of judgment.\"\n\nIn Count I, Mackey, a citizen of Illinois, and Time Saver Tools, Inc., an Illinois corporation owned by Mackey, are the original plaintiffs and the respondents here. Sears, Roebuck & Co., a New York corporation doing business in Illinois, is the original defendant and the petitioner here. Mackey charges Sears with conduct violating the Sherman Antitrust Act in a manner prejudicial to three of Mackey's commercial ventures causing him $190,000 damages, for which he seeks $570,000 as treble damages. His first charge is unlawful destruction by Sears, since 1949, of the market for nursery lamps manufactured by General Metalcraft Company, a corporation wholly owned by Mackey. Mackey claims that this caused him a loss of $150,000. His second charge is unlawful interference by Sears, in 1952, with Mackey's contract to sell, on commission, certain tools and other products of the Vascoloy-Ramet Corporation, causing Mackey to lose $15,000. His third charge is unlawful destruction by Sears, in 1952, of the market for a new type of carbide-tipped lathe bit and for other articles manufactured by Time Saver Tools, Inc., resulting in a loss to Mackey of $25,000. Mackey combines such charges with allegations that Sears has used its great size to monopolize commerce and restrain competition in these fields. He asks for damages and equitable relief.\n\nIn Count II, Mackey claims federal jurisdiction by virtue of diversity of citizenship. He incorporates the allegations of Count I as to the Metalcraft transactions and asks for $250,000 damages for Sears' willful destruction \n\n[351 \nU.S. 427, 431]\n\u00a0\n of the business of Metalcraft, plus $50,000 for Mackey's loss on obligations guaranteed by him.\n\nIn Count III, Mackey seeks $75,000 in a common-law proceeding against Sears for unlawfully inducing a breach of his Vascoloy commission contract.\n\nIn Count IV, Time Saver seeks $200,000 in a common-law proceeding against Sears for unlawfully destroying Time Saver's business by unfair competition and patent infringement.\n\nThe jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals to entertain Mackey's appeal from the District Court's judgment depends upon 28 U.S.C. 1291, which provides that \"The courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the United States . . . .\" (Emphasis supplied.)\n\nIf Mackey's complaint had contained only Count I, there is no doubt that a judgment striking out that count and thus dismissing, in its entirety, the claim there stated would be both a final and an appealable decision within the meaning of 1291. Similarly, if his complaint had contained Counts I, II, III and IV, there is no doubt that a judgment striking out all four would be a final and appealable decision under 1291. The controversy before us arises solely because, in this multiple claims action, the District Court has dismissed the claims stated in Counts I and II, but has left un adjudicated those stated in Counts III and IV.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nBefore the adoption of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in 1939, such a situation was generally regarded as leaving the appellate court without jurisdiction of an attempted appeal. It was thought that, although the judgment was a final decision on the respective claims in Counts I and II, it obviously was not a final decision of \n\n[351 \nU.S. 427, 432]\n\u00a0\n the whole case, and there was no authority for treating anything less than the whole case as a judicial unit for purposes of appeal.\n3\n This construction of the judicial unit was developed from the common law which had dealt with litigation generally less complicated than much of that of today.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nWith the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, there came an increased opportunity for the liberal joiner of claims in multiple claims actions. This, in turn, demonstrated a need for relaxing the restrictions upon what should be treated as a judicial unit for purposes of appellate jurisdiction. Sound judicial administration did not require relaxation of the standard of finality in the disposition of the individual adjudicated claims for the purpose of their appealability. It did, however, demonstrate that, at least in multiple claims actions, some final decisions, on less than all of the claims, should be appealable without waiting for a final decision on all of the claims. Largely to \n\n[351 \nU.S. 427, 433]\n\u00a0\n meet this need, in 1939, Rule 54 (b) was promulgated in its original form through joint action of Congress and this Court.\n5\n It read as follows:\n\n \"(b) JUDGMENT AT VARIOUS STAGES. When more than one claim for relief is presented in an action, the court at any stage, upon a determination of the issues material to a particular claim and all counterclaims arising out of the transaction or occurrence which is the subject matter of the claim, may enter a judgment disposing of such claim. The judgment shall terminate the action with respect to the claim so disposed of and the action shall proceed as to the remaining claims. In case a separate judgment is so entered, the court by order may stay its enforcement until the entering of a subsequent judgment or judgments and may prescribe such conditions as are necessary to secure the benefit thereof to the party in whose favor the judgment is entered.\"\n\n\n It gave limited relief. The courts interpreted it as not relaxing the requirement of a \"final decision\" on each individual claim as the basis for an appeal, but as authorizing \n\n[351 \nU.S. 427, 434]\n\u00a0\n a limited relaxation of the former general practice that, in multiple claims actions, all the claims had to be finally decided before an appeal could be entertained from a final decision upon any of them.\n6\n Thus, original Rule 54 (b) modified the single judicial unit theory but left unimpaired the statutory concept of finality prescribed by 1291. However, it was soon found to be inherently difficult to determine by any automatic standard of unity which of several multiple claims were sufficiently separable from others to qualify for this relaxation of the unitary principle in favor of their appealability. The result was that the jurisdictional time for taking an appeal from a final decision on less than all of the claims in a multiple claims action in some instances expired earlier than was foreseen by the losing party. It thus became prudent to take immediate appeals in all cases of doubtful appealability and the volume of appellate proceedings was undesirably increased.\n\nLargely to overcome this difficulty, Rule 54 (b) was amended, in 1946, to take effect in 1948.\n7\n Since then it has read as follows:\n\n \"(b) JUDGMENT UPON MULTIPLE CLAIMS. When more than one claim for relief is presented in an action, whether as a claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim, the court may direct the entry of a final judgment upon one or more but less than all of the claims only upon an express determination \n\n[351 \nU.S. 427, 435]\n\u00a0\n that there is no just reason for delay and upon an express direction for the entry of judgment. In the absence of such determination and direction, any order or other form of decision, however designated, which adjudicates less than all the claims shall not terminate the action as to any of the claims, and the order or other form of decision is subject to revision at any time before the entry of judgment adjudicating all the claims.\" (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n\n In this form, it does not relax the finality required of each decision, as an individual claim, to render it appealable, but it does provide a practical means of permitting an appeal to be taken from one or more final decisions on individual claims, in multiple claims actions, without waiting for final decisions to be rendered on all the claims in the case. The amended rule does not apply to a single claim action nor to a multiple claims action in which all of the claims have been finally decided. It is limited expressly to multiple claims actions in which \"one or more but less than all\" of the multiple claims have been finally decided and are found otherwise to be ready for appeal.\n\nTo meet the demonstrated need for flexibility, the District Court is used as a \"dispatcher.\" It is permitted to determine, in the first instance, the appropriate time when each \"final decision\" upon \"one or more but less than all\" of the claims in a multiple claims action is ready for appeal. This arrangement already has lent welcome certainty to the appellate procedure. Its \"negative effect\" has met with uniform approval. The effect so referred to is the rule's specific requirement that for \"one or more but less than all\" multiple claims to become appealable, the District Court must make both \"an express determination that there is no just reason for delay\" and \"an express direction for the entry of judgment.\" A party adversely affected by a final decision thus knows that \n\n[351 \nU.S. 427, 436]\n\u00a0\n his time for appeal will not run against him until this certification has been made.\n8\n\u00a0\n\nIn the instant case, the District Court made this certification, but Sears, Roebuck & Co. nevertheless moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction under 1291. The grounds for such a motion ordinarily might be (1) that the judgment of the District Court was not a decision upon a \"claim for relief,\" (2) that the decision was not a \"final decision\" in the sense of an ultimate disposition of an individual claim entered in the course of a multiple claims action, or (3) that the District Court abused its discretion in certifying the order.\n\nIn the case before us, there is no doubt that each of the claims dismissed is a \"claim for relief\" within the meaning of Rule 54 (b), or that their dismissal constitutes a \"final decision\" on individual claims. Also, it cannot well be argued that the claims stated in Counts I and II are so inherently inseparable from, or closely related to, those stated in Counts III and IV that the District Court has abused its discretion in certifying that there exists no just reason for delay. They certainly can be decided independently of each other.\n\nPetitioner contends that amended Rule 54 (b) attempts to make an unauthorized extension of 1291. We disagree. It could readily be argued here that the claims stated in Counts I and II are sufficiently independent of those stated in Counts III and IV to satisfy the requirements of Rule 54 (b) even in its original form. If that were so, the decision dismissing them would also be appealable under the amended rule. It is nowhere contended today that a decision that would have been appealable under the original rule is not also appealable under the amended rule, provided the District Court makes the required certification. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 427, 437]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWhile it thus might be possible to hold that in this case the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction under original Rule 54 (b), there at least would be room for argument on the issue of whether the decided claims were separate and independent from those still pending in the District Court.\n9\n Thus the instant case affords an excellent illustration of the value of the amended rule which was designed to overcome that difficulty. Assuming that the requirements of the original rule are not met in this case, we nevertheless are enabled to recognize the present appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals under the amended rule. The District Court cannot, in the exercise of its discretion, treat as \"final\" that which is not \"final\" within the meaning of 1291. But the District Court may, by the exercise of its discretion in the interest of sound judicial administration, release for appeal final decisions upon one or more, but less than all, claims in multiple claims actions. The timing of such a release is, with good reason, vested by the rule primarily in the discretion of the District Court as the one most likely to be familiar with the case and with any justifiable reasons for delay. With equally good reason, any abuse of that discretion remains reviewable by the Court of Appeals.\n\nRule 54 (b), in its original form, thus may be said to have modified the single judicial unit practice which had been developed by court decisions. The validity of that rule is no longer questioned. In fact, it was applied by this Court in Reeves v. Beardall, \n316 \nU.S. 283\n, without its validity being questioned. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 427, 438]\n\u00a0\n\n\nRule 54 (b), in its amended form, is a comparable exercise of the rulemaking authority of this Court. It does not supersede any statute controlling appellate jurisdiction. It scrupulously recognizes the statutory requirement of a \"final decision\" under 1291 as a basic requirement for an appeal to the Court of Appeals. It merely administers that requirement in a practical manner in multiple claims actions and does so by rule instead of by judicial decision. By its negative effect, it operates to restrict in a valid manner the number of appeals in multiple claims actions.\n\nWe reach a like conclusion as to the validity of the amended rule where the District Court acts affirmatively and thus assists in properly timing the release of final decisions in multiple claims actions. The amended rule adapts the single judicial unit theory so that it better meets the current needs of judicial administration. Just as Rule 54 (b), in its original form, resulted in the release of some decisions on claims in multiple claims actions before they otherwise would have been released,\n10\n so amended Rule 54 (b) now makes possible the release of more of such decisions subject to judicial supervision. The amended rule preserves the historic federal policy against piecemeal appeals in many cases more effectively than did the original rule.\n11\n\u00a0\n\nAccordingly, the appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals is sustained,\n12\n and its judgment denying the motion to dismiss the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction is      Affirmed.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] For decisions directly or impliedly sustaining the validity of amended Rule 54 (b), as applied in the instant case, see Rieser v.

General Mills, Inc., supra. The meaning of that rule is considered hereafter.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] At common law, a writ of error did not lie to review a judgment that failed to adjudicate every cause of action asserted in the controversy. See Holcombe v. McKusick, 20 How. 552; United States v. Girault, 11 How. 22; Metcalfe's Case, 11 Co. Rep. 38a, 77 Eng. Rep. 1193. The rule generally followed in the federal courts was that, in a case involving a single plaintiff and a single defendant, a judgment was not appealable if it disposed of some, but less than all, of the claims presented. See Collins v. Miller, \n252 \nU.S. 364\n; Sheppy v. Stevens, 200 F. 946 (C. A. 2d Cir.). In cases involving multiple parties where the alleged liability was joint, a judgment was not appealable unless it terminated the action as to all the defendants. See Hohorst v. Hamburg-American Packet Co., \n148 \nU.S. 262\n. But if, in a multiple party case, a judgment finally disposed of a claim that was recognized to be separate and distinct from the others, that judgment, under some circumstances, was appealable. See Republic of China v. American Express Co., 190 F.2d 334 (C. A. 2d Cir.).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The appellate jurisdiction of the United States Courts of Appeals, with exceptions not directly pertinent here, is still largely restricted to the review of cases appealed under 28 U.S.C. 1291. But see Forgay v. Conrad, 6 How. 201; Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., \n337 \nU.S. 541\n; 28 U.S.C. 1292, 1651.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The Supreme Court's authority to promulgate the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is derived from the Enabling Act, now appearing as 28 U.S.C. 2072. It authorizes this Court to promulgate rules governing \"the forms of process, writs, pleadings, and motions, and the practice and procedure of the district courts of the United States . . . in civil actions.\" It provides that such rules \"shall not abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right . . . .\" And, by reason of Article I, 8, of the Constitution, it has been held repeatedly that only Congress may define the jurisdiction of the lower federal courts. See Sibbach v. Wilson & Co., \n312 \nU.S. 1\n; Baltimore Contractors, Inc., v. Bodinger, \n348 \nU.S. 176\n; and Fed. Rules Civ.

Grace Line, Inc., supra, at 174.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] \". . . situations arose where district courts made a piecemeal disposition of an action and entered what the parties thought amounted to a judgment, although a trial remained to be had on other claims similar or identical with those disposed of.

Petroleum Corp., \n338 \nU.S. 507, 511\n-512.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] In the instant case, the claim dismissed by striking out Count I is based on the Sherman Act, while Counts III and IV do not rely on, or even refer to, that Act. They are largely predicated on common-law rights. The basis of liability in Count I is independent of that on which the claims in Counts III and IV depend. But the claim in Count I does rest in part on some of the facts that are involved in Counts III and IV. The claim stated in Count II is clearly independent of those in Counts III and IV.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] See Collins v. Metro-Goldwyn Pictures Corp., 106 F.2d 83 (C. A. 2d Cir.), cited in Reeves v. Beardall, \n316 \nU.S. 283\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] See Cobbledick v. United States, \n309 \nU.S. 323\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] Mackey also argues that the Court of Appeals has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 1292 (1). In view of our disposition of this case, we do not reach that contention. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 427, 439]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, whom MR. JUSTICE HARLAN joins, concurring in No. 34 and dissenting in No. 76.\n\nThe result in these two litigations of course has significance for the parties. That is, however, of relative insignificance compared to the directions which judges in the district courts and courts of appeals will draw from the Court's opinions. For me, what is said has not a little kinship with the pronouncements of the Delphic oracle.\n\nThe opinion in Cold Metal Process Co. v. United Engineering & Foundry Co., post, p. 445, declares that 28 U.S.C. 1291 remains unimpaired, but surely that section does not remain what it was before these opinions were written. Rule 54 (b) is apparently the transforming cause. The Court could have said that Rule 54 (b), promulgated under congressional authority and having the force of statute, has qualified 28 U.S.C. 1291. It does not say so. The Court could have said that it rejects the reasoning of the decisions in which this Court for over a century has interpreted 1291 as expressing a hostility toward piecemeal appeals. It does not say so. The Court could have said that Rule 54 (b)'s requirement of a certificate from a district judge means that the district judges alone determine the content of finality. The Court does not say that either.\n\nThe Court does indicate that what has been the core of the doctrine of finality as applied to multiple claims litigation - that only that part of a litigation which is separate from, and independent of, the remainder of the litigation can be appealed before the completion of the entire litigation - is no longer to be applied as a standard, or at least as an exclusive standard, for deciding what is final for purposes of 1291. The Court does not, however, indicate what standards the district courts and the courts of appeals are now to apply in determining when a decision is final. It leaves this problem in the first \n\n[351 \nU.S. 427, 440]\n\u00a0\n instance to the district courts, subject to review by the courts of appeals for an abuse of discretion. In other instances where a district court's ruling can be upset only for an abuse of its discretion, the scope of review is necessarily narrow. Here, in regard to the present problem, what is to come under review is a newly modified requirement of finality. But the requirement continues to be based upon a statute, viz., 28 U.S.C. 1291, and that statute defines and constricts the jurisdiction of the courts of appeals. Therefore the issue of compliance with this congressional command would, I should suppose, cast upon the courts of appeals a duty of independent judgment broader than is implied by the usual flavor of the phrase \"abuse of discretion.\"\n\nFor me, the propositions emerging from analysis of the relationship of Rule 54 (b) to 28 U.S.C. 1291 are clear.\n\n1. 28 U.S.C. 1291 is left intact by Rule 54 (b). It could not be otherwise with due regard for the congressional policy embodied in that section and in view of what the Advisory Committee on the Rules said in its Note to amended Rule 54 (b):\n\n \"The historic rule in the federal courts has always prohibited piecemeal disposal of litigation and permitted appeals only from final judgments except in those special instances covered by statute. . . . Rule 54 (b) was originally adopted in view of the wide scope and possible content of the newly created `civil action' in order to avoid the possible injustice of a delay in judgment of a distinctly separate claim to await adjudication of the entire case. It was not designed to overturn the settled federal rule stated above . . . .\n\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \". . . After extended consideration, it [the Committee] concluded that a retention of the older federal \n\n[351 \nU.S. 427, 441]\n\u00a0\n rule was desirable, and that this rule needed only the exercise of a discretionary power to afford a remedy in the infrequent harsh case to provide a simple, definite, workable rule. This is afforded by amended Rule 54 (b). It re-establishes an ancient policy with clarity and precision. . . .\" Report of Advisory Committee on Proposed Amendments to Rules of Civil Procedure 70-72.\n\n\n2. \n28 \nU.S.C. 1291 is not a technical rule in a game. It expresses not only a deeply rooted but a wisely sanctioned principle against piecemeal appeals governing litigation in the federal courts. See Cobbledick v. United States, \n309 \nU.S. 323\n; Radio Station WOW v. Johnson, \n326 \nU.S. 120, 123\n-127. The great importance of this characteristic feature of the federal judicial system - its importance in administering justice - is made luminously manifest by considering the evils where, as in New York, piecemeal reviews are allowed.\n\n3. While the principle against piecemeal appeals has been compendiously and therefore, at times, loosely phrased as implying that the whole of a litigation, no matter what its nature, must be completed before any appeal is allowed, see Collins v. Miller, \n252 \nU.S. 364, 370\n, the underlying rationale of the principle has been respected when not susceptible of this mechanical way of putting it. What have been called exceptions are not exceptions at all in the sense of inroads on the principle. They have not qualified the core, that is, that there should be no premature, intermediate appeal.\n\nThus the Court has permitted appeal before completion of the whole litigation when failure to do so would preclude any effective review or would result in irreparable injury. See Forgay v. Conrad, 6 How. 201; Cohen v. Beneficial Loan Corp., \n337 \nU.S. 541, 545\n-547; Swift & Co. v. Compania Caribe, \n339 \nU.S. 684, 688\n-689. A \n\n[351 \nU.S. 427, 442]\n\u00a0\n second situation in which the Court has found that an appeal before termination of the entire litigation did not conflict with the congressional policy against piecemeal appeals is that in which a party to the completed portion of the litigation has no interest in the rest of the proceedings and to make him await their outcome would merely cause unfairness. See Williams v. Morgan, \n111 \nU.S. 684, 699\n; United States v. River Rouge Co., \n269 \nU.S. 411, 413\n-414.\n\n4. The expansion by the Federal Rules of the allowable content of a proceeding and the range of a litigation inevitably enlarged the occasions for severing one aspect or portion of a litigation from what remains under the traditional test of a \"final decision.\" On the basis of prior cases, we held that it was not a departure from the policy against piecemeal appeals to permit an appeal with respect to that part of a multiple claims litigation based on a set of facts separate and independent from the facts on which the remainder of the litigation was based. Reeves v. Beardall, \n316 \nU.S. 283\n. The Note of the Advisory Committee, quoted supra, demonstrates that the amended Rule 54 (b) was designed in accordance with the historic policy against premature appeal and with the decisions of this Court allowing appeal from a \"judgment of a distinctly separate claim.\" What the Rule did introduce, however, was a discretionary power in the district judge to control appealability by preventing a party from even attempting to appeal a severable part of a litigation unless the district judge has expressly certified that there is no just reason for delay and has expressly directed entry of judgment on that phase of the litigation. This provision was directed to the kind of difficulty encountered in Dickinson v. Petroleum Conversion Corp., \n338 \nU.S. 507\n, in ascertaining whether the district judge is in fact finished with a separable part of the litigation. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 427, 443]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Court casually disregards this long history of 1291 and the bearing of Rule 54 (b) to it by rejecting the separate-and-independent test as the basis for determining the finality of a part of a multiple claims litigation. The Court says that its decision \"does not impair the statutory concept of finality embraced in 1291.\" The Court may not do so in words, for it pays lip-service to 1291. But that section's function as a brake against piecemeal appeals in future multiple claims litigation is greatly impaired. Encouragement is abundantly given to parties to seek such appeals.\n\nThe principles which this Court has heretofore enunciated over a long course of decisions under 1291 furnish ready guides for deciding the appealability of the certified parts of the litigation in the two cases now before the Court. Count II in Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Mackey, ante, p. 427, is appealable since the transactions and occurrences involved in it do not involve any of those embraced in Counts III and IV. Count I involves at least two transactions which are also the subject matter of Counts III and IV, but is appealable under 1292 (1) as an interlocutory order denying an injunction. In Cold Metal Process Co. v. United Engineering & Foundry Co., post, p. 445, the counterclaim, even if not compulsory, is based in substantial part on the transactions involved in the main litigation and hence not appealable.\n\n5. Of course, as the Court's opinion appears to recognize, that crucial principle of the doctrine of finality that the court of appeals has no jurisdiction unless there is a \"final decision\" cannot be left to the district court. It is one thing for a district court to determine whether it is or is not through with a portion of a litigation. It is quite another thing for it to determine whether the requirements of 1291 are satisfied so as to give jurisdiction to the court of appeals. A district court can no more confer \n\n[351 \nU.S. 427, 444]\n\u00a0\n jurisdiction on a court of appeals outside the limits of 28 U.S.C. 1291 than a state supreme court can confer jurisdiction on this Court beyond the bounds of 28 U.S.C. 1257. In a particular litigation the opinion of the district judge may properly be deemed a valuable guide. But flexibility would be a strange name for authority in the district court to command the court of appeals to exercise jurisdiction.\n\n6. In summary, then, the Court rightly states, even if it does not hold, that 1291 is unimpaired by Rule 54 (b). Section 1291 is what a long course of decision has construed it to be. The unifying principle of decisions for over a century is observance of hostility in the federal judicial system to piecemeal appellate review (with a few strictly defined exceptions not here relevant, see 28 U.S.C. 1292) of one litigation, no matter how many phases or parts there may be to a single judicial proceeding, so long as no part has become separated from, and independent of, the others. This rooted principle against piecemeal appeals of an organic whole - the core of 1291 - is not left unimpaired when its enforcement is committed without guidance to the individualized notions about finality of some two hundred and fifty district judges, themselves accountable to the discordant views of eleven essentially independent courts of appeals. Allowing such leeway to the district courts and courts of appeals is not flexibility but anarchy. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 427, 445]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","79":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE v. U.S.(1956)\nNo. 6\nArgued: October 12, 1955Decided: January 9, 1956\n\n\n\n\n The Interstate Commerce Commission issued an order approving tariff regulations providing that railroads will be responsible for claims for physical damage to shell eggs carried by them only to the extent that such damage is in excess of specified percentages or \"tolerances.\" The validity of the regulations was challenged on the ground that they violated 20 (11) of the Interstate Commerce Act, which provides that any carrier subject to the Act receiving property for interstate transportation \"shall be liable . . . for any loss, damage, or injury to such property caused by it\" and forbids any limitation of, or exemption from, such liability. The Commission had concluded that, since the tolerances represented pre-shipment and unavoidable damage not \"caused by\" the railroads, their deduction from damage claims could not limit the railroads' proper liability. Held: The Commission's findings were insufficient to support this conclusion or to establish that the tolerances permitted by its order will not operate to limit carrier liability in violation of 20 (11), and the Commission's order must be set aside.

JUSTICE CLARK.\n\nThese cases involve the validity of railroad tariff provisions exonerating the appellee railroads from liability for stated percentages of damage to shell eggs shipped over their lines. The cases come to us by direct appeal\n1\n from a judgment of a three-judge district court in Utah,\n2\n which dismissed an action brought to set aside and enjoin an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission\n3\n approving such tariff provisions. We noted probable jurisdiction on October 14, 1954.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nClaims against the railroads for damage to egg shipments steadily and rapidly increased in the years following 1939, particularly on shipments to the eastern sea-board area.\n5\n In 1950 the railroads, believing that because of the difficulties of proof they were being exposed to liability for damage for which they were not responsible, filed with the Commission proposed tariff provisions similar in form to those approved by the order under review. After an investigation and hearing,\n6\n the Commission concluded \n\n[350 \nU.S. 162, 164]\n\u00a0\n that egg shipments ordinarily contained substantial amounts of damage for which the railroads were not responsible - namely, (a) damage existing prior to shipment, and (b) damage unavoidably arising in transit because of the inherently fragile nature of eggs. The average amount of such damage was found to be 3% for eggs packaged at railhead points and 5% for those packaged elsewhere. On the basis of this finding, the Commission, although rejecting the higher-percentage provisions proposed by the railroads,\n7\n found reasonable - and hence authorized the railroads to include in their tariff schedules\n8\n - the following tolerance provision:\n\n \"On eggs placed in packages at rail point of origin  of the shipment, no claim shall be allowed where the  physical damage to the eggs at destination does not  exceed 3% of the contents of the packages containing  damaged eggs. Where damage exceeds 3%, claims  shall be allowed for all damage in excess of 3%, if  investigation develops carrier liability.\n\n\n \"Exception. - Where bona fide certificates of Federal  or State egg inspection agencies showing extent  of physical damage to eggs determined at rail point  of origin of the shipment immediately prior to tender  for rail transportation indicate the actual shell damage  to be other than 2%, the percentage of actual  damage as shown on such certificates, plus 1% shall  be used in lieu of 3% specified in this Section.\"\n\n\n An otherwise identical provision applicable to \"eggs placed in packages at points other than the rail point of \n\n[350 \nU.S. 162, 165]\n\u00a0\n origin\" was determined to be reasonable with a tolerance of 5%.\n\nIt is claimed that these tariff provisions violate 20 (11) of the Interstate Commerce Act, 24 Stat. 386, as amended, 49 U.S.C. 20 (11), which provides that any common carrier subject to the Act receiving property for interstate transportation \"shall be liable . . . for any loss, damage, or injury to such property caused by it . . ., and no contract, receipt, rule, regulation, or other limitation of any character whatsoever shall exempt such common carrier . . . from the liability hereby imposed . . . .\"\n\nThe Commission and the court below (one judge dissenting) held that the tolerance provisions did not violate 20 (11) because the pre-shipment and unavoidably-caused damage represented by the tolerances was not damage \"caused by\" the railroads; hence the tolerance regulations, in providing a means for determining the extent of such damage, did not limit the railroads' proper liability, but operated simply to eliminate from damage claims the damage for which the railroads were not liable.\n\nThe appellants attack the provisions on six principal grounds: (1) the Commission has no jurisdiction over damage claims and hence no power to prescribe regulations governing their disposition; (2) tolerances based on averages necessarily embrace a forbidden limitation of liability since, by definition, some shipments will contain less than the \"average\" damage, resulting in those cases in the carrier being relieved of its full liability; (3) the railroads are liable for in-transit damage even though \"unavoidable\";\n9\n (4) the averages found by the Commission are not supported by the evidence; (5) the approval of uniform nation-wide tolerances was unreasonable in light \n\n[350 \nU.S. 162, 166]\n\u00a0\n of the wide differences in the egg-damage experience of consignees located in different areas of the country;\n10\n and (6) the conclusion that the tolerances do not limit liability is not supported by the Commission's findings. Our agreement with this last contention makes it unnecessary for us to consider the other arguments, and we may assume, though we do not decide, that the tariff provisions are not invalid for any of the other reasons assigned.\n\nThe Commission's justification of the tolerance regulations as not limiting liability rests upon two distinct propositions: (1) that there is present in every case of eggs at destination physical damage not \"caused by\" the railroads - and hence for which they are not liable under 20 (11) - in the amount of the specified percentages; and (2) that the deduction of those percentages from damage claims operates merely to prevent liability for such damage from being improperly imposed on the railroads. We \n\n[350 \nU.S. 162, 167]\n\u00a0\n shall accept for purposes of discussion the validity of the first proposition. The infirmity we find in the Commission's report is rather that the second proposition is simply assumed and is supported by no findings upon which we can say that the Commission's conclusion was reasonably based. Such a conclusion being essential to remove the tolerance provisions from the prohibition of 20 (11), the lack of findings necessary to justify that conclusion renders invalid the Commission's order approving the tolerance regulations. See Florida v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 194, 215\n. Indeed, so far does the report fail to support the Commission's conclusion that it tends affirmatively to support precisely the opposite conclusion - namely, that the tolerances do unlawfully limit liability. We know of no better way to illustrate the inadequacies of the report than by showing the manner in which the inferences raised by it and unanswered by the Commission would, if accepted, lead to that opposing conclusion.\n\nIn the first place, we are unable to discover in the report any showing that damage claims include - or should reasonably be deemed to include - the exempt damage which is to be deducted from them. At common law, proof that a case of eggs contained a specified amount of damage for which the carrier was not liable would afford no defense to a damage claim not shown to include that damage. To complete the defense, some showing that the damage claimed included the exempt damage would be required, such as evidence that all of the damage had been found and claimed. Similarly, to justify a regulation authorizing the deduction from damage claims of a tolerance representing exempt damage, some basis for inferring that damage claims ordinarily include such damage would seem required, such as a finding that the type of inspection upon which damage claims are based is adequate to reveal substantially all the damage present in a case. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 162, 168]\n\u00a0\n\n\nFar from making such a finding, however, the Commission report indicates that damage claims normally do not include all the damage present in a case. As described by the Commission, the customary inspection at destination upon which damage claims are based is simply a visual examination of a layer of 36 eggs at a time, continuing only until a layer in the case with no visible damage is found, at which point none of the succeeding layers is even looked at.\n11\n Inasmuch as \"damage\" of the sort represented by the tolerances includes even the most minor shell imperfections, the inference seems inevitable that much damage is overlooked. This inference is strengthened by the Commission's statement that much of the damage normally present in a case could be found only \"by candling and clicking, and could not be detected by the kind of inspection performed at\" destination.\n12\n And that damage claims do not in practice include all damage is further indicated by the Department of Agriculture studies cited by the Commission in which the damage overlooked by customary inspections at destination was found to range between 3.6% and 7.3%.\n13\n Indeed, if the inferences suggested by these latter studies be accepted, it \n\n[350 \nU.S. 162, 169]\n\u00a0\n would appear that there is ordinarily overlooked in the destination inspection - and hence not included in damage claims - physical damage nearly equal to or greater than the exempt damage represented by the tolerances. If that be true, a further reduction of the claim by the full amount of the tolerance would necessarily operate to \"limit\" liability by approximately the full amount of the tolerance.\n\nNor is it an answer to this that the consignee is entitled to make a more thorough inspection than the prevailing practice entails. By in effect requiring a consignee to prove that his damage claim does not include the exempt damage, the tolerances would impose on the consignee the burden of disproving a defense which at common law it would be the carrier's burden to establish. Whether or not the Commission has power so to alter the burden of proof, there is nothing to indicate that it had any intention of doing so. The Commission seems to have believed that under the prevailing commercial practices the carriers were being exposed to an improper liability and that the tolerances, applied in the same commercial setting, would do no more than remedy that situation. It would pervert the Commission's purpose to deal realistically with a commercial problem now to seek to justify the tolerances on the ground that it is technically possible for consignees, by departing from the normal commercial practices, to avoid the limitation of liability caused by the tolerances. Especially is this true in the absence of any suggestion in the Commission's report that such a complete inspection by consignees would be commercially feasible.\n14\n\u00a0\n\n[350 \nU.S. 162, 170]\n\u00a0\n\n\nAnother inadequacy of the Commission's report arises from its failure to distinguish between different kinds of physical damage in the application of the tolerances. The most favorable evidence supporting the Commission's conclusions as to the extent of the damage not \"caused by\" the railroads was a Department of Agriculture study showing that at destination the average case of eggs contains 4.8% \"checked\" or \"stained\" eggs and 0.3% broken eggs.\n15\n Presumably, therefore, the tolerances approved by the Commission represent physical damage in the same proportions - that is, primarily checked and stained eggs with only a nominal percentage of broken eggs. Checked and stained eggs are salable at a reduced price and therefore, unlike broken eggs, represent only a partial loss. The tariff provisions, however, do not differentiate between these types of damage and apparently authorize the deduction of the full tolerance without regard to the nature of the damage claimed. But to permit the offsetting of checked and stained eggs, representing only a partial loss, against broken eggs, representing a total loss, would seem necessarily to limit the railroads' proper liability under 20 (11).\n\nA third major respect in which the Commission's report falls short of establishing that the tolerances will not limit \n\n[350 \nU.S. 162, 171]\n\u00a0\n liability results from its failure to consider the relationship between the physical damage represented by the tolerances and the legal loss for which damage claims are asserted. We have thus far assumed that \"physical damage\" could properly be equated with \"loss\" and have shown that, even on that assumption, the Commission has not shown the existence of a relationship between the damage represented by the tolerances and that included in damage claims which would justify the deduction authorized by the tariff provisions. In fact, however, it would appear that damage claims are based not on physical damage to individual eggs but rather on the loss of commercial acceptability of a case of eggs as a whole. As the Commission observed, the \"commercially sound\" case of eggs invariably contains some damage,\n16\n and it is apparently only when the damage is so great as to make a case commercially unacceptable for its grade that it loses value. When a commercially unsound case is received, the consignee, rather than suffer the presumably greater loss that would result from selling it at a lower grade or as salvage, ordinarily \"reconditions\" the case by replacing the visibly damaged eggs and, if necessary, the packaging materials. From the character of this process as described by the Commission,\n17\n it is apparent that the purpose is simply to make the case commercially sound and not to discover and remove all the damage present in the case. The damage claim, if liability is asserted against the carrier, then consists simply of the cost of reconditioning the case - that is, the labor and material costs plus the loss on the damaged eggs removed.\n18\n\u00a0\n\n[350 \nU.S. 162, 172]\n\u00a0\n\n\nViewed in the above terms, the probable effect of the tolerances on liability becomes even more apparent. Inasmuch as the highest grade specifications prescribed by the Department of Agriculture permit physical damage of 5%,\n19\n a case of eggs received at destination with only the tolerance damage of 3% or 5% would presumably be considered \"commercially sound\" and be salable at the full price. Thus it would seem that presence of the tolerance damage by itself causes the consignee no loss and affords no basis for a damage claim, and that it is only when there is additional damage, making it necessary to recondition the case to make it commercially sound, that there is a loss for which a claim may be asserted. And if the additional damage is caused by the railroad, it necessarily follows that the cost of the reconditioning made necessary only because of that damage is a loss \"caused by\" the railroad within 20 (11).\n20\n Any reduction of the damage claim in such circumstances would thus relieve the carrier of its proper liability.\n\nThe Commission's report thus leaves us not merely with uncertainty as to the impact of the tolerances, cf. United States v. Chicago, M., St. P. & P. R. Co., \n294 \nU.S. 499\n, \n\n[350 \nU.S. 162, 173]\n\u00a0\n 504-505, 510-511, but with the strong impression that they are likely to operate in a forbidden manner. The report contains no answers to the problems we have raised, if indeed the Commission considered them at all. Since the report falls far short of establishing that the tolerances will not operate to limit carrier liability in violation of 20 (11), the order of the Commission approving the tolerances must be set aside, and the judgment below\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 28 U.S.C. 1253, 2325.

See, e. g., Bills of Lading, 52 I. C. C. 671, 679; Chesapeake & O. R. Co. v. Thompson Mfg. Co., \n270 \nU.S. 416, 421\n-422; Adams Express Co. v. Croninger, \n226 \nU.S. 491, 506\n-507, 509. The \"unavoidable\" damage to eggs is claimed to be within the \"inherent vice\" exception. The appellants contend, however, that the exception does not include damage induced by external force, however slight or unavoidable, but is limited to loss or damage arising solely from the nature of the property without the intervention of human factors, such as loss from decay, fermentation, evaporation or natural shrinkage. See, e. g., Austin v. Seaboard R. Co., 188 F.2d 239, 240-241 (C. A. 5th Cir.); Akerly v. Railway Exp. Agency, 96 N. H. 396, 400-402, 77 A. 2d 856, 860-861; Jackson & Perkins Co. v. Mushroom Transp.

C. C., at 385-386, 392.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] 284 I. C. C., at 395.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] 284 I. C. C., at 393-394. In \"candling,\" each egg is placed before a light to disclose defects not otherwise detectable; in \"clicking,\" two eggs are knocked together, the sound revealing shell imperfections.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] 284 I. C. C., at 396. In answer to the implications of these uncontroverted studies, the Commission simply said: \"The record does not indicate the handling received by those particular shipments after they were delivered to the consignees. It does indicate, however, based on the number and amount of claims, that the inspection of shipments of eggs arriving at New York is being performed with a view to detecting all damaged eggs. Claims in amounts exceeding 50 percent of the revenue on the entire egg traffic to New York in 1947 do not appear to be based on a cursory inspection.\" Ibid. But this speculative reasoning hardly overcomes the Commission's own explicit finding of the inadequacy of the destination inspections to discover all the damage.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] To the contrary, the report notes that, despite the efforts of packers by careful inspection to eliminate all damage, \"absolute perfection is commercially impossible\" and a substantial amount is overlooked, 284 I. C. C., at 393, and the difficulties would seem even \n\n[350 \nU.S. 162, 170]\n\u00a0\n greater under the more adverse conditions prevailing at destination. Nor do the Department of Agriculture test studies upon which the tolerances were based indicate the feasibility of an inspection adequate to uncover all damage. The usual Department of Agriculture grading inspections involve an examination only of 100 eggs from each of 15 cases out of a carload, 284 I. C. C., at 393, and, while the Commission does not clearly say so, apparently the test studies utilized a similar spot-check inspection, from which the total amount of damage was simply inferred. Damage claims, on the other hand, can be asserted only for the damage that is actually found.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] 284 I. C. C., at 393-394. \"Checked\" eggs have slight cracks but the membrane is unbroken; \"stained\" eggs are sound eggs which have been stained by leakage from other eggs. Id., at 384, 385.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] 284 I. C. C., at 393.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] 284 I. C. C., at 395. The eggs are simply transferred from the damaged case to a new case a whole layer (36 eggs) at a time, in the course of which any obviously damaged eggs are removed and replaced.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] 284 I. C. C., at 385, 399.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 19\n] 284 I. C. C., at 401. Of this 5% (for Grade A or AA eggs), no more than 0.5% may consist of broken eggs. As appears above, however, the proportion of broken eggs represented by the tolerances is well within this limit.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 20\n] It seems immaterial that in a given case the consignee might remove more damage than the minimum necessary to make the case commercially sound. The cost of the extensive inspection that would be necessary to assure that precisely the right amount of damage is removed - a cost the consignee would presumably be entitled to recover - would defeat the mitigation of damages which is the very purpose of the reconditioning. The carrier can ask no more than that the consignee act reasonably in mitigating damages, and there is no suggestion that the commercially accepted method of reconditioning unsound cases is unreasonable.\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, concurring.\n\nIt seems desirable to state, summarily, the basis on which I join the Court's opinion.\n\nThe starting-point of the Court's determination of the issue in this case is recognition of the fact that the Cummins Amendment to the Interstate Commerce Act, 20 (11), does not constitute an affirmative congressional formulation of a carrier's liability for damage to goods transported by it. The legal import of that Amendment is to bar the Interstate Commerce Commission from legalizing tariffs limiting the common-law liability of a carrier for such damage. The common law, in imposing liability, dispensed with proof by a shipper of a carrier's negligence in causing the damage. But for breakage unavoidable in the nature of things - whether nature be operating within a thing or from without, it is equally an \"inherent vice\" - there would be no liability since the common law did not impose a liability unrelated to the carrier's conduct.\n\nThese are the general principles to be deduced from the cases decided at common law. A situation as complicated as the one before us precludes mechanical or mathematical application of these generalities. At common law, if a shipper sued for damage to eggs, the carrier \n\n[350 \nU.S. 162, 174]\n\u00a0\n might be able to introduce evidence demonstrating an established percentage of loss not in any sense caused by it. Such fact of inevitable loss could be established by adequately supported averages and would not require demonstration of the incidence of inevitable preshipment or in-transit damage in a particular shipment. To be sure, the shipper might then reply by proving an inevitable percentage of damage caused by the railroad which was undetected or undetectable at destination. One would have to reason from principle, as it is called, to conclude whether the common law would throw on the carrier the burden of showing that the total amount of such loss was inevitably represented in the shipper's damage claim or whether it would allow the carrier to subtract this inevitable damage from whatever damage claim was made and thus throw on the shipper the burden of finding all the damage if he wanted a full recovery.\n\nLikewise, if the common law allowed a carrier to urge that the shipper suffered no loss from the undetected or undetectable damage because he could get full price for the cases containing such damage, it might be equally open to the shipper to urge that the average inevitable loss which was being subtracted from his damage claim was made up in large part of damage which was equally undetectable by ordinary commercial inspection and could therefore not be represented in the damage claims that were being made. A further complicating factor is the fact that the grade specifications prescribed by the Department of Agriculture allow prescribed percentages of damage. See 284 I. C. C., at 401. For example, 5% shell damage is permitted in Grade AA and Grade A eggs, so that the presence of such damage does not prevent a shipper from receiving full price.\n\nThe Cummins Amendment requires that common-law principles of liability be not impaired. But the difficulties \n\n[350 \nU.S. 162, 175]\n\u00a0\n of proof and the presence of numerous complicating factors, some of which have been indicated, do not permit dogmatic views regarding the common law's treatment of such a situation as this. The unsuitability of common-law proceedings for the trial of such complicated issues was one of the main reasons why the Interstate Commerce Commission was established to deal with problems pertaining to railroad tariffs and the conflicting interests they entail. As long as the Commission is guided by the common-law principles governing the carriers' liability and takes due account of all the factors thereby involved, this Court must stay its hands. The order of the Commission in this case, however, is set aside because the Commission has not made clear the basis on which it approved the allowable \"tolerances\" in the sanctioned tariffs. Since the basis of the Commission's order is not clear, the foundation for the review of the order is wanting. United States v. Chicago, M., St. P. & P. R. Co., \n294 \nU.S. 499, 510\n-511.\n\nThis precondition of clarity for the findings of the Commission as a basis for review does not require us to establish the frailty of particular findings or to examine the correctness of alternative meanings to be attributed to dubious findings. An order of the Commission cannot stand if we cannot tell what it has decided or if it leaves foggy the basis of its conclusions.\n\nIn joining the opinion of the Court, therefore, I do not read it as implying that, because any proof of tolerances may have infirmities as a matter of mathematical demonstration or may offend theoretical arguments based on laws of probability, it may not satisfy the cruder standards of proof by which adjudications are made in courts of law and which may sustain determinations by the Interstate Commerce Commission. Specifically, I assume that the various inadequacies which generate the uncertainty \n\n[350 \nU.S. 162, 176]\n\u00a0\n in which the Commission's report leaves us are not to be deemed controlling rules of law in allowing the Commission to ascertain inevitable preshipment or intransit damage to eggs, i. e., tolerances, by such substantiality of proof as is appropriate to the subject matter.\n\nMR. JUSTICE MINTON, with whom MR. JUSTICE REED and MR. JUSTICE BURTON join, dissenting.\n\nThe Court's opinion does not meet the issue in this case as I see it. The principal question, as was freely conceded at the argument, was whether the Interstate Commerce Commission had the power to promulgate the regulation under 20 (11). The Court now accepts for the sake of argument that the Commission had the power and then proceeds to find the regulation unfair and unreasonable, although a similar regulation had been in effect since 1919. See National Poultry, Butter & Egg Assn. v. New York Central R. Co., 52 I. C. C. 47.\n\nIn an earlier case, in which the Commission had under consideration a tariff which provided certain deductions as an incident to the natural shrinkage of grain, it was claimed that the carrier could not so limit its liability because it violated 20 (11). The Commission said:\n\n \"There appears to be little or no merit in the contention that the rule violates the inhibition clause of the act against the limitation of liability, for the limitation is not against losses caused by the carrier or its connections, but rather against liability for losses due to the inherent nature of the commodities themselves and attributable to no human agency.\" A. B. Crouch Grain Co. v. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co., 41 I. C. C. 717-718. See also The Cummins Amendment, 33 I. C. C. 682.\n\n\n For loss in transportation due to the inherent nature of the goods a carrier is not liable. Chesapeake & O. R. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 162, 177]\n\u00a0\n Co. v. Thompson Mfg. Co., \n270 \nU.S. 416\n. Carrier liability must be limited to damage \"caused by it.\" Adams Express Co. v. Croninger, \n226 \nU.S. 491\n. A tolerance regulation that fairly takes into consideration the inherent nature of the goods and the damage existing prior to receipt by the carrier, as this regulation does, is not prohibited by 20 (11). Obviously there could not be a search and determination egg by egg as to whether the breakage was due to the fault of the carrier or to the inherent nature of the commodity. I think the Commission had the power to promulgate regulations prescribing, after full hearing, a reasonable deduction for loss due to the inherent defects of the commodity transported. The nature of the commodity and the impossibility of deciding this humpty-dumpty question of who or what broke the egg is a proper subject for regulation. Such a regulation would not be a limit of liability but a yardstick for measuring the damage not caused by the carrier but due to the inherent nature of the commodity.\n\nWhat the Commission did, after long investigation and experience with similar regulations since 1919, was to order that, as to shell eggs packaged at railpoint of origin, no claim should be allowed for damages not in excess of 3%. If in excess of 3% there could be recovery on showing that the damage was caused by the carrier. For eggs packaged off the railhead the tolerance was 5%.\n\nAs the basis for its action the Commission specifically found:\n\n \"We find that the present 5 percent tolerance on eggs, other than those rehandled and repacked at the rail point of origin, is not shown to be unreasonable or otherwise unlawful. We further find that the proposed tolerances of 4 percent on eggs packed at the rail point of origin, and 6 percent on eggs packed at points other than the rail point of origin have not \n\n[350 \nU.S. 162, 178]\n\u00a0\n been justified, but that tolerances of 3 and 5 percent, respectively, would be reasonable. . . .\" 284 I. C. C., at 403.\n\n\n The Commission report embodies basic findings to support this conclusion. For example, the Commission concluded, on the basis of certain Department of Agriculture studies, that 3.4% damage is the typical average damage existing in shipments of eggs when loaded into railroad cars at points of origin; and that an average of 1.7% damage was \"incident to the movement in transit.\" 284 I. C. C., at 393-394. Further, the Commission found that the commercial destination inspections at New York, the most important terminal for eggs shipped by rail, are \"performed with a view to detecting all damaged eggs.\" Id., at 396. The tolerances represent the considered judgment of the Commission, after hearing voluminous evidence as to the nature of shell eggs and the way they are handled at railpoint, off railpoint and during shipment. I cannot say that this is not an allowable judgment for the Commission to make. Certainly the treatment of this case by the majority does not make for clarity and understanding, and it leaves yet undecided the question whether the Commission has the power to make an order establishing such a regulation or tariff. I think the regulation is an adequate commercial approximation of noncarrier damage, and is reasonable and within the power of the Commission to make.\n\nFor these reasons, and for the reasons set forth at length in the opinion of the District Court, 119 F. Supp. 846, I would affirm the judgment. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 162, 179]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","80":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSHEPPARD v.

In this atmosphere of a 'Roman holiday' for the news media, Sam Sheppard stood trial for his life.' 165 Ohio St. 293, 294, 135 N.E.2d 340, 342. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 910\n, 911]\n\u00a0\n  The defendant claimed that a proceeding so infused and enveloped by the 'atmosphere of a 'Roman holiday\" precluded a fair trial and could not but deprive him of the due process of law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution. The Supreme Court of Ohio rejected this claim and the defendant then invoked the discretionary power of this Court to review the correctness of its decision. This Court in turn now refuses the defendant the opportunity to bring the case here for review.\n\n  Such denial of his petition in no wise implies that this Court approves the decision of the Supreme Court of Ohio. It means and means only that for one reason or another this case did not commend itself to at least four members of the Court as falling within those considerations which should lead this Court to exercise its discretion in reviewing a lower court's decision. For reasons that have often been explained the Court does not give the grounds for denying the petitions for certiorari in the normally more than 1,000 cases each year in which petitions are denied. It has also been explained why not even the positions of the various Justices in such cases are matters of public record. The rare cases in which an individual position is noted leave unillumined the functioning of the certiorari system, and do not reveal the position of all the members of the Court.

CO.(1956)\nNo. 150\nArgued: January 19, 1956Decided: February 27, 1956\n\n\n\n\n Petitioner, an independent contractor in the business of unloading gasoline, was instructed by the consignee to unload a tank car of gasoline which had been hauled by respondent railroad and which was located on a siding in its freight yards. While petitioner was standing on a board attached to the car near the dome, in order to unload the car by opening a valve inside the dome, the board broke and petitioner fell, sustaining injuries. The board, which was defective, was permanently fastened to the car near the dome and had been placed there for the purpose for which petitioner was using it. Held: The board was a safety appliance within the meaning of 2 and 3 of the Safety Appliance Act of 1910, and the railroad was absolutely liable for damages resulting from petitioner's injuries. Pp. 319-325.\n\n (a) The board here involved came within the meaning of the term \"running boards\" as used in 2 of the Act, which provides that \"all cars requiring . . . secure running boards shall be equipped with such . . . running boards.\" P. 321.\n\n\n (b) The fact that the Interstate Commerce Commission in its 1911 regulations under 3 has not specified uniform standards for such running boards is not a binding administrative determination that they are not \"running boards\" for the purposes of 2. Pp. 321-322.\n\n\n (c) Failure of the Commission to specify uniform standards for such running boards under 3 need not mean that the tank car was not a car \"requiring\" such a running board within the meaning of 2. Pp. 322-323.\n\n\n (d) If such a running board is provided by a railroad or the makers of the car and used by the railroad as an appliance necessary for the use of the car, it must be a safe board as required by 2. Pp. 323-324.\n\n\n (e) Section 2 is not limited to such running boards as are required only in the movement of the train. Pp. 324-325.\n\n\n (f) There is no merit in the railroad's contention that, since petitioner is not one of its employees, no duty is owed him under 2 of the Act.

Shepard argued the cause and filed a brief for respondent.\n\nRobert W. Ginnane and C. H. Johns filed a brief for the Interstate Commerce Commission, as amicus curiae, supporting respondent.\n\nMR. JUSTICE MINTON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nPetitioner, an independent contractor in the business of unloading gasoline, was instructed by the consignee to unload a tank car of gasoline which had been hauled by respondent Atlantic Coast Line and which was located at the time on a siding in respondent's freight yards. In order to release the gasoline through a hose attached to the bottom of the car, it was necessary to go to the dome on top of the car, remove the dome cap, and open a valve inside the dome. While petitioner and his helper were engaged in opening the valve, the board on which they were standing broke and petitioner fell, sustaining injuries. There is no dispute that the board was defective. It was a wooden board over seven feet long attached to the side of the tank near the top just below the dome by means of two triangular steel braces extending from the side of the tank at either end of the board.\n\nThe question presented here is whether this device, which for convenience we shall call a dome running board, is a safety appliance within the meaning of 2 and 3 of the Safety Appliance Act of 1910. Act of April 14, 1910, c. 160, 2 and 3, 36 Stat. 298, 45 U.S.C. 11 and 12.\n\nPetitioner brought suit in the District Court, alleging in one count of his amended complaint absolute liability for a violation of the Act and in a second count common-law negligence. The jury returned a general verdict in his \n\n[350 \nU.S. 318, 320]\n\u00a0\n favor. The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for a new trial on the negligence count alone, holding that the trial court erred in instructing that the dome running board was a safety appliance. 220 F.2d 242.\n1\n We granted certiorari because of the importance of the questions raised as to the proper interpretation of the Safety Appliance Act. \n350 \nU.S. 819\n.\n\nSection 2 of the Safety Appliance Act of 1910 provides in part:\n\n\". . . all cars requiring secure ladders and secure running boards shall be equipped with such ladders and running boards . . . .\"\n\n\n Section 3 provides:\n\n \"That within six months from the passage of this Act the Interstate Commerce Commission, after hearing, shall designate the number, dimensions, location, and manner of application of the appliances provided for by section two . . . and thereafter said number, location, dimensions, and manner of application as designated by said commission shall remain as the standards of equipment to be used on all cars subject to the provisions of this Act, unless changed by an order of said Interstate Commerce Commission . . . and failure to comply with any such requirement of the Interstate Commerce Commission shall be subject to a like penalty as failure to comply with any requirement of this Act. . . .\"\n2\n\u00a0\n\n\n Under the authority of 3, the Commission in 1911 promulgated regulations still in force providing in detail for \n\n[350 \nU.S. 318, 321]\n\u00a0\n one running board running around the perimeter, or at least the full length of the sides, of tank cars.\n3\n Such a board enables a trainman to walk the length of a tank car between cars adjoining it on either end. The regulations make no mention whatever by any name of dome running boards. Petitioner nevertheless contends that the dome running board is a required running board affording him protection under 2.\n\nThe obvious purpose of a dome running board is to provide a secure flooring for those who must perform operations in connection with the tank car dome. Clearly, the dome running board has major importance in loading and unloading operations. But a railroad man of over twenty-five years' experience testified that it also may be used to stand on in order to pass hand signals or repair minor troubles occurring while the train is en route. The dome running board is an integrated part of the exterior equipment of a tank car;\n4\n it functions as a permanently attached outside \"floor\" near the dome of the car. The testimony showed that railroad men, including respondent's employees, often refer to the dome running board as a running board. We hold that it comes within the meaning of the term \"running boards\" as used in 2.\n\nThe fact that the Commission in its 1911 regulations under 3 has not specified uniform standards for dome running boards is not a binding administrative determination that they are not running boards for the purposes of 2. The reason for the omission is apparently the Commission's view that only appliances affording safety while the train is moving need be standardized. But \n\n[350 \nU.S. 318, 322]\n\u00a0\n there is no showing that the regulations purport to exhaust by implication each category of statutory appliances listed in 2. Omission of dome running boards of itself show no more than that the Commission has not standardized all possible running boards within 2. Davis v. Manry, \n266 \nU.S. 401\n, is consistent with our view. There the court itself interpreted the language in 2 requiring grab irons \"on their roofs\" of \"cars having ladders\" to apply only to cars having roofs. It then pointed to the Commission's failure to standardize a grab iron over a standardized ladder on a tender without a roof only as a supporting \"practical construction\" of the section. Moreover, the Commission in that case, having standardized the ladder, had no alternative but to interpret the statutory word \"roofs\" by either standardizing a grab iron or not standardizing it. Here no such practical construction is implied by the failure to standardize.\n\nEven if the dome running board be properly characterized as a running board, respondent contends that, since 2 refers to \"cars requiring . . . secure running boards,\" the Commission's failure to standardize dome running boards under 3 constitutes an administrative determination that they are not required within the meaning of 2. The purpose of 3 was to provide uniformity in the location and characteristics of those appliances upon which railroad men, working \"always in haste, and often in darkness and storm,\" must \"instinctively\" rely in the hazards of their employment. Illinois Central R. Co. v. Williams, \n242 \nU.S. 462, 466\n.\n5\n Effectuation of such a purpose would require standardization of running boards which extend the length of train cars. But considerations of administrative expertise relevant to 3 are not equally applicable to the effectuation of the purpose of 2. The \n\n[350 \nU.S. 318, 323]\n\u00a0\n purpose of the latter section was \"to convert the general legal duty of exercising ordinary care to provide\" safety appliances on cars \"requiring [them] for their proper use\" into a \"statutory, an absolute and imperative duty, of making them `secure.'\" Illinois Central R. Co. v. Williams, supra. The purpose of 3 is to standardize the appliances required by 2. But it does not follow that appliances necessary and furnished for the safe use of the car, although not standardized under 3, are not within the sweep of 2. Clearly, those who work on train cars may necessarily have to rely on the security of a dome running board, although the purposes of that appliance may not require any unhesitating reliance on its uniform characteristics.\n\nIn the Williams case, supra, this Court held that the Commission's statutory power to postpone the effective date of its standardization regulations under 3 did not suspend the railroad's duty under 2 to make appliances secure. There was no question that the appliance in Williams was required, but the teaching of the case is that Commission action under 3 does not exhaust the commands of 2. See also Southern Pac. Co. v. Carson, 169 F.2d 734, holding a railroad liable under 2 for defects in an independent wooden club used to help turn a brake wheel where the wheel itself complied with the Commission's regulations, which made no mention of the club. We conclude that failure of the Commission to standardize the dome running board need not mean that it was not a required running board under 2. To hold otherwise would relieve railroads from the absolute duty under 2 to make safety appliances secure whenever new appliances are adopted which have not yet been standardized by the Commission.\n\nBoth the respondent and the manufacturer of the tank car considered that the dome running board was required for the proper use of the car. The railroad industry \n\n[350 \nU.S. 318, 324]\n\u00a0\n itself has recognized that tank cars require secure dome running boards. The Association of American Railroads safety appliance standards, largely identical to the Interstate Commerce Commission regulations, contain detailed uniform specifications for dome running boards,\n6\n and compliance with those safety standards is required for interchange of cars between lines.\n7\n Petitioner used the dome running board, not simply because it happened to be there, but also because it had to be there for him to perform his duties safely, and performance of his duties was essential to the operation of the tank car. At best, appliances standardized in Commission regulations represent the minimum of safety equipment, and there is no prohibition of additional safety appliances. If a dome running board is provided by the railroad or the makers of the car and used by the railroad as an appliance necessary for the use of the car, it must be a safe board as required by 2. Cf. Texas & Pacific R. Co. v. Rigsby, \n241 \nU.S. 33, 37\n.\n\nThe Commission, in a brief filed here, contends that only appliances designed to insure safety while the train is in movement are within 2, and, therefore, a dome running board cannot be a statutory running board. No case is cited to support this construction. Nothing in the language of 2 itself or in its legislative history indicates that it should be read so narrowly. Whether or not an appliance is designed to afford protection while the train is moving may provide the Commission with an appropriate guide for deciding which appliances should be standardized under 3. But there is no reason to import such a distinction into 2 in order to deny the \n\n[350 \nU.S. 318, 325]\n\u00a0\n humane benefits of the Act to those who perform dangerous work on train cars that are not moving. Section 2 is not limited to such running boards as are required only in the movement of the train. The dome running board here was required for the use of the car. Section 2 required it to be safe, although regulations pursuant to 3 had not standardized it.\n\nThere is no merit in respondent's contention that, since petitioner is not one of its employees, no duty is owed him under 2 of the Act. Having been upon the dome running board for the purpose of unloading the car, he was a member of one class for whose benefit that device is a safety appliance under the statute. As to him, the violation of the statute must therefore result in absolute liability. Coray v. Southern Pacific Co., \n335 \nU.S. 520\n; Brady v. Terminal Railroad Assn., \n303 \nU.S. 10\n; Fairport, P. & E. R. Co. v. Meredith, \n292 \nU.S. 589\n; Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Layton, \n243 \nU.S. 617\n.

Code of Rules for the Interchange of Traffic (1952 ed.), Rules 3 (s) (1), 3 (r) (7).\n\nMR. JUSTICE REED, with whom MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER and MR. JUSTICE BURTON join, dissenting.\n\nThe ultimate question presented by this case is whether the defective dome platform\n1\n which caused petitioner's injury is a safety appliance within the meaning of 2 of the Act of April 14, 1910, c. 160, 36 Stat. 298, 45 U.S.C. 11. The Court holds that the dome platform is a \n\n[350 \nU.S. 318, 326]\n\u00a0\n \"running board\" within the meaning of 2, and that the tank car involved here was a car \"requiring\" the platform.\n\nFirst, it can hardly be said that the dome platform is a running board as that term is used in 2 of the Act. It appears that every device regulated by the Safety Appliance Act is principally designed for use by, and for the protection of, trainmen while railroad cars are in motion. Certainly there is no indication that this legislation was meant to regulate all devices and appliances employed on railroad cars; and there is nothing in the legislative history upon which to base a belief that equipment designed principally for loading and unloading cars, such as a dome platform, was to be covered by the statute. Moreover, while a dome platform might be loosely spoken of as a running board, it does not appear that it falls within the technical definition of that term as used in the trade. A running board is a \"plane surface, made of boards or special metal structure, for trainmen to walk or run on.\"\n2\n The platform involved here is used principally to stand on to give convenient access to the top of the dome.\n\nHowever, the principal ground upon which I dissent is aside from the question whether a dome platform is a \"running board\" under 2. Assuming that it is, it does not follow that the respondent violated the Act. Pursuant to such an assumption, I will read 2 of the statute as though the words \"dome platforms\" appear in the place of \"running boards.\" But even then not every \n\n[350 \nU.S. 318, 327]\n\u00a0\n defective dome platform is prohibited by the statute. So far as pertinent here, 2 provides that \"all cars requiring . . . secure running boards [viz., dome platforms] shall be equipped with such . . . .\" The congressional mandate then is merely that railroad carriers shall provide secure dome platforms on cars \"requiring\" them. No other dome platforms would be safety appliances under this Act. Therefore, the inquiry here narrows to whether this tank car \"required\" a dome platform.\n\nSection 2 does not itself indicate any means for determining which cars require running boards (dome platforms), and thus does not specify which dome platforms, if any, are safety appliances.\n3\n However, 3 of the Act provides that within six months \"the Interstate Commerce Commission, after hearing, shall designate the number, dimensions, location, and manner of application of the appliances provided for by section two of this Act . . .\"\n4\n and that those designations are to remain as railroad equipment standards unless changed by the Commission.\n5\n It seems inescapable, just as a matter of \n\n[350 \nU.S. 318, 328]\n\u00a0\n logic, that since 3 gave to the Commission the duty to determine, among other things, how many of the \"required\" 2 appliances shall be used and where they shall be placed, the Commission was thereby meant to determine which are cars \"requiring\" running boards (dome platforms), and therefore which dome platforms, if any, are safety appliances. Moreover, if it be assumed that the statute is ambiguous in this matter, the other alternative is to leave to the courts the determination of which types of cars require dome platforms, or any other 2 equipment except sill steps and handbrakes, to be revealed ad hoc. The creation of such uncertainties is not to be favored. But in view of the existence of the Interstate Commerce Commission, an administrative expert in the safety requirements of the railroad industry, coupled with the explicit delegation to the Commission by 3 of the authority to designate the number and location of the appliances required by 2, it would seem difficult to conclude anything but that Congress made railroads responsible as insurers only for such running boards as the Commission, not the courts, might determine are required. This purpose of Congress is even more clear from the words of the Act itself than it is from the Code sections, codified long after the regulations were issued.\n\nThis leads me to examine the regulations promulgated by the Interstate Commerce Commission pursuant to 3 of the Act. As previously noted, that section required the Commission to prescribe the uniform standards applicable to the safety appliances set forth in 2. Nowhere in the regulations (49 CFR 131.1 et seq.) does the Commission prescribe dome platform equipment for tank \n\n[350 \nU.S. 318, 329]\n\u00a0\n cars.\n6\n It follows that tank cars are not cars \"requiring\" dome platforms. Therefore, the absence of such equipment on tank cars, or the presence of such equipment in a defective condition, should not constitute a violation of the Act. Of course, this would not mean that railroads could with impunity employ insecure dome platforms on their tank cars, or for that matter, any defective equipment not covered by the Safety Appliance Act. That Act does not supplant the basic law of negligence, and this petitioner has preserved his right of recovery for any negligence.\n\nThe fact that the Association of American Railroads prescribes dome platforms for tank cars in its safety appliance standards\n7\n does not suggest a different result. The Association is not entrusted with the enforcement of this statute or with its reach; and while it is commendable that it has adopted standards in this instance which require equipment beyond that which may be covered by the Safety Appliance Act, if I am correct as to the duties of the Commission, the action of the Association cannot supplant the determinations of the Commission.\n\nThis Court has never before held that railroad car equipment not specifically required by statute or regulation can be treated as governed by the Safety Appliance Act. That issue has been ruled upon in accordance with this dissent in Central Vermont R. Co. v. Perry, 10 F.2d 132. There the trial court had instructed the jury affirmatively on the application of the Safety Appliance \n\n[350 \nU.S. 318, 330]\n\u00a0\n Act with respect to the absence of a footboard across the rear of a tender. Without deciding whether the footboard was a running board within the meaning of 2 of the 1910 Act, and evidently upon the assumption that it was, the court said:\n\n \"As the Safety Appliance Act and its supplements do not require a footboard at the rear end of the tender of a shifting engine and the regulations of the Interstate Commerce Commission do not require one, . . . we are of the opinion that the court erred in its instruction to the jury.\" Id., at 137.\n\n\n The position herein expressed is not contrary to Illinois Central R. Co. v. Williams, \n242 \nU.S. 462\n. That case involved a defective handhold at the top of a ladder on a boxcar. Section 2 of the Act provides for secure ladders on all cars \"requiring\" them, and, on \"all cars having ladders,\" it provides for secure handholds at the top of the ladders. The Court commented that \"A box car could not properly be used without a secure ladder and . . . all cars having ladders must be equipped with secure hand holds . . . .\" Id., at 464. But I do not understand this to have been a holding by the Court that, apart from any Interstate Commerce Commission determination, boxcars require secure ladders. At most the comment was a dictum, since it was clearly not necessary to decide whether the car involved required a secure ladder. The car had a ladder, and all cars \"having ladders shall also be equipped with secure hand holds or grab irons on their roofs . . . .\" Moreover, as later appears in that case, the Commission had previously issued an order designating the number, dimensions, location, and manner of application of ladders on boxcars. While that order granted an extension of time of five years within which to comply with the standards therein prescribed, it nonetheless constituted a Commission determination that boxcars \n\n[350 \nU.S. 318, 331]\n\u00a0\n require secure ladders within the meaning of 2. For similar reasons Texas & Pacific R. Co. v. Rigsby, \n241 \nU.S. 33\n, is not contrary to this dissent. See Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co. v. Scarlett, \n300 \nU.S. 471\n.\n\nFinally, continuing to assume that a dome platform is a running board under 2, and now upon the further assumption that the courts were meant to decide which cars require them, a dissent is still indicated. In these circumstances, consistent with the normal rule, great respect should be given to the interpretation of an act by the administrative agency designated to administer it.\n8\n As has been observed, the regulations of the Interstate Commerce Commission prescribing the uniform standards applicable to 2 safety appliances omit to mention dome platform equipment for tank cars. Thus the Commission does not understand dome platforms to be \"required\" for tank cars under 2. If it had so understood, it is reasonable to believe it would have provided standards for such equipment in its regulations. Moreover, at the request of the Court, the Commission advised by brief in this case that the dome platform was not even a running board, much less a required running board. Following this Court's ruling in Davis v. Manry, \n266 \nU.S. 401\n, this \"construction by the Commission - the tribunal to which the application of 2 is entrusted and which would be solicitous to enforce it -\" should be followed. Id., at 404-405.\n\nFor these reasons the judgment should be affirmed.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The device involved in this case is denominated a dome platform in the Car Builders' Cyclopedia (18th ed. 1949-1951) 253.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Car Builders' Cyclopedia (19th ed. 1953) 51. Substantially the same definition of the term appears in each of the other eighteen editions of this volume, the first of which was published in 1879 as \"The Car-Builder's Dictionary.\" That edition was published so as to alleviate the \"inconvenience, confusion, and delay . . . caused . . . by want of common names for the different parts of [railroad] cars.\" Preface, The Car-Builders' Dictionary (1879). See also note 1, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Section 2 does, however, specify which cars require sill steps and handbrakes. \"All cars must be equipped with secure sill steps and efficient hand brakes . . . .\" (Italics supplied.) Assuming that \"sill steps\" and \"hand brakes\" include all devices falling within those terms when used generically, it would seem that all such devices are safety appliances and must meet the statutory standard of \"secure\" or \"efficient.\" Cf. Southern Pac. Co. v. Carson, 169 F.2d 734.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The quoted phrase does not appear in 45 U.S.C. 12, the Code section corresponding to 3 of the Act. The phrase evidently was omitted from the Code as being fully executed at the time the Code was compiled.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The Act became law on April 14, 1910. Thus, the Commission had until October 13, 1910, within which to adopt its standardizing regulations. Such regulations were adopted on October 13, 1910, by Commission order. Subsequently, on March 13, 1911, the Commission adopted another order superseding the order of October 13, 1910. 49 CFR 131.1 et seq. However, the effective date of the mandate \n\n[350 \nU.S. 318, 328]\n\u00a0\n of 2 was, by its terms, not until July 1, 1911, over three months after the final promulgation of the Commission regulations. There was thus no time lag, either actual or contemplated, between the effective date of 2 and the I. C. C. determinations.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] 49 CFR 131.8 (b) and 131.9 (c) are the only regulations relating to running boards on tank cars, and it is clear, as well as conceded, that those subsections do not require a running board of any sort at or near the dome of these cars.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] A.

JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis appeal brings into question the constitutionality of 903 of the Charter of the City of New York. That section provides that whenever an employee of the City utilizes the privilege against self-incrimination to avoid answering a question relating to his official conduct, \"his term or tenure of office or employment shall terminate and such office or employment shall be vacant, and he shall not be eligible to election or appointment to any office or employment under the city or any agency.\"\n1\n Appellant Slochower invoked the privilege against self-incrimination \n\n[350 \nU.S. 551, 553]\n\u00a0\n under the Fifth Amendment before an investigating committee of the United States Senate, and was summarily discharged from his position as associate professor at Brooklyn College, an institution maintained by the City of New York. He now claims that the charter provision, as applied to him, violates both the Due Process and Privileges and Immunities Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nOn September 24, 1952, the Internal Security Subcommittee of the Committee on the Judiciary of the United States Senate held open hearings in New York City. The investigation, conducted on a national scale, related to subversive influences in the American educational system. At the beginning of the hearings the Chairman stated that education was primarily a state and local function, and therefore the inquiry would be limited to \"considerations affecting national security, which are directly within the purview and authority of the subcommittee.\" Hearings Before the Subcommittee to Investigate the Administration of the Internal Security Act and Other Internal Security Laws of Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 82d Cong., 2d Sess. 1. Professor Slochower, when called to testify, stated that he was not a member of the Communist Party, and indicated complete willingness to answer all questions about his associations or political beliefs since 1941. But he refused to answer questions concerning his membership during 1940 and 1941 on the ground that his answers might tend to incriminate him. The Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee accepted Slochower's claim as a valid assertion of an admitted constitutional right.\n\nIt had been alleged that Slochower was a Communist in 1941 in the testimony of one Bernard Grebanier before the Rapp-Coudert Committee of the New York Legislature. See Report of the Subcommittee of the Joint Legislative Committee to Investigate Procedures and Methods of \n\n[350 \nU.S. 551, 554]\n\u00a0\n Allocating State Moneys for Public School Purposes and Subversive Activities, Legislative Document (1942), No. 49, State of New York, at 318. Slochower testified that he had appeared twice before the Rapp-Coudert Committee, and had subsequently testified before the Board of Faculty relating to this charge. He also testified that he had answered questions at these hearings relating to his Communist affiliations in 1940 and 1941.\n\nShortly after testifying before the Internal Security Subcommittee, Slochower was notified that he was suspended from his position at the College; three days later his position was declared vacant \"pursuant to the provisions of Section 903 of the New York City Charter.\"[fn[*]]\n\nSlochower had 27 years' experience as a college teacher and was entitled to tenure under state law. McKinney's New York Laws, Education Law, 6206 (2). Under this statute, appellant may be discharged only for cause, and after notice, hearing, and appeal. 6206 (10). The Court of Appeals of New York, however, has authoritatively interpreted 903 to mean that \"the assertion of the privilege against self incrimination is equivalent to a resignation.\" Daniman v. Board of Education, 306 N. Y. 532, 538, 119 N. E. 2d 373, 377. Dismissal under this provision is therefore automatic and there is no right to charges, notice, hearing, or opportunity to explain.\n\nThe Supreme Court of New York, County of Kings, concluded that appellant's behavior fell within the scope of 903, and upheld its application here. 202 Misc. 915, 118 N. Y. S. 2d 487. The Appellate Division, 282 App. Div. 718, 122 N. Y. S. 2d 286, reported sub nom. Shlakman v. Board, and the Court of Appeals, reported \n\n[350 \nU.S. 551, 555]\n\u00a0\n sub nom. Daniman v. Board, supra, each by a divided court, affirmed. We noted probable jurisdiction, \n348 \nU.S. 935\n, because of the importance of the question presented.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nSlochower argues that 903 abridges a privilege or immunity of a citizen of the United States since it in effect imposes a penalty on the exercise of a federally guaranteed right in a federal proceeding. It also violates due process, he argues, because the mere claim of privilege under the Fifth Amendment does not provide a reasonable basis for the State to terminate his employment. Appellee insists that no question of \"privileges or immunities\" was raised or passed on below, and therefore directs its argument solely to the proposition that 903 does not operate in an arbitrary or capricious manner. We do not decide whether a claim under the \"privileges or immunities\" clause was considered below, since we conclude the summary dismissal of appellant in the circumstances of this case violates due process of law.\n\nThe problem of balancing the State's interest in the loyalty of those in its service with the traditional safeguards of individual rights is a continuing one. To state that a person does not have a constitutional right to government employment is only to say that he must comply with reasonable, lawful, and nondiscriminatory terms laid down by the proper authorities. Adler v. Board of Education, \n342 \nU.S. 485\n, upheld the New York Feinberg Law which authorized the public school authorities to \n\n[350 \nU.S. 551, 556]\n\u00a0\n dismiss employees who, after notice and hearing, were found to advocate the overthrow of the Government by unlawful means, or who were unable to explain satisfactorily membership in certain organizations found to have that aim.\n3\n Likewise Garner v. Los Angeles Board, \n341 \nU.S. 716, 720\n, upheld the right of the city to inquire of its employees as to \"matters that may prove relevant to their fitness and suitability for the public service,\" including their membership, past and present, in the Communist Party or the Communist Political Association. There it was held that the city had power to discharge employees who refused to file an affidavit disclosing such information to the school authorities.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nBut in each of these cases it was emphasized that the State must conform to the requirements of due process. In Wieman v. Updegraff, \n344 \nU.S. 183\n, we struck down a so-called \"loyalty oath\" because it based employability solely on the fact of membership in certain organizations. We pointed out that membership itself may be innocent and held that the classification of innocent and guilty together was arbitrary.\n5\n This case rests squarely on the proposition that \"constitutional protection does extend to the public servant whose exclusion pursuant to a statute is patently arbitrary or discriminatory.\" \n344 \nU.S., at 192\n.\n\nHere the Board, in support of its position, contends that only two possible inferences flow from appellant's claim \n\n[350 \nU.S. 551, 557]\n\u00a0\n of self-incrimination: (1) that the answering of the question would tend to prove him guilty of a crime in some way connected with his official conduct; or (2) that in order to avoid answering the question he falsely invoked the privilege by stating that the answer would tend to incriminate him, and thus committed perjury. Either inference, it insists, is sufficient to justify the termination of his employment. The Court of Appeals, however, accepted the Committee's determination that the privilege had been properly invoked and it further held that no inference of Communist Party membership could be drawn from such a refusal to testify. It found the statute to impose merely a condition on public employment and affirmed the summary action taken in the case. With this conclusion we cannot agree.\n\nAt the outset we must condemn the practice of imputing a sinister meaning to the exercise of a person's constitutional right under the Fifth Amendment. The right of an accused person to refuse to testify, which had been in England merely a rule of evidence, was so important to our forefathers that they raised it to the dignity of a constitutional enactment, and it has been recognized as \"one of the most valuable prerogatives of the citizen.\" Brown v. Walker, \n161 \nU.S. 591, 610\n. We have reaffirmed our faith in this principle recently in Quinn v. United States, \n349 \nU.S. 155\n. In Ullmann v. United States, \n350 \nU.S. 422\n, decided last month, we scored the assumption that those who claim this privilege are either criminals or perjurers. The privilege against self-incrimination would be reduced to a hollow mockery if its exercise could be taken as equivalent either to a confession of guilt or a conclusive presumption of perjury. As we pointed out in Ullmann, a witness may have a reasonable fear of prosecution and yet be innocent of any wrongdoing. The privilege serves to protect the innocent who otherwise might \n\n[350 \nU.S. 551, 558]\n\u00a0\n be ensnared by ambiguous circumstances. See Griswold, The Fifth Amendment Today (1955).\n\nWith this in mind, we consider the application of 903. As interpreted and applied by the state courts, it operates to discharge every city employee who invokes the Fifth Amendment. In practical effect the questions asked are taken as confessed and made the basis of the discharge. No consideration is given to such factors as the subject matter of the questions, remoteness of the period to which they are directed, or justification for exercise of the privilege. It matters not whether the plea resulted from mistake, inadvertence or legal advice conscientiously given, whether wisely or unwisely. The heavy hand of the statute falls alike on all who exercise their constitutional privilege, the full enjoyment of which every person is entitled to receive. Such action falls squarely within the prohibition of Wieman v. Updegraff, supra.\n\nIt is one thing for the city authorities themselves to inquire into Slochower's fitness, but quite another for his discharge to be based entirely on events occurring before a federal committee whose inquiry was announced as not directed at \"the property, affairs, or government of the city, or . . . official conduct of city employees.\" In this respect the present case differs materially from Garner, where the city was attempting to elicit information necessary to determine the qualifications of its employees. Here, the Board had possessed the pertinent information for 12 years, and the questions which Professor Slochower refused to answer were admittedly asked for a purpose wholly unrelated to his college functions. On such a record the Board cannot claim that its action was part of a bona fide attempt to gain needed and relevant information.\n\nWithout attacking Professor Slochower's qualification for his position in any manner, and apparently with full knowledge of the testimony he had given some 12 years \n\n[350 \nU.S. 551, 559]\n\u00a0\n before at the state committee hearing, the Board seized upon his claim of privilege before the federal committee and converted it through the use of 903 into a conclusive presumption of guilt. Since no inference of guilt was possible from the claim before the federal committee, the discharge falls of its own weight as wholly without support. There has not been the \"protection of the individual against arbitrary action\" which Mr. Justice Cardozo characterized as the very essence of due process. Ohio Bell Telephone Co. v. Commission, \n301 \nU.S. 292, 302\n.\n\nThis is not to say that Slochower has a constitutional right to be an associate professor of German at Brooklyn College. The State has broad powers in the selection and discharge of its employees, and it may be that proper inquiry would show Slochower's continued employment to be inconsistent with a real interest of the State. But there has been no such inquiry here. We hold that the summary dismissal of appellant violates due process of law.\n\nThe judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n    Reversed and remanded.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE BLACK and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS join the Court's judgment and opinion, but also adhere to the views expressed in their dissents in Adler v. Board of Education, and Garner v. Los Angeles Board, supra, and to their concurrences in Wieman v. Updegraff, supra.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The full text of 903 provides:\n\n\"If any councilman or other officer or employee of the city shall, after lawful notice or process, wilfully refuse or fail to appear before any court or judge, any legislative committee, or any officer, board or body authorized to conduct any hearing or inquiry, or having appeared shall refuse to testify or to answer any question regarding the property, government or affairs of the city or of any county included within its territorial limits, or regarding the nomination, election, appointment or official conduct of any officer or employee of the city or of any such county, on the ground that his answer would tend to incriminate him, or shall refuse to waive immunity from prosecution on account of any such matter in relation to which he may be asked to testify upon any such hearing or inquiry, his term or tenure of office or employment shall terminate and such office or employment shall be vacant, and he shall not be eligible to election or appointment to any office or employment under the city or any agency.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] [Reporter's Note: A sentence which was reported in the Preliminary Print at p. 554, lines 13-18, was deleted by an order of the Court entered May 28, 1956, \n351 \nU.S. 944\n.]\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Thirteen other individuals brought suit for reinstatement after their dismissal for pleading the privilege against self-incrimination in the same federal investigation.

JUSTICE BURTON and MR. JUSTICE MINTON join, dissenting.\n\nIn reliance upon the Due Process Clause of our Constitution, the Court strikes deep into the authority of New York to protect its local governmental institutions from influences of officials whose conduct does not meet \n\n[350 \nU.S. 551, 560]\n\u00a0\n the declared state standards for employment. This New York City Charter, 903, adopted in 1936, to take effect in 1938, was designed to eliminate from public employment individuals who refused to answer legally authorized inquiries as to the \"official conduct of any officer or employee of the city . . . on the ground that his answer would tend to incriminate him.\" Its provisions, as applicable to Professor Slochower and others, have been upheld by the Court of Appeals of New York under multi-pronged state grounds of attack in the instances where he and other city teachers of New York have sought to bar their removal from their positions.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nThe sole reliance of the Court for reversal of the New York Court of Appeals is that 903, as here applied, violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution. The Court of Appeals amended its remittitur to show that it held federal due process was not violated. 307 N. Y. 806, 121 N. E. 2d 629. In view of the conclusions of the Court of Appeals we need deal only with that problem. The Court of Appeals has exclusive power to determine the reach of its own statute. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 551, 561]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Court finds it a denial of due process to discharge an employee merely because he relied upon the Fifth Amendment plea of self-incrimination to avoid answering questions which he would be otherwise required to answer. We assert the contrary - the city does have reasonable ground to require its employees either to give evidence regarding facts of official conduct within their knowledge or to give up the positions they hold. Petitioners never contended that error or inadvertence led them to refuse to answer. Their contention is set out in the margin below.\n2\n Discharges under 903 do not depend upon any conclusion as to the guilt of the employee of some crime that might be disclosed by his testimony or as to his guilt or perjury, if really there was no prosecution to fear. We disagree with the Court's assumption that 903 as a practical matter takes the questions asked as confessed. Cities, like other employers, may reasonably conclude that a refusal to furnish appropriate information is enough to justify discharge. Legally authorized bodies have a right to demand that citizens furnish facts pertinent to official inquiries. The duty to respond may be refused for personal protection against prosecution only, but such avoidance of public duty to furnish information can properly \n\n[350 \nU.S. 551, 562]\n\u00a0\n be considered to stamp the employee as a person unfit to hold certain official positions. Such a conclusion is reinforced when the claimant for protection has the role of instructor to youth. The fact that the witness has a right to plead the privilege against self-incrimination protects him against prosecution but not against the loss of his job.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nThe Court may intend merely to hold that since the facts of Slochower's alleged Communist affiliations prior to 1941 were known to the Board before the federal claim, and since the inquiries of the Committee were asked for a purpose unrelated to his college functions, therefore it was a denial of due process to vacate his office. If so, its conclusion is likewise, we think, erroneous. We agree that this case is not like Garner v. Los Angeles Board, \n341 \nU.S. 716\n, an attempt to elicit information about professional qualifications. But 903 is directed at the propriety of employing a man who refuses to give needed information to appropriate public bodies.\n\nConsideration of the meaning of \"due process\" under the Fourteenth Amendment supports our position that 903 of the City Charter does not violate that concept. For this Court to hold that state action in the field of its unchallenged powers violates the due process of the Federal Constitution requires far more than mere disagreement with the legal conclusions of state courts. To require, as the Court does, that New York stay its hand in discharging a teacher whom the city deems unworthy to occupy a chair in its Brooklyn College, demands that this Court say, if it follows our prior cases, that the action of the Board in declaring Professor Slochower's position \n\n[350 \nU.S. 551, 563]\n\u00a0\n vacant was inconsistent with the fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base of all our civil and political institutions.\n4\n A denial of due process is \"a practice repugnant to the conscience of mankind.\"\n5\n Surely no such situation exists here.\n\nThose charged with educational duties in a State bear heavy responsibilities. Only a few years ago, in Adler v. Board of Education, \n342 \nU.S. 485\n, we upheld against three dissents the Feinberg Law of New York making ineligible for employment as a teacher in any public school a member of any subversive organization, if he knew its purpose. The argument that the \"fact found bears no relation to the fact presumed,\" i. e., \"disqualification for employment,\" was rejected. There also the contention was denial of due process. We said:\n\n \"A teacher works in a sensitive area in a schoolroom.  There he shapes the attitude of young minds towards  the society in which they live. In this, the state  has a vital concern. It must preserve the integrity  of the schools. That the school authorities have the  right and the duty to screen the officials, teachers,  and employees as to their fitness to maintain the  integrity of the schools as a part of ordered society,  cannot be doubted. One's associates, past and present,  as well as one's conduct, may properly be considered  in determining fitness and loyalty.\" Id., at  493.\n\n\n A great American university has declared that members of its faculty who invoked the Fifth Amendment before committees of Congress were guilty of \"misconduct\" \n\n[350 \nU.S. 551, 564]\n\u00a0\n though not grave enough to justify dismissal.\n6\n Numerous other colleges and universities have treated the plea of the Fifth Amendment as a justification for dismissal of faculty members.\n7\n When educational institutions themselves feel the impropriety of reserving full disclosure of facts from duly authorized official investigations, can we properly say a city cannot protect itself against such conduct by its teachers?\n\nThe New York rule is not the patently arbitrary and discriminatory statute of Wieman v. Updegraff, \n344 \nU.S. 183\n. There \"[a] state servant may have joined a proscribed organization unaware of its activities and purposes.\" P. 190. This Court unanimously condemned as arbitrary the requirement of an oath that covered both innocent and knowing membership without distinction. A different situation exists here. Section 903 was included \n\n[350 \nU.S. 551, 565]\n\u00a0\n in the Seabury Report to help in the elimination of graft and corruption.\n8\n Numerous employees had refused to testify as to criminal acts on the ground of self-incrimination. New York decided it did not want that kind of public employees. We think New York had that right. We would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Matter of Daniman v. Board of Education, Matter of Shlakman v. Board of Higher Education, 306 N. Y. 532, 119 N. E. 2d 373.\n\n\"In this court we are all agreed that the Communist party is a continuing conspiracy against our Government. . . . We are also all in agreement that an inquiry into past or present membership in the Communist party is an inquiry regarding the official conduct of an officer or employee of the City of New York.

Internal security affects local as well as National Governments.\" Id., at 540-541, 119 N. E. 2d, at 379. The majority decided 903 was applicable to a \"hearing before a Federal legislative committee\" and that this appellant was an employee of the city. Id., at 541, 119 N.

The Subcommittee acquiesced in the refusal of petitioners to answer such questions.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Cf. Ullmann v.

Above all, he owes his colleagues in the university complete candor and perfect integrity, precluding any kind of clandestine or conspiratorial activities. He owes equal candor to the public. If he is called upon to answer for his convictions it is his duty as a citizen to speak out. It is even more definitely his duty as a professor. Refusal to do so, on whatever legal grounds, cannot fail to reflect upon a profession that claims for itself the fullest freedom to speak and the maximum protection of that freedom available in our society. In this respect, invocation of the Fifth Amendment places upon a professor a heavy burden of proof of his fitness to hold a teaching position and lays upon his university an obligation to reexamine his qualifications for membership in its society.\n\n .  .  .   .   .\n\n\n\n\". . .

JUSTICE HARLAN, dissenting.\n\nI dissent because I think the Court has misconceived the nature of 903 as construed and applied by the New York Court of Appeals, and has unduly circumscribed the power of the State to ensure the qualifications of its teachers.\n\nAs I understand MR. JUSTICE CLARK'S opinion, the Court regards 903 as raising some sort of presumption of guilt from Dr. Slochower's claim of privilege. That is not the way the Court of Appeals construed the statute. On the contrary, that Court said: \"we do not presume, of course, that these petitioners [one of whom was Dr. Slochower] by their action have shown cause to be discharged under the Feinberg Law (L. 1949, ch. 360) since no inference of membership in the Communist party may be drawn from the assertion of one's privilege against self incrimination.\"\n1\n Since 903 is inoperative if even incriminating answers are given, it is apparent that it is the exercise of the privilege itself which is the basis for the discharge, quite apart from any inference of guilt. Thus the Court of Appeals could say that \"The assertion of the privilege against self incrimination is equivalent to a resignation.\"\n2\n It is also clear that the Board of Education's discharge of Dr. Slochower was on this same \n\n[350 \nU.S. 551, 566]\n\u00a0\n premise. The question this case presents, therefore, is not whether any inferences can constitutionally be drawn from a claim of privilege, but whether a State violates due process when it makes a claim of privilege grounds for discharge.\n\nIn effect, what New York has done is to say that it will not employ teachers who refuse to cooperate with public authorities when asked questions relating to official conduct. Does such a statute bear a reasonable relation to New York's interest in ensuring the qualifications of its teachers? The majority seems to decide that it does not. This Court has already held, however, that a State may properly make knowing membership in an organization dedicated to the overthrow of the Government by force a ground for disqualification from public school teaching. Adler v. Board of Education, \n342 \nU.S. 485\n. A requirement that public school teachers shall furnish information as to their past or present membership in the Communist Party is a relevant step in the implementation of such a state policy, and a teacher may be discharged for refusing to comply with that requirement. Garner v. Los Angeles Board, \n341 \nU.S. 716\n. Moreover, I think that a State may justifiably consider that teachers who refuse to answer questions concerning their official conduct are no longer qualified for public school teaching, on the ground that their refusal to answer jeopardizes the confidence that the public should have in its school system. On either view of the statute. I think Dr. Slochower's discharge did not violate due process.\n\nIt makes no difference that the question which Dr. Slochower refused to answer was put to him by a federal rather than a state body. The authority of the subcommittee to ask the question is not controverted. While as an original matter I would be doubtful whether 903 was intended to apply to federal investigations, the \n\n[350 \nU.S. 551, 567]\n\u00a0\n Court of Appeals has ruled otherwise, and its interpretation is binding on us. Dr. Slochower cannot discriminate between forums in deciding whether or not to answer a proper and relevant question, if the State requires him to answer before every lawfully constituted body. Here, the information sought to be elicited from Dr. Slochower could have been considered by state authorities in reviewing Dr. Slochower's qualifications, and the effect of his claim of privilege on the public confidence in its school system was at least as great as it would have been had his refusal to answer been before a state legislative committee.\n\nThere is some evidence that Dr. Slochower had already answered, before a state committee, the same question which he refused to answer before the congressional subcommittee.\n3\n Even assuming that New York already had the information, I cannot see how that would prevent New York from constitutionally applying 903 to this claim of privilege. Apart from other considerations, who can tell whether Dr. Slochower would have answered the question the same way as he had before?\n\nOn this record I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.

This shop contains a department for repair of petitioner's cars temporarily removed from service and a department engaged in the construction of new cars for use in interstate commerce by petitioner and a subsidiary.\n\nRespondents Gileo, Eufrazia and Eelk were employed by petitioner in Shop No. 9. Gileo worked on repair of petitioner's cars already in service for almost 10 years prior to his transfer to new car construction 5 months before he was injured. Eufrazia did repair work for 9 months before he was assigned to new car construction a month prior to his injury. Eelk had worked a month on repairs, was transferred to new car construction for 5 weeks, was reassigned to repair work for a month and had been back on new car construction for 3 months when he incurred his injury. Thus, all three of these respondents had at one time worked on repair jobs in Shop No. 9, but there is no dispute that they were engaged exclusively in new car construction when their injuries were incurred. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 493, 495]\n\u00a0\n\n\nRespondents brought separate suits against petitioner for recovery under the F. E. L. A. Respondent Gileo sued in the Superior Court for the City and County of San Francisco, and respondents Eufrazia and Eelk sued in the Superior Court for the County of Sacramento. In all three suits, petitioner claimed that the F. E. L. A. did not apply because neither it nor respondents were engaged in interstate commerce and that therefore the courts were without jurisdiction to entertain the actions, the exclusive remedy for injured employees in these circumstances resting with the Industrial Accident Commission under the California Workmen's Compensation Act. This challenge to the jurisdiction of the court was rejected in the Gileo case, the court ruling as a matter of law that the F. E. L. A. governed the situation before it. Petitioner having stipulated the issues of negligence and the amount of damages, judgment was entered for Gileo. The trial court in the Eufrazia and Eelk cases ruled in favor of petitioner's contention that it lacked jurisdiction because the F. E. L. A. was not applicable, and judgment was entered for petitioner before trial was had on the issues of negligence and damages. The Supreme Court of California held, in separate decisions, that the Act applied to each of the respondents.\n2\n We granted certiorari, \n350 \nU.S. 818\n, because the cases involve interpretation of an important federal statute governing railroad employer obligations to its injured employees.\n\nIn the Eufrazia and Eelk cases, the Supreme Court of California simply entered an order reversing the decisions \n\n[351 \nU.S. 493, 496]\n\u00a0\n of the trial court. Unlike Gileo, petitioner did not stipulate with respect to the issues of negligence and damages. There were no trials of these issues, and, under California practice, the effect of the Supreme Court of California's unqualified reversal is to remand the cases to the trial court. See Gospel Army v. Los Angeles, \n331 \nU.S. 543, 546\n. Since the issues of negligence and damages remain to be tried, there is no final judgment in the highest court of the State, and this Court, therefore, lacks jurisdiction to review the Eufrazia and Eelk cases. 28 U.S.C. 1257. We therefore dismiss the writs in those two cases.\n\nThe sole question which the Gileo case presents is whether or not an employee of an interstate rail carrier who is injured while performing work on new cars to be used in interstate commerce by the carrier and its subsidiary can maintain an action for damages against his employer under the F. E. L. A., as amended.\n\nSection 1 of the F. E. L. A., with which we are here concerned, originally provided that \"every common carrier by railroad while engaging in commerce\" between the States \"shall be liable in damages to any person suffering injury while he is employed by such carrier in such commerce\" for injury or death resulting wholly or partly from the negligence of the carrier.\n3\n This Court early \n\n[351 \nU.S. 493, 497]\n\u00a0\n construed the statute to require that the employee be \"at the time of the injury engaged in interstate transportation or in work so closely related to it as to be practically a part of it\" in order to qualify for coverage under the Act. Shanks v. Delaware, L. & W. R. Co., \n239 \nU.S. 556, 558\n. Later, in Raymond v. Chicago, M. & St. P. R. Co., \n243 \nU.S. 43, 45\n, and New York Central R. Co. v. White, \n243 \nU.S. 188, 192\n, this Court held that employees engaged in or connected with new construction for their railroad employers were not engaged in interstate commerce within the meaning of the Act and were therefore not entitled to its benefits. See also Pedersen v. Delaware, L. & W. R. Co., \n229 \nU.S. 146, 152\n. The \"moment of injury\" and \"new construction\" doctrines were the source of much confusion to the railroads, their employees and the courts, with the result that the reports were replete with decisions drawing very fine distinctions in determining whether an employee was engaged in interstate commerce within the contemplation of the Act so as to entitle him to bring suit for damages thereunder for injuries incurred while in the carrier's employ. The uncertainty had grown to such proportions that Congress, in 1939, added the following paragraph to 1 of the Act:\n4\n\u00a0\n\n \"Any employee of a carrier, any part of whose duties as such employee shall be the furtherance of interstate or foreign commerce; or shall, in any way directly or closely and substantially, affect such commerce as above set forth shall, for the purposes of this Act, be considered as being employed by such \n\n[351 \nU.S. 493, 498]\n\u00a0\n carrier in such commerce and shall be considered as entitled to the benefits of this Act and of an Act entitled `An Act relating to the liability of common carriers by railroad to their employees in certain cases' (approved April 22, 1908), as the same has been or may hereafter be amended.\"\n\n\n The Senate, in its report on the amendments to the Act, characterized one aim of the amendment in this manner: \"1. It broadens and clarifies the law in its application to employees who may be killed or injured while in the service of a railroad company engaged in interstate or foreign commerce.\"\n5\n Petitioner concedes that the 1939 amendment abolishes the \"moment of injury\" rule of the Shanks case, supra. But it vigorously contends that, because Congress, in amending the Act, did not alter the first paragraph of 1, it is liable only for employee injuries incurred while the railroad is \"engaging in commerce\" between the States. It is argued that, since the railroad was here engaged in the construction of new cars, which activity, under the \"new construction\" doctrine of Raymond and White, supra, is not commerce between the States, employees injured while engaging in new construction are not covered by the 1939 amendment. With this we cannot agree.\n\nThe 1939 amendment to 1 of the Act provides that \"[a]ny employee of a carrier, any part of whose duties as such employee shall be the furtherance of interstate or foreign commerce; or shall, in any way directly or closely and substantially, affect such commerce,\" as described in the first paragraph of 1, \"shall, for the purposes of this Act, be considered as being employed by such carrier in such commerce and shall be considered as entitled to the benefits\" of the Act. This amendatory language makes it plain that if a railroad employee either \n\n[351 \nU.S. 493, 499]\n\u00a0\n furthers interstate commerce in the performance of any part of his duties or in any way \"directly or closely and substantially\" affects such commerce, Congress has placed such an employee on an equal footing, for purposes of coverage under the Act, with those employees who, prior to the 1939 amendment, were held to be employed by the railroads in commerce between the States. Therefore, in determining whether respondent Gileo is entitled to the benefits of the F. E. L. A., the pertinent inquiry is not whether \"new construction\" is interstate commerce under the test of Raymond and White. Rather, the crucial question is whether any part of Gileo's duties as a railroad employee furthers interstate commerce or in any way directly or closely and substantially affects such commerce.\n\nPetitioner is engaged in the manufacture of its own railroad cars for use in performing its transportation function in interstate commerce. Such new construction is an integral element in the carrier's total operations, and it follows that workmen employed to build these new cars perform duties which are in \"furtherance\" of interstate commerce. Furthermore, in carrying out these duties, such employees affect interstate commerce \"directly or closely and substantially.\" Failure to perform their duties would preclude delivery to the railroad of cars which it considers essential to its transportation needs and would substantially impede the carrier's performance of its transportation function and thus the interstate commerce in which it is engaged. This interpretation is consistent with the letter and spirit of the 1939 amendment, which Congress enacted to cure the evils of hypertechnical distinctions which had developed in over 30 years of F. E. L. A. litigation. Whatever justification there may have been before the amendment for holding that employees working on repairs of a railroad's instrumentalities were engaged in interstate commerce and therefore \n\n[351 \nU.S. 493, 500]\n\u00a0\n entitled to the benefits of the Act, Pedersen v. Delaware, L. & W. R. Co., supra, while those who were working on construction of new railroad facilities were not engaged in interstate commerce and therefore were not covered by the Act, Raymond and White, supra, has been swept away by the 1939 amendment. This Court recently rejected the \"new construction\" doctrine in determining whether an employee is \"engaged in commerce\" within the meaning of a like provision in the Fair Labor Standards Act. Mitchell v. C. W. Vollmer & Co., \n349 \nU.S. 427\n. We hold that 1 of the F. E. L. A., as amended, covers respondent Gileo.\n\nRespondent Aranda was injured while employed by petitioner as a wheel molder in its wheel foundry at Sacramento, California. There wheels are made to be joined to axles which form the truck base for the petitioner's cars, both new and those already in interstate service. Since wheels which wear out cannot be repaired, they must be recast or remolded and, as a result, worn wheels are continually shipped from all points on petitioner's rail network to its Sacramento foundry for remolding and eventual return to petitioner's rolling stock. A certain level of inventory is indispensable to effective utilization of this mode of operation. The operation itself is a vital link in the chain of petitioner's function as an interstate rail carrier. It is thus plain that Aranda's duties as a wheel molder both served to further interstate commerce and directly or closely and substantially affected such commerce. We therefore hold that he is entitled to the benefits of the Act.\n\nRespondent Moreno was employed as a laborer and was injured while laying rails in a retarder yard which petitioner was constructing for the purpose of facilitating the movement of freight trains in interstate commerce by use of a new \"switching\" method. The yard was to be used in connection with petitioner's main line of track. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 493, 501]\n\u00a0\n It was opened to interstate traffic 4 months after Moreno was injured. Passage of the 1939 amendment makes unnecessary indulgence in nice distinctions relating to whether Moreno was engaged in new construction or construction which, although new, was merely a substitute for petitioner's existing method of switching cars. Cf. Agostino v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 50 F. Supp. 726. In view of what we have said above, it is clear that Moreno, in the performance of his duties, was furthering interstate commerce and that his work directly or closely and substantially affected commerce, within the meaning of the 1939 amendment.\n\nThe judgments in\n\n  Gileo v. Southern Pacific Co.,\n\n\n  Aranda v. Southern Pacific Co.,\n\n\n  Moreno v. Southern Pacific Co., are\n\n\n       Affirmed.\n\n\n The writs in\n\n  Eufrazia v. Southern Pacific Co.,\n\n\n  Eelk v.

Eufrazia and Southern Pacific Co. v. Eelk must be dismissed because they were improvidently granted for want of final state court judgments. Regarding Southern Pacific Co. v.

CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe question presented is whether the proceeds of the sale by the United States Government of standing timber on allotted lands on the Quinaielt Indian Reservation may be made subject to capital-gains tax, consistently with applicable treaty and statutory provisions and the Government's role as respondents' trustee and guardian.\n\nWhen white men first came to the Olympic Peninsula, in what is now the State of Washington, they found the Quinaielt Tribe of Indians and their neighboring allied tribes occupying a tract of country lying between the \n\n[351 \nU.S. 1, 3]\n\u00a0\n Coast Range and the Pacific Ocean. This vast tract, with the exception of a small portion reserved for their exclusive use, was ceded by the Quinaielts and their neighbors to the United States in exchange for protection and tutelage by the treaty of July 1, 1855, and January 25, 1856, 12 Stat. 971. According to this treaty, the Quinaielts were to have exclusive use of their reservation \"and no white man shall be permitted to reside thereon without permission of the tribe . . . .\" Article II. Years later, Congress passed the General Allotment Act of 1887.\n1\n Thereunder, Indians were to be allotted lands on their reservations not to exceed 160 acres of grazing land or 80 acres of agricultural land,\n2\n and 25 years after allotment the allottees were to receive the lands discharged of the trust under which the United States had theretofore held them, and to obtain a patent \"in fee, discharged of said trust and free of all charge or incumbrance whatsoever,\"\n3\n though the President might extend the period.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nRespondents, husband and wife, were born on the reservation, and are described by the Government as full-blood, noncompetent Quinaielt Indians. They have lived on the reservation all their lives with the exception of the time served by respondent husband in the Armed Forces of the United States during World War II.\n\nPursuant to the treaty and under the General Allotment Act of 1887, respondent husband was allotted from the treaty-guaranteed reservation 93.25 acres and received \n\n[351 \nU.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n a trust patent\n5\n therefor dated October 1, 1907.\n6\n During the tax year here in question, the fee title to this land was still held by the United States in trust for him, and was not subject to alienation or encumbrance by him, except with the consent of the United States Government, which consent had never been given. The land was forest land, covered by coniferous trees from one hundred years to several hundred years old. It was not adaptable to agricultural purposes, and was of little value after the timber was cut.\n\nIn the year 1943, the Bureau of Indian Affairs of the United States Department of the Interior entered into a contract of sale for the standing timber on respondent's allotted land for the total price of $15,080.80. The Government received the sum of $8,418.28 on behalf of respondent in that year.\n7\n\u00a0\n\n[351 \nU.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n\n\nUpon demand of petitioner, Collector of Internal Revenue for the District of Washington, respondents filed a joint income tax return on October 10, 1947, for the tax year 1943, reporting long-term capital gain from the sale of the timber in that year. Simultaneously, they paid the taxes shown due. Thereafter, they filed a timely claim for refund of the taxes paid and contended that the proceeds from the sale of timber from the allotted land were not subject to federal income taxation because such taxation would be in violation of the provisions of the Quinaielt Treaty, the trust patent, and the General Allotment Act. The claim for refund was denied, and this action was instituted. The District Court found that the tax had been unlawfully collected and ordered the refund. 110 F. Supp. 924. The Court of Appeals, agreeing with the District Court but recognizing a conflict between this case and the decision of the Tenth Circuit in the case of Jones v. Taunah, 186 F.2d 445, affirmed. 220 F.2d 349. Because of the apparent conflict, we granted certiorari. \n350 \nU.S. 816\n.\n\nThe Government urges us to view this case as an ordinary tax case without regard to the treaty, relevant statutes, congressional policy concerning Indians, or the \n\n[351 \nU.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n guardian-ward relationship between the United States and these particular Indians. It argues:\n\n\"As citizens of the United States they are taxable under the broad provisions of Sections 11 and 22 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, which imposes a tax on the net income of every individual, derived from any source whatever. There is no exemption from tax in the Quinaielt Treaty, the General Allotment Act, the taxing statute, or in any other legislation dealing with taxpayers' affairs. . . .\n\n\n \"Even if it be assumed that the United States would be prohibited from imposing a direct tax on the allotted land held in trust for the taxpayers, there would, nevertheless, be no prohibition against a federal tax on the income derived from the land, since a tax on such income is not the same as a tax on the source of the income, the land.\"\n8\n\u00a0\n\n\n We agree with the Government that Indians are citizens and that in ordinary affairs of life, not governed by treaties or remedial legislation, they are subject to the payment of income taxes as are other citizens. We also agree that, to be valid, exemptions to tax laws should be clearly expressed. But we cannot agree that taxability of respondents in these circumstances is unaffected by the treaty, the trust patent or the Allotment Act.\n\nThe courts below held that imposition of the tax here in question is inconsistent with the Government's promise to transfer the fee \"free of all charge or incumbrance whatsoever.\" Although this statutory provision is not expressly couched in terms of nontaxability, this Court has said that\n\n\"Doubtful expressions are to be resolved in favor of the weak and defenseless people who are the wards \n\n[351 \nU.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n of the nation, dependent upon its protection and good faith. Hence, in the words of Chief Justice Marshall, `The language used in treaties with the Indians should never be construed to their prejudice. If words be made use of, which are susceptible of a more extended meaning than their plain import, as connected with the tenor of the treaty, they should be considered as used only in the latter sense.' Worcester v. The State of Georgia, 6 Pet. 515, 582.\" Carpenter v. Shaw, \n280 \nU.S. 363, 367\n.\n\n\n Thus, the general words \"charge or incumbrance\" might well be sufficient to include taxation. But Congress, in an amendment to the General Allotment Act, gave additional force to respondents' position. Section 6 of that Act was amended to include a proviso -\n\n\"That the Secretary of the Interior may, in his discretion, and he is authorized, whenever he shall be satisfied that any Indian allottee is competent and capable of managing his or her affairs at any time to cause to be issued to such allottee a patent in fee simple, and thereafter all restrictions as to sale, incumbrance, or taxation of said land shall be removed and said land shall not be liable to the satisfaction of any debt contracted prior to the issuing of such patent . . . .\"\n9\n\u00a0\n\n\n The Government argues that this amendment was directed solely at permitting state and local taxation after a transfer in fee, but there is no indication in the legislative history of the amendment that it was to be so limited.\n10\n The fact that this amendment antedated the federal income tax by 10 years also seems irrelevant. The \n\n[351 \nU.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n literal language of the proviso evinces a congressional intent to subject an Indian allotment to all taxes only after a patent in fee is issued to the allottee. This, in turn, implies that, until such time as the patent is issued, the allotment shall be free from all taxes, both those in being and those which might in the future be enacted.\n11\n\u00a0\n\nThe first opinion of an Attorney General touching on this question seemed to construe the language of the amendment to Section 6 as exempting from the income tax income derived from restricted allotments.\n12\n And even without such a clear statutory basis for exemption, a later Attorney General advised that he was -\n\n\"[U]nable, by implication, to impute to Congress under the broad language of our Internal Revenue Acts an intent to impose a tax for the benefit of the Federal Government on income derived from the restricted property of these wards of the nation; property the management and control of which rests largely in the hands of officers of the Government charged by law with the responsibility and duty of protecting the interests and welfare of these dependent people. In other words, it is not lightly to be assumed that Congress intended to tax the ward for the benefit of the guardian.\"\n13\n\u00a0\n\n\n Two of these opinions were published as Treasury Decisions.\n14\n On the basis of these opinions and decisions, and a series of district and circuit court decisions, it was said by Felix S. Cohen, an acknowledged expert in \n\n[351 \nU.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n Indian law, that \"It is clear that the exemption accorded tribal and restricted Indian lands extends to the income derived directly therefrom.\"\n15\n These relatively contemporaneous official and unofficial writings are entitled to consideration. The Government makes much of a subsequent Attorney General's opinion,\n16\n which expressly overruled an earlier opinion,\n17\n on the authority of Superintendent of Five Civilized Tribes v. Commissioner, \n295 \nU.S. 418\n.\n\nThat case is distinguishable from the case at hand. It involved what the Court characterized as \"income derived from investment of surplus income from land,\"\n18\n or income on income, which Cohen termed \"reinvestment income.\" The purpose of the allotment system was to protect the Indians' interest and \"to prepare the Indians to take their place as independent, qualified members of the modern body politic.\" Board of Commissioners v. Seber, \n318 \nU.S. 705, 715\n. To this end, it is necessary to preserve the trust and income derived directly therefrom, but it is not necessary to exempt reinvestment income from tax burdens. It is noteworthy that the Superintendent case did not involve an attempt to tax the land \"surplus.\"\n19\n\u00a0\n\n[351 \nU.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe wisdom of the congressional exemption from tax embodied in Section 6 of the General Allotment Act is manifested by the facts of the instant case. Respondent's timber constitutes the major value of his allotted land. The Government determines the conditions under which the cutting is made.\n20\n Once logged off, the land is of little value.\n21\n The land no longer serves the purpose for which it was by treaty set aside to his ancestors, and for which it was allotted to him. It can no longer be adequate to his needs and serve the purpose of bringing him finally to a state of competency and independence. Unless the proceeds of the timber sale are preserved for respondent, he cannot go forward when declared competent with the necessary chance of economic survival in competition with others. This chance is guaranteed by the tax exemption afforded by the General Allotment Act, and the solemn undertaking in the patent. It is unreasonable to infer that, in enacting the income tax law. Congress intended to limit or undermine the Government's undertaking. To tax respondent under these circumstances would, in the words of the court below, be \"at the least, a sorry breach of faith with these Indians.\"\n22\n\u00a0\n\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is\n\n       Affirmed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE HARLAN took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 24 Stat. 388, 25 U.S.C. 331 et seq.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 25 U.S.C. 331.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Id., 348.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Ibid. The trust period here involved has regularly been extended by Executive Order. See note following 25 U.S.C. 348, and see 25 U.S.C. 462, which provides: \"The existing periods of trust placed upon any Indian lands and any restriction on alienation thereof are extended and continued until otherwise directed by Congress.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The term \"patent\" inadequately describes respondent's interest. \"Congress . . . was careful to avoid investing the allottee with the title in the first instance, and directed that there should be issued to him what . . . is in reality an allotment certificate . . . .\" Monson v. Simonson, \n231 \nU.S. 341, 345\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] In pertinent part, the patent provides: \"Now know ye, That the United States of America, in consideration of the premises, has allotted, and by these presents does allot, unto the said Horton Capoeman, the land above described, and hereby declares that it does and will hold the land thus allotted (subject to all statutory provisions and restrictions) for the period of twenty-five years, in trust for the sole use and benefit of the said Indian, and that at the expiration of said period the United States will convey the same by patent to said Indian, in fee, discharged of said trust and free of all charge or incumbrance whatsoever, . . . .\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] This sale seems to have followed a pattern generally adopted by the Government in selling timber from Indian allotments. Huge areas of forest are put up for competitive bids by lumber companies. These tracts include the tribal forest lands and individual allotments, with the consent of tribal councils and individual allottees. The successful bidder is required to make an immediate advance payment \n\n[351 \nU.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n of a large proportion of the estimated value of the lumber in the tract. Since as much as 640 million board feet have been sold at one time, this requirement makes it economically infeasible for any but the largest companies to submit bids. The uncertainties of such large scale operations, which are to be carried on over 25- or 30-year periods, coupled with local quality and accessibility variables, has resulted in substantially lower than prevailing market bids. In some instances, the return to other sellers of comparable timber was two or three times that received by the Indians.

MITCHELL(1956)\nNo. 22\nArgued: November 16, 1955Decided: January 30, 1956\n\n\n\n\n Workers in a plant manufacturing wet storage batteries, in which extensive use is made of dangerously caustic and toxic materials, are compelled by vital considerations of health and hygiene and by other considerations to change clothes before and after work and to shower after work in facilities which state law requires their employer to provide. Held: Changing clothes and showering are parts of their \"principal,\" rather than their \"preliminary\" or \"postliminary,\" activities, within the meaning of 4 (a) (2) of the Portal-to-Portal Act, and the time spent in these activities must be counted in measuring the work-time for which compensation is required by the Fair Labor Standards Act.

With her on the brief were Solicitor General Sobeloff, Ralph S. Spritzer, Stuart Rothman and Sylvia S. Ellison. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 247, 248]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis case raises an issue of coverage under the Fair Labor Standards Act, as amended by the Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947, with respect to work performed before or after the direct or productive labor for which the worker is primarily paid.\n\nThe precise question is whether workers in a battery plant must be paid as a part of their \"principal\" activities for the time incident to changing clothes at the beginning of the shift and showering at the end, where they must make extensive use of dangerously caustic and toxic materials, and are compelled by circumstances, including vital considerations of health and hygiene, to change clothes and to shower in facilities which state law requires their employer to provide, or whether these activities are \"preliminary\" or \"postliminary\" within the meaning of the Portal-to-Portal Act and, therefore, not to be included in measuring the work time for which compensation is required under the Fair Labor Standards Act.\n\nThe Secretary of Labor, contending that these activities are so covered, brought this action in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee to enjoin petitioners from violating the overtime and record-keeping requirements of Sections 7 and 11 (c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, in the employment of production workers, and from violating Section 15 (a) (1) of the Act by making interstate shipments of the goods produced by such workers.\n\nThe District Court gave judgment for the plaintiff, and the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed. 215 F.2d 171. Because of the importance of the interpretation of the portal-to-portal provisions in the administration of the Fair Labor Standards Act, and because of a conflict between the circuits on the subject, Mitchell v. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 247, 249]\n\u00a0\n King Packing Co., 216 F.2d 618, we granted certiorari in both cases, \n349 \nU.S. 914\n.\n\nThere is no question of back pay involved here because the Court limited its judgment to prospective relief. Nor is the question of changing clothes and showering under normal conditions involved because the Government concedes that these activities ordinarily constitute \"preliminary\" or \"postliminary\" activities excluded from compensable work time as contemplated in the Act. It contends, however, that such activities in the circumstances of this case are an integral and indispensable part of the production of batteries, the \"principal activity\" in which these employees were engaged, and are, therefore, compensable under the relevant provisions of the Act.\n\nThe petitioners own and operate a plant where they are engaged in manufacturing automotive-type wet storage batteries which they sell in interstate commerce. All of the production employees, such as those with whom we are here concerned, customarily work with or near the various chemicals used in the plant. These include lead metal, lead oxide, lead sulphate, lead peroxide, and sulphuric acid. Some of these are in liquid form; some are in powder form, and some are solid. In the manufacturing process, some of the materials go through various changes and give off dangerous fumes. Some are spilled or dropped, and thus become a part of the dust in the air. In general, the chemicals permeate the entire plant and everything and everyone in it. Lead and its compounds are toxic to human beings. Regular exposure to atmosphere containing 1.5 milligrams or more of lead per 10 cubic meters is regarded by the medical profession as hazardous and involving the possibility of lead intoxication or lead poisoning. In battery plants, such as this one, it is \"almost impossible,\" it was testified, to keep lead concentration in the air \"within absolutely safe limits,\" and in petitioners' plant \"lead oxide was on the floor \n\n[350 \nU.S. 247, 250]\n\u00a0\n and in the air and on the plates which employees handled.\" Abnormal concentrations of lead were discovered in the bodies of some of petitioners' employees, and petitioners' insurance doctor recommended that such employees be segregated from their customary duties. The primary ways in which lead poisoning is contracted are by inhalation and ingestion; i. e., by taking in particles through the nose or mouth, an open cut or sore, or any other body cavity. The risk is \"very great\" and even exists outside the plant because the lead dust and lead fumes which are prevalent in the plant attach themselves to the skin, clothing and hair of the employees. Even the families of battery workers may be placed in some danger if lead particles are brought home in the workers' clothing or shoes. Sulphuric acid in the plant is also a hazard. It is irritating to the skin and can cause severe burns. When the acid contacts clothing, it causes disintegration or rapid deterioration. Moreover, the effects of sulphuric acid make the employee more susceptible than he would otherwise be to contamination by particles of lead and lead compounds.\n\nPetitioners, like other manufacturers, try to minimize these hazards by plant ventilation, but industrial and medical experts are in agreement that ventilation alone is not sufficient to avoid the dangers of lead poisoning. Safe operation also requires the removal of clothing and showering at the end of the work period. This has become a recognized part of industrial hygiene programs in the industry, and the state law of Tennessee requires facilities for this purpose. Tenn. Code Ann. (Williams 1934), 1952 Supp., Section 5788.15. In addition, the Tennessee Workmen's Compensation Act, Tenn. Code Ann. (Williams 1934), 1952 Supp., Sections 6851-6901, which covers petitioners, makes lead poisoning a compensable occupational disease (Section 6852 (d)). In order to comply with this statute, petitioners carry insurance, under Section 6895, to protect against liability, and \n\n[350 \nU.S. 247, 251]\n\u00a0\n the insurance carrier would not accept the insurance risk if defendants refused to have showering and clothes-changing facilities for their employees.\n\nAccordingly, in order to make their plant as safe a place as is possible under the circumstances and thereby increase the efficiency of its operation, petitioners have equipped it with shower facilities and a locker room with separate lockers for work and street clothing. Also, they furnish without charge old but clean work clothes which the employees wear. The cost of providing their own work clothing would be prohibitive for the employees, since the acid causes such rapid deterioration that the clothes sometimes last only a few days. Employees regularly change into work clothes before the beginning of the productive work period, and shower and change back at the end of that period.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nPetitioners issued no written instructions to employees on this subject, but the employees testified and the foreman declared in a signed statement that \"In the afternoon the men are required by the company to take a bath because lead oxide might be absorbed into the blood stream. It protects the company and the employee both.\"\n\nPetitioners do not record or pay for the time which their employees spend in these activities, which was found to amount to thirty minutes a day, ten minutes in the morning and twenty minutes in the afternoon, for each employee. They do not challenge the concurrent findings of the courts below that the clothes-changing and showering activities of the employees are indispensable to the performance of their productive work and integrally related thereto. They do contend that these activities fall without the concept of \"principal activity\" and that, \n\n[350 \nU.S. 247, 252]\n\u00a0\n being performed off the production line and before or after regular shift hours, they are beyond the protection of the Fair Labor Standards Act.\n\nThe trial court held that these activities \"are made necessary by the nature of the work performed\"; that they fulfill \"mutual obligations\" between petitioners and their employees; that they \"directly benefit\" petitioners in the operation of their business, and that they \"are so closely related to other duties performed by [petitioners'] employees as to be an integral part thereof and are, therefore, included among the principal activities of said employees.\" It concluded that the time thereby consumed is not excluded from coverage by Section 4 of the Portal-to-Portal Act, but constitutes time worked within the meaning of the Fair Labor Standards Act. The Court of Appeals affirmed, likewise holding that the term \"principal activity or activities\" in Section 4\n2\n embraces all \n\n[350 \nU.S. 247, 253]\n\u00a0\n activities which are \"an integral and indispensable part of the principal activities,\" and that the activities in question fall within this category.\n\nWith this conclusion, we agree.\n\nThe Portal-to-Portal Act was designed primarily to meet an \"existing emergency\" resulting from claims which, if allowed in accordance with Anderson v. Mt. Clemens Pottery Co., \n328 \nU.S. 680\n, would have created \"wholly unexpected liabilities, immense in amount and retroactive in operation.\"\n3\n This purpose was fulfilled by the enactment of Section 2.\n4\n The trial court specifically \n\n[350 \nU.S. 247, 254]\n\u00a0\n limited the effect of this judgment to services rendered after the judgment becomes final. We are not, therefore, concerned with the provisions of Section 2, which is inapplicable to actions relating to activities of employees performed after May 14, 1947.\n\nThe language of Section 4 is not free from ambiguity and the legislative history of the Portal-to-Portal Act becomes of importance. That Act originated in a House bill, which had no provision comparable to Section 4, but rather gave similar treatment to retroactive and prospective claims; i. e., excluding coverage except by contract or custom in the industry. H. R. Rep. No. 326, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. 12. The Conference Report stated that the language of Section 4 follows the Senate bill. S.Rep. No. 48, 80th Cong., 1st Sees. 48. In the Senate, the colloquy between several Senators and Senator Cooper, a sponsor of the bill and a member of the three-man subcommittee that held hearings for the Committee on the Judiciary which reported it, demonstrates that the Senate intended the activities of changing clothes and showering to be within the protection of the Act if they are an integral part of and are essential to the principal activities of the employees.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nThere is some conflicting history in the House,\n6\n but the Senate discussion is more clear cut and, because the Section originated in that body, is more persuasive.\n\nIn 1949, Section 3 (o) was added to the Act.\n7\n Both sides apparently take comfort from it, but the position \n\n[350 \nU.S. 247, 255]\n\u00a0\n of the Government is strengthened by it since its clear implication is that clothes changing and washing, which are otherwise a part of the principal activity, may be expressly excluded from coverage by agreement. The congressional understanding of the scope of Section 4 is further marked by the fact that the Congress also enacted Section 16 (c)\n8\n at the same time, after hearing from the Administrator his outstanding interpretation of the coverage of certain preparatory activities closely related to the principal activity and indispensable to its performance.\n9\n\u00a0\n\nOn the whole it is clear, we think, that while Congress intended to outlaw claims prior to 1947 for wages based on all employee activities unless provided for by contract or custom of the industry, including, of course, activities performed before or after regular hours of work, it did not intend to deprive employees of the benefits of the Fair Labor Standards Act where they are an integral part of and indispensable to their principal activities. Had Congress intended the result urged by petitioner, the \n\n[350 \nU.S. 247, 256]\n\u00a0\n very different provisions of Sections 2 and 4 would have been unnecessary; Section 2 could have been given prospective as well as retroactive effect.\n\nWe, therefore, conclude that activities performed either before or after the regular work shift, on or off the production line, are compensable under the portal-to-portal provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act if those activities are an integral and indispensable part of the principal activities for which covered workmen are employed and are not specifically excluded by Section 4 (a) (1).\n\nWe find no difficulty in fitting the facts of this case to that conclusion because it would be difficult to conjure up an instance where changing clothes and showering are more clearly an integral and indispensable part of the principal activity of the employment than in the case of these employees.\n\nThe judgment is\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n   APPENDIX TO OPINION OF THE COURT.\n\n\n Colloquy Between Senator Cooper and Other Senators.\n\n\"Mr. COOPER. . . . Before the enactment of the Fair Labor Standards Act an employee might have worked upon a lathe under a contract, and his contract may have provided that his pay should commence at a scheduled hour, say at 7 o'clock when the lathe began to run, and he began to apply his energy to a casting or to a block upon the lathe. After the enactment of the Fair Labor Standards Act, by interpretations of the Wage and Hour Administrator, it was held that certain preparatory activities such as sharpening the tools, oiling the machinery, preparing his machinery for work, were so closely related to his productive activity that the employer must compensate the employee for it. We believe that in the use of the words `principal activity' we have preserved to the employee the rights and the benefits and the privileges which have been given to him under the Fair Labor Standards Act, because it is our opinion \n\n[350 \nU.S. 247, 257]\n\u00a0\n that those activities which are so closely related and are an integral part of the principal activity, indispensable to its performance, must be included in the concept of principal activity. And to make our position clear we have given examples in the report. . . .\n\n\n\"Mr. McGRATH. I think that at this point we might very definitely make contribution to the legislative history of what we are doing here. Am I correct in understanding the Senator to say that what the majority of the committee proposes is that any activity of a worker shall be considered a part of his principal activity if the doing of that act is indispensable to the performance of the rest of his day's work?\n\n\n\"Mr. COOPER. I can read the language used in the report, and I think that language should be used in this connection, because the words and phrases it employs were adopted by the committee. On page 48 of the report, in the definition of `principal activity,' we find these words:\n\n\"`It will be observed that the particular time at which the employee commences his principal activity or activities and ceases his principal activity or activities marked the beginning and the end of his workday. The term \"principal activity or activities\" includes all activities which are an integral part thereof as illustrated by the following examples:\n\n\n\"`1. In connection with the operation of a lathe an employee will frequently at the commencement of his workday oil, grease, or clean his machine, or install a new cutting tool. Such activities are an integral part of the principal activity, and are included within such term.\n\n\n\"`2. In the case of a garment worker in a textile mill, who is required to report 30 minutes before other employees report to commence their principal activities, and who during such 30 minutes distributes clothing or parts of clothing at the work-benches of other employees and gets machines in readiness for operation by other employees, such activities are among the principal activities of such employee.'\n\n\n\n\"We believe that our bill provides that the employee must receive compensation for such activities.\n\n.   .   .  .  .\n\n\n\n\"Mr. McGRATH. . . . Then we can clear that point up by reiterating that what the committee means is that any amount of time spent in the performance of the type of activity expressed in examples 1 and 2 is to be hereafter regarded as compensable time. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 247, 258]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Mr. COOPER. I should certainly say so, as a part of the principal activity.\n\n\n\"Mr. McGRATH. There are innumerable instances of operations which have to be performed that are not covered in these two particular examples. I think of one at the moment. In certain of our chemical plants workers are required to put on special clothing and to take off their clothing at the end of the workday, and in some of the plants they are required to take shower baths before they leave. Does the Senator regard such activity as that as coming within the compensable workday?\n\n\n\"Mr. COOPER. I am very happy that the Senator has asked the question, because I believe it gives the opportunity of drawing a fine distinction between the type of activity which we consider compensable and the type which should not be compensable. In accordance with our intention as to the definition of `principal activity,' if the employee could not perform his activity without putting on certain clothes, then the time used in changing into those clothes would be compensable as part of his principal activity. On the other hand, if changing clothes were merely a convenience to the employee and not directly related to the specific work, it would not be considered a part of his principal activity, and it follows that such time would not be compensable.\" 93 Cong. Rec. 2297-2298.\n\n.  .  .  .  .\n\n\n\n\"Mr. BARKLEY. . . . Suppose that a man is a machinist or a mechanic of some kind. He is required to go to work at 8 o'clock. Let us assume for a moment that he is not a member of an organization. He is required to enter upon the actual labor, which might be termed his principal employment, at 8 o'clock in the morning and to spend 8 hours at such principal employment. But let us suppose that his employer requires him to be on the grounds and within the shop at 7:30 in the morning in order that he may spend half an hour sharpening and preparing the tools with which he himself or his colleagues in the factory are to work.

Employees of motor carriers with which the union had collective bargaining agreements had been persuaded by agents of the union to refrain from delivering loaded trailers to the railroad for \"piggy-backing.\" The union was not concerned in any way with the railroad's labor policy, nor was there any claim that the union interfered in any manner with the railroad's employees.

D'Arcy, Jr. argued the cause for petitioners. With him on the brief were John D. O'Reilly, Jr. and Richard S. Sullivan.\n\nHerbert Burstein argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief was William T. Griffin.\n\nMR. JUSTICE MINTON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nRespondent railroad has, since 1937, engaged in hauling, between Boston, Massachusetts, and other points in New England, loaded trailers of the type ordinarily hauled over the highways by motor carriers. This operation is popularly known as \"piggy-backing.\" Trailers to be shipped from Boston are delivered to respondent's freight yard by employees of the motor carriers. There they are detached from the tractors and driven by special devices onto respondent's flatcars by employees of New England Transportation Co., a motor carrier, which is a subsidiary of respondent. The trailers are secured to the flatcars by respondent's employees.\n\nPetitioners are the local teamsters union, one of its officers and two of its business agents. The union, by virtue of collective-bargaining agreements, represents a large number of drivers and helpers of certain motor carriers which are engaged in over-the-road hauling of freight between Boston and other points in New England. Respondent's \"piggy-backing\" operations have steadily increased over the years, with a resulting loss of work for truck drivers. The union sought, without success, in 1946, and again in 1949, an agreement by the motor carriers to cease shipping trailers by \"piggy-back.\" Having failed in these and subsequent negotiations to dissuade the trucking companies from participating in \"piggy-backing,\" petitioner union assigned petitioners Norton and McCarthy, business agents of the union, to patrol \n\n[350 \nU.S. 155, 157]\n\u00a0\n the entrance to respondent's Yard 5 where trailers are delivered for \"piggy-back\" operations.\n\nOn July 11, 12 and 14, 1952, Norton and McCarthy stopped a number of truck-drawn trailers owned by carriers with whom petitioner union had collective-bargaining agreements and persuaded the drivers to refrain from delivering the trailers to respondent. Employees of New England Transportation Co. were persuaded by Norton and McCarthy not to load previously delivered trailers onto respondent's flatcars.\n\nRespondent filed suit in the Superior Court of Suffolk County, Massachusetts, seeking permanently to enjoin petitioners' conduct and, in addition, damages in the sum of $100,000. In its amended complaint respondent alleged, among other things:\n\n\". . . the individual respondents and the respondent union prevented the loading of trailers on flat cars and enforced a boycott against petitioner and a withholding of patronage and services by motor truck carriers and shippers.\n\n\n .  .  . .  .\n\n\n \"The petitioner is informed and believes that the object of the acts committed by the respondents on July 11, 12 and 14, 1952, as set forth in paragraphs `8' and `9' of this complaint was to force or require the petitioner to cease handling and transporting the products of various shippers and motor carriers who employ petitioner's flat car service.\n\n\n .  .   .  .  .\n\n\n  \"The said acts were and are intended to compel shippers and motor truck carriers to assign work to members of the respondent union and to thereby commit an unfair labor practice in violation of the National Labor Relations Act; and \n\n[350 \nU.S. 155, 158]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n \"The said acts were intended to and did, in fact, result in an unlawful secondary boycott in violation of the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and of Section 8 (b) (4) (A) of the National Labor Relations Act; . . . .\"\n1\n\u00a0\n\n\n After hearing, a permanent injunction was granted and, on appeal, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts affirmed. 331 Mass. 720, 122 N. E. 2d 759. We granted certiorari to determine whether the state court had jurisdiction to enjoin the petitioners' conduct or whether its jurisdiction had been pre-empted by the authority vested in the National Labor Relations Board. \n348 \nU.S. 969\n.\n\nResolution of this question depends upon (1) whether respondent, as a railroad subject to the Railway Labor Act, may avail itself of the processes of the N. L. R. B., and (2) if respondent may do so, was it required, in the circumstances of this case, to seek relief from that tribunal rather than from the state courts.\n\nThe Massachusetts court, although recognizing the principle that state courts ordinarily lack authority to enjoin alleged unfair labor practices affecting interstate \n\n[350 \nU.S. 155, 159]\n\u00a0\n commerce,\n2\n determined that it had jurisdiction in this controversy to restrain petitioners' conduct because the Labor Management Relations Act's definition of \"employer,\" as interpreted by the N. L. R. B., cast doubt upon respondent's ability to obtain relief under that Act.\n\nThe Act, in its definition of an \"employer,\" expressly excludes anyone subject to the Railway Labor Act. 61 Stat. 137, 29 U.S.C. 152 (2).\n3\n It is of course true that employer-employee relationships of railroads such as respondent are governed by the Railway Labor Act,\n4\n which was passed before either the National Labor Relations Act or the Labor Management Relations Act. Neither of the latter Acts was intended to tread upon the ground covered by the Railway Labor Act. It is clear that neither railroads nor their employees may carry their grievances with one another to the N. L. R. B. for resolution. But it does not follow from this that a railroad is precluded from seeking the aid of the Board in circumstances unrelated to its employer-employee relations. Respondent itself has maintained throughout the entire course of this litigation that there is no labor dispute with \n\n[350 \nU.S. 155, 160]\n\u00a0\n its employees. The Massachusetts court found that petitioner union was in no way concerned with respondent's labor policy, nor was there any claim that the union interfered in any manner whatsoever with the railroad employees.\n\nThe N. L. R. B. is empowered to issue complaints whenever \"it is charged\" that any person subject to the Act is engaged in any proscribed unfair labor practice. 10 (b). Under the Board's Rules and Regulations such a charge may be filed by \"any person.\"\n5\n We think it clear that Congress, in excluding \"any person subject to the Railway Labor Act\" from the statutory definition of \"employer,\" carved out of the Labor Management Relations Act the railroads' employer-employee relationships which were, and are, governed by the Railway Labor Act. But we do not think that by so doing Congress intended to divest the N. L. R. B. of jurisdiction over controversies otherwise within its competence solely because a railroad is the complaining party. Furthermore, since railroads are not excluded from the Act's definition of \"person,\" they are entitled to Board protection from the kind of unfair labor practice proscribed by 8 (b) (4) (A). This interpretation permits the harmonious effectuation of three distinct congressional objectives: (1) to provide orderly and peaceful procedures for protecting the rights of employers, employees and the public in labor disputes so as to promote the full, free flow of commerce, as expressed in 1 (b) of the Labor Management Relations Act; (2) to maintain the traditional separate treatment of employer-employee relationships of railroads subject to \n\n[350 \nU.S. 155, 161]\n\u00a0\n the Railway Labor Act; and (3) to minimize \"diversities and conflicts likely to result from a variety of local procedures and attitudes toward labor controversies.\" Garner v. Teamsters Union, \n346 \nU.S. 485, 490\n.\n\nRespondent contends, however, that even if railroads may seek the aid of the N. L. R. B., it was not required to do so in this case because petitioners' conduct was neither protected by 7 nor prohibited by 8 (b) (4) of the Labor Management Relations Act. As we noted earlier, respondent's amended complaint alleged violations of the Act. Whether the Act was violated or whether, as respondent now claims, it was not, is, of course, a question for the Board to determine. Even if petitioners' conduct is not prohibited by 8 of the Act, it may come within the protection of 7, in which case the State was not free to enjoin the conduct. In any event, the Board's jurisdiction in the circumstances of this case is clearly settled by this Court's recent decision in Weber v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., \n348 \nU.S. 468, 481\n:\n\n\"But where the moving party itself alleges unfair labor practices, where the facts reasonably bring the controversy within the sections prohibiting these practices, and where the conduct, if not prohibited by the federal Act, may be reasonably deemed to come within the protection afforded by that Act, the state court must decline jurisdiction in deference to the tribunal which Congress has selected for determining such issues in the first instance.\"\n\n\n We therefore hold that the question presented by the facts in this case brings it within the jurisdiction of the N. L. R. B., whose jurisdiction is exclusive, and the respondent railroad may seek any remedy it may have before said Board.\n\nThe judgment is\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 8 (b) (4) (A) provides:\n\n\"(b) It shall be an unfair labor practice for a labor organization or its agents -\n\n .   .   .   .  .\n\n\n\n\"(4) to engage in, or to induce or encourage the employees of any employer to engage in, a strike or a concerted refusal in the course of their employment to use, manufacture, process, transport, or otherwise handle or work on any goods, articles, materials, or commodities or to perform any services, where an object thereof is: (A) forcing or requiring any employer or self-employed person to join any labor or employer organization or any employer or other person to cease using, selling, handling, transporting, or otherwise dealing in the products of any other producer, processor, or manufacturer, or to cease doing business with any other person; . . . .\" 61 Stat. 141, 29 U.S.C. 158 (b) (4) (A).\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Garner v.

Supp. 25.\n\nAppellee holds licenses covering different areas surrounding Chicago, Houston, and St. Louis. As these are substantially in the same form, a single illustration will suffice. It covers contract carriage of \n\n[350 \nU.S. 409, 410]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\"Steel articles, and such materials as are used or useful in highway construction projects, except cement, rock, sand, and gravel, over irregular routes, in connection with said carrier's presently authorized operations,\n\n\n\"From points and places in the CHICAGO, ILL.

C. 673, to points and places in Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Texas, and return with no transportation for compensation.\" No. MC 96505 SUB 6.\n\n\n The facts are fully set out in the reports referred to above. In essence they show that appellee, by active solicitation from 1951 to 1954 in the areas mentioned, had secured 69 contracts to serve shippers. These had been filed with the Commission and there is no charge of any violation of the restrictions of the license or the requirements of individual contracts except that the appellee has held itself out by its actions to be a common carrier.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nThe Commission found this holding-out from an advertisement, run without legal advice and since discontinued, offering its transportation service without mentioning whether it was contract or common carriage.\n\nIt was also charged that\n\n \". . . the great increase in the number of contracts  held by it are attributable in large degree to aggressive  sales activities and affirmative precontract  traffic solicitation, which amounts to a public offer  or holding out. In this connection, it is also asserted \n\n[350 \nU.S. 409, 411]\n\u00a0\n  that defendant maintained an employee in Des  Moines, Iowa, whose duties included the active solicitation  of traffic. . . . There is evidence that business  has been lost by interveners after a representative  of defendant called upon receivers of steel in  Iowa, leaving a copy of defendant's schedule of  minimum rates and charges, and a copy of a blank  contract to be executed by such shippers.\" 62  M. C. C. 413, 414-415.\n\n\n It was concluded by the Commission:\n\n  \"Although the facts here are meager in some respects,  they reveal a pattern of extraordinary expansion  in a period of approximately 8 months and an  easy turnover of contracts thereafter. We believe  that there is ample evidence to show that this expansion  was brought about, to some extent at least,  by indiscriminate solicitation and advertising, among  other things.\" Id., at 421.\n\n\n In Craig Contract Carrier Application, 31 M. C. C. 705, 712, the ICC stated that the services of a contract carrier must be individual and specialized. A requirement of specialization is supported by respectable legislative history. See, e. g., 79 Cong. Rec. 5651. In this case the ICC found that appellee had not sufficiently specialized its operation. However, we conclude that if specialization is to be read into 49 U.S.C. 303 (a) (15) by the legislative history, it is satisfied here since appellee hauls only strictly limited types of steel products under individual and continuing contractual agreements with a comparatively small number of shippers throughout a large area.\n\nWe hold also that the fact that appellee has actively solicited business within the bounds of his license does \n\n[350 \nU.S. 409, 412]\n\u00a0\n not support a finding that it was \"holding itself out to the general public.\" A contract carrier is free to aggressively search for new business within the limits of his license.\n2\n Because the ICC's order is not supported by evidence in the record and is contrary to the definitions of contract and common carriers in 303 (14) and (15), we affirm the District Court.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] A common carrier is one \"which holds itself out to the general public to engage in the transportation by motor vehicle . . . of passengers or property.\" A contract carrier is any \"person which, under individual contracts or agreements, engage in\" such transportation. 49 U.S.C. 303 (a) (14), (15).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] \"Provided, however, That no terms, conditions, or limitations shall restrict the right of the carrier to substitute or add contracts within the scope of the permit, or to add to his or its equipment and facilities, within the scope of the permit, as the development of the business and the demands of the public may require.\" 49 U.S.C. 309 (b).\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, whom MR. JUSTICE HARLAN joins, dissenting.\n\nThe Motor Carrier Act, 49 Stat. 543, 544, 49 U.S.C. 303 (a) (14), gives to the term \"common carrier by motor vehicle\" the classic meaning that \"common carrier\" had acquired and maintained during the course of centuries. In short, the test of what is a \"common carrier\" under this Act is what legal history has established as the test, and we do not find that the Interstate Commerce Commission has departed from this test. We cannot believe that if the evidence, as disclosed by the record, which need not be recited, had appeared in a common-law action against the respondent, a court would be justified in taking the case from the jury, and that if the jury had found against the respondent, its verdict would not be allowed to stand. The finding by the Interstate Commerce Commission that the respondent was a \"common carrier,\" and therefore subject to the regulatory provisions of the Act, ought not to have less weight than a jury's verdict. Accordingly, other issues raised in the case are not reached, and we would reverse the judgment below. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 409, 413]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","90":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. v.

Ohlbaum.\n\nAlbert R. Connelly argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were Thomas H. Wall, John E. McCoy and John D. Calhoun.\n\nMR. JUSTICE REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission issued, on August 19, 1948, a notice of proposed rulemaking under the authority of 47 U.S.C. 303 (r), 311, 313 and 314 (Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 301 et seq.). It was proposed, so far as is pertinent to this case, to amend Rules 3.35, 3.240 and 3.636 relating to Multiple Ownership of standard, FM and television broadcast stations. Those rules provide that licenses for broadcasting stations will not be granted if the applicant, directly or indirectly, has an interest in other stations beyond a limited number. The purpose of the limitations is to avoid overconcentration of broadcasting facilities.\n\nAs required by 5 U.S.C. 1003 (b), the notice permitted \"interested\" parties to file statements or briefs. Such parties might also intervene in appeals. 47 U.S.C. 402 (d) and (e). Respondent, licensee of a number of radio and television stations, filed a statement objecting to the proposed changes, as did other interested broadcasters. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 192, 194]\n\u00a0\n Respondent based its objections largely on the fact that the proposed rules did not allow one person to hold as many FM and television stations as standard stations. Storer argued that such limitations might cause irreparable financial damage to owners of standard stations if an obsolescent standard station could not be augmented by FM and television facilities.\n\nIn November 1953 the Commission entered an order amending the Rules in question without significant changes from the proposed forms.\n1\n A review was sought \n\n[351 \nU.S. 192, 195]\n\u00a0\n in due course by respondent in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit under 5 U.S.C. 1034,\n2\n 47 U.S.C. 402 (a),\n3\n and 5 U.S.C. 1009 (a), (c).\n4\n Respondent alleged it owned or controlled, within the meaning of the Multiple Ownership Rules, seven standard radio, five FM radio and five television broadcast stations. It asserted that the Rules complained of were in conflict with the statutory mandates that applicants should be granted licenses if the public interest would be served and that applicants must have a hearing before denial of an application. 47 U.S.C. 309 (a) and (b).\n5\n\u00a0\n\n[351 \nU.S. 192, 196]\n\u00a0\n\n\n Respondent also claimed:\n\n \"The Rules, in considering the ownership of one (1%) per cent or more of the voting stock of a broadcast licensee corporation as equivalent to ownership, operation or control of the station, are unreasonable and bear no rational relationship to the national Anti-Trust policy.\"\n\n\n This latter claim was important to respondent because allegedly 20% of its voting stock was in scattered ownership and was traded in by licensed dealers. This stock was thus beyond its control.\n\nRespondent asserted it was a \"party aggrieved\" and a \"person suffering legal wrong\" or adversely affected under the several statutes that authorize review of FCC action. See notes 2, 3 and 4, supra. It stated its injuries from the Rules thus:\n\n \"Storer is adversely affected and aggrieved by the Order of the Commission adopted on November 25, 1953, amending the Multiple Ownership Rules, in that:\n\n\n \"(a) Storer is denied the right of a full and fair hearing to determine whether its ownership of an interest in more than seven (7) standard radio and five (5) television broadcast stations, in light of and upon a showing of all material circumstances, will \n\n[351 \nU.S. 192, 197]\n\u00a0\n thereby serve the public interest, convenience and necessity.\n\n\n \"(b) The acquisition of Storer's voting stock by the public under circumstances beyond the control of Storer, may and could be violative of the Multiple Ownership rules, as amended, and result in a forfeiture of licenses now held by Storer, with resultant loss and injury to Storer and to all other Storer stockholders.\"\n\n\n On the day the amendments to the Rules were adopted, a pending application of Storer for an additional television station at Miami was dismissed on the basis of the Rules.\n\nWhile the question of respondent's right to appeal has not been raised by either party or by the Court of Appeals, our jurisdiction is now mooted. It may be considered. Federal Communications Comm'n v. National Broadcasting Co., \n319 \nU.S. 239, 246\n. Jurisdiction depends upon standing to seek review and upon ripeness. If respondent could not rightfully seek review from the order adopting the challenged regulations, it must await action to its disadvantage under them, and neither the Court of Appeals nor this Court has jurisdiction of the controversy. Under the above-cited Code sections, review of Commission action is granted any party aggrieved or suffering legal wrong by that action.\n6\n\u00a0\n\n[351 \nU.S. 192, 198]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe think respondent had standing to sue at the time it exercised its privilege. The process of rulemaking was complete. It was final agency action, 5 U.S.C. 1001 (c) and (g), by which Storer claimed to be \"aggrieved.\" When the authority to appeal was substantially the same, we held that an appellant who complained of the grant of a license to a competitor because it would reduce its own income had standing to appeal against a contention, admittedly sound, that such economic injury to appellant was not a proper issue before the Commission. We said:\n\n \"Congress had some purpose in enacting  402 (b) (2). It may have been of opinion that one likely to be financially injured by the issue of a license would be the only person having a sufficient interest to bring to the attention of the appellate court errors of law in the action of the Commission in granting the license. It is within the power of Congress to confer such standing to prosecute an appeal.\" Federal Communications Comm'n v. Sanders Radio Station, \n309 \nU.S. 470, 477\n.\n\n\n We added that such an appellant could raise any relevant question of law in respect to the order.\n\nAgain in Columbia Broadcasting System v. United States, \n316 \nU.S. 407\n, this Court considered the problem of standing to review Commission action under the then existing 402 (a), 48 Stat. 1093, and the Urgent Deficiencies Act, 38 Stat. 219. CBS there sought review of the adoption of Chain Broadcasting Regulations by the Commission. Against the contention that the adoption of regulations did not command CBS to do or refrain from doing anything (dissent \n316 \nU.S., at 429\n), this Court held that the order promulgating regulations was \n\n[351 \nU.S. 192, 199]\n\u00a0\n reviewable because it presently affected existing contractual relationships. It said:\n\n \"The regulations are not any the less reviewable  because their promulgation did not operate of their  own force to deny or cancel a license. It is enough  that failure to comply with them penalizes licensees,  and appellant, with whom they contract. If an  administrative order has that effect it is reviewable  and it does not cease to be so merely because it is  not certain whether the Commission will institute  proceedings to enforce the penalty incurred under  its regulations for noncompliance.\" Id., at 417-418.\n\n\n The Court said that the regulations \"presently determine rights.\" Id., at 421.\n\n  \"Appellant's standing to maintain the present  suit in equity is unaffected by the fact that the regulations  are not directed to appellant and do not in  terms compel action by it or impose penalties upon  it because of its action or failure to act. It is enough  that, by setting the controlling standards for the  Commission's action, the regulations purport to  operate to alter and affect adversely appellant's contractual  rights and business relations with station  owners whose applications for licenses the regulations  will cause to be rejected and whose licenses the  regulations may cause to be revoked.\" Id., at 422.\n\n\n See Federal Communications Comm'n v. American Broadcasting Co., \n347 \nU.S. 284, 289\n, and El Dorado Oil Works v. United States, \n328 \nU.S. 12, 18\n-19.\n\nThe regulations here under consideration presently aggrieve the respondent. The Commission exercised a power of rulemaking which controls broadcasters. The Rules now operate to control the business affairs of Storer. Unless it obtains a modification of this declared administrative \n\n[351 \nU.S. 192, 200]\n\u00a0\n policy, Storer cannot enlarge the number of its standard or FM stations. It seems, too, that the note to Rule 3.636 (n. 1, supra) endangers Storer's stations as alleged in its petition for review. See this opinion, supra, p. 197, at (b). Commission hearings are affected now by the Rules. Storer cannot cogently plan its present or future operations.\n7\n It cannot plan to enlarge the number of its standard or FM stations, and at any moment the purchase of Storer's voting stock by some member of the public could endanger its existing structure. These are grievances presently restricting Storer's operations. In the light of the legislation allowing review of the Commission's actions, we hold that Storer has standing to bring this action.\n\nIn its petition for review Storer prayed the court to vacate the provisions of the Multiple Ownership Rules insofar as they denied to an applicant already controlling the allowable number of stations a \"full and fair hearing\" to determine whether additional licenses to the applicant would be in the public interest.\n8\n The Court of Appeals struck out, as contrary to 309 (a) and (b) of the Communications Act (n. 5, supra), the words italicized in Rule 3.636 (n. 1, supra) and the similar words in Rules 3.35 and 3.240. The case was remanded to the Commission with directions to eliminate these words. 95 U.S. App. D.C. 97, 220 F.2d 204. We granted certiorari. \n350 \nU.S. 816\n. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 192, 201]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Commission asserts that its power to make regulations gives it the authority to limit concentration of stations under a single control.\n9\n It argues that rules may go beyond the technical aspects of radio, that rules may validly give concreteness to a standard of public interest, and that the right to a hearing does not exist where an applicant admittedly does not meet those standards as there would be no facts to ascertain. The Commission shows that its regulations permit applicants to seek amendments and waivers of or exceptions to its Rules.\n10\n It adds:\n\n\"This does not mean, of course, that the mere filing of an application for a waiver . . . would necessarily require the holding of a hearing, for if that were the case a rule would no longer be a rule. It means \n\n[351 \nU.S. 192, 202]\n\u00a0\n only that it might be an abuse of discretion to fail to hear a request for a waiver which showed, on its face, the existence of circumstances making application of the rule inappropriate.\"\n\n\n Respondent defends the position of the Court of Appeals. It urges that an application cannot be rejected under 47 U.S.C. 309 without a \"full hearing\" to applicant. We agree that a \"full hearing\" under 309 means that every party shall have the right to present his case or defense by oral or documentary evidence, to submit rebuttal evidence, and to conduct such cross-examination as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts. Cf. 5 U.S.C. 1006 (c). Such a hearing is essential for wise and just application of the authority of administrative boards and agencies.\n\nWe do not read the hearing requirement, however, as withdrawing from the power of the Commission the rule-making authority necessary for the orderly conduct of its business. As conceded by Storer, \"Section 309 (b) does not require the Commission to hold a hearing before denying a license to operate a station in ways contrary to those that the Congress has determined are in the public interest.\"\n11\n The challenged Rules contain limitations \n\n[351 \nU.S. 192, 203]\n\u00a0\n against licensing not specifically authorized by statute. But that is not the limit of the Commission's rulemaking authority. 47 U.S.C. 154 (i) and 303 (r) grant general rulemaking power not inconsistent with the Act or law.\n\nThis Commission, like other agencies, deals with the public interest. Scripps-Howard Radio v. Federal Communications Comm'n, \n316 \nU.S. 4, 14\n. Its authority covers new and rapidly developing fields. Congress sought to create regulation for public protection with careful provision to assure fair opportunity for open competition in the use of broadcasting facilities. Accordingly, we cannot interpret 309 (b) as barring rules that declare a present intent to limit the number of stations consistent with a permissible \"concentration of control.\" It is but a rule that announces the Commission's attitude on public protection against such concentration.\n12\n The Communications Act must be read as a whole and with appreciation of the responsibilities of the body charged with its fair and efficient operation. The growing complexity of our economy induced the Congress to place regulation of businesses like communication in specialized agencies with broad powers. Courts are slow to interfere with their conclusions when reconcilable with statutory directions.\n13\n We think the Multiple Ownership Rules, as adopted, are reconcilable with the Communications \n\n[351 \nU.S. 192, 204]\n\u00a0\n Act as a whole. An applicant files his application with knowledge of the Commission's attitude toward concentration of control.\n\nIn National Broadcasting Co. v. United States, \n319 \nU.S. 190\n, similar rules prohibiting certain methods of chain broadcasting were upheld despite a claim that the Rules caused licenses to be denied without \"examination of written applications presented . . . as required by 308 and 309.\" Id., at 230.\n14\n The National Broadcasting case validated numerous regulations couched in the prohibitory language of the present regulations. The one in the margin will serve as an example.\n15\n\u00a0\n\nIn the National Broadcasting case we called attention to the necessity for flexibility in the Rules there involved. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 192, 205]\n\u00a0\n The \"Commission provided that `networks will be given full opportunity, on proper application for new facilities or renewal of existing licenses, to call to our attention any reasons why the principle should be modified or held inapplicable.'\" Id., at 207. We said:\n\n\"The Commission therefore did not bind itself inflexibly to the licensing policies expressed in the Regulations. In each case that comes before it the Commission must still exercise an ultimate judgment whether the grant of a license would serve the `public interest' is not served by application of the Regulations, it must be assumed that the Commission will act in accordance with its statutory obligations.\" Id., at 225.\n\n\n That flexibility is here under the present 309 (a) and (b) and the FCC's regulations. See n. 10, supra. We read the Act and Regulations as providing a \"full hearing\" for applicants who have reached the existing limit of stations, upon their presentation of applications conforming to Rules 1.361 (c) and 1.702, that set out adequate reasons why the Rules should be waived or amended. The Act, considered as a whole, requires no more. We agree with the contention of the Commission that a full hearing, such as is required by 309 (b), n. 5, supra, would not be necessary on all such applications. As the Commission has promulgated its Rules after extensive administrative hearings, it is necessary for the accompanying papers to set forth reasons, sufficient if true, to justify a change or waiver of the Rules. We do not think Congress intended the Commission to waste time on applications that do not state a valid basis for a hearing. If any applicant is aggrieved by a refusal, the way for review is open. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 192, 206]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case to that court so that it may consider respondent's other objections to the Multiple Ownership Rules.\n\n    Reversed and remanded.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE DOUGLAS concurs in the result.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 3.636 will illustrate the problem: \" 3.636 Multiple ownership. (a) No license for a television broadcast station shall be granted to any party (including all parties under common control) if: \"(1) Such party directly or indirectly owns, operates, or controls another television broadcast station which serves substantially the same area; or \"(2) Such party, or any stockholder, officer or director of such party, directly or indirectly owns, operates, controls, or has any interest in, or is an officer or director of any other television broadcast station if the grant of such license would result in a concentration of control of television broadcasting in a manner inconsistent with public interest, convenience, or necessity. In determining whether there is such a concentration of control, consideration will be given to the facts of each case with particular reference to such factors as the size, extent and location of areas served, the number of people served, and the extent of other competitive service to the areas in question. The Commission, however, will in any event consider that there would be such a concentration of control contrary to the public interest, convenience or necessity for any party or any of its stockholders, officers or directors to have a direct or indirect interest in, or be stockholders, officers, or directors of, more than five television broadcast stations.\"[*] (The italicized material is common to all three Rules.) [*] \"In applying the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section to the stockholders of a corporation which has more than 50 voting stockholders, only those stockholders need be considered who are officers or directors or who directly or indirectly own 1 per cent or more of the outstanding voting stock.\" 47 CFR, Rev. 1953. The standard and FM Rules limited stations to seven.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] \"Any party aggrieved by a final order reviewable under this chapter may, within sixty days after entry of such order, file in the court of appeals, wherein the venue as prescribed by section 1033 of this title lies, a petition to review such order. . . .\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] \"(a) Any proceeding to enjoin, set aside, annul, or suspend any order of the Commission under this chapter (except those appealable under subsection (b) of this section) shall be brought as provided by and in the manner prescribed in chapter 19A of Title 5.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] \"Except so far as (1) statutes preclude judicial review or (2) agency action is by law committed to agency discretion - \"(a) Any person suffering legal wrong because of any agency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by such action within the meaning of any relevant statute, shall be entitled to judicial review thereof. .  .   .   .   . \"(c) Every agency action made reviewable by statute and every final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in any court shall be subject to judicial review. . . .\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] 47 U.S.C. 309: \"(a) Examination; action by Commission. \"If upon examination of any application provided for in section 308 of this title the Commission shall find that public interest, convenience, and necessity would be served by the granting thereof, it shall grant such application. \"(b) Notification of denial; contents; reply; hearing; intervention. \"If upon examination of any such application the Commission is unable to make the finding specified in subsection (a) of this section, it shall forthwith notify the applicant and other known parties in interest of the grounds and reasons for its inability to make such \n\n[351 \nU.S. 192, 196]\n\u00a0\n finding. . . .

In explanation the reports of the Senate, No. 752, 79th Cong., 1st Sess. 26, and the House, No. 1980, 79th Cong., 2d Sess. 42, define \"legal wrong\": \"The phrase `legal wrong' means such a wrong as is specified in section 10 (c). It means that something more than mere adverse personal effect must be shown in order to prevail - that is, that the adverse effect must be an illegal effect.\" Section 10 (e) of the bill required reviewing courts to \"hold unlawful any action . . . (3) contrary to statutes or statutory right.\" Section 10 (e) of the Act is now in substantially the same language. 5 U.S.C. 1009 (e).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Cf. Frozen Food Express v.

This was not passed upon by the Court of Appeals. 95 U.S. App. D.C. 97, 220 F.2d 204. Its judgment leaves that portion of the Rule unaffected.

Change to the present form was merely for more certainty and clarification to avoid the possibility of arbitrary Commission action. See S. Rep. No. 44, 82d Cong., 1st Sess. 8.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] \"No license shall be granted to a standard broadcast station having any contract, arrangement, or understanding, express or implied, with a network organization under which the station is prevented or hindered from, or penalized for, broadcasting the programs of any other network organization.\" Id., at 200; 47 CFR, 1941 Supp., 3.101.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\nThe Court has properly deemed it necessary to question sua sponte the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals to entertain this case,\n1\n but I am unable to agree with its decision that such jurisdiction existed. In my view, Storer was not a \"party aggrieved by a final order\" of the Commission, within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 1034, and hence was not entitled to invoke the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals. Accordingly, I would vacate the judgment below and remand the case to the Court of Appeals with directions to dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 192, 207]\n\u00a0\n\n\n1. These regulations do not, in my view, constitute an \"order\" within the meaning of 1034. They simply establish certain standards to be followed by the Commission in the future exercise of its licensing powers; they do not require any licensee to do or to refrain from doing anything, attach no consequences to his action or inaction, and determine no questions as to his legal status. As such they are quite unlike the Chain Broadcasting regulations which were held to be a reviewable \"order\" in Columbia Broadcasting System v. United States, \n316 \nU.S. 407\n, in a proceeding comparable to this one. Those regulations were held reviewable, not because every Commission action in the form of a regulation was considered to be an \"order,\" but for the specific reason that they proscribed certain kinds of contracts between licensees and the national networks and, by prescribing the sanction of license cancellation for noncompliance, operated to coerce action by the licensees and to determine the legal status of the networks' contracts. Of their own force and with no further administrative action being taken, the regulations induced licensees to cancel existing network contracts and deterred them from entering into new ones. That coercive effect of the regulations on present conduct, the very characteristic which led the Court to regard the Chain Broadcasting regulations as an \"order\" despite their form, is totally lacking here.\n2\n\u00a0\n\n[351 \nU.S. 192, 208]\n\u00a0\n\n\n2. A second obstacle to review of the regulations here is that, even if they be deemed an \"order,\" Storer has not shown that it is \"aggrieved\" by them.\n\nIn assessing the character of Storer's grievance, we must put aside the Commission's order, made simultaneously with its promulgation of the challenged regulations, which denied a pending application by Storer for a sixth television license. That order was reviewable only by a direct appeal within 30 days under 47 U.S.C. 402 (b), (c), Federal Communications Comm'n v. Columbia Broadcasting System, \n311 \nU.S. 132\n, and became final and conclusive upon Storer's failure to appeal from it. Since that order cannot be reviewed, and no relief from it may be granted in this proceeding, it is only of the prospective effect of the regulations, not their past application, that Storer may complain. And it is by that effect that Storer must show it is \"aggrieved.\"\n\nIn its petition for review, Storer alleged that it was aggrieved by the regulations in that:\n\n \"(a) Storer is denied the right of a full and fair hearing to determine whether its ownership of an interest in more than seven (7) standard radio and five (5) television broadcast stations, in light of and upon a showing of all material circumstances, will thereby serve the public interest, convenience and necessity.\n\n\n \"(b) The acquisition of Storer's voting stock by the public under circumstances beyond the control of Storer, may and could be violative of the Multiple Ownership rules, as amended, and result in a forfeiture of licenses now held by Storer, with resultant loss and injury to Storer and to all other Storer stockholders.\"\n\n\n However these allegations are read, they assert no more than that the Commission may in the future take action \n\n[351 \nU.S. 192, 209]\n\u00a0\n pursuant to the regulations to deny or revoke a license. Of course, if such action should ever be taken, Storer would then be \"aggrieved.\" But by the same token it would then have a complete remedy through a direct appeal from such action under 402 (b). Until such time as the regulations are applied to it, however, Storer will not have been \"aggrieved\" and hence will not be entitled to review. Indeed, in this case we do not even reach the often difficult problem whether an alleged injury is sufficient or of such a nature as to entitle the complaining party to review; here we have that rare case in which no present injury of any kind is even alleged.\n\nIt is said, however, that the regulations \"now operate to control the business affairs of Storer,\" despite the absence of any such allegation by Storer. Since the regulations do not have any coercive effect, I take that to mean only that Storer, if it exercises prudent business judgment, will take into account the announced policy of the Commission in deciding whether or not to apply for an additional license. No doubt that is true, but I fail to see how Storer has been \"aggrieved\" by being told in advance one of the factors that will govern the disposition of any future license application on its part. If anything, Storer is now able to make a more enlightened judgment as to the probabilities of success in obtaining a further license.\n\n3. So clear is it, in fact, that Storer has not been \"aggrieved\" by the mere issuance of the regulations, that the Court's grant of review in this case must be premised not upon the effect of the regulations themselves, but simply upon Storer's interest in knowing whether or not a future application of them would be valid. The result is that the statutory procedure for obtaining relief from a present injury caused by an order has been converted into something quite different - namely, a procedure for obtaining a declaratory judgment as to the validity of a \n\n[351 \nU.S. 192, 210]\n\u00a0\n future application of new regulations. Not only is such a proceeding not authorized by the statute, however, but Storer would not have standing to invoke it even if it were.\n\nThat declaratory relief from future orders is not contemplated by 1034 seems clear. That section authorizes review only of an \"order,\" only if the order is \"final,\" and only at the instance of one aggrieved \"by\" the challenged order itself. The regulations here are not an \"order\"; if they were it would not be \"final\" since further administrative action must be taken before Storer will be affected; and Storer's grievance, if any, will be caused not \"by\" the regulations but only by their future application. Moreover, quite apart from these obstacles, the procedure provided for by 1034 is inappropriate for anticipatory equitable relief. That section requires, for example, that petitions for review be filed within 60 days after the order is issued. While such a time limitation is clearly appropriate to a procedure for relief from an injury already suffered, there seems no justification for so limiting the availability of declaratory relief from future action. Why should declaratory relief be denied as the threat of the future injury becomes more imminent, or be granted to those who have a sufficient interest to seek review immediately while being denied to those who later acquire a similar or even greater interest? Finally, no reason is apparent why existing procedures for declaratory judgments are not adequate; to construe 1034 as an alternative declaratory judgment procedure simply produces the incongruous result of authorizing declaratory relief in the Courts of Appeals within 60 days after the order is issued and in the District Courts thereafter.\n\nIn the second place, even if 1034 is to be construed as authorizing declaratory relief, I see no reason why the usual requirements for invoking equity jurisdiction should not be as applicable to such a proceeding as they are to \n\n[351 \nU.S. 192, 211]\n\u00a0\n an ordinary declaratory judgment action or to a proceeding to set aside a Commission order under the Urgent Deficiencies Act, the predecessor to 1034 under which the CBS case arose. In that case, CBS's right to equitable relief in advance of the application of the regulations was expressly based on the irreparable injury it would suffer - the wholesale cancellation of its contracts with licensees - before any further administrative action was taken and for which there was no other adequate remedy. Unless these requirements for equitable relief are to be abandoned, there can be no right to relief here, for Storer alleges no threatened injury of any kind, other than the possibility of future administrative action for which there would be a complete remedy by appeal.\n\nIt is said, however - again without support of any allegations by Storer - that Storer \"cannot cogently plan its present or future operations\" unless it is advised whether or not the regulations are valid. But plans for expansion of communications facilities have always had to be made subject to the contingency that the Commission might refuse to grant the necessary license for any one of a number of reasons. Storer's position in this respect is now no different than it was before the regulations were issued: any plan to acquire a new station must simply take into account, among the several contingencies, the likelihood that a denial of a license under the regulations would be upheld on appeal. What this argument comes down to, therefore, is that Storer needs to know whether or not it can validly be denied a license under the regulations so that, if it can, it need not make an application. That is, the injury that Storer will have suffered if the decision on the validity of the regulations is postponed until Storer in fact applies for a license is the expense of making that very application, the same injury that is suffered by all unsuccessful license applicants. Until today, I should not have thought argument was necessary to reject such \n\n[351 \nU.S. 192, 212]\n\u00a0\n a basis for declaratory relief. Declaratory relief has been denied persons whose only alternative was to risk both dismissal from public employment and the imposition of criminal penalties, United Public Workers v. Mitchell, \n330 \nU.S. 75\n, yet it is granted here to relieve Storer of the mere burden of making an application for a license.\n3\n\u00a0\n\n4. The holding of the Court today amounts to this: that regulations which impose no duty and determine no rights may be reviewed at the instance of a person who alleges no injury, to settle whether a future application of the regulations that may never occur would be valid. The lack of support for this decision is disclosed by the Court's primary reliance on CBS,\n4\n a case which in my view not only fails to support the Court's conclusion but is persuasive, if not controlling, authority for precisely the opposite result.\n5\n In my opinion, the implications of the \n\n[351 \nU.S. 192, 213]\n\u00a0\n decision undermine much of the settled law on reviewability of administrative action, and it is the more unfortunate because made without the benefit of briefs or argument by the parties. I cannot concur in that part of the Court's opinion.\n\nThe Court having decided, however, that the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction, I concur with the Court on the merits.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Although the question of reviewability was not raised below or argued here, there can be no doubt of the power of the Court to consider the issue sua sponte, since it goes to the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals and of this Court. Cf. Federal Communications Comm'n v. National Broadcasting Co., \n319 \nU.S. 239, 246\n; Rochester Telephone Corp. v. United States, \n307 \nU.S. 125, 128\n, n. 3; American Federation of Labor v. Labor Board, \n308 \nU.S. 401, 404\n. The jurisdiction of the Courts of Appeals to review orders of the Federal Communications Commission, other than those granting or denying licenses, is granted by the Act of December 29, 1950, 64 Stat. 1129, 5 U.S.C. 1031-1042. Section 1032, which confers the jurisdiction, provides that \"Such jurisdiction shall be invoked by the filing of a petition as provided in section 1034.\" Section 1034, in turn, provides that \"Any party aggrieved by a final order . . . may, within sixty days after entry of such order, file in the court of appeals . . . a petition to review such order.\" In short, the court's jurisdiction may be invoked only upon the petition of a \"party aggrieved by a final order.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Insofar as the Multiple Ownership regulations provide for the revocation of existing licenses upon the purchase by a licensee of a stock interest in more than the maximum number of stations, they could arguably be deemed an \"order\" forbidding licensees, under pain of license revocation, to engage in stock transactions the result of which would violate the numerical limitations. Storer is not complaining, however, of any such deterrent effect of the regulations and does not allege that it desires either to buy or to sell stock in any licensee. It objects only to the possibility of a future loss of a license should persons beyond its control - and, by hypothesis, not deterred by the regulations - purchase its stock. See paragraph (b) of Storer's allegations, p. 208, infra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The recent holding of this Court in East Texas Motor Freight Lines, Inc. v. Frozen Food Express, ante, p. 49, does not support the result reached here. In that case the declaratory interpretation of the Interstate Commerce Act - sought by way of review of the Commission's interpretative regulations in a proceeding under the Urgent Deficiencies Act - was considered justified because of the possibility of criminal penalties being imposed for violations of the Act and the risk of loss of substantial investments in operations that might subsequently be enjoined by the Commission. No such necessity for declaratory relief is even alleged here; there is no threat of criminal prosecutions and, since a license is always a condition precedent to acquisition of a new station, there is no danger of the loss of investments to be made prior to the future administrative action.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Of the other cases cited by the Court, only Federal Communications Comm'n v. American Broadcasting Co., \n347 \nU.S. 284\n, involved a similar situation, and there the jurisdictional problem was neither raised by the parties nor noted by the Court.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Throughout the opinion in the CBS case, the Court emphasized the exceptional circumstances which justified immediate review of the Chain Broadcasting regulations and distinguished them from regulations of the sort here involved. See, e. g., \n316 \nU.S., at 424\n-425: \"We need not stop to discuss here the great variety of administrative rulings which, unlike this one, are not reviewable - either because \n\n[351 \nU.S. 192, 213]\n\u00a0\n they do not adjudicate rights or declare them legislatively, or because there are adequate administrative remedies which must be pursued before resorting to judicial remedies, or because there is no occasion to resort to equitable remedies. But we should not for that reason fail to discriminate between them and this case in which, because of its peculiar circumstances, all the elements prerequisite to judicial review are present. The ultimate test of reviewability is not to be found in an overrefined technique, but in the need of the review to protect from the irreparable injury threatened in the exceptional case by administrative rulings which attach legal consequences to action taken in advance of other hearings and adjudications that may follow, the results of which the regulations purport to control.\"\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, dissenting.\n\nWhile I agree that the amendatory Rules promulgated by the Federal Communications Commission relating to Multiple Ownership of standard, FM and television stations constitute a reviewable \"order\" within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 1034, my Brother HARLAN'S reasoning convinces me that the respondent was not on the record before us a \"party aggrieved\" under that section. Therefore the court below should not have entertained the petition to review the Commission's order.\n\nProcedural and jurisdictional limitations on judicial action by the federal courts are not playthings of lawyers nor obstructions on the road of justice. Whether formulated by the Constitution, congressional enactments or settled judicial precedents, they are means designed to keep the courts within appropriate limits and to enforce \n\n[351 \nU.S. 192, 214]\n\u00a0\n rights according to general standards and not have them depend on the impact of the individual case. To be sure, dealing as we are with general standards, differences of views regarding their scope and applicability are bound to arise from time to time. Who is a \"party aggrieved\" or a \"party in interest\" turns on the context, often confused and dubious, of a particular set of circumstances and therefore raises issues on which judges not unnaturally divide, as they do on other unmathematical problems of the law. See Singer & Sons v. Union Pacific R. Co., \n311 \nU.S. 295\n.\n\nTo the laity such matters may seem technicalities in a derogatory sense of the term. But this is only one phase of an attitude of mind that thinks ill of law which does not accord with private wishes. When informed by a legal adviser that to carry out his desires would encounter \"technical legal difficulties,\" a strenuous President of the United States impatiently observed that \"all law is technicality.\" But even professionally competent officials are at times impatient with decisions that fail to adjudicate substantive issues on which light is sought. It seems to me important, therefore, not to minimize the function of jurisdictional limitations upon adjudication by expressing views on the merits. There are, of course, exceptional situations where it is proper for a dissenter to go to the merits when a majority of the Court removes from the case threshold objections of procedure and jurisdiction. See, e. g., Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority, \n297 \nU.S. 288, 341\n. This is not such a case. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 192, 215]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","92":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. v.

The Court holds that a federal tax lien has priority over a statutory machanic's lien, even though the mechanic's lien was specific, prior in time, perfected in the sense that everything possible under state law had been done to make it choate, and was being enforced before the federal tax lien arose. The mechanic's lien arose out of a contract to furnish labor and materials for the improvement of the real estate. The contract had been performed, the mechanic's lien recorded for a specific amount, and suit instituted to enforce the lien-all before the federal taxes were assessed and the tax liens recorded. Moreover, by the time the United States filed the present action to foreclose its tax liens, the mechanic's lien had been reduced to judgment, and the real estate sold at public auction and transferred by the purchaser to others. In United States v. City of New Britain, Conn., \n347 \nU.S. 81, 84\n, 369, we said that liens under state law were 'perfected in the sense that [ U.S. v. White Bear Brewing Co.   \n350 \nU.S. 1010\n (1956)  ][1010-Continued.]\nthere is nothing more to be done to have a choate lien-when the identity of the lienor, the property subject to the lien, and the amount of the lien are established.' Accordingly, we held that the principle that \n\n[350 \nU.S. 1010\n, 1011]\n\u00a0\n \"the first in time is the first is right\", id., 347 U.S. at page 85, 74 S. Ct. 370, should be applied. I would apply the same principle here.\n  None of our other cases stands in the way. United States v. Security Trust & Savings Bank of San Diego, \n340 \nU.S. 47\n, involved a general inchoate attachment lien which had been procured by the holder of an unsecured note. The attachment lien gave no right to proceed against the property unless the lienor obtained a judgment within three years. In United States v. Acri, \n348 \nU.S. 211\n, the attachment lien was contingent upon the outcome of the suit for damages and was therefore 'inchoate.' Id., 348 U.S. at page 214, 75 S.Ct. at page 241. The same was true of the lien of the garnisher in United States v. Liverpool & London & Globe Ins. Co., \n348 \nU.S. 215\n. In United States v. Scovil, \n348 \nU.S. 218\n, the landlord's distress lien was 'only a caveat of a more perfect lien to come.' Id., 348 U.S. at page 220, 75 S.Ct. at page 246. And in United States v. Colotta, \n350 \nU.S. 808\n, the mechanic's lien which we subordinated to the federal tax lien had become definite in amount but no steps had been taken to file the statutory lis pendens notice nor to enforce the lien before the federal lien arose and was recorded.\n  Here the lien is not general and inchoate. It is specific and choate. The lienor had an immediate right to 'enforce his lien' against the property. Ill.Rev.Stat.1953, c. 82, s 9. This is clearly more than 'merely a lis pendens notice that a right to perfect a lien exists.' 340 U.S. at page 50, 71 S.Ct. at page 113. Indeed, the mechanic's lienor had instituted suit to enforce the lien before the federal tax lien arose and had completed enforcement of the lien by the time the United States instituted the present action.\n  The Court apparently holds that under 26 U.S.C. s 3670, 26 U.S.C.A. s 3670, a lien that is specific and choate under state law, no matter how diligently enforced, can never prevail against a subsequent federal tax lien, short of reducing the lien to final judgment. That is new doctrine, not warranted by our decisions, and supportable only if the New Britain case were overruled. \n\n\n\n","93":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nULLMANN v. UNITED STATES(1956)\nNo. 58\nArgued: December 6, 1955Decided: March 26, 1956\n\n\n\n\n Pursuant to subpoena, petitioner appeared before a federal grand jury which was investigating attempts to endanger the national security by espionage and conspiracy to commit espionage. Invoking the privilege against self-incrimination, he refused to answer questions relating to his knowledge of such activities, to his and other persons' participation in such activities, and to his and other persons' membership in the Communist Party. Under the Immunity Act of 1954, 18 U.S.C. 2486 (c), the United States Attorney, with the approval of the Attorney General, applied to a Federal District Court for an order requiring petitioner to testify before the grand jury. The Court issued such an order; petitioner persisted in his refusal to testify; and he was convicted of contempt and sentenced to imprisonment. Held: The Act is constitutional and the conviction is sustained. Pp. 423-439.\n\n 1. The Act does not violate the Fifth Amendment, because the immunity which it provides against prosecutions, penalties and forfeitures is sufficiently broad to displace the protection afforded by the privilege against self-incrimination. Pp. 429-431.\n\n\n 2. Assuming that the statutory requirements are met, subsection (c) does not give a Federal District Court discretion to deny an application for an order requiring a witness to answer relevant questions put by a grand jury, and therefore it does not impose on the Court a non-judicial function. Pp. 431-434.\n\n\n 3. The Act provides immunity from state prosecution for crime, and, in doing so, it does not exceed the constitutional power of Congress. Pp. 434-436.\n\n\n 4. Brown v.

Davitt.\n\nOsmond K. Fraenkel filed a brief for the National Lawyers Guild, as amicus curiae, supporting petitioner.\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nOn November 10, 1954, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York filed an application under the Immunity Act of 1954, 68 Stat. 745, 18 U.S.C. (Supp. II) 3486, for an order requiring petitioner to testify before a grand jury. The Immunity Act, in its pertinent portions, provides:\n\n \"(c) Whenever in the judgment of a United States attorney the testimony of any witness, or the production of books, papers, or other evidence by any witness, in any case or proceeding before any grand jury or court of the United States involving any interference with or endangering of, or any plans or attempts to interfere with or endanger, the national security or defense of the United States by treason, sabotage, espionage, sedition, seditious conspiracy, violations of chapter 115 of title 18 of the United States Code, violations of the Internal Security Act of 1950 (64 Stat. 987), violations of the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 (60 Stat. 755), as amended, violations of sections 212 (a) (27), (28), (29) or 241 (a) (6), (7) or 313 (a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (66 Stat. 182-186; 204-206; 240-241), and conspiracies involving any of the foregoing, is necessary to the public interest, he, upon the approval of the Attorney General, shall make application to the court that the witness shall be instructed to testify or produce evidence subject to the provisions \n\n[350 \nU.S. 422, 424]\n\u00a0\n of this section, and upon order of the court such witness shall not be excused from testifying or from producing books, papers, or other evidence on the ground that the testimony or evidence required of him may tend to incriminate him or subject him to a penalty or forfeiture. But no such witness shall be prosecuted or subjected to any penalty or forfeiture for or on account of any transaction, matter, or thing concerning which he is compelled, after having claimed his privilege against self-incrimination, to testify or produce evidence, nor shall testimony so compelled be used as evidence in any criminal proceeding (except prosecution described in subsection (d) hereof) against him in any court.\n\n\n \"(d) No witness shall be exempt under the provision of this section from prosecution for perjury or contempt committed while giving testimony or producing evidence under compulsion as provided in this section.\"\n\n\n In his application the United States Attorney alleged the following facts. On November 3, 1954, petitioner, pursuant to subpoena, appeared before a duly constituted grand jury of the Southern District of New York which was investigating matters concerned with attempts to endanger the national security by espionage and conspiracy to commit espionage. The grand jury asked him a series of questions relating to his knowledge of such activities, to his and other persons' participation in such activities, and to his and other persons' membership in the Communist Party. Petitioner, invoking the privilege against self-incrimination, refused to answer the questions. The United States Attorney also asserted that he deemed the testimony necessary to the public interest of the United States, and annexed a letter from the Attorney General of the United States approving the application. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 422, 425]\n\u00a0\n The United States Attorney, in compliance with a request of the district judge, filed an affidavit asserting his own good faith in filing the application.\n\nPetitioner, contesting the application, attacked the constitutionality of the Act and urged that, if the immunity statute be held constitutional, the District Court should, in the exercise of its discretion, deny the application. He filed an affidavit setting forth in detail experiences with agents of the Department of Justice and congressional investigating committees and other information in support of his plea for an exercise of discretion by the District Court. The Government in reply filed affidavits denying some of the allegations set forth in petitioner's affidavit.\n\nOn January 31, 1955, the District Court sustained the constitutionality of the statute. 128 F. Supp. 617. Its order, dated February 8, 1955, instructed petitioner \"to answer the questions propounded to him before the Grand Jury and to testify and produce evidence with respect to such matters under inquiry before said Grand Jury . . . .\" Petitioner appealed from this order, but the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit dismissed the appeal on the authority of Cobbledick v. United States, \n309 \nU.S. 323\n.\n\nPetitioner again refused to answer the questions which the District Court had ordered him to answer. He was then brought before the District Court and, on stipulation that he had refused to obey the order of the court of February 8, he was convicted of contempt and sentenced to six months' imprisonment unless he should purge himself of the contempt. Petitioner appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit which affirmed the judgment of the District Court. 221 F.2d 760. The importance of the questions at issue, in view of the differences between the legislation sustained in Brown v. Walker, \n161 \nU.S. 591\n, and the Act under review, led us to bring the case here. \n349 \nU.S. 951\n. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 422, 426]\n\u00a0\n\n\nFour major questions are raised by this appeal: Is the immunity provided by the Act sufficiently broad to displace the protection afforded by the privilege against self-incrimination? Assuming that the statutory requirements are met, does the Act give the district judge discretion to deny an application for an order requiring a witness to answer relevant questions put by the grand jury, and, if so, is the court thereby required to exercise a function that is not an exercise of \"judicial Power\"? Did Congress provide immunity from state prosecution for crime, and, if so, is it empowered to do so? Does the Fifth Amendment prohibit compulsion of what would otherwise be self-incriminating testimony no matter what the scope of the immunity statute?\n\nIt is relevant to define explicitly the spirit in which the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination should be approached. This command of the Fifth Amendment (\"nor shall any person . . . be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself . . . .\") registers an important advance in the development of our liberty - \"one of the great landmarks in man's struggle to make himself civilized.\"\n1\n Time has not shown that protection from the evils against which this safeguard was directed is needless or unwarranted. This constitutional protection must not be interpreted in a hostile or niggardly spirit. Too many, even those who should be better advised, view this privilege as a shelter for wrongdoers. They too readily assume that those who invoke it are either guilty of crime or commit perjury in claiming the privilege.\n2\n Such a view does scant honor \n\n[350 \nU.S. 422, 427]\n\u00a0\n to the patriots who sponsored the Bill of Rights as a condition to acceptance of the Constitution by the ratifying States. The Founders of the Nation were not naive or disregardful of the interests of justice. The difference between them and those who deem the privilege an obstruction to due inquiry has been appropriately indicated by Chief Judge Magruder:\n\n \"Our forefathers, when they wrote this provision into the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution, had in mind a lot of history which has been largely forgotten to-day. See VIII Wigmore on Evidence (3d ed. 1940) 2250 et seq.; Morgan, The Privilege Against Self-Incrimination, 34 Minn. L. Rev. 1 (1949). They made a judgment and expressed it in our fundamental law, that it were better for an occasional crime to go unpunished than that the prosecution should be free to build up a criminal case, in whole or in part, with the assistance of enforced disclosures by the accused. The privilege against self-incrimination serves as a protection to the innocent as well as to the guilty, and we have been admonished that it should be given a liberal application. Hoffman v. United States, . . . \n341 \nU.S. 479, 486\n . . . . If it be thought that the privilege is outmoded in the conditions of this modern \n\n[350 \nU.S. 422, 428]\n\u00a0\n age, then the thing to do is to take it out of the Constitution, not to whittle it down by the subtle encroachments of judicial opinion.\" Maffie v. United States, 209 F.2d 225, 227.\n\n\n Nothing new can be put into the Constitution except through the amendatory process. Nothing old can be taken out without the same process.\n\nNo doubt the constitutional privilege may, on occasion, save a guilty man from his just deserts. It was aimed at a more far-reaching evil - a recurrence of the Inquisition and the Star Chamber, even if not in their stark brutality. Prevention of the greater evil was deemed of more importance than occurrence of the lesser evil. Having had much experience with a tendency in human nature to abuse power, the Founders sought to close the doors against like future abuses by law-enforcing agencies.\n\nAs no constitutional guarantee enjoys preference, so none should suffer subordination or deletion. It is appropriate to read the conviction expressed in a memorable address by Senator Albert J. Beveridge to the American Bar Association in 1920, a time when there was also manifested impatience with some of the restrictions of the Constitution in the presumed interest of security. His appeal was to the Constitution - to the whole Constitution, not to a mutilating selection of those parts only which for the moment find favor.\n3\n To view a particular \n\n[350 \nU.S. 422, 429]\n\u00a0\n provision of the Bill of Rights with disfavor inevitably results in a constricted application of it. This is to disrespect the Constitution.\n\nIt is in this spirit of strict, not lax, observance of the constitutional protection of the individual that we approach the claims made by petitioner in this case. The attack on the Immunity Act as violating the Fifth Amendment is not a new one. Sixty years ago this Court considered, in Brown v. Walker, \n161 \nU.S. 591\n, the constitutionality of a similar Act, the Act of February 11, 1893, 27 Stat. 443.\n4\n In that case, Brown, auditor for a railroad company, had been subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury which was investigating charges that officers and agents of the company had violated the Interstate Commerce Act. Invoking the privilege against self-incrimination, he refused to answer certain questions concerning the operations and the rebate policy of the railroad. On an order to show cause before the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, he was adjudged in contempt. His petition for a writ of habeas corpus to the Circuit Court for the Western District \n\n[350 \nU.S. 422, 430]\n\u00a0\n of Pennsylvania was dismissed. Petitioner appealed to this Court, urging that the 1893 immunity statute was unconstitutional.\n\nThe Court considered and rejected petitioner's arguments, holding that a statute which compelled testimony but secured the witness against a criminal prosecution which might be aided directly or indirectly by his disclosures did not violate the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination and that the 1893 statute did provide such immunity. \"While the constitutional provision in question is justly regarded as one of the most valuable prerogatives of the citizen, its object is fully accomplished by the statutory immunity, and we are, therefore, of opinion that the witness was compellable to answer . . . .\" \n161 \nU.S., at 610\n.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nPetitioner, however, attempts to distinguish Brown v. Walker. He argues that this case is different from Brown v. Walker because the impact of the disabilities imposed by federal and state authorities and the public in general - such as loss of job, expulsion from labor unions, state registration and investigation statutes, passport eligibility, and general public opprobrium - is so oppressive that the statute does not give him true immunity. This, he alleges, is significantly different from the impact of testifying on the auditor in Brown v. Walker, who could the next day resume his job with reputation unaffected.\n6\n But, as this Court has often held, \n\n[350 \nU.S. 422, 431]\n\u00a0\n the immunity granted need only remove those sanctions which generate the fear justifying invocation of the privilege: \"The interdiction of the Fifth Amendment operates only where a witness is asked to incriminate himself - in other words, to give testimony which may possibly expose him to a criminal charge. But if the criminality has already been taken away, the Amendment ceases to apply.\" Hale v. Henkel, \n201 \nU.S. 43, 67\n. Here, since the Immunity Act protects a witness who is compelled to answer to the extent of his constitutional immunity, he has of course, when a particular sanction is sought to be imposed against him, the right to claim that it is criminal in nature.\n\nAgain, the petitioner seeks to distinguish this case from Brown v. Walker by claiming that under the Immunity Act of 1954 the district judge to whom the United States Attorney must apply for an order instructing him to testify has discretion in granting the order and thus has discretion in granting the immunity which automatically follows from the order. Petitioner cites the language of the statute, the legislative history, and miscellaneous other authorities in support of his construction. The Government contends that the court has no discretion to determine whether the public interest would best be served by exchanging immunity from prosecution for testimony, that its only function is to order a witness to testify if it determines that the case is within the framework of the statute.\n\nWe are concerned here only with (c) and therefore need not pass on this question with respect to (a) and \n\n[350 \nU.S. 422, 432]\n\u00a0\n (b) of the Act.\n7\n A fair reading of (c) does not indicate that the district judge has any discretion to deny the order on the ground that the public interest does not \n\n[350 \nU.S. 422, 433]\n\u00a0\n warrant it. We agree with District Judge Weinfeld's interpretation of this section:\n8\n\u00a0\n\n \"The most that can be said for the legislative history is that it is on the whole inconclusive. Certainly, it contains nothing that requires the court to reject the construction which the statutory language clearly requires. Especially is this so where the construction contended for purports to raise a serious constitutional question as to the role of the judiciary under the doctrine of separation of powers. The Supreme Court has repeatedly warned `if a serious doubt of constitutionality is raised, it is a cardinal principle that this Court will first ascertain whether a construction of the statute is fairly possible by which the question may be avoided.'\n9\n Indeed, the Court has stated that words may be strained `in the candid service of avoiding a serious constitutional doubt.'\n10\n Here there is no need to strain words. It requires neither torturing of language nor disregard of a clear legislative policy\n11\n to avoid the constitutional question advanced by the witness. Indeed, to reach the constitutional issue would require straining of language. In such circumstances the court's duty is plainly to avoid the constitutional question.\" 128 F. Supp., at 627-628. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 422, 434]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n Since the Court's duty under (c) is only to ascertain whether the statutory requirements are complied with by the grand jury, the United States Attorney, and the Attorney General, we have no difficulty in concluding that the district court is confined within the scope of \"judicial Power.\" Interstate Commerce Commission v. Brimson, \n154 \nU.S. 447\n.\n\nPetitioner further argues that the immunity is not constitutionally sufficient so long as a witness is subject to the very real possibility of state prosecution. He urges that the statute does not, and constitutionally could not, grant such immunity. The immunity portion of the statute contains two parts. The first prohibits prosecutions and is worded virtually in the terms of the 1893 Act. The second makes explicit that the compelled testimony shall not be used against the witness in any proceeding in any court. Such a clause was construed in Adams v. Maryland, \n347 \nU.S. 179\n, to apply to state courts. In Brown v. Walker, it was urged that the prohibition against prosecution did not grant protection against prosecution in the state courts. First finding that Congress could constitutionally provide such immunity, the Court then interpreted the statute:\n\n \"The act in question contains no suggestion that it is to be applied only to the Federal courts. It declares broadly that `no person shall be excused from attending and testifying . . . before the Interstate Commerce Commission . . . on the ground . . . that the testimony . . . required of him may tend to criminate him,' etc. `But no person shall be prosecuted or subjected to any penalty or forfeiture for or on account of any transaction, matter or thing concerning which he may testify,' etc. It is not that he shall not be prosecuted for or on account of any crime concerning which he may testify, which might \n\n[350 \nU.S. 422, 435]\n\u00a0\n possibly be urged to apply only to crimes under the Federal law and not to crimes, such as the passing of counterfeit money, etc., which are also cognizable under state laws; but the immunity extends to any transaction, matter or thing concerning which he may testify, which clearly indicates that the immunity is intended to be general, and to be applicable whenever and in whatever court such prosecution may be had.\" \n161 \nU.S., at 607\n-608.\n\n\n The Report of the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives supports the broad interpretation of the Act before us:\n\n\"Even though the power of Congress to prohibit a subsequent State prosecution is doubtful, such a constitutional question should not prevent the enactment of the recommended bill. The language of the amendment . . . is sufficiently broad to ban a subsequent State prosecution if it be determined that the Congress has the constitutional power to do so. In addition, the amendment recommended provides the additional protection - as set forth in the Adams case, by outlawing the subsequent use of the compelled testimony in any criminal proceeding - State or Federal.\n\n\n  \"By the use of these two distinct concepts, the committee believes that the fullest protection that can be afforded the witness will be achieved.\" H. R. Rep. No. 2606, 83d Cong., 2d Sess. 7.\n\n\n Petitioner questions the constitutional power of Congress to grant immunity from state prosecution. Congressional abolition of state power to punish crimes committed in violation of state law presents a more drastic exercise of congressional power than that which we considered in Adams. In that case, only the use of the compelled testimony, not prosecution itself, was prohibited. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 422, 436]\n\u00a0\n Here the State is forbidden to prosecute. But it cannot be contested that Congress has power to provide for national defense and the complementary power \"To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.\" U.S. Const., Art. I, 8, cl. 18. The Immunity Act is concerned with the national security. It reflects a congressional policy to increase the possibility of more complete and open disclosure by removal of fear of state prosecution. We cannot say that Congress' paramount authority in safeguarding national security does not justify the restriction it has placed on the exercise of state power for the more effective exercise of conceded federal power. We have already, in the name of the Commerce Clause, upheld a similar restriction on state court jurisdiction, Brown v. Walker, \n161 \nU.S., at 606\n-607, and we can find no distinction between the reach of congressional power with respect to commerce and its power with respect to national security. See also Hines v. Davidowitz, \n312 \nU.S. 52\n.\n12\n\u00a0\n\nPetitioner also urges that if Brown v. Walker is found nondistinguishable and controlling, then that case should be reconsidered and overruled. He also urges upon us a \"return\" to a literal reading of the Fifth Amendment. Brown v. Walker was the second case to deal with an immunity statute. Four years previously, in Counselman v. Hitchcock, \n142 \nU.S. 547\n, a unanimous Court had found \n\n[350 \nU.S. 422, 437]\n\u00a0\n constitutionally inadequate the predecessor to the 1893 statute because the immunity granted was incomplete, in that it merely forbade the use of the testimony given and failed to protect a witness from future prosecution based on knowledge and sources of information obtained from the compelled testimony. It was with this background that the 1893 statute, providing complete immunity from prosecution, was passed and that Brown v. Walker was argued and decided. As in Counselman, appellant's numerous arguments were presented by James C. Carter, widely acknowledged as the leader of the American bar.\n13\n The Court was closely divided in upholding the statute, and the opinions reflect the thoroughness with which the issues were considered. Since that time the Court's holding in Brown v. Walker has never been challenged; the case and the doctrine it announced have consistently and \n\n[350 \nU.S. 422, 438]\n\u00a0\n without question been treated as definitive by this Court, in opinions written, among others, by Holmes and Brandeis, JJ. See, e. g., McCarthy v. Arndstein, \n266 \nU.S. 34, 42\n; Heike v. United States, \n227 \nU.S. 131, 142\n. The 1893 statute has become part of our constitutional fabric and has been included \"in substantially the same terms, in virtually all of the major regulatory enactments of the Federal Government.\" Shapiro v. United States, \n335 \nU.S. 1, 6\n. For a partial list of these statutes, see, id., at 6-7, n. 4. Moreover, the States, with one exception - a case decided prior to Brown v. Walker - have, under their own constitutions, enunciated the same doctrine, 8 Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed.) 2281, and have passed numerous statutes compelling testimony in exchange for immunity in the form either of complete amnesty or of prohibition of the use of the compelled testimony. For a list of such statutes, see 8 Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed.), 2281, n. 11 (pp. 478-501) and Pocket Supplement thereto, 2281, n. 11 (pp. 147-157).\n\nWe are not dealing here with one of the vague, undefinable, admonitory provisions of the Constitution whose scope is inevitably addressed to changing circumstances. The privilege against self-incrimination is a specific provision of which it is peculiarly true that \"a page of history is worth a volume of logic.\" New York Trust Co. v. Eisner, \n256 \nU.S. 345, 349\n. For the history of the privilege establishes not only that it is not to be interpreted literally,\n14\n but also that its sole concern is, as its name indicates, with the danger to a witness forced to give testimony leading to the infliction of \"penalties \n\n[350 \nU.S. 422, 439]\n\u00a0\n affixed to the criminal acts . . . .\" Boyd v. United States, \n116 \nU.S. 616, 634\n. We leave Boyd v. United States unqualified, as it was left unqualified in Brown v. Walker. Immunity displaces the danger. Once the reason for the privilege ceases, the privilege ceases. We reaffirm Brown v. Walker, and in so doing we need not repeat the answers given by that case to the other points raised by petitioner.\n15\n\u00a0\n\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE REED concurs in the opinion and judgment of the Court except as to the statement that no constitutional \n\n[350 \nU.S. 422, 440]\n\u00a0\n guarantee enjoys preference. Murdock v. Pennsylvania, \n319 \nU.S. 105, 115\n; Thomas v. Collins, \n323 \nU.S. 516, 530\n; cf. Kovacs v. Cooper, \n336 \nU.S. 77, 88\n.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Griswold, The Fifth Amendment Today (1955), 7.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Father John Fearon, O. P., has addressed himself to this misapprehension: \"What is to be said of the opinion that an innocent man has an obligation in conscience not to have recourse to the Fifth Amendment? Since the natural law does not provide explicitly for this circumstance moral obligation has to be determined \n\n[350 \nU.S. 422, 427]\n\u00a0\n by civil law. Actually the determination of civil law is quite clear: the innocent and guilty alike have a right of recourse to the Fifth Amendment. And if the innocent man has a clearly defined right to such recourse it is inconceivable that he could simultaneously have a duty not to have recourse, since rights and duties are correlative. Nor can it be urged that non-recourse is a duty of piety rather than justice. If such an opinion were binding and all innocent men waived their rights to the protection of the Fifth Amendment, the purpose of the law would be defeated and the common welfare of the nation would suffer rather than prosper.\" Congressional Investigations and Moral Theology, The Commonweal, Feb. 19, 1954, 497, 499.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] \"If liberty is worth keeping and free representative government worth saving, we must stand for all American fundamentals - not some, but all. All are woven into the great fabric of our national well-being. We cannot hold fast to some only, and abandon others that, for the moment, we find inconvenient. If one American fundamental is prostrated, others in the end will surely fall. The success or failure of the American theory of society and government, depends upon our fidelity to every one of those inter-dependent parts of that immortal charter of orderly freedom, the Constitution of the United States.\" Beveridge, The Assault upon American Fundamentals, 45 Reports of American Bar Assn., 188, 216 (1920).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] \". . . no person shall be excused from attending and testifying or from producing books, papers, tariffs, contracts, agreements and documents before the Interstate Commerce Commission, or in obedience to the subpoena of the Commission . . . or in any cause or proceeding, criminal or otherwise, based upon or growing out of any alleged violation of the act of Congress, entitled, `An act to regulate commerce,' . . . on the ground or for the reason that the testimony or evidence, documentary or otherwise, required of him, may tend to criminate him or subject him to a penalty or forfeiture.

Walker stated: \". . . it is entirely clear that he was not the chief or even a substantial offender against the law, and that his privilege was claimed for the purpose of shielding the railway or its officers from answering a charge of having violated its provisions. To say that, notwithstanding his immunity from punishment, he would incur personal odium and disgrace from answering these questions, seems too much like an abuse of language to be worthy of serious consideration.\" 161 U.S., \n\n[350 \nU.S. 422, 431]\n\u00a0\n at 609-610. The Court, however, concluded: \"But, even if this were true, under the authorities above cited, he would still be compelled to answer, if the facts sought to be elucidated were material to the issue.\" Id., at 610.

United States, \n335 \nU.S. 1, 31\n . . . .\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] We need not consider at this time petitioner's claim that immunity is not complete and the statute unconstitutional because he can be prosecuted later for participation in a continuing conspiracy. Congress has the power to provide, and has provided, that immunity from prosecution which the Constitution requires. See Heike v. United States, \n227 \nU.S. 131, 142\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] He urged that the statute left the witness in a worse condition because it did not abrogate the crime for which he was given immunity; that the constitutional safeguard goes toward relieving the witness from the danger of an accusation being made against him while the statutory immunity forces him to supply evidence leading to an accusation and provides only a means for defense; that the statute puts a heavy burden on petitioner, if he is indicted, to prove that he had testified concerning the matter for which he was indicted; that a citizen is entitled to the very thing secured to him by the constitutional safeguards and not something which will probably answer the same purpose; that the statute subjects him to the infamy and disgrace from which he was protected by the constitutional safeguard; that the statute did not protect him from prosecution for a state crime; that even if it were so interpreted, Congress had no power to grant such protection; that the immunity granted was too narrow since it only extended to matters concerning which he was called to testify and not to all matters related to the testimony given; that to be able to claim the privilege the witness would virtually have to reveal his crime in order that the court could see that the statute failed to protect him; and finally that the statute was an attempt to exercise the power of pardon which was a power not delegated to Congress.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] \". . . the provisions of the Constitution are not mathematical formulas having their essence in their form; they are organic living institutions transplanted from English soil. Their significance is vital not formal; it is to be gathered not simply by taking the words and a dictionary, but by considering their origin and the line of their growth.\" Gompers v. United States, \n233 \nU.S. 604, 610\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] We do not discuss petitioner's argument, relying on the First Amendment, that inquiry into his political membership and associations is unconstitutional. Petitioner contends that some of the questions which he was asked are objectionable because they require testimony that is protected by the implications of the First Amendment. But it is every man's duty to give testimony before a duly constituted tribunal unless he invokes some valid legal exemption in withholding it. Although petitioner made the First Amendment argument when the United States Attorney applied, under the Immunity Act, for an order requiring him to testify, when he was cited for contempt he urged only \"all of the grounds we urged before Judge Weinfeld in opposition to the statute, in support of our contention that the statute was unconstitutional. We will rest on that and proceed on that basis in the Appellate Courts.\" Petitioner did not make any objection to the questions other than the assertion of the unconstitutionality of the Immunity Act. It should also be noted that when petitioner - who, the record shows, was an experienced witness, had been advised by counsel especially experienced in this field, and was desirous of making this a test case - refused to answer the questions propounded before the grand jury the second time, he did not claim any privilege under the First Amendment. His counsel, by way of dispensing with the reading of the minutes of what took place before the grand jury, stated that \"the reason given for his refusal was that he feared the answers might incriminate him and he pleaded his privilege under the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution.\"\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom MR. JUSTICE BLACK concurs, dissenting.\n\nI would reverse the judgment of conviction. I would base the reversal on Boyd v. United States, \n116 \nU.S. 616\n, or, in the alternative, I would overrule the five-to-four decision of Brown v. Walker, \n161 \nU.S. 591\n, and adopt the view of the minority in that case that the right of silence created by the Fifth Amendment is beyond the reach of Congress.\n\nFirst, as to the Boyd case. There are numerous disabilities created by federal law that attach to a person who is a Communist. These disabilities include ineligibility for employment in the Federal Government and in defense facilities, disqualification for a passport, the risk of internment, the risk of loss of employment as a longshoreman - to mention only a few.\n1\n These disabilities imposed by federal law are forfeitures within the meaning of our cases and as much protected by the Fifth \n\n[350 \nU.S. 422, 441]\n\u00a0\n Amendment as criminal prosecution itself. But there is no indication that the Immunity Act, 68 Stat. 745, 18 U.S.C. (Supp. II) 3486, grants protection against those disabilities. The majority will not say that it does. I think, indeed, that it must be read as granting only partial, not complete, immunity for the matter disclosed under compulsion. Yet, as the Court held in Counselman v. Hitchcock, \n142 \nU.S. 547, 586\n, an immunity statute to be valid must \"supply a complete protection from all the perils against which the constitutional prohibition was designed to guard . . . .\"\n\nBoyd v. United States, supra, involved a proceeding to establish a forfeiture of goods alleged to have been fraudulently imported without payment of duties. The claimants resisted an order requiring the production of an invoice to be used against them in the forfeiture proceedings. The Court in an opinion by Mr. Justice Bradley sustained the defense of the Fifth Amendment. The Court said, \"A witness, as well as a party, is protected by the law from being compelled to give evidence that tends to criminate him, or to subject his property to forfeiture.\" \n116 \nU.S., at 638\n. And see Lees v. United States, \n150 \nU.S. 476\n. The contrary holding was deemed hostile to the spirit of our institutions:\n\n  \". . . any compulsory discovery by extorting the  party's oath, or compelling the production of his  private books and papers, to convict him of crime, or  to forfeit his property, is contrary to the principles  of a free government. It is abhorrent to the instincts  of an Englishman; it is abhorrent to the instincts of  an American. It may suit the purposes of despotic  power; but it cannot abide the pure atmosphere of  political liberty and personal freedom.\" 116 U.S.,  at 631-632. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 422, 442]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n The forfeiture of property on compelled testimony is no more abhorrent than the forfeiture of rights of citizenship. Any forfeiture of rights as a result of compelled testimony is at war with the Fifth Amendment.\n\nThe Court apparently distinguishes the Boyd case on the ground that the forfeiture of property was a penalty affixed to a criminal act. The loss of a job and the ineligibility for a passport are also penalties affixed to a criminal act. For the case of Dennis v. United States, \n341 \nU.S. 494\n, makes plain that membership in the Communist Party is a crucial link of evidence for conviction under the Smith Act, 54 Stat. 671, as amended, 62 Stat. 808, 18 U.S.C. 2385. And see Blau v. United States, \n340 \nU.S. 159\n. When a man loses a job because he is a Communist, there is as much a penalty suffered as when an importer loses property because he is a tax evader. When a man loses his right to a passport because he is a Communist, there is as much a penalty suffered as when property is lost for violation of the revenue laws. If there was a penalty suffered in the Boyd case, there are penalties suffered here. Both are hitched to criminal acts. And the Constitution places the property rights involved in the Boyd case no higher than the rights of citizenship involved here.\n\nThe Court may mean that if disqualification for government employment or ineligibility for a passport is a forfeiture within the meaning of the Boyd case, Congress has lifted these disabilities in exchange for the witness' testimony. Congress, I think, will be surprised to hear this. There is nothing in the legislative history that would suggest that Congress was willing to pay any such price for the testimony. If the disabilities which attach under existing law are forfeitures, the Court should strike down the Act. If Congress chooses to enact a new Immunity Act broad enough to protect against all forfeitures, it is free to do so. The Court seems to commit \n\n[350 \nU.S. 422, 443]\n\u00a0\n Congress to a policy that there is no indication Congress favors.\n\nWe should apply the principle of the Boyd case to the present one and hold that since there is no protection in the Immunity Act against loss of rights of citizenship, the immunity granted is less than the protection afforded by the Constitution. Certainly personal freedom has at least as much constitutional dignity as property.\n\nSecond, as to Brown v. Walker. The difficulty I have with that decision and with the majority of the Court in the present case is that they add an important qualification to the Fifth Amendment. The guarantee is that no person \"shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\" The majority does not enforce that guarantee as written but qualifies it; and the qualification apparently reads, \"but only if criminal conviction might result.\" Wisely or not, the Fifth Amendment protects against the compulsory self-accusation of crime without exception or qualification. In Counselman v. Hitchcock, supra, at 562, Mr. Justice Blatchford said, \"The privilege is limited to criminal matters, but it is as broad as the mischief against which it seeks to guard.\"\n\nThe \"mischief\" to be prevented falls under at least three heads.\n\n(1) One \"mischief\" is not only the risk of conviction but the risk of prosecution. Mr. Justice Shiras, one of the four dissenters in Brown v. Walker, alluded to this difficulty when he declared that the immunity statute involved in that case was unconstitutional:\n\n\". . . all that can be said is, that the witness is not protected, by the provision in question, from being prosecuted, but that he has been furnished with a good plea to the indictment, which will secure his acquittal. But is that true? Not unless the plea is sustained by competent evidence. His condition, \n\n[350 \nU.S. 422, 444]\n\u00a0\n then, is that he has been prosecuted, been compelled, presumably, to furnish bail, and put to the trouble and expense of employing counsel and furnishing the evidence to make good his plea.\" \n161 \nU.S., at 621\n.\n\n\n The risk of prosecution is not a risk which the wise take lightly. As experienced a judge as Learned Hand once said, \"I must say that, as a litigant, I should dread a lawsuit beyond almost anything else short of sickness and of death.\" See Frank, Courts on Trial (1949), 40. A part of the dread in a case such as this is the chain of events that may be put in motion once disclosure is made. The truth is, I think, that there is no control left, once the right of secrecy is broken. For the statute protects the accused only on account of the \"transaction, matter, or thing\" concerning which he is compelled to testify and bars the use as evidence of the \"testimony so compelled.\" The forced disclosure may open up vast new vistas for the prosecutor with leads to numerous accusations not within the purview of the question and answer. What related offenses may be disclosed by leads furnished by the confession? How remote need the offense be before the immunity ceases to protect it? How much litigation will it take to determine it? What will be the reaction of the highest court when the facts of the case reach it?\n\nIt is, for example, a crime for a person who is a member of a Communist organization registered under the Subversive Activities Control Act, 64 Stat. 987, 50 U.S.C. 781, to be employed by the United States, to be employed in any defense facility, to hold office or employment with any labor organization, 5 (a) (1), or to apply for a passport or to use a passport. 6 (a). The crime under that Act is the application for a passport, the use of a passport, or employment by one of the named agencies, as the case may be. Are those crimes included within \n\n[350 \nU.S. 422, 445]\n\u00a0\n the \"transaction, matter, or thing\" protected by the Immunity Act?\n\nThe Taft-Hartley Act, 61 Stat. 146, 29 U.S.C. 159 (h), requires officers of labor organizations to file non-Communist affidavits as a condition to the exercise by the National Labor Relations Board of its power to make investigations or to issue complaints. A witness before a grand jury or congressional committee is compelled under the force of the Immunity Act to testify. He testifies that he is not a member of the Communist Party. He then files an affidavit under the Taft-Hartley Act to that effect. May he be prosecuted for filing a false affidavit?\n\nThese are real and dread uncertainties that the Immunity Act does not remove. They emphasize that one protective function of the Fifth Amendment is at once removed when the guarantee against self-incrimination is qualified in the manner it is today.\n\nThe Court leaves all those uncertainties to another day, saying that the immunity granted by Congress will extend to its constitutional limits and that those constitutional limits will be determined case by case in future litigation. That means that no one knows what the limits are. The Court will not say. Only litigation on a distant day can determine it.\n\nThe concession of the Court underlines my point. It shows that the privilege of silence is exchanged for a partial, undefined, vague immunity. It means that Congress has granted far less than it has taken away.\n\n(2) The guarantee against self-incrimination contained in the Fifth Amendment is not only a protection against conviction and prosecution but a safeguard of conscience and human dignity and freedom of expression as well. My view is that the Framers put it beyond the power of Congress to compel anyone to confess his crimes. The evil to be guarded against was partly self-accusation \n\n[350 \nU.S. 422, 446]\n\u00a0\n under legal compulsion. But that was only a part of the evil. The conscience and dignity of man were also involved. So too was his right to freedom of expression guaranteed by the First Amendment.\n2\n The Framers, therefore, created the federally protected right of silence and decreed that the law could not be used to pry open one's lips and make him a witness against himself.\n\nA long history and a deep sentiment lay behind this decision. Some of those who came to these shores were Puritans who had known the hated oath ex officio used both by the Star Chamber and the High Commission. See Maguire, Attack of the Common Lawyers on the Oath Ex Officio as Administered in the Ecclesiastical Courts in England, Essays in History and Political Theory (1936), c. VII. They had known the great rebellion of Lilburn, Cartwright and others against those instruments of oppression. Cartwright had refused to take the oath ex officio before the High Commission on the grounds that \"hee thought he was not bound by the laws of God so to doe.\" Pearson, Thomas Cartwright and Elizabethan Puritanism 1535-1603 (1925), 318. Lilburn marshalled many arguments against the oath ex officio, one of them being the sanctity of conscience and the dignity of man before God:\n\n\"as for that Oath that was put upon me, I did refuse to take it as a sinful and unlawful oath, and by the strength of my God enabling me, I will never take it, though I be pulled in pieces by wild horses, as \n\n[350 \nU.S. 422, 447]\n\u00a0\n the antient Christians were by the bloody tyrants in the Primitive Church; neither shall I think that man a faithful subject of Christ's kingdom, that shall at any time hereafter take it, seeing the wickedness of it hath been so apparently laid open by so many, for the refusal whereof many do suffer cruel persecution to this day.\" The Trial of Lilburn and Wharton, 3 How. St. Tr. 1315, 1332.\n\n\n The literature of the Levellers, of whom Lilburn was a leader, abounds in this attitude. In 1648, there was published a Declaration in the form of a petition, item 12 of which reads:\n\n \"That all Statutes for all kinds of Oaths, whether in Corporations, Cities, or other, which insnare conscientious people, as also other Statutes, injoyning all to hear the Book of Common Prayer, be forthwith repealed and nulled, and that nothing be imposed upon the consciences of any to compel them to sin against their own consciences.\" Haller & Davies, The Leveller Tracts 1647-1653 (1944), 112.\n\n\n In 1653, Lilburn published The Just Defense in which he wrote:\n\n \"Another fundamental right I then contended for, was, that no mans conscience ought to be racked by oaths imposed, to answer to questions concerning himself in matters criminal, or pretended to be so.\" Haller & Davies, id., at 454.\n\n\n These are important declarations, as they throw light on the meaning of \"compelled\" as used in the Fifth Amendment.\n\nThe amending process that brought the Fifth Amendment into the Constitution is of little aid in our problem of interpretation. But there are indications in the debates on the Constitution that the evil to be remedied was the use of torture to exact confessions. See, e. g., \n\n[350 \nU.S. 422, 448]\n\u00a0\n Virginia Debates (2d ed. 1805), 221, 320-321; 2 Elliot's Debates (2d ed. 1876), 111. It was, indeed, the condemnation of torture to exact confessions that was written into the early law of the American Colonies. Article 45 of the Massachusetts Body of Liberties of 1641 provided in part, \"No man shall be forced by Torture to confesse any Crime against himself nor any other . . . .\" Connecticut adopted a similar provision. Laws of Connecticut Colony (1865 ed.), 65. Virginia soon followed suit: \". . . noe law can compell a man to sweare against himself in any matter wherein he is liable to corporall punishment.\" Hening, Statutes at Large, Vol. II, 422.\n\nThe compulsion outlawed was moral compulsion as well as physical compulsion. An episode in the administration of Governor William Bradford of the Plymouth Plantation illustrates the point. He sought advice from his ministers asking, \"How farr a magistrate may extract a confession from a delinquent, to acuse him self of a capital crime . . . .\" The three ministers - Ralph Partrich, John Reynor, and Charles Chancy - were unanimous in concluding that the oath was against both the laws of God and the laws of man. Partrich's answer is typical:\n\n\"[The magistrate] may not extracte a confession of a capital crime from a suspected person by any violent means, whether it be by an oath imposed, or by any punishment inflicted or threatened to be inflicted.\" Bradford, History of Plymouth Plantation, Mass. Hist. Soc. Coll. Ser. 4, Vol. III, 390-391.\n\n\n And see Griswold, The Fifth Amendment Today (1955), 4; Morgan, The Privilege Against Self Incrimination, 34 Minn. L. Rev. 1, 22; Pittman, The Colonial and Constitutional History of the Privilege Against Self-Incrimination in America, 21 Va. L. Rev. 763, 769.\n\nThe Court, by forgetting that history, robs the Fifth Amendment of one of the great purposes it was designed \n\n[350 \nU.S. 422, 449]\n\u00a0\n to serve. To repeat, the Fifth Amendment was written in part to prevent any Congress, any court, and any prosecutor from prying open the lips of an accused to make incriminating statements against his will. The Fifth Amendment protects the conscience and the dignity of the individual, as well as his safety and security, against the compulsion of government.\n3\n\u00a0\n\n(3) This right of silence, this right of the accused to stand mute serves another high purpose. Mr. Justice Field, one of the four dissenters in Brown v. Walker, stated that it is the aim of the Fifth Amendment to protect the accused from all compulsory testimony \"which would expose him to infamy and disgrace,\" as well as that which might lead to a criminal conviction. \n161 \nU.S., at 631\n. One of the most powerful opinions in the books maintaining that thesis is by Judge Peter S. Grosscup in United States v. James, 60 F. 257, involving the same Immunity Act as the one involved in Brown v. Walker. Judge Grosscup reviewed the history of the reign of intolerance that once ruled England, the contests between Church and State, and the cruelties of the old legal procedures. Judge Grosscup said concerning the aim of the Framers in drafting the Fifth Amendment (id., at 264):\n\n\"Did they originate such privilege simply to safeguard themselves against the law-inflicted penalties \n\n[350 \nU.S. 422, 450]\n\u00a0\n and forfeitures? Did they take no thought of the pains of practical outlawry? The stated penalties and forfeitures of the law might be set aside; but was there no pain in disfavor and odium among neighbors, in excommunication from church or societies that might be governed by the prevailing views, in the private liabilities that the law might authorize, or in the unfathomable disgrace, not susceptible of formulation in language, which a known violation of law brings upon the offender? Then, too, if the immunity was only against the law-inflicted pains and penalties, the government could probe the secrets of every conversation, or society, by extending compulsory pardon to one of its participants, and thus turn him into an involuntary informer. Did the framers contemplate that this privilege of silence was exchangeable always, at the will of the government, for a remission of the participant's own penalties, upon a condition of disclosure, that would bring those to whom he had plighted his faith and loyalty within the grasp of the prosecutor? I cannot think so.\"\n\n\n Mr. Justice Field and Judge Grosscup were on strong historical ground. The Fifth Amendment was designed to protect the accused against infamy as well as against prosecution. A recent analysis by Professor Mitchell Franklin of Tulane illuminates the point. See The Encyclopediste Origin and Meaning of the Fifth Amendment, 15 Lawyers Guild Rev. 41. He shows how the Italian jurist, Beccaria, and his French and English followers, influenced American thought in the critical years following our Revolution. The history of infamy as a punishment was notorious. Luther had inveighed against excommunication. The Massachusetts Body of Liberties of 1641 had provided in Article 60: \"No church censure shall degrad or depose any man from any Civil \n\n[350 \nU.S. 422, 451]\n\u00a0\n dignitie, office, or Authoritie he shall have in the Commonwealth.\" Loss of office, loss of dignity, loss of face were feudal forms of punishment. Infamy was historically considered to be punishment as effective as fine and imprisonment.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nThe Beccarian attitude toward infamy was a part of the background of the Fifth Amendment. The concept of infamy was explicitly written into it. We need not guess as to that. For the first Clause of the Fifth Amendment contains the concept in haec verba: \"No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime,\n5\n unless on a presentment or indictment \n\n[350 \nU.S. 422, 452]\n\u00a0\n of a Grand Jury . . . .\" (Italics added.) And the third Clause, the one we are concerned with here - \"No person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself . . .\" - also reflects the revulsion of society at infamy imposed by the State. Beccaria, whose works were well known here\n6\n and who was particularly well known to Jefferson,\n7\n was the main voice against the use of infamy as punishment. The curse of infamy, he showed, results from public opinion. Oppression occurs when infamy is imposed on the citizen by the State. The French jurist, Brissot de Warville, wrote in support of Beccaria's position, \"It is in the power of the mores rather than in the hands of the legislator that this terrible weapon of infamy rests, this type of civil excommunication, which deprives the victim of all consideration, which severs all the ties which bind him to his fellow citizens, which isolates him in the midst of \n\n[350 \nU.S. 422, 453]\n\u00a0\n society. The purer and more untouched the customs are, the greater the force of infamy.\" I Theorie des Loix Criminelles (1781) 188. As de Pastoret said, \"Infamy, being a result of opinion, exists independently of the legislator; but he can employ it adroitly to make of it a salutary punishment.\"\n8\n Des Loix Penales (1790), Pt. 2, 121.\n\nIt was in this tradition that Lord Chief Justice Treby ruled in 1696 that \". . . no man is bound to answer any questions that will subject him to a penalty, or to infamy.\" Trial of Friend, 13 How. St. Tr. 1, 17.\n\nThere is great infamy involved in the present case, apart from the loss of rights of citizenship under federal law which I have already mentioned. The disclosure that a person is a Communist practically excommunicates him from society. School boards will not hire him. See Adler v. Board of Education, \n342 \nU.S. 485\n. A lawyer risks exclusion from the bar (In re Anastaplo, 3 Ill. 2d 471, 121 N. E. 2d 826); a doctor, the revocation of his license to practice (cf. Barsky v. Board of Regents, \n347 \nU.S. 442\n). If an actor, he is on a black list. (See Horowitz, Loyalty Tests for Employment in the Motion Picture Industry, 6 Stan. L. Rev. 438.) And he will be able to find no employment in our society except at the \n\n[350 \nU.S. 422, 454]\n\u00a0\n lowest level, if at all. These facts make most persuasive the words of Judge Grosscup in United States v. James, supra, at 264-265, written in 1894:\n\n\"The battle for personal liberty seems to have been attained, but, in the absence of the din and clash, we cannot comprehend the meaning of all the safeguards employed. When we see the shield held before the briber, the liquor seller, the usury taker, the duelist, and the other violators of accepted law, we are moved to break or cast it aside, unmindful of the splendid purpose that first threw it forward. But, whatever its disadvantages now, it is a fixed privilege, until taken down by the same power that extended it. It is not certain, either, that it may not yet serve some useful purpose. The oppression of crowns and principalities is unquestionably over, but the more frightful oppression of selfish, ruthless, and merciless majorities may yet constitute one of the chapters of future history. In my opinion, the privilege of silence, against a criminal accusation, guaranteed by the fifth amendment, was meant to extend to all the consequences of disclosure.\"\n\n\n It is no answer to say that a witness who exercises his Fifth Amendment right of silence and stands mute may bring himself into disrepute. If so, that is the price he pays for exercising the right of silence granted by the Fifth Amendment. The critical point is that the Constitution places the right of silence beyond the reach of government. The Fifth Amendment stands between the citizen and his government. When public opinion casts a person into the outer darkness, as happens today when a person is exposed as a Communist, the government brings infamy on the head of the witness when it compels disclosure. That is precisely what the Fifth Amendment prohibits. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 422, 455]\n\u00a0\n\n\nFinally, it is said that we should not disturb Brown v. Walker because it is an old and established decision. But this Court has always been willing to re-examine and overrule constitutional precedents, even those old and established. In Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, \n304 \nU.S. 64\n, this Court overruled Swift v. Tyson, 16 Pet. 1, which had been a rule of decision for 95 years. United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters Assn., \n322 \nU.S. 533\n, partly overruled Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall. 168, which had been decided 75 years previously. In Kilbourn v. Thompson, \n103 \nU.S. 168\n, the Court rejected some of the grounds of decision in Anderson v. Dunn, 6 Wheat. 204, which had been standing for 59 years. Brown v. Walker, decided by a bare majority of the Court and now 60 years old, has no greater claim to sanctity than the other venerable decisions which history showed had outlived their usefulness or were conceived in error. And a rejection of Brown v. Walker would certainly be far less disruptive of a system of law than was the overruling of Swift v. Tyson, which affected the trial of every diversity case in the federal courts.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See 64 Stat. 992, 50 U.S.C. 784, as amended, 68 Stat. 777, 50 U.S.C. (Supp. II) 784 (prohibition of employment in the Federal Government and in defense facilities); 64 Stat. 993, 50 U.S.C. 785 (ineligibility for a passport); 64 Stat. 1019, 50 U.S.C. 811-826 (the possibility of internment); 40 Stat. 220, as amended, 64 Stat. 427, 50 U.S.C. 191; 33 CFR, 1955 Cum. Supp., 125.01, 125.29 (possibility of loss of employment as a longshoreman). And see 68 Stat. 776, 50 U.S.C. (Supp. II) 843. Moreover, under the Subversive Activities Control Act, 64 Stat. 987, 50 U.S.C. 781, discussed hereafter, it is a crime for a person who is a member of a Communist organization registered under the Act to engage in certain activity, e. g., to hold office or employment with any labor organization, to work for the Government or have employment in any defense facility, 5 (a) (1), or to apply for or use a passport 6 (a).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The impact of public identification on First Amendment freedoms was acknowledged by Chief Justice Vinson in American Communications Assn. v. Douds, \n339 \nU.S. 382, 402\n, where he said: \"Under some circumstances, indirect `discouragements' undoubtedly have the same coercive effect upon the exercise of First Amendment rights as imprisonment, fines, injunctions or taxes. A requirement that adherents of particular religious faiths or political parties wear identifying arm-bands, for example, is obviously of this nature.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Dean Erwin N. Griswold of Harvard recently wrote:\n\n\"Where matters of a man's belief or opinions or political views are essential elements in the charge, it may be most difficult to get evidence from sources other than the suspected or accused person himself. Hence, the significance of the privilege over the years has perhaps been greatest in connection with resistance to prosecution for such offenses as heresy or political crimes. In these areas the privilege against self-incrimination has been a protection for freedom of thought and a hindrance to any government which might wish to prosecute for thoughts and opinions alone.\" The Fifth Amendment Today, supra, 8-9.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Infamy as a sanction in Roman Law is traced in Tatarczuk, Infamy of Law, Canon Law Studies No. 357, The Catholic University of America (1954), 1-13. The penalties that Roman Law attached to infamy are familiar: exclusion from the army, from all public service, and from the exercise of certain public rights. Id., at 10.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The cases arising under the first Clause of the Fifth Amendment recognize that what may be considered an \"infamous crime\" within the meaning of that Clause may be affected by changes of public opinion from one age to another. See Ex parte Wilson, \n114 \nU.S. 417, 427\n; Mackin v. United States, \n117 \nU.S. 348, 351\n; United States v. Moreland, \n258 \nU.S. 433, 441\n, 451 (dissenting opinion by Brandeis, J.). In United States v. Waddell, \n112 \nU.S. 76\n, the Court refused to decide the \"very important\" question whether a crime was made \"infamous\" when upon conviction the defendant became \"ineligible to any office, or place of honor, profit or trust created by the Constitution or laws of the United States.\" Justice Miller said: \"When we bring this language, which is not the sentence of the court, but an indelible disgrace affixed to the party convicted, by the declaration of the law itself, into direct connection with the language of the fifth article of amendment of the Constitution . . . there does arise a very serious question whether this crime is not made an infamous one by the language of the statute, and cannot, therefore, be prosecuted by information.\" Id., at 82. The Court did not decide the question because it had not been argued nor presented to the lower courts. And see Ex parte Wilson, supra, at 426.\n\nThe Fifth and Sixth Amendments place the grand and petit juries as barriers between the government and the individual. The provisions \n\n[350 \nU.S. 422, 452]\n\u00a0\n for those two juries help emphasize the function played by the Bill of Attainder clauses of the Constitution. See Art. I, 9, cl. 3; Art. I, 10, cl. 1. The guarantee of jury trial and the prohibition of Bills of Attainder place beyond the pale the imposition of infamy or outlawry by either the Executive or the Congress. The penalties proscribed as Bills of Attainder extend to disqualification for government employment and outlawry from the professions. See United States v. Lovett, \n328 \nU.S. 303\n; Ex parte Garland, 4 Wall. 333; Cummings v. Missouri, 4 Wall. 277.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Beccaria seems to have been principally introduced to America by Voltaire. See Barr, Voltaire in America (1941), 23-24. Barr states, \"Beccaria's Essay on Crimes and Punishment with its famous commentary by Voltaire was known in America immediately after its first appearance in France and was the first of Voltaire's works to be published in America. It was popular in lending libraries and as a quickly sold item in bookstores, because of general interest in the formation of a new social order. A separate monograph would be necessary to trace the influence of this epoch-making tract.\" Id., at 119.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] See Chinard, The Commonplace Book of Thomas Jefferson (1926), 298 et seq.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] de Pastoret, supra, 125-126, wrote:\n\n\"Penalties which, in France, produce infamy in law are (in addition to corporal or afflictive penalties), la claie,\n*\n the iron collar or the pillory, civil death, censure, condemnation of memory, condemnation to be led around on an ass wearing a straw hat, degradation from the order of nobility, fine in a criminal matter when a judgment confirms it . . . public confession and apology, forced alms in civil matters, permanent prohibition to hold office.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Trainer sur la claie was the means used to drag the condemned to execution. The same thing was done to the bodies of suicides.

JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe question presented in this case is whether under the Natural Gas Act, 52 Stat. 821, 15 U.S.C. 717 et seq., a regulated natural gas company furnishing gas \n\n[350 \nU.S. 332, 334]\n\u00a0\n to a distributing company under a long-term contract may, without the consent of the distributing company, change the rate specified in the contract simply by filing a new rate schedule with the Federal Power Commission. The pertinent provisions of the Act are set forth in the margin.\n1\n\u00a0\n\n[350 \nU.S. 332, 335]\n\u00a0\n\n\nRespondent Mobile Gas Service Corporation (Mobile), a distributor of natural gas to domestic and industrial users in Mobile, Alabama, acquires its gas from petitioner United Gas Pipe Line Company (United), a \"natural-gas \n\n[350 \nU.S. 332, 336]\n\u00a0\n company\" subject to regulation under the Act. In 1946 the Ideal Cement Company (Ideal), planning to construct a cement plant in the city provided it could be assured a supply of gas at a sufficiently low rate, obtained from Mobile an agreement to furnish gas for a 10-year term at 12 cents per MCF (thousand cubic feet). Mobile, in turn, before entering into a contract with Ideal, obtained from United a 10-year contract to supply gas for resale to Ideal at the equivalent of 10.7 cents per MCF, a rate substantially lower than that for other gas furnished by United. This contract was filed with the Federal Power Commission as an amendment to the general supply contracts between Mobile and United, and, with the approval of the Commission, became a part of United's filed schedules of rates and contracts.\n\nIn June 1953 United, without the consent of Mobile, filed new schedules with the Commission which purported to increase the rate on gas for resale to Ideal to 14.5 cents per MCF, a rate more closely approximating that for other gas furnished to Mobile by United. Claiming that United could not thus unilaterally change the contract rate, Mobile petitioned the Commission to reject United's filing. The Commission denied the petition, holding that under 4 (d) of the Act the new rate, being a non-suspendible industrial rate, automatically became effective 30 days after filing and would remain in effect unless and until the Commission should, after investigation \n\n[350 \nU.S. 332, 337]\n\u00a0\n under 4 (e), determine the new rate to be unlawful. Mobile paid the new rate until April 15, 1955, when United, with Commission approval, accepted an assignment to it of Mobile's contract with Ideal.\n2\n This assignment made the pending investigation into the lawfulness of the new rate moot, since in the Commission's view its determination on that matter would have no retroactive effect. Thus the only question before us is whether United properly collected from Mobile the difference between the old 10.7-cent rate and the new 14.5-cent rate during the period from July 25, 1953 (when the new rate purportedly went into effect), to April 15, 1955 (when United took over the Ideal contract) - a sum aggregating approximately $240,000. On Mobile's petition for review, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit (Hastie, J., dissenting) reversed the Commission's order, directed it to reject United's filing of the new schedule insofar as it purported to increase the rate in question, and held Mobile entitled to a return of the amounts paid in excess of the contract rate. 215 F.2d 883. Both the Commission and United, which had intervened in the Court of Appeals, petitioned for certiorari, which we granted because of the importance of this question in the administration of the Natural Gas Act. \n348 \nU.S. 950\n. For the reasons discussed below, we hold that the Natural Gas Act does not give natural gas companies the right to change their rate contracts by their own unilateral action.\n\nThe question presented is solely one of the proper interpretation of the Natural Gas Act, there being no claim that the statute, if interpreted to permit a natural gas company unilaterally to change its contracts, would be \n\n[350 \nU.S. 332, 338]\n\u00a0\n unconstitutional. Cf. Midland Realty Co. v. Kansas City P. & L. Co., \n300 \nU.S. 109\n. The Act\n3\n requires natural gas companies to file all rates and contracts with the Commission ( 4 (c)) and authorizes the Commission to modify any rate or contract which it determines to be \"unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory, or preferential\" ( 5 (a)). Changes in previously filed rates or contracts must be filed with the Commission at least 30 days before they are to go into effect ( 4 (d)), and, except in the case of industrial rates, the Commission may suspend the operation of the new rate pending a determination of its reasonableness ( 4 (e)). If a decision has not been reached before the period of suspension expires, a maximum of five months, the filed rate must be allowed to go into effect, but the Commission's order may be made retroactive to that date.\n\nIn construing the Act, we should bear in mind that it evinces no purpose to abrogate private rate contracts as such. To the contrary, by requiring contracts to be filed with the Commission, the Act expressly recognizes that rates to particular customers may be set by individual contracts. In this respect, the Act is in marked contrast to the Interstate Commerce Act, which in effect precludes private rate agreements by its requirement that the rates to all shippers be uniform, a requirement which made unnecessary any provision for filing contracts. See Armour Packing Co. v. United States, \n209 \nU.S. 56\n. The Commission in its brief recognizes this basic difference between the two Acts and notes the differing natures of the industries which gave rise to it. The vast number of retail transactions of railroads made policing of individual transactions administratively impossible; effective regulation could be accomplished only by requiring compliance with a single schedule of rates applicable to all \n\n[350 \nU.S. 332, 339]\n\u00a0\n shippers. On the other hand, only a relatively few wholesale transactions are regulated by the Natural Gas Act and these typically require substantial investment in capacity and facilities for the service of a particular distributor. Recognizing the need these circumstances create for individualized arrangements between natural gas companies and distributors, the Natural Gas Act permits the relations between the parties to be established initially by contract, the protection of the public interest being afforded by supervision of the individual contracts, which to that end must be filed with the Commission and made public.\n\nThe provision of the Natural Gas Act directly in issue here is 4 (d), which provides that \"no change shall be made by any natural-gas company in any such [filed] rate . . . or contract . . . except after thirty days' notice to the Commission,\" which notice is to be given by filing new schedules showing the changes and the time they are to go into effect. It is argued that this provision authorizes a natural gas company to change its rate contracts simply by filing a new schedule of rates, to go into effect in no less than thirty days. On its face, however, 4 (d) is simply a prohibition, not a grant of power. It does not purport to say what is effective to change a contract, any more than 4 (c) purports to define what constitutes a \"contract\" that may be filed with the Commission. The section says only that a change cannot be made without the proper notice to the Commission; it does not say under what circumstances a change can be made. Absent the Act, a unilateral announcement of a change to a contract would of course be a nullity, and we find no basis in the language of 4 (d) for inferring that the mere imposition of a filing-and-notice requirement was intended to make effective action which would otherwise be of no effect at all. In short, 4 (d) on its face indicates no more than that otherwise valid changes cannot be put into effect \n\n[350 \nU.S. 332, 340]\n\u00a0\n without giving the required notice to the Commission. To find in the section a further purpose to empower natural gas companies to change their contracts unilaterally requires reading into it language that is neither there nor reasonably to be implied.\n\nIt is argued, however, that a different conclusion is compelled when 4 (d) is read with the other provisions of the Act. Petitioners attempt to characterize the Act as setting up two separate and distinct \"procedures\" for changing rates: (1) the \"hearing and order\" procedure of 5 (a) under which the Commission may determine existing rates to be unreasonable and order changes to be made; and (2) the \"filed-rate\" procedure of 4 (d) and (e) under which the natural gas company may initiate changes, in which event the Commission's only concern is with the reasonableness of the new rate. These are said to be complementary and mutually exclusive procedures, the choice between which - since both expressly relate to changes in \"contracts\" as well as other rates - depends solely on who is seeking the change and not on whether the rate sought to be changed is embodied in a contract. From this characterization of the procedures, petitioners conclude that when a natural gas company initiates a rate change under 4 (d) the proceedings are governed exclusively by 4 (d) and (e), and hence the Commission's only power is that which it has under 4 (e) to set aside the new rate if that is found to be unlawful.\n\nThe major defect of this argument is that it assumes the answer to the very question in issue - whether natural gas companies are empowered to \"initiate\" unilateral contract changes under 4 (d). That the so-called \"filed-rate\" procedure is applicable to changes in contracts as well as other rates proves only that contracts may be changed, not that they may be changed unilaterally. Moreover, the very premise that 4 (d) and (e) and 5 (a) are alternative rate-changing \"procedures\" is itself \n\n[350 \nU.S. 332, 341]\n\u00a0\n based on a misconception of the structure of the Act. These sections are simply parts of a single statutory scheme under which all rates are established initially by the natural gas companies, by contract or otherwise, and all rates are subject to being modified by the Commission upon a finding that they are unlawful. The Act merely defines the review powers of the Commission and imposes such duties on natural gas companies as are necessary to effectuate those powers; it purports neither to grant nor to define the initial rate-setting powers of natural gas companies.\n\nThe powers of the Commission are defined by 4 (e) and 5 (a). The basic power of the Commission is that given it by 5 (a) to set aside and modify any rate or contract which it determines, after hearing, to be \"unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory, or preferential.\" This is neither a \"rate-making\" nor a \"rate-changing\" procedure. It is simply the power to review rates and contracts made in the first instance by natural gas companies and, if they are determined to be unlawful, to remedy them. Section 5 (a) would of its own force apply to all the rates of a natural gas company, whether long-established or newly changed, but in the latter case the power is further implemented by 4 (e). All that 4 (e) does, however, is to add to this basic power, in the case of a newly changed rate or contract (except \"industrial\" rates), the further powers (1) to preserve the status quo pending review of the new rate by suspending its operation for a limited period, and (2) thereafter to make its order retroactive, by means of the refund procedure, to the date the change became effective. The scope and purpose of the Commission's review remain the same - to determine whether the rate fixed by the natural gas company is lawful.\n\nThe limitations imposed on natural gas companies are set out in 4 (c) and 4 (d). The basic duties are \n\n[350 \nU.S. 332, 342]\n\u00a0\n the filing requirements: 4 (c) requires schedules showing all rates and contracts in force to be filed with the Commission and 4 (d) requires all changes in such schedules likewise to be filed. In addition, 4 (d) imposes the further requirement that the changes be filed at least thirty days before they are to go into effect. It may readily be seen that these requirements are no more than are necessary to implement 4 (e) and 5 (a): the filing requirements are obviously necessary to permit the Commission to exercise its review functions, and the requirement of 30-days' advance notice of changes is essential to afford the Commission a reasonable period in which to determine whether to exercise its suspension powers under 4 (e).\n\nThe relationship of these sections thus affords no support to petitioners' characterization of 4 (d) and (e) as establishing a rate-changing \"procedure\" - a \"proceeding\" before the Commission \"initiated\" by a natural gas company filing a \"proposed\" change. Section 4 (d) provides not for the filing of \"proposals\" but for notice to the Commission of any \"change . . . made by\" a natural gas company, and the change is effected, if at all, not by an order of the Commission but solely by virtue of the natural gas company's own action. If the purported change is one the natural gas company has the power to make, the \"change\" is completed upon compliance with the notice requirement and the new rate has the same force as any other rate - it can be set aside only upon being found unlawful by the Commission. It is thus no more a \"proposed\" rate than any other rate, all of which are equally subject to Commission review. Likewise, no \"proceeding\" is \"initiated\" by a 4 (d) filing. A proceeding to review the new rate may be initiated under 4 (e), but, if so, it is initiated by the Commission in the same manner as a proceeding under 5 (a) to review any other rate, that is, upon complaint or its own motion. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 332, 343]\n\u00a0\n The only difference is the interim suspension power given by 4 (e), but that in no way affects the character of the proceeding, which remains, like a 5 (a) proceeding, simply a review by the Commission of a rate established by the natural gas company. In short, the Act provides no \"procedure\" either for making or changing rates; it provides only for notice to the Commission of the rates established by natural gas companies and for review by the Commission of those rates. The initial rate-making and rate-changing powers of natural gas companies remain undefined and unaffected by the Act.\n\nAll of the relevant provisions of the Act can thus be fully explained as simply defining and implementing the powers of the Commission to review rates set initially by natural gas companies, and there is nothing to indicate that they were intended to do more. Admittedly, the Act presumes a capacity in natural gas companies to make rates and contracts and to change them from time to time, but nowhere in the Act is either power defined. The obvious implication is that, except as specifically limited by the Act, the rate-making powers of natural gas companies were to be no different from those they would possess in the absence of the Act: to establish ex parte, and change at will, the rates offered to prospective customers; or to fix by contract, and change only by mutual agreement, the rate agreed upon with a particular customer. No more is necessary to give full meaning to all the provisions of the Act: consistent with this, 4 (d) means simply that no change - neither a unilateral change to an ex parte rate nor an agreed-upon change to a contract - can be made by a natural gas company without the proper notice to the Commission. Hence there is nothing in the structure or purpose of the Act from which we can infer the right, not otherwise possessed and nowhere expressly given by the Act, \n\n[350 \nU.S. 332, 344]\n\u00a0\n of natural gas companies unilaterally to change their contracts.\n\nOur conclusion that the Natural Gas Act does not empower natural gas companies unilaterally to change their contracts fully promotes the purposes of the Act. By preserving the integrity of contracts, it permits the stability of supply arrangements which all agree is essential to the health of the natural gas industry. Conversion by consumers, particularly industrial users, to the use of natural gas may frequently require substantial investments which the consumer would be unwilling to make without long-term commitments from the distributor, and the distributor can hardly make such commitments if its supply contracts are subject to unilateral change by the natural gas company whenever its interests so dictate. The history of the Ideal contract furnishes a case in point. On the other hand, denying to natural gas companies the power unilaterally to change their contracts in no way impairs the regulatory powers of the Commission, for the contracts remain fully subject to the paramount power of the Commission to modify them when necessary in the public interest. The Act thus affords a reasonable accommodation between the conflicting interests of contract stability on the one hand and public regulation on the other.\n\nIt may be noted also that this interpretation, while precluding natural gas companies from unilaterally changing their contracts simply because it is in their private interests to do so, does not deprive them of an avenue of relief when their interests coincide with the public interest. Section 5 (a) authorizes the Commission to investigate rates not only \"upon complaint of any State, municipality, State commission, or gas distributing company\" but also \"upon its own motion.\" Thus, while natural gas companies are understandably not given the same explicit standing to complain of their own contracts \n\n[350 \nU.S. 332, 345]\n\u00a0\n as are those who represent the public interest or those who might be discriminated against, there is nothing to prevent them from furnishing to the Commission any relevant information and requesting it to initiate an investigation on its own motion.\n4\n And if the Commission, after hearing, determines the contract rate to be so low as to conflict with the public interest, it may under 5 (a) authorize the natural gas company to file a schedule increasing the rate.\n\nThe prior decisions of this Court cited by petitioners as requiring an opposite result are readily distinguishable. In Armour Packing Co. v. United States, \n209 \nU.S. 56\n, a rate contract between a railroad and a shipper at the filed rates in effect at the time the contract was made was held not to justify payment at the contract rate for shipments made after the filed rates for shipments of that character had been increased by the railroad. The very basis for that decision, however, was the requirement of the Interstate Commerce Act that rates to all shippers be uniform and comply with the single tariff filed with the Commission, there being no provision under that Act for the filing of individual contracts. That is, the Interstate Commerce Act by its own force precluded contracts for rates different from those applicable to other shippers. The Natural Gas Act, on the other hand, recognizes the need for private contracts of varying terms and expressly provides for the filing of such contracts as a part of the rate schedules. No contention is made here that the fact that the Mobile contract was at a rate different from that to other customers in itself made the contract illegal or that - as held in Armour - United could not lawfully have complied with the contract had it wanted to. In Midland \n\n[350 \nU.S. 332, 346]\n\u00a0\n Realty Co. v. Kansas City P. & L. Co., \n300 \nU.S. 109\n, the Court held only that a statute interpreted by the state court as authorizing unilateral contract changes by a public utility was not unconstitutional. On the other hand, in Wichita Railroad & Light Co. v. Public Utilities Commission of Kansas, \n260 \nU.S. 48\n, this Court interpreted a Kansas statute, not yet fully construed by the state court, as not giving such a power to a public utility, and to the extent that that decision rested upon an original interpretation of similar statutory language it affords strong support for our interpretation of the Natural Gas Act.\n\nThe only two Courts of Appeals that have squarely ruled on this question, those for the District of Columbia and Third Circuits, have concluded that neither the Natural Gas Act,\n5\n nor the virtually identical provisions of the Federal Power Act\n6\n authorize unilateral contract changes.\n7\n The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, however, although distinguishing its decision on a procedural ground, has indicated a contrary conclusion.\n8\n The parties have also referred us to numerous state court decisions construing state statutes of varying degrees of similarity to the Natural Gas Act, some holding that unilateral contract changes were authorized\n9\n and others \n\n[350 \nU.S. 332, 347]\n\u00a0\n holding that they were not.\n10\n Taken as a whole, the state decisions prove little more than that the question is an open one and afford little guidance to the proper interpretation of the Federal Act.\n\nFrom our conclusion that the Natural Gas Act gives a natural gas company no power to change its contracts unilaterally, it follows that the new schedule filed by United was a nullity insofar as it purported to change the rate set by its contract with Mobile and that the contract rate remained the only lawful rate. There can be no doubt of the authority of the Commission to reject the unauthorized filing under its general powers to issue orders \"necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this Act,\" 16, and its failure to do so and its order \"permitting\" the new rates to become effective were in error. Any amounts paid by Mobile in excess of the contract rates on the basis of the erroneous order of the Commission were therefore unlawfully collected, and United is obligated to make restitution of the excess payments. Cf. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. United States, \n279 \nU.S. 781\n.\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"SEC. 4. . . .

At any hearing involving a rate or charge sought to be increased, the burden of proof to show that the increased rate or charge is just and reasonable shall be upon the natural-gas company, and the Commission shall give to the hearing and decision of such questions preference over other questions pending before it and decide the same as speedily as possible.\" 52 Stat. 822-823, 15 U.S.C. 717c.\n\n\n\"SEC. 5.

JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis action was instituted in the United States Court of Claims by government per diem employees to recover holiday pay consisting of an extra day's compensation for each holiday worked during the year 1945.\n\nEach of the respondents was employed by the Navy under a Schedule of Wages which provided that \"whenever an employee is relieved or prevented from working solely because of the occurrence of any day declared a \n\n[352 \nU.S. 40, 41]\n\u00a0\n holiday\" he was to receive the same pay for such days as for other days. This language was taken from a Joint Resolution of Congress of June 29, 1938, 52 Stat. 1246,\n1\n having to do with holiday pay. In 1945 the respondents were not relieved from working on certain holidays named in this Resolution and were paid only the regular scheduled pay for the work performed on those days. They contend that under a Joint Resolution of January 6, 1885, 23 Stat. 516,\n2\n they have a vested right to an additional full day's wage as \"gratuity pay\" for each holiday worked. The Government urges that the 1885 Resolution was repealed in toto by the Joint Resolution of June 29, 1938, \n\n[352 \nU.S. 40, 42]\n\u00a0\n or in the alternative that the latter is inconsistent and in conflict with the provisions of the earlier Resolution upon which respondents rely.\n\nThe Court of Claims entered judgment for respondents, believing that the issue \"was considered and disposed of by [its] majority opinion . . . in Kelly v. United States, 119 C.

Reg. 2685, excused all government employees from work on December 24, 1937. Under the 1885 Resolution per diem employees received no compensation for that day since the holidays enumerated therein did not include December 24. A Joint Resolution was introduced in the House by Representative Ramspeck to allow holiday pay to per diem employees for that day. On referral to the House Committee on Civil Service, advice was sought from the Civil Service Commission, the Bureau of the Budget, and the Comptroller General. The Civil Service Commission advised by letter dated February 15, 1938, that the \"accounting authorities, however, have held that in the absence of specific legislation the regular employees of the Federal Government whose compensation is fixed at a rate per day, per hour, or on a piece-work basis lose pay for that day. This has resulted in discrimination \n\n[352 \nU.S. 40, 43]\n\u00a0\n against these groups of Federal employees.\" The Commission advised, further, that \"there is the broader question involved of securing statutory authority for such payments as a general practice . . . .\" H. R. Rep. No. 2683, 75th Cong., 3d Sess. 2. The Commission suggested the language that might be inserted in a Resolution that \"would give permanent statutory authority\" for holiday pay. In addition, the Commission's reference to the \"accounting authorities\" revealed that the Comptroller General had advised the Secretary of the Navy on December 20, 1937, that under existing law (a) per annum employees suffered no loss of income as the result of holidays, whether declared by statute or executive order, whereas per diem employees received pay only for those holidays enumerated in the 1885 Resolution; (b) per diem employees received statutory holiday pay whether the holiday happened to fall on a nonwork day (Saturday or Sunday) or not, while per annum workers were allowed neither additional pay nor holiday time when the holiday happened to fall on a nonwork day; and (c) if a per diem employee worked on a statutory holiday falling on such a nonwork day, he received double pay.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nIn its report, supra, to the House, the Committee incorporated the letter from the Commission, the advisory opinion of the Comptroller General, and a letter dated February 14, 1938, from the Bureau of the Budget advising that the proposed legislation would not be \"in conflict with the program of the President.\" The Committee drafted an entirely new Resolution, incorporating the language suggested by the Commission, intending for it to cover the \"general practice\" of the Government in regard to holiday pay. The only legislation then covering \n\n[352 \nU.S. 40, 44]\n\u00a0\n the general practice of the Government as to holiday pay was the 1885 Resolution and as to it the Committee categorically declared in its Report:\n\n\"Section 2 [of the Resolution] proposes to repeal the joint resolution of January 6, 1885 (U.S.C., title 5, sec. 86), which is as follows: . . .\" [It then sets out in full the 1885 Resolution.]\n\n\n Furthermore, there is no indication anywhere in its Report that any portion of the 1885 Resolution - much less any administrative practice thereunder - was to survive. In addition to this unequivocal statement that the purpose of the 1938 Resolution was to repeal the 1885 one, the Committee further revealed by its action under the Rules of the 75th Congress that it so intended. The Rules required a Committee reporting out a bill repealing an act or part thereof to include in its report the text of the act or part thereof proposed to be repealed. The Report here included the text of the 1885 Resolution in toto. On the other hand, if it was intended only that the 1885 Resolution be amended, the Rules required the Committee to insert in its report a comparative print of the part of the act which it proposed to be amended. Here no such comparative print was inserted.\n\nMoreover, the few brief statements on the floor of the House show nothing to the contrary. Representative Ramspeck declared that the Resolution \"gives the same right to per diem employees as to the regular monthly employees.\" Representative Rogers stated. \"This simply prevents an unintentional discrimination.\" Nothing was said as to the 1885 Resolution, nor did anyone contend, contrary to the Committee Report, that it was not the intention to repeal it in toto. See 83 Cong. Rec. 9466-9467.\n\nIt is contended that the purpose of the 1938 Resolution was to increase the number of holidays for per diem \n\n[352 \nU.S. 40, 45]\n\u00a0\n employees to include those allowed by executive order, but to leave intact the allowance of double pay for per diem employees who worked on the holidays specified in the 1885 Resolution. This cannot be correct, for no one contends that the 1938 Resolution did not repeal the 1885 Resolution, as interpreted, with reference to holiday pay on nonwork days. That being so, we cannot see why the 1885 Resolution should be regarded as having been left unrepealed with reference to holiday pay on work days.\n4\n Moreover, respondents' contention is entirely untenable in light of the Committee Report. Confusion would be created rather than eliminated if the contention were accepted. The purpose, as shown by the letters, the advisory opinion, the Report, and the statements on the floor of the House, was to alleviate discriminations as to holiday pay and to treat employees alike insofar as possible. This the 1938 Resolution accomplished. Should the respondents' interpretation prevail, it would result in a double standard of pay for per diem employees working on holidays. On those holidays included in the 1885 Resolution, the employees would receive double pay, while on holidays included in or created pursuant to the authority provided by the 1938 Resolution alone they would receive only single pay. This result is required because the 1938 Resolution permits no holiday pay when the employee is required to work. We cannot attribute such anomalous results to the Congress. It is urged that our interpretation would result in a per diem employee receiving the same pay for working on a holiday as is \n\n[352 \nU.S. 40, 46]\n\u00a0\n received by his fellow employee who is excused from so working. But this is no discrimination as it likewise is visited upon the per annum employee.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nWe now turn to other indications supporting the position that the 1885 Resolution was repealed. As we indicated earlier, the double payment for holiday work recognized prior to the 1938 Resolution came about in 1906 through an interpretation of the 1885 Resolution by the Assistant Comptroller of the Treasury. This ruling was recognized by all departments and agencies of the Government until August 1938, when the Comptroller General held that the 1885 Resolution had been repealed by the 1938 Resolution and gratuity pay for holidays was no longer a right of per diem employees.\n6\n This opinion was followed consistently by all of the departments and agencies of the Government. In this regard it is of importance to note that several efforts were made to repeal this interpretation by specific Act of Congress, but in each instance the bill failed to pass.\n7\n This contemporaneous interpretation of the 1938 Resolution by the agency charged with its supervision - an interpretation followed by all agencies of the Government - together \n\n[352 \nU.S. 40, 47]\n\u00a0\n with acquiescence of the Congress, must be given great weight.\n\nLikewise it is noted that the House Committee on the Revision of Laws has similarly treated the 1938 Resolution. In the 1940 and 1946 recodifications of the United States Code the 1885 Resolution is listed as being repealed by the later Resolution of 1938. Again in the 1952 edition of the Code the 1885 Resolution is not only listed as repealed but its entire text is omitted from the Code. An explanatory notation states that this Resolution was repealed and is now covered by 86a which is the 1938 Resolution.\n\nAs we noted earlier, this case is not disposed of by United States v. Kelly, \n342 \nU.S. 193\n, and nothing in Kelly lends support to the employees' argument here. Kelly was a printer employed at the Government Printing Office. The wages of employees in Kelly's office were fixed by a collective-bargaining agreement pursuant to the Act of June 7, 1924, 43 Stat. 658. This Act, though amended, remained in effect as to the provisions involved here at the time of Kelly's claim. The contract Kelly sued on was entered into by the Government under this Act. We said the problem was \"whether the 1938. Resolution somehow precludes the awarding of the gratuity pay which the agreement [so made] seems to grant.\" \n342 \nU.S., at 194\n. We held that \"since the agreement provided for gratuity pay for holidays worked. [Kelly] was entitled to such pay.\"\n8\n The award to Kelly, \n\n[352 \nU.S. 40, 48]\n\u00a0\n then, was solely on the basis of the collective-bargaining agreement. Here there is no such agreement. There is nothing on which the employees can rely which affirmatively grants the double pay they claim.\n\nThe judgment of the Court of Claims is, therefore,\n\n     Reversed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE BRENNAN took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Joint Resolution of June 29, 1938, c. 818, 52 Stat. 1246, 5 U.S.C. 86a:\n\n\". . .

The employees of the Navy Yard, Government Printing Office, Bureau of Printing and Engraving, and all other per diem employees of the Government on duty at Washington, or elsewhere in the United States shall be allowed the following holidays, to wit: The 1st day of January, the 22d day of February, the day of each year which is celebrated as `Memorial' or `Decoration Day', the 4th day of July, the 25th day of December, and such days as may be designated by the President as days for national thanksgiving, and shall receive the same pay as on other days.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] This double pay resulted from interpretation of the 1885 Resolution by the office of the Comptroller of the Treasury. 13 Comp. Dec. 40. See also, 13 Comp. Gen. 295, 297.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] It is true that the Comptroller General's 1937 letter pointed up the discrimination between per annum and per diem employees on nonwork days. But, even though not specifically adverted to, it would seem that a similar discrimination was also apparent as to work days in that per annum employees would receive no extra pay, while per diem employees would receive not only their regular wage but an equal amount as holiday pay.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Moreover, the Schedule of Wages here provided for 50% additional pay for work required on holidays not included in the regular tour of duty and 125% additional for work in excess of eight hours on such days.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] 18 Comp.

R. 6222, 77th Cong., 1st Sess.; S. 1679, 79th Cong., 2d Sess.\n\nThe policy of allowing gratuity pay for holidays worked in peace-time and of prohibiting it in wartime is reflected in a section of the Federal Employees Pay Act of 1945, 59 Stat. 298, 5 U.S.C. 922. This section provided for gratuity pay for holidays worked but was not to go into effect until the cessation of hostilities in World War II. By implication then, there was no gratuity pay allowed by statute for holidays worked during wartime.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Kelly also claimed under a Joint Resolution. The Resolution of 1885 provided for \"gratuity pay\" for holidays for all government per diem employees. A Joint Resolution of 1895 referring specifically to Government Printing Office employees is substantially identical in regard to holiday pay with the 1885 Resolution. The Kelly case was considered on the basis of the 1895 Resolution, but the Court was not required to determine whether Kelly was entitled to any pay under that Resolution.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BURTON, with whom MR. JUSTICE BLACK and MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER concur, dissenting.\n\nThe issue before us is purely one of statutory construction. For the reasons hereafter stated, we believe that the Court has misconstrued the Resolution of 1938 by treating it as completely repealing the Resolution of 1885 and all other prior holiday pay statutes. Our conclusion is based upon (1) the long-established practice under the Resolution of 1885, as amended, of allowing a full day's gratuity pay to per diem employees on holidays, whether or not those employees also received pay for services actually rendered on those days; (2) the language of the 1938 Resolution; (3) the circumstances which led to the presentation of the 1938 Resolution; and (4) the legislative history of its consideration by Congress.\n\nThe Joint Resolution of January 6, 1885, 23 Stat. 516, 5 U.S.C. (1934 ed.) 86, provided -\n\n\"That the employees of the Navy Yard, Government Printing Office, Bureau of Printing and Engraving, and all other per diem employees of the Government on duty at Washington, or elsewhere in the United States, shall be allowed the following holidays, to wit: The first day of January, the twenty-second day of February, the fourth day of July, the twenty-fifth \n\n[352 \nU.S. 40, 49]\n\u00a0\n day of December, and such days as may be designated by the President as days for national thanksgiving, and shall receive the same pay as on other days.\"\n1\n\u00a0\n\n\n This Resolution was interpreted repeatedly by the Comptroller of the Treasury, the Comptroller General of the United States, and later the Court of Claims, as allowing the designated per diem employees, on the specified holidays, their regular rate of pay as a gratuity, whether or not they worked on those days. Those who worked on such holidays received their scheduled pay for such work in addition to the holiday gratuity.\n2\n The administrative practice conformed to this interpretation.\n\nThis interpretation and the reason for it is made clear in the following quotation from the Comptroller of the Treasury:\n\n \"I can not reconcile with any ideas of equity and justice the proposition that Congress ever intended by this or any other statute to allow the employees (and we are now speaking of per diem employees who are paid from a lump sum and not a stated, fixed annual salary) a legal holiday with pay, and place it in the power of yourself or any other person to cause any such employee to work on such day, such employee \n\n[352 \nU.S. 40, 50]\n\u00a0\n so working receiving just the same amount of pay for said day as those who are not compelled to work, and no more.\n\n\n  .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \"The laborer is worthy of his hire and should have it when compelled to work on a holiday. The giving him pay for such a day when he does not work is the free gift of Congress, and I will not stultify such gift by taking away from him his pay on a day for which he worked because Congress saw fit to give him pay for legal holidays when he did not work.\n\n\n \"You are therefore authorized to pay to the employees named their wages for work done on Thanksgiving Day in addition to their pay as provided by said act of 1895.\" 8 Comp. Dec. 322, 325 (1901).\n\n\n Thus, until 1938, it was the Government's settled practice to allow gratuity pay to per diem employees on the specified holidays, whether or not the employees performed work on those holidays. It was in that significant context, late in 1937, that the incident occurred which led to the House Joint Resolution of June 29, 1938, 52 Stat. 1246, 5 U.S.C. (1952 ed.) 86a.\n\nOn December 6, 1937, the President, by Executive Order No. 7763, 2 Fed. Reg. 2685, closed the government offices and excused all government employees from work on Friday, December 24, the day before Christmas. As December 24 was not a holiday specified by the Resolution of 1885, as amended, the Acting Comptroller General by letter of December 20, 1937, advised the Secretary of the Navy that per diem employees of the Navy Department would not be entitled either to gratuity or scheduled pay for that day unless, of course, they earned the latter by working. The difficulty was that the government offices had been closed by an Executive Order whereas \n\n[352 \nU.S. 40, 51]\n\u00a0\n the Resolutions limited the allowance of holiday gratuities to a list of statutory holidays.\n3\n The above-mentioned letter gave unquestioning recognition to the existing statutory authorization of gratuity pay for specified holidays, whether or not additionally compensated labor was performed on those days. It contained no suggestion that such payments were invalid or even unwise, except to point out that the existing law allowed such gratuities even when a holiday occurred on a nonworkday. On this point, the letter commented that \"even when any of such holidays falls on a nonworkday (such as a Saturday), such employees receive pay for the holiday when no work is performed thereon, in addition to the full week's pay otherwise earned, and double compensation for the day if work is performed thereon.\" H. R. Rep. No. 2683, 75th Cong., 3d Sess. 5.\n\nWith this situation before him, Representative Ramspeck of the House Committee on Civil Service introduced House Joint Resolution 551 providing that the \"employees . . . who were excused from duty on December 24, 1937, by the Executive order of December 6, 1937, shall receive compensation for December 24, 1937, any law or regulation to the contrary notwithstanding.\" See 83 Cong. Rec. 9466.\n\nThis was referred to the Civil Service Commission which returned it with the suggested substitute which later became the Resolution of 1938. The Commission explained the need for the substitute as follows:\n\n\"It is believed that the President had in view that the benefits of the holiday be accorded to all classes of employees to the greatest extent possible. The accounting authorities, however, have held that in \n\n[352 \nU.S. 40, 52]\n\u00a0\n the absence of specific legislation the regular employees of the Federal Government whose compensation is fixed at a rate per day, per hour, or on a piece-work basis lose pay for that day. This has resulted in discrimination against these groups of Federal employees.\n\n\n \"The proposed joint legislation provides for the payment of compensation to these employees to cover the single day, December 24, 1937; but there is the broader question involved of securing statutory authority for such payments as a general practice and thus obviate the necessity for special resolutions by Congress. Such a resolution, for example, was required last year to provide payment for these same classes of employees in Washington, D.C., who were excused from duty on January 20, 1937, the date of the inauguration of the President.\n\n\n \"It is believed that general legislation in the following phraseology would give permanent statutory authority for payments under the circumstances indicated:\n\n\n \"`Hereafter, whenever regular employees of the Federal Government, whose compensation is fixed at a rate per day, per hour, or on a piece work basis, are relieved or prevented from working solely because of the occurrence of a holiday, such as New Year's Day, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Fourth of July, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day, or any other day declared a holiday by Federal statute or Executive order, or any day on which the Departments and establishments of the Government are closed by Executive order, they shall receive the same pay for such days as for other days on which an ordinary day's work is performed.\n\n\n \"`SEC. 2. The joint resolution of January 6, 1885 (U.S.C., title 5, sec. 86), and all other laws inconsistent \n\n[352 \nU.S. 40, 53]\n\u00a0\n or in conflict with the provisions of this Act are hereby repealed to the extent of such inconsistency or conflict.'\" H. R. Rep. No. 2683, 75th Cong., 3d Sess. 2.\n4\n\u00a0\n\n\n The letters, constituting the Committee Report, thus pointed to the following changes to be accomplished by the new Resolution:\n\n1. Extend the gratuity to include not only statutory holidays but also any holidays and other nonworkdays prescribed by Executive Order.\n\n2. Extend the gratuity to cover all \"regular employees of the Federal Government, whose compensation is fixed at a rate per day, per hour, or on a piece work basis . . . .\" Ibid.\n\nThe above extensions followed the suggestion of the Civil Service Commission that the new Resolution should answer \"the broader question involved of securing statutory authority for such payments [as that of December 24, 1937] as a general practice and thus obviate the necessity for special resolutions by Congress.\" Ibid.\n\nThe new Resolution also met the implied criticism relating to the allowance of gratuities for holidays occurring on other than workdays. It did this by expressly limiting gratuity allowances to those days on which the employees \"are relieved or prevented from working solely because of the occurrence of a holiday such as New Year's Day . . . .\" (Emphasis supplied.) 52 Stat. 1246. It thus excluded holidays when the relief from work was due in part to the day not being a workday without regard to its designation as a holiday.\n\nThe few brief statements made by the sponsor of the Resolution, Representative Ramspeck, at the time of its adoption, confirm the view that the Resolution was merely \n\n[352 \nU.S. 40, 54]\n\u00a0\n a corrective measure intended to aid \"the lowest-paid group of employees in the Government service,\" rather than a measure designed to abolish substantial benefits enjoyed by per diem laborers under a 50-year-old governmental practice.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nIt is hardly conceivable that, if either the sponsor of this Resolution or the Committee recommending its adoption had seen in it the deprivation of pay now contended for by the Government, the sponsor or the Committee would not have mentioned that effect in the presentation of the measure. The absence of any such mention is eloquent testimony that the Resolution had no such meaning. It is equally inconceivable that Congress would unanimously reduce the pay of the Government's \n\n[352 \nU.S. 40, 55]\n\u00a0\n lowest paid employees sub silentio. Read in its context, and in the light of the explanation, made on the floor, that this Resolution sought \"simply to correct\" such a situation as that which occurred on Christmas Eve, and to prevent an unintentional discrimination against per diem employees, it is difficult to read into the Resolution the meaning, contrary to their interests, for which the Government now contends.\n\nThe fact that, at the time the 1938 Resolution was enacted, it was the general practice of private industry to pay some type of premium pay for holidays worked emphasizes the unlikelihood of the interpretation contended for by the Government. In Kelly v. United States, 119 Ct. Cl. 197, 209, 96 F. Supp. 611, 614, the Court of Claims, in interpreting the 1938 Resolution, described the circumstances in that year as follows:\n\n \"With regard to its per diem and per hour employees, the so-called wage board employees, the Government is in competition with private employers, and attempts to keep its wages and working conditions in step with those in private enterprise. It is completely unthinkable that the owner of a printing shop could, by practice, or by contract, maintain the policy as to holiday pay which the Government here seeks to attribute to Congress. Such an employer might, and many employers did, in 1938, have a policy of not paying for holidays not worked. If the holiday was worked, it was paid for. Some such employers then, and most of them now 1951. have contracts with their employees providing for paid holidays, but in all such contracts there is a provision that if the holiday is in fact worked, it will be paid for again, usually at premium pay, and in addition to the holiday pay. But in no case which we have heard of, or can imagine, could an employer maintain a \n\n[352 \nU.S. 40, 56]\n\u00a0\n practice whereby an employee who worked on a holiday received merely the same pay as one who did not work.\"\n6\n\u00a0\n\n\n The foregoing changes in the existing law retained its general pattern. They clarified both the classes of per diem employees entitled to a holiday gratuity, and the occasions when that gratuity was to be payable. Nowhere in the Resolution or in its legislative history is there any express statement of the Government's present contention that an employee who comes within the statutory classification of eligibility for the holiday gratuity is deprived of it if he performs some compensated labor for the Government on the holiday in question.\n\nThe Government emphasizes the phrase, added in 1938, which states that its regular per diem employees shall receive holiday pay \"whenever [they] are relieved or prevented from working solely because of the occurrence of a holiday . . . .\" This is interpreted by the Court of Claims as eliminating gratuity pay for those holidays which occur on nonworkdays. It does this aptly because the occurrence of a holiday on a nonworkday obviously is not the sole cause preventing per diem employment on those days. The Government, however, suggests that this clause also means that if a per diem employee, who becomes entitled to gratuity pay solely because of the occurrence of a holiday on a workday, nevertheless responds to a call to work on that day, he loses the \n\n[352 \nU.S. 40, 57]\n\u00a0\n gratuity. Such an interpretation discriminates against the loyal holiday worker.\n\nMoreover, such an interpretation produces the inequitable result that an employee who works on a holiday receives no more pay than an employee who is not required to work on the same holiday.\n\nConcededly, this was not so before 1938. At least until then the 1885 Resolution was recognized as authorizing gratuity pay for holidays, whether or not work was performed on those days. Accordingly, in 1938, it would have been a simple thing to repeal the 1885 Resolution outright if that result were intended. Instead of doing so, the repealing section in the 1938 Resolution expressly limited itself to the inconsistencies and conflicts between, on the one hand, the new Resolution and, on the other, the 1885 Resolution and \"all other laws inconsistent or in conflict with the provisions\" of the new Resolution. Such a limited repeal well reflects the above-recited legislative history. It shows the character of the new Resolution to be that of corrective legislation in the interests of the laborers. To be sure, the House Committee Report in its treatment of 2 of the new Resolution did set forth the text of the 1885 Resolution as that of the Resolution cited in that repealing section. That recital is not sufficient to change the specifically restricted repealing clause into an outright repeal in the face of its express limitation to inconsistencies and conflicts.\n\nThe Resolutions of 1885 and 1938 are in pari materia and should be read together. When so read, there is no basis for treating differently the several holidays specified in the Resolutions. No \"double standard\" results. The 1938 Resolution expands the statutory list of holidays to include various other days that might be designated by Executive Orders. None of the original list are excluded. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 40, 58]\n\u00a0\n\n\nPetitioner cites no judicial decision upholding its interpretation. The Court of Claims has twice rejected it and taken the opposite view.\n7\n\u00a0\n\nPetitioner cites as authority for its position the brief rulings of the Comptroller General under the 1938 Resolution. Without reviewing the material which has influenced the Court of Claims, those rulings assume, without discussion or judicial support, that the Resolution of 1938 completely repealed the Resolution of 1885. See 18 Comp. Gen. 10, 16, 186, 191 (1938). The treatment of the amendment in the publication of the United States Code is not controlling and cites no judicial authority.\n\nIn United States v. Kelly, \n342 \nU.S. 193\n, we held that per diem employees of the Government Printing Office were entitled to the gratuity pay guaranteed by their collective-bargaining agreement. We also said expressly that the 1938 Resolution \"was silent on the subject of gratuity pay for holidays on which work was performed.\" Id., at 195. The Kelly case thus shows that, at the very least, the gratuity policy of the 1885 Resolution is not prohibited after 1938. Accordingly, it would be consistent with that case to uphold the Court of Claims in the instant case. The collective-bargaining contract in the Kelly case was declaratory of, not contrary to, the policy of the 1885 Resolution.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Claims should be affirmed.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In 1887 a fifth holiday was added - Memorial Day. Joint Resolution of February 23, 1887, 24 Stat. 644. For an earlier similar provision, applicable only to employees of the Government Printing Office, see 21 Stat. 304. A subsequent like provision for such employees, the Act of January 12, 1895, 28 Stat. 601, 607, was \"consistently administered as providing for gratuity pay in addition to regular compensation if the employee worked on a holiday.\" United States v. Kelly, \n342 \nU.S. 193, 195\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See 8 Comp. Dec. 322 (1901); 13 Comp. Dec. 40 (1906); 21 Comp. Dec. 566 (1915); 22 Comp. Dec. 404 (1916); 24 Comp. Dec. 218 (1917); 24 Comp.

No. 2683, 75th Cong., 3d Sess. 3-5, relating to House Joint Resolution 551, later approved June 29, 1938, and now before us.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] For the official text of the Resolution as approved June 29, 1938, see 52 Stat. 1246, 5 U.S.C.

What does this cover?\n\n\n\"Mr. RAMSPECK. This covers the lowest-paid group of employees in the Government service. It is those who work on a per diem basis. For instance, last Christmas Eve the President excused all Government employees from rendering any service. His Executive order, of course, applied to every employee in the Government service. Those who are working on a monthly salary got their pay for Christmas Eve, but those who work on a per diem were forced to take the day off, and they lost the day's pay.

Spicer, Jr. argued the cause and filed a brief for respondent. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 77, 78]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis case presents questions similar to those involved in United States v. Western Pacific R. Co., ante, p. 59, decided today.\n\nIn 1941 and 1942 the Government shipped from Pontiac, Michigan, to Newport News, Virginia, over the respondent's lines, various military supplies destined for China, via the port of Rangoon, Burma. This intended exportation was frustrated by the fall of Rangoon to Japanese military forces on March 8, 1942. The Government therefore took possession of the shipments at Newport News, reshipped them about three months later to storage centers in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, and more than a year later again reshipped some of the goods to various points on the Pacific Coast, whence they were exported to Calcutta, India. Had the original purpose of a shipment to China been accomplished, the export rate provided in Item 23030 of Tariff No. 218-M\n1\n would have applied to the transportation between Pontiac and Newport News. However, when that shipment was frustrated, the respondent billed the Government at the higher \n\n[352 \nU.S. 77, 79]\n\u00a0\n domestic rate.\n2\n The Government paid these bills as rendered, but subsequently, on post-audit by the General Accounting Office, readjusted the charges to the lower export rate, deducting the difference from subsequent bills of the carrier for other transportation services.\n3\n Thereafter the respondent sued the United States in the District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia under the Tucker Act\n4\n to recover the amount of these deductions. The District Court gave judgment for the respondent,\n5\n the Court of Appeals affirmed,\n6\n and we granted certiorari.\n7\n\u00a0\n\nThe Court of Appeals, following its earlier decision in United States v. Chesapeake & Ohio R. Co., 215 F.2d 213, held \"that the intention to export to China was abandoned and that the movement which began at Pontiac, Michigan, as an export was converted by the shipper into a domestic shipment\"; hence the domestic rate applied. It further held that the District Court had properly denied the Government's request for a referral to the Interstate Commerce Commission of the question whether the domestic rate, if applied to these shipments, would be reasonable. As to this the Court of Appeals said that the \"question was not the reasonableness of rates, which everyone conceded to be reasonable, but which rate was applicable to the shipment under the circumstances of the case, a question which the court was competent to decide.\" Therefore, it concluded that there were no \"administrative questions\" for the Commission to determine. Further, without questioning the timeliness of the \n\n[352 \nU.S. 77, 80]\n\u00a0\n respondent's suit under the Tucker Act,\n8\n the Court of Appeals held that in any event referral to the Commission of the question of the reasonableness of the domestic tariff as applied to these shipments was barred by the two-year statute of limitations of the Interstate Commerce Act.\n9\n\u00a0\n\nUnlike the Court of Claims in United States v. Western Pacific R. Co., supra, the Court of Appeals, correctly we think, regarded the questions of whether the domestic tariff applied to these shipments, and whether it was reasonable if so applied, as simply two ways of stating the same underlying problem. Hence we face the same question as the one we have dealt with in the Western Pacific case, supra, namely: does the issue of tariff construction, which the Court of Appeals regarded as one for the court, involve such acquaintance with rate-making and transportation factors as to make the issue initially one for the Interstate Commerce Commission, under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction? In this instance we cannot say positively whether or not there should have been a referral to the Commission. The Government, treating the issues of \"construction\" and \"reasonableness\" as separable, did not question the Court of Appeals' holding that the domestic tariff applied, but argued only that the tariff was unreasonable as applied to these shipments. The parties, therefore, have not briefed or argued the factors making for or against the application of the domestic rather than the export tariff. Consequently, we do not know what kinds of factors are involved, and we therefore cannot say on this record whether the issue of tariff construction \n\n[352 \nU.S. 77, 81]\n\u00a0\n should have been referred to the Commission. We think this question should be determined by the Court of Appeals upon a full record, which would no doubt include consideration of the factors shown by the record in the earlier case which it followed here,\n10\n and which is not before us.\n11\n For the reasons given in our opinion in the Western Pacific case, supra, we hold that referral to the Commission would not be barred by the 16 (3) statute of limitations.\n\nWe shall therefore reverse the judgment below and remand the case to the Court of Appeals for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion and with our opinion in United States v. Western Pacific R. Co., supra, decided this day.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE DOUGLAS dissents from a reference of these matters to the Interstate Commerce Commission, since he is of the view that the principles of Great Northern R. Co. v. Merchants Elevator Co., \n259 \nU.S. 285\n, are applicable here.\n\nMR. JUSTICE REED and MR.

During the relevant period, appellee produced almost 75% of the cellophane sold in the United States; but cellophane constituted less than 20% of all flexible packaging materials sold in the United States. The trial court found that the relevant market for determining the extent of appellee's market control was the market for flexible packaging materials and that competition from other materials in that market prevented appellee from possessing monopoly powers in its sales of cellophane. Accordingly, it dismissed the complaint. Held: The judgment is affirmed. Pp. 378-404.\n\n (a) The ultimate consideration in determining whether an alleged monopolist violates 2 of the Sherman Act is whether the defendant controls prices and competition in the market for such part of trade or commerce as he is charged with monopolizing.

Spritzer and William J. Lamont.\n\n\nGerhard A. Gesell argued the cause for appellee. With him on the brief were James H. McGlothlin, Burke Marshall, Hugh M. Morris and Frank J. Zugehoer.\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\nThe United States brought this civil action under 4 of the Sherman Act against E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company. The complaint, filed December 13, 1947, in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, charged du Pont with monopolizing, attempting to monopolize and conspiracy to monopolize interstate commerce in cellophane and cellulosic caps and bands in violation of 2 of the Sherman Act. Relief by injunction was sought against defendant and its officers, forbidding monopolizing or attempting to monopolize interstate trade in cellophane. The prayer also sought action to dissipate the effect of the monopolization by divestiture or other steps. On defendant's motion under 28 U.S.C. 1404 (a), the case was transferred to the District of \n\n[351 \nU.S. 377, 379]\n\u00a0\n Delaware. After a lengthy trial, judgment was entered for du Pont on all issues.\n1\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Government's direct appeal here does not contest the findings that relate to caps and bands, nor does it raise any issue concerning the alleged attempt to monopolize or conspiracy to monopolize interstate commerce in cellophane. The appeal, as specifically stated by the Government, \"attacks only the ruling that du Pont has not monopolized trade in cellophane.\" At issue for determination is only this alleged violation by du Pont of 2 of the Sherman Act.\n2\n\u00a0\n\n\nDuring the period that is relevant to this action, du Pont produced almost 75% of the cellophane sold in the United States, and cellophane constituted less than 20% of all \"flexible packaging material\" sales. This was the designation accepted at the trial for the materials listed in Finding 280, Appendix A, this opinion, post, p. 405. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 377, 380]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe Government contends that, by so dominating cellophane production, du Pont monopolized a \"part of the trade or commerce\" in violation of 2. Respondent agrees that cellophane is a product which constitutes \"a `part' of commerce within the meaning of Section 2.\" Du Pont brief, pp. 16, 79. But it contends that the prohibition of 2 against monopolization is not violated because it does not have the power to control the price of cellophane or to exclude competitors from the market in which cellophane is sold. The court below found that the \"relevant market for determining the extent of du Pont's market control is the market for flexible packaging materials,\" and that competition from those other materials prevented du Pont from possessing monopoly powers in its sales of cellophane. Finding 37.\n\n\nThe Government asserts that cellophane and other wrapping materials are neither substantially fungible nor like priced. For these reasons, it argues that the market for other wrappings is distinct from the market for cellophane and that the competition afforded cellophane by other wrappings is not strong enough to be considered in determining whether du Pont has monopoly powers. Market delimitation is necessary under du Pont's theory to determine whether an alleged monopolist violates 2. The ultimate consideration in such a determination is whether the defendants control the price and competition in the market for such part of trade or commerce as they are charged with monopolizing. Every manufacturer is the sole producer of the particular commodity it makes but its control in the above sense of the relevant market depends upon the availability of alternative commodities for buyers: i. e., whether there is a cross-elasticity of demand between cellophane and the other wrappings. This interchangeability is largely gauged by the purchase of competing products for similar uses considering the price, characteristics and adaptability of the \n\n[351 \nU.S. 377, 381]\n\u00a0\n competing commodities. The court below found that the flexible wrappings afforded such alternatives. This Court must determine whether the trial court erred in its estimate of the competition afforded cellophane by other materials.\n\n\nThe burden of proof, of course, was upon the Government to establish monopoly. See United States v. Aluminum Co. of America, 148 F.2d 416, 423, 427. This the trial court held the Government failed to do, upon findings of fact and law stated at length by that court. For the United States to succeed in this Court now, it must show that erroneous legal tests were applied to essential findings of fact or that the findings themselves were \"clearly erroneous\" within our rulings on Rule 52 (a) of the Rules of Civil Procedure. See United States v. United States Gypsum Co., \n333 \nU.S. 364, 393\n-395. We do not try the facts of cases de novo. Timken Roller Bearing Co. v. United States, \n341 \nU.S. 593, 597\n.\n3\n\u00a0\n\n\nTwo additional questions were raised in the record and decided by the court below. That court found that, even if du Pont did possess monopoly power over sales of cellophane, it was not subject to Sherman Act prosecution, because (1) the acquisition of that power was protected by patents, and (2) that power was acquired solely through du Pont's business expertness. It was thrust upon du Pont. 118 F. Supp., at 213-218.\n\n\nSince the Government specifically excludes attempts and conspiracies to monopolize from consideration, a conclusion that du Pont has no monopoly power would obviate examination of these last two issues.\n\n\nI. Factual Background. - For consideration of the issue as to monopolization, a general summary of the development of cellophane is useful. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 377, 382]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nIn the early 1900's, Jacques Brandenberger, a Swiss chemist, attempted to make tablecloths impervious to dirt by spraying them with liquid viscose (a cellulose solution available in quantity from wood pulp, Finding 361) and by coagulating this coating. His idea failed, but he noted that the coating peeled off in a transparent film. This first \"cellophane\" was thick, hard, and not perfectly transparent, but Brandenberger apparently foresaw commercial possibilities in his discovery. By 1908 he developed the first machine for the manufacture of transparent sheets of regenerated cellulose. The 1908 product was not satisfactory, but by 1912 Brandenberger was making a saleable thin flexible film used in gas masks. He obtained patents to cover the machinery and the essential ideas of his process.\n\n\nIt seems to be agreed, however, that the disclosures of these early patents were not sufficient to make possible the manufacture of commercial cellophane. The inadequacy of the patents is partially attributed to the fact that the essential machine (the Hopper) was improved after it was patented. But more significant was the failure of these patents to disclose the actual technique of the process. This technique included the operational data acquired by experimentation.\n4\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn 1917 Brandenberger assigned his patents to La Cellophane Societe Anonyme and joined that organization. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 377, 383]\n\u00a0\n Thereafter developments in the production of cellophane somewhat paralleled those taking place in artificial textiles. Chemical science furnished the knowledge for perfecting the new products. The success of the artificial products has been enormous. Du Pont was an American leader in the field of synthetics and learned of cellophane's successes through an associate, Comptoir des Textiles Artificiel.\n\n\nIn 1923 du Pont organized with La Cellophane an American company for the manufacture of plain cellophane. The undisputed findings are that:\n\n \"On December 26, 1923, an agreement was executed between duPont Cellophane Company and La Cellophane by which La Cellophane licensed duPont Cellophane Company exclusively under its United States cellophane patents, and granted duPont Cellophane Company the exclusive right to make and sell in North and Central America under La Cellophane's secret processes for cellophane manufacture. DuPont Cellophane Company granted to La Cellophane exclusive rights for the rest of the world under any cellophane patents or processes duPont Cellophane Company might develop.\" Finding 24.\n\n\n\n Subsequently du Pont and La Cellophane licensed several foreign companies, allowing them to manufacture and vend cellophane in limited areas. Finding 601. Technical exchange agreements with these companies were entered into at the same time. However, in 1940, du Pont notified these foreign companies that sales might be made in any country,\n5\n and by 1948 all the technical exchange agreements were canceled. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 377, 384]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nSylvania, an American affiliate of a Belgian producer of cellophane not covered by the license agreements above referred to, began the manufacture of cellophane in the United States in 1930. Litigation between the French and Belgian companies resulted in a settlement whereby La Cellophane came to have a stock interest in Sylvania, contrary to the La Cellophane-du Pont agreement. This resulted in adjustments as compensation for the intrusion into United States of La Cellophane that extended du Pont's limited territory. The details do not here seem important. Since 1934 Sylvania has produced about 25% of United States cellophane.\n\n\nAn important factor in the growth of cellophane production and sales was the perfection of moistureproof cellophane, a superior product of du Pont research and patented by that company through a 1927 application. Plain cellophane has little resistance to the passage of moisture vapor. Moistureproof cellophane has a composition added which keeps moisture in and out of the packed commodity. This patented type of cellophane has had a demand with much more rapid growth than the plain.\n\n\nIn 1931 Sylvania began the manufacture of moistureproof cellophane under its own patents. After negotiations over patent rights, du Pont in 1933 licensed Sylvania to manufacture and sell moistureproof cellophane produced \n\n[351 \nU.S. 377, 385]\n\u00a0\n under the du Pont patents at a royalty of 2% of sales. These licenses, with the plain cellophane licenses from the Belgian company, made Sylvania a full cellophane competitor, limited on moistureproof sales by the terms of the licenses to 20% of the combined sales of the two companies of that type by the payment of a prohibitive royalty on the excess. Finding 552. There was never an excess production. The limiting clause was dropped on January 1, 1945, and Sylvania was acquired in 1946 by the American Viscose Corporation with assets of over two hundred million dollars.\n\n\nBetween 1928 and 1950, du Pont's sales of plain cellophane increased from $3,131,608 to $9,330,776. Moistureproof sales increased from $603,222 to $89,850,416, although prices were continuously reduced. Finding 337. It could not be said that this immense increase in use was solely or even largely attributable to the superior quality of cellophane or to the technique or business acumen of du Pont, though doubtless those factors were important. The growth was a part of the expansion of the commodity-packaging habits of business, a by-product of general efficient competitive merchandising to meet modern demands. The profits, which were large, apparently arose from this trend in marketing, the development of the industrial use of chemical research and production of synthetics, rather than from elimination of other producers from the relevant market. That market is discussed later at p. 394. Tables appearing at the end of this opinion (Appendix A. Findings 279-292, inclusive, post, pp. 405-410) show the uses of cellophane in comparison with other wrappings.\n6\n See the discussion, infra, p. 399 et seq.\n\n\nII. The Sherman Act and the Courts. - The Sherman Act has received long and careful application by this Court to achieve for the Nation the freedom of enterprise \n\n[351 \nU.S. 377, 386]\n\u00a0\n from monopoly or restraint envisaged by the Congress that passed the Act in 1890. Because the Act is couched in broad terms, it is adaptable to the changing types of commercial production and distribution that have evolved since its passage. Chief Justice Hughes wrote for the Court that \"As a charter of freedom, the Act has a generality and adaptability comparable to that found to be desirable in constitutional provisions.\" Appalachian Coals, Inc. v. United States, \n288 \nU.S. 344, 359\n-360. Compare on remedy, Judge Wyzanski in United States v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 110 F. Supp. 295, 348. It was said in Standard Oil Co. v. United States, \n221 \nU.S. 1, 50\n, that fear of the power of rapid accumulations of individual and corporate wealth from the trade and industry of a developing national economy caused its passage. Units of traders and producers snowballed by combining into so-called \"trusts.\" Competition was threatened. Control of prices was feared. Individual initiative was dampened. While the economic picture has changed, large aggregations of private capital, with power attributes, continue. Mergers go forward. Industries such as steel, automobiles, tires, chemicals, have only a few production organizations. A considerable size is often essential for efficient operation in research, manufacture and distribution.\n\n\nJudicial construction of antitrust legislation has generally been left unchanged by Congress. This is true of the Rule of Reason.\n7\n While it is fair to say that the Rule \n\n[351 \nU.S. 377, 387]\n\u00a0\n is imprecise, its application in Sherman Act litigation, as directed against enhancement of price or throttling of competition, has given a workable content to antitrust legislation. See note 18, infra. It was judicially declared a proper interpretation of the Sherman Act in 1911, with a strong, clear-cut dissent challenging its soundness on the ground that the specific words of the Act covered every contract that tended to restrain or monopolize.\n8\n This Court has not receded from its position on the Rule.\n9\n There is not, we think, any inconsistency between it and the development of the judicial theory that agreements as to maintenance of prices or division of territory are in themselves a violation of the Sherman Act.\n10\n It is logical that some agreements and practices are invalid per se, while others are illegal only as applied to particular situations.\n11\n\u00a0\n\n\nDifficulties of interpretation have arisen in the application of the Sherman Act in view of the technical changes in production of commodities and the new distribution practices.\n12\n They have called forth reappraisal of the effect of the Act by business and government.\n13\n\u00a0\n\n[351 \nU.S. 377, 388]\n\u00a0\n That reappraisal has so far left the problems with which we are here concerned to the courts rather than to administrative agencies. Cf. Federal Trade Commission Act. 38 Stat. 721. It is true that Congress has made exceptions to the generality of monopoly prohibitions, exceptions that spring from the necessities or conveniences of certain industries or business organizations, or from the characteristics of the members of certain groups of citizens.\n14\n But those exceptions express legislative \n\n[351 \nU.S. 377, 389]\n\u00a0\n determination of the national economy's need of reasonable limitations on cutthroat competition or prohibition of monopoly. \"[W]here exceptions are made, Congress should make them.\" United States v. Line Material Co., \n333 \nU.S. 287, 310\n. They modify the reach of the Sherman Act but do not change its prohibition of other monopolies. We therefore turn to 2 (note 2, supra) to determine whether du Pont has violated that section by its dominance in the manufacture of cellophane in the before-stated circumstances.\n\n\nIII. The Sherman Act, 2 - Monopolization. - The only statutory language of 2 pertinent on this review is: \"Every person who shall monopolize . . . shall be deemed guilty . . . .\" This Court has pointed out that monopoly at common law was a grant by the sovereign to any person for the sole making or handling of anything so that others were restrained or hindered in their lawful trade. Standard Oil Co. v. United States, \n221 \nU.S. 1, 51\n. However, as in England, it came to be recognized here that acts bringing the evils of authorized monopoly - unduly diminishing competition and enhancing prices - were undesirable (id., at 56, 57, 58) and were declared illegal by 2. Id., at 60-62. Our cases determine that a party has monopoly power if it has, over \"any part of the trade or commerce among the several States.\" a power of controlling prices or unreasonably restricting competition. Id., at 58. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 377, 390]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nSenator Hoar, in discussing 2, pointed out that monopoly involved something more than extraordinary commercial success, \"that it involved something like the use of means which made it impossible for other persons to engage in fair competition.\"\n15\n This exception to the \n\n[351 \nU.S. 377, 391]\n\u00a0\n Sherman Act prohibitions of monopoly power is perhaps the monopoly \"thrust upon\" one of United States v. Aluminum Co. of America, 148 F.2d 416, 429, left as an undecided possibility by American Tobacco Co. v. United States, \n328 \nU.S. 781\n. Compare United States v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 110 F. Supp. 295, 342.\n16\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf cellophane is the \"market\" that du Pont is found to dominate, it may be assumed it does have monopoly power over that \"market.\"\n17\n Monopoly power is the power to control prices or exclude competition.\n18\n It seems apparent \n\n[351 \nU.S. 377, 392]\n\u00a0\n that du Pont's power to set the price of cellophane has been limited only by the competition afforded by other flexible packaging materials. Moreover, it may be practically impossible for anyone to commence manufacturing cellophane without full access to du Pont's technique. However, du Pont has no power to prevent competition from other wrapping materials. The trial court consequently had to determine whether competition from the other wrappings prevented du Pont from possessing monopoly power in violation of 2. Price and competition are so intimately entwined that any discussion of theory must treat them as one. It is inconceivable that price could be controlled without power over competition or vice versa. This approach to the determination of monopoly power is strengthened by this Court's conclusion in prior cases that, when an alleged monopolist has power over price and competition, an intention to monopolize in a proper case may be assumed.\n19\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf a large number of buyers and sellers deal freely in a standardized product, such as salt or wheat, we have complete or pure competition. Patents, on the other hand, furnish the most familiar type of classic monopoly. As the producers of a standardized product bring about significant differentiations of quality, design, or packaging in the product that permit differences of use, competition becomes to a greater or less degree incomplete and the producer's power over price and competition greater over his article and its use, according to the differentiation he is able to create and maintain. A retail seller may have in one sense a monopoly on certain trade because of location, as an isolated country store or filling station, or because no \n\n[351 \nU.S. 377, 393]\n\u00a0\n one else makes a product of just the quality or attractiveness of his product, as for example in cigarettes. Thus one can theorize that we have monopolistic competition in every nonstandardized commodity with each manufacturer having power over the price and production of his own product.\n20\n However, this power that, let us say, automobile or soft-drink manufacturers have over their trademarked products is not the power that makes an illegal monopoly. Illegal power must be appraised in terms of the competitive market for the product.\n21\n\u00a0\n\n\nDetermination of the competitive market for commodities depends on how different from one another are the offered commodities in character or use, how far buyers will go to substitute one commodity for another. For example, one can think of building materials as in commodity competition but one could hardly say that brick competed with steel or wood or cement or stone in the meaning of Sherman Act litigation; the products are too different. This is the interindustry competition emphasized by some economists. See Lilienthal, Big Business, c. 5. On the other hand, there are certain differences in the formulae for soft drinks but one can hardly say that each one is an illegal monopoly. Whatever the market may be, we hold that control of price or competition establishes the existence of monopoly power under 2. Section 2 requires the application of a reasonable approach in determining the existence of monopoly power just as surely as did 1. This of course does not mean that there can be a reasonable monopoly. See notes 7 and 9, supra. Our next step is to determine whether du Pont has monopoly power over cellophane: that is, power over its price in relation to or competition with \n\n[351 \nU.S. 377, 394]\n\u00a0\n other commodities. The charge was monopolization of cellophane. The defense, that cellophane was merely a part of the relevant market for flexible packaging materials.\n\n\nIV. The Relevant Market. - When a product is controlled by one interest, without substitutes available in the market, there is monopoly power. Because most products have possible substitutes, we cannot, as we said in Times-Picayune Co. v. United States, \n345 \nU.S. 594, 612\n, give \"that infinite range\" to the definition of substitutes. Nor is it a proper interpretation of the Sherman Act to require that products be fungible to be considered in the relevant market.\n\n\nThe Government argues:\n\n \"We do not here urge that in no circumstances may competition of substitutes negative possession of monopolistic power over trade in a product. The decisions make it clear at the least that the courts will not consider substitutes other than those which are substantially fungible with the monopolized product and sell at substantially the same price.\"\n\n\n\n But where there are market alternatives that buyers may readily use for their purposes, illegal monopoly does not exist merely because the product said to be monopolized differs from others. If it were not so, only physically identical products would be a part of the market. To accept the Government's argument, we would have to conclude that the manufacturers of plain as well as moistureproof cellophane were monopolists, and so with films such as Pliofilm, foil, glassine, polyethylene, and Saran, for each of these wrapping materials is distinguishable. These were all exhibits in the case. New wrappings appear, generally similar to cellophane: is each a monopoly? What is called for is an appraisal of the \"cross-elasticity\" of demand in the trade. See Note, 54 Col. L. Rev. 580. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 377, 395]\n\u00a0\n The varying circumstances of each case determine the result.\n22\n In considering what is the relevant market for determining the control of price and competition, no more definite rule can be declared than that commodities reasonably interchangeable by consumers for the same purposes make up that \"part of the trade or commerce,\" monopolization of which may be illegal. As respects flexible packaging materials, the market geographically is nationwide.\n\n\nIndustrial activities cannot be confined to trim categories. Illegal monopolies under 2 may well exist over limited products in narrow fields where competition is eliminated.\n23\n That does not settle the issue here. In \n\n[351 \nU.S. 377, 396]\n\u00a0\n determining the market under the Sherman Act, it is the use or uses to which the commodity is put that control. The selling price between commodities with similar uses and different characteristics may vary, so that the cheaper product can drive out the more expensive. Or, the superior quality of higher priced articles may make dominant the more desirable. Cellophane costs more than many competing products and less than a few. But whatever the price, there are various flexible wrapping materials that are bought by manufacturers for packaging their goods in their own plants or are sold to converters who shape and print them for use in the packaging of the commodities to be wrapped. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 377, 397]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nCellophane differs from other flexible packaging materials. From some it differs more than from others. The basic materials from which the wrappings are made and the advantages and disadvantages of the products to the packaging industry are summarized in Findings 62 and 63. They are aluminum, cellulose acetate, chlorides, wood pulp, rubber hydrochloride, and ethylene gas. It will adequately illustrate the similarity in characteristics of the various products by noting here Finding 62 as to glassine.\n24\n Its use is almost as extensive as cellophane, Appendix C, post, p. 412, and many of its characteristics equally or more satisfactory to users.\n25\n\u00a0\n\n[351 \nU.S. 377, 398]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nIt may be admitted that cellophane combines the desirable elements of transparency, strength and cheapness more definitely than any of the others. Comparative characteristics have been noted thus:\n\n\"Moistureproof cellophane is highly transparent, tears readily but has high bursting strength, is highly impervious to moisture and gases, and is resistant to grease and oils. Heat sealable, printable, and adapted to use on wrapping machines, it makes an excellent packaging material for both display and protection of commodities.\n\n\n \"Other flexible wrapping materials fall into four major categories: (1) opaque nonmoistureproof wrapping paper designed primarily for convenience and protection in handling packages; (2) moistureproof films of varying degrees of transparency designed primarily either to protect, or to display and protect, the products they encompass; (3) nonmoistureproof transparent films designed primarily to display and to some extent protect, but which obviously do a poor protecting job where exclusion or retention of moisture is important; and (4) moistureproof materials other than films of varying degrees of transparency (foils and paper products) designed to protect and display.\"\n26\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n An examination of Finding 59, Appendix B, post, p. 411, will make this clear. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 377, 399]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nBut, despite cellophane's advantages, it has to meet competition from other materials in every one of its uses. Cellophane's principal uses are analyzed in Appendix A, Findings 281 and 282. Food products are the chief outlet, with cigarettes next. The Government makes no challenge to Finding 283 that cellophane furnishes less than 7% of wrappings for bakery products, 25% for candy, 32% for snacks, 35% for meats and poultry, 27% for crackers and biscuits, 47% for fresh produce, and 34% for frozen foods. Seventy-five to eighty percent of cigarettes are wrapped in cellophane. Finding 292. Thus, cellophane shares the packaging market with others. The over-all result is that cellophane accounts for 17.9% of flexible wrapping materials, measured by the wrapping surface. Finding 280, Appendix A, post, p. 405.\n\n\nMoreover a very considerable degree of functional interchangeability exists between these products, as is shown by the tables of Appendix A and Findings 150-278.\n27\n It will be noted, Appendix B, that except as to permeability to gases, cellophane has no qualities that are not possessed by a number of other materials. Meat will do as an example of interchangeability. Findings 205-220. Although du Pont's sales to the meat industry have reached 19,000,000 pounds annually, nearly 35%, this volume is attributed \"to the rise of self-service retailing of fresh meat.\" Findings 212 and 283. In fact, since the popularity of self-service meats, du Pont has lost \"a considerable proportion\" of this packaging business to Pliofilm. Finding 215. Pliofilm is more expensive than cellophane, but its superior physical characteristics apparently offset cellophane's price advantage. While retailers \n\n[351 \nU.S. 377, 400]\n\u00a0\n shift continually between the two, the trial court found that Pliofilm is increasing its share of the business. Finding 216. One further example is worth noting. Before World War II, du Pont cellophane wrapped between 5 and 10% of baked and smoked meats. The peak year was 1933. Finding 209. Thereafter du Pont was unable to meet the competition of Sylvania and of greaseproof paper. Its sales declined and the 1933 volume was not reached again until 1947. Findings 209-210. It will be noted that greaseproof paper, glassine, waxed paper, foil and Pliofilm are used as well as cellophane, Finding 218. Findings 209-210 show the competition and 215-216 the advantages that have caused the more expensive Pliofilm to increase its proportion of the business.\n\n\nAn element for consideration as to cross-elasticity of demand between products is the responsiveness of the sales of one product to price changes of the other.\n28\n If a slight decrease in the price of cellophane causes a considerable number of customers of other flexible wrappings to switch to cellophane, it would be an indication that a high cross-elasticity of demand exists between them; that the products compete in the same market. The court below held that the \"[g]reat sensitivity of customers in the flexible packaging markets to price or quality changes\" prevented du Pont from possessing monopoly control over price. 118 F. Supp., at 207. The record sustains these findings. See references made by the trial court in Findings 123-149.\n\n\nWe conclude that cellophane's interchangeability with the other materials mentioned suffices to make it a part of this flexible packaging material market.\n\n\nThe Government stresses the fact that the variation in price between cellophane and other materials demonstrates they are noncompetitive. As these products are \n\n[351 \nU.S. 377, 401]\n\u00a0\n all flexible wrapping materials, it seems reasonable to consider, as was done at the trial, their comparative cost to the consumer in terms of square area. This can be seen in Finding 130, Appendix C. Findings as to price competition are set out in the margin.\n29\n Cellophane costs two or three times as much, surface measure, as its chief competitors for the flexible wrapping market, glassine and greaseproof papers. Other forms of cellulose wrappings and those from other chemical or mineral substances, with the exception of aluminum foil, are more expensive. The uses of these materials, as can be observed by Finding 283 in Appendix A, are largely to wrap small packages for retail distribution. The wrapping is a relatively small proportion of the entire cost of the article.\n30\n Different producers need different qualities in wrappings and their need may vary from time to time as their products undergo change. But the necessity for flexible wrappings is the central and unchanging demand. We cannot say that these differences in cost gave du Pont monopoly power over prices in view of the findings of fact on that subject.\n31\n\u00a0\n\n[351 \nU.S. 377, 402]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nIt is the variable characteristics of the different flexible wrappings and the energy and ability with which the manufacturers push their wares that determine choice. A glance at \"Modern Packaging,\" a trade journal, will give, by its various advertisements, examples of the competition among manufacturers for the flexible packaging market. The trial judge visited the 1952 Annual Packaging \n\n[351 \nU.S. 377, 403]\n\u00a0\n Show at Atlantic City, with the consent of counsel. He observed exhibits offered by \"machinery manufacturers, converters and manufacturers of flexible packaging materials.\" He states that these personal observations confirmed his estimate of the competition between cellophane and other packaging materials. Finding 820. From this wide variety of evidence, the Court reached the conclusion expressed in Finding 838:\n\n \"The record establishes plain cellophane and moistureproof cellophane are each flexible packaging materials which are functionally interchangeable with other flexible packaging materials and sold at same time to same customers for same purpose at competitive prices; there is no cellophane market distinct and separate from the market for flexible packaging materials; the market for flexible packaging materials is the relevant market for determining nature and extent of duPont's market control; and duPont has at all times competed with other cellophane producers and manufacturers of other flexible packaging materials in all aspects of its cellophane business.\"\n\n\n\n The facts above considered dispose also of any contention that competitors have been excluded by du Pont from the packaging material market. That market has many producers and there is no proof du Pont ever has possessed power to exclude any of them from the rapidly expanding flexible packaging market. The Government apparently concedes as much, for it states that \"lack of power to inhibit entry into this so-called market [i. e., flexible packaging materials], comprising widely disparate products, is no indicium of absence of power to exclude competition in the manufacture and sale of cellophane.\" The record shows the multiplicity of competitors and the financial strength of some with individual assets running to the hundreds of millions. Findings 66-72. Indeed, the \n\n[351 \nU.S. 377, 404]\n\u00a0\n trial court found that du Pont could not exclude competitors even from the manufacture of cellophane, Finding 727, an immaterial matter if the market is flexible packaging material. Nor can we say that du Pont's profits, while liberal (according to the Government 15.9% net after taxes on the 1937-1947 average), demonstrate the existence of a monopoly without proof of lack of comparable profits during those years in other prosperous industries. Cellophane was a leader, over 17%, in the flexible packaging materials market. There is no showing that du Pont's rate of return was greater or less than that of other producers of flexible packaging materials. Finding 719.\n\n\nThe \"market\" which one must study to determine when a producer has monopoly power will vary with the part of commerce under consideration. The tests are constant. That market is composed of products that have reasonable interchangeability for the purposes for which they are produced - price, use and qualities considered. While the application of the tests remains uncertain, it seems to us that du Pont should not be found to monopolize cellophane when that product has the competition and interchangeability with other wrappings that this record shows.\n\n\nOn the findings of the District Court, its judgment is\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE CLARK and MR. JUSTICE HARLAN took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\n[For concurring opinion of MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, see post, p. 413.]\n\n\n[For dissenting opinion of THE CHIEF JUSTICE, joined by MR. JUSTICE BLACK and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, see post, p. 414.] \n\n[351 \nU.S. 377, 405]\n\u00a0\n\n\n    APPENDIX A.\n\n\n  VIII. RESULTS OF DU PONT'S COMPETITION WITH OTHER     MATERIALS.\n\n\n   (Findings 279-292.)\n\n\n279. \nDuring the period du Pont entered the flexible packaging business, and since its introduction of moisture-proof cellophane, sales of cellophane have increased. Total volume of flexible packaging materials used in the United States has also increased. Du Pont's relative percentage of the packaging business has grown as a result of its research, price, sales and capacity policies, but du Pont cellophane even in uses where it has competed has not attained the bulk of the business, due to competition of other flexible packaging materials.\n\n\n280. Of the production and imports of flexible packaging materials in 1949 measured in wrapping surface, du Pont cellophane accounted for less than 20% of flexible packaging materials consumed in the United States in that year.

Of this quantity, 80% is sold for packaging baked goods, meat, candy, crackers and biscuits, frozen foods, fresh vegetables and produce, potato chips, and \"snacks,\" such as peanut butter sandwiches, popcorn, etc. A small amount is sold for wrapping of textiles and paper products, etc. Largest non-food use of cellophane is the overwrapping of cigarette packages.\n\n\nThe breakdown of du Pont cellophane sales for the year 1949 was:\n\n Use    Sales  Percent of TOBACCO    (M pounds)  Total Sales\n\n\n Cigarettes .................. 20,584   11.6  Cigars ......................  3,195  1.8  Other Tobacco ...............  1,657  0.9     --------  -------  Total .................... 25,436   14.3\n\n\n\n FOOD PRODUCTS\n\n Candy & Gum ................. 17,054  9.6  Bread & Cake ................ 40,081   22.5  Crackers & Biscuits ......... 12,614  7.1  Meat ........................ 11,596  6.5  Noodles & Macaroni ..........  2,602  1.5  Tea & Coffee ................  1,380  0.8  Cereals .....................  2,487  1.4  Frozen Foods ................  5,234  2.9  Dried Fruit ................. 333  0.2  Nuts ........................  2,946  1.7  Popcorn & Potato Chips ......  6,929  3.9  Dairy Products ..............  3,808  2.1  Fresh Produce ...............  4,564  2.6  Unclassified Foods ..........  8,750  4.9     --------  ------- Total ..................... 120,478   67.7 \n\n[351 \nU.S. 377, 407]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n Use    Sales   Percent of MISCELLANEOUS    (M pounds)   Total Sales\n\n\n Hosiery ......................  1,370   0.7  Textiles .....................  3,141   1.8  Drugs ........................  1,031   0.6  Rubber ....................... 317   0.2  Paper ........................  2,736   1.5  Unclassified ................. 18,602    10.5     --------  -------  Total ...................... 27,197    15.3 Domestic Total .................. 173,011    97.3 Export ..........................  4,820   2.7 Grand Total ..................... 177,831   100.0\n\n\n282. \nSales of cellophane by du Pont in 1951, by principal uses, were approximately as follows:\n\n       Pounds\n\n\n\n White bread ........................ between 8 and  9,000,000 Specialty breads ............................... 15,700,000 Cake and other baked sweet goods ................  22,000,000 Meat ............................................  19,000,000 Candy (including chewing gum) ...................  20,000,000 Crackers and biscuits ...........................  17,000,000 Frozen foods .................................... 5,800,000 Cigarettes ......................................  23,000,000\n\n\n283. 1949 sales of 19 major representative converters whose business covered a substantial segment of the total converting of flexible packaging materials for that year showed the following as to their sales of flexible packaging materials, classified by end use:\n\n     Quantity    Percent End Use   (Millions   of Total BAKERY PRODUCTS   sq. in.)

About 96% of packaged white bread produced in the United States is wrapped in waxed paper or glassine, and about 6% in cellophane. The cellophane figure includes sales by all U.S. producers.\n\n\n285. Forty-eight percent of specialty breads are wrapped in du Pont cellophane, the remainder in other cellophane or other materials. Most of this balance is wrapped in waxed paper and glassine.\n\n\n286. Approximately 45% of cake and baked sweet goods packaged by wholesale bakers is wrapped in du Pont cellophane. The balance is wrapped in other cellophane or in waxed paper or glassine.\n\n\n287. Between 25 and 35% of packaged candy units sold in the United States are wrapped in du Pont cellophane.\n\n\n288. Of sponge and sweet crackers and biscuits combined approximately 25% to 30% of the packaged units produced in 1951 were wrapped in du Pont cellophane.\n\n\n289. Du Pont cellophane at the present time is used on approximately 20 to 30% of packaged retail units of frozen foods. The remainder use waxed paper, waxed glassine, polyethylene, Pliofilm, Cry-O-Vac, or vegetable parchment.\n\n\n290. Approximately 20 to 30% of packages of potato chips and other snacks are wrapped in du Pont cellophane. Most of the remainder are packaged in glassine and other flexible wraps. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 377, 410]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n291. Approximately 4 to 6% of the packaged units of cereal are wrapped in du Pont cellophane. The principal flexible packaging materials used are waxed paper and glassine.\n\n\n292.

This viscous fluid is ripened according to a \"ripening index,\" a test whereby viscose is put in a salt solution and shaken to bring out the coagulation point. The requisite strength of this solution varies according to the ripening time. Fourteen additional baths follow the first coagulating bath. The most advantageous ripening time, temperature, size, composition, and duration of each of the baths were all determined by the trials and errors of Brandenberger and La Cellophane, the corporation he directed. It was estimated that in 1923 it would have taken four or five years of experimentation by a new producer of cellophane to attain this production technique.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Substantially identical letters were sent in this form: \"Question has been raised within our organization as to the existence of territorial limitations under our agreements with your company relating to regenerated cellulose film.

Rec. 3151: \"Mr. KENNA. Mr. President, I have no disposition to delay a vote on the bill, but I would like to ask, with his permission, the Senator from Vermont a question touching the second section: \"`Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade, etc.' \"Is it intended by the committee, as the section seems to indicate, that if an individual engaged in trade between States or between States and Territories, or between States or Territories and the District of Columbia, or between a State and a foreign country, by his own skill and energy, by the propriety of his conduct generally, shall pursue his calling in such a way as to monopolize a trade, his action shall be a crime under this proposed act? To make myself understood, if I am not clear - \"Mr. EDMUNDS. I think I understand the Senator. \"Mr. KENNA. Suppose a citizen of Kentucky is dealing in shorthorn cattle and by virtue of his superior skill in that particular product it turns out that he is the only one in the United States to whom an order comes from Mexico for cattle of that stock for a considerable period, so that he is conceded to have a monopoly of that trade with Mexico; is it intended by the committee that the bill shall make that man a culprit? \"Mr. EDMUNDS. It is not intended by it and the bill does not do it. Anybody who knows the meaning of the word `monopoly,' as the courts apply it, would not apply it to such a person at all; and I am sure my friend must understand that.\" Id., at 3152: \"Mr. HOAR. I put in the committee, if I may be permitted to say so (I suppose there is no impropriety in it), the precise question which has been put by the Senator from West Virginia, and I had that precise difficulty in the first place with this bill, but I was answered, and I think all the other members of the committee agreed in the answer, that `monopoly' is a technical term known to the common law, and that it signifies - I do not mean to say that they stated what the signification was, but I became satisfied that they \n\n[351 \nU.S. 377, 391]\n\u00a0\n were right and that the word `monopoly' is a merely technical term which has a clear and legal signification, and it is this: It is the sole engrossing to a man's self by means which prevent other men from engaging in fair competition with him. \"Of course a monopoly granted by the King was a direct inhibition of all other persons to engage in that business or calling or to acquire that particular article, except the man who had a monopoly granted him by the sovereign power. I suppose, therefore, that the courts of the United States would say in the case put by the Senator from West Virginia that a man who merely by superior skill and intelligence, a breeder of horses or raiser of cattle, or manufacturer or artisan of any kind, got the whole business because nobody could do it as well as he could was not a monopolist, but that it involved something like the use of means which made it impossible for other persons to engage in fair competition, like the engrossing, the buying up of all other persons engaged in the same business.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] See p. 381.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] Compare Standard Oil Co. v.

United States, \n268 \nU.S. 563, 579\n: \"It should be said at the outset, that in considering the application of the rule of decision in these cases to the situation presented by this record, it should be remembered that this Court has often announced that each case arising under the Sherman Act must be determined upon the particular facts disclosed by the record, and that the opinions in those cases must be read in the light of their facts and of a clear recognition of the essential differences in the facts of those cases, and in the facts of any new case to which the rule of earlier decisions is to be applied.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 23\n] The Government notes that the prohibitions of 2 of the Sherman Act have often been extended to producers of single products and to business of limited scope. But the cases to which the Government refers us were not concerned with the problem that is now before the Court. In Story Parchment Co. v. Paterson Co., \n282 \nU.S. 555\n, a conspiracy to monopolize trade in vegetable parchment was held to be a violation of 2. Parchment paper is obviously no larger a part of commerce than cellophane. Recovery, however, was based on proven allegations of combination and conspiracy to monopolize, and the scope of the market was not in issue. P. 560. Similarly, Indiana Farmer's Guide Co. v. Prairie Farmer Publishing Co., \n293 \nU.S. 268\n, ruled that a combination or conspiracy for the purpose of monopolizing the farm-paper business in the north central part of the Nation would be illegal by reason of the second section of the Sherman Act. Lorain Journal Co. v. United States, \n342 \nU.S. 143\n, a case not cited by the Government, was concerned with even a smaller \n\n[351 \nU.S. 377, 396]\n\u00a0\n geographical area (dissemination of news in a community and surrounding territory). But the Court held only that defendant had attempted to monopolize, not that he had in fact monopolized. Also, this Court found in United States v. Columbia Steel Co., \n334 \nU.S. 495\n, that the \"relevant competitive market\" for determining whether there had been an unreasonable restraint of trade (or an attempt to monopolize) was the market for \"rolled steel\" products in an 11-state area. Women's dresses of \"original design,\" Fashion Originators' Guild v. Federal Trade Comm'n, \n312 \nU.S. 457\n; \"first run\" motion pictures, United States v. Paramount Pictures, \n334 \nU.S. 131\n; the news services of one news agency, United States v. Associated Press, 52 F. Supp. 362 (S. D. N. Y.), aff'd \n326 \nU.S. 1\n; and newspaper advertising as distinguished from other means of news dissemination, Times-Picayune Co. v. United States, \n345 \nU.S. 594\n, have all been designated as parts of commerce. All four were concerned only with the question of whether there had been an attempt to monopolize. United States v. Aluminum Co. of America, 148 F.2d 416 (C. A. 2d Cir.), did involve the question of monopolization. Judge Hand found that the relevant market for measuring Alcoa's power was the market for \"virgin\" aluminum; he refused to consider the close competition offered by \"secondary\" (used) aluminum. The reason for the narrow definition was that Alcoa's control over virgin aluminum permitted it to regulate the supply of used aluminum even though the latter should be actually sold by a competitor. Consequently, the case is not particularly helpful in the problem of market definition now before the Court.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 24\n] \"62. . . . Greaseproof paper is made by beating wood pulp in a vat filled with water until the fibers become saturated and gelatinous in texture. Resulting product is translucent and resistant to oil and grease. \"Glassine is produced by finishing greaseproof paper between highly polished metal rollers under heat and at pressure. This process develops the transparency and surface gloss which are characteristic of glassine. It is greaseproof, and can be sealed by heat, if coated. It is made moistureproof by coating and with appropriate lacquers or waxes and may be printed.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 25\n] \"63.

The price of cellophane is today an obstacle to its sales in competition with other flexible packaging materials. \"133. Cellophane has always been higher priced than the two largest selling flexible packaging materials, wax paper and glassine, and this has represented a disadvantage to sales of cellophane. \"134. DuPont considered as a factor in the determination of its prices, the prices of waxed paper, glassine, greaseproof, vegetable parchment, and other flexible packaging materials. \"135. DuPont, in reducing its prices, intended to narrow price differential between cellophane and packaging papers, particularly glassine and waxed paper. The objective of this effort has been to increase the use of cellophane. Each price reduction was intended to open up new uses for cellophane, and to attract new customers who had not used cellophane because of its price.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 30\n] See, e. g., R. 4846.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 31\n] \"140. Some users are sensitive to the cost of flexible packaging materials; others are not. Users to whom cost is important include \n\n[351 \nU.S. 377, 402]\n\u00a0\n substantial business: for example, General Foods, Armour, Curtiss Candy Co., and smaller users in the bread industry, cracker industry, and frozen food industry. These customers are unwilling to use more cellophane because of its relatively high price, would use more if the price were reduced, and have increased their use as the price of cellophane has been reduced. \"141. The cost factor slips accounts away from cellophane. This hits at the precarious users, whose profit margins on their products are low, and has been put in motion by competitive developments in the user's trade. Examples include the losses of business to glassine in candy bar wraps in the 30's, frozen food business to waxed paper in the late 40's, and recent losses to glassine in cracker packaging. \"142. The price of cellophane was reduced to expand the market for cellophane. DuPont did not reduce prices for cellophane with intent of monopolizing manufacture or with intent of suppressing competitors. \"143. DuPont reduced cellophane prices to enable sales to be made for new uses from which higher prices had excluded cellophane, and to expand sales. Reductions were made as sales volume and market conditions warranted. In determining price reductions, duPont considered relationship between its manufacturing costs and proposed prices, possible additional volume that might be gained by the price reduction, effect of price reduction upon the return duPont would obtain on its investment. It considered the effect its lowered price might have on the manufacture by others, but this possible result of a price reduction was never a motive for the reduction. \"144. DuPont never lowered cellophane prices below cost, and never dropped cellophane prices temporarily to gain a competitive advantage. \"145. As duPont's manufacturing costs declined, 1924 to 1935, duPont reduced prices for cellophane. When costs of raw materials increased subsequent to 1935, it postponed reductions until 1938 and 1939. Subsequent increases in cost of raw material and labor brought about price increases after 1947.\" \n\n[351 \nU.S. 377, 413]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, concurring.\n\n\nI concur in the judgment of the Court and in so much of MR. JUSTICE REED'S opinion as supports the conclusion that cellophane did not by itself constitute a closed market but was a part of the relevant market for flexible packaging materials.\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE REED has pithily defined the conflicting claims in this case. \"The charge was monopolization of cellophane. The defense, that cellophane was merely a part of the relevant market for flexible packaging materials.\" Since this defense is sustained, the judgment below must be affirmed and it becomes unnecessary to consider whether du Pont's power over trade in cellophane would, had the defense failed, come within the prohibition of \"monopolizing\" under 2 of the Sherman Act. Needless disquisition on the difficult subject of single-firm monopoly should be avoided since the case may be disposed of without consideration of this problem.\n\n\nThe boundary between the course of events by which a business may reach a powerful position in an industry without offending the outlawry of \"monopolizing\" under 2 of the Sherman Act and the course of events which brings the attainment of that result within the condemnation of that section, cannot be established by general phrases. It must be determined with reference to specific facts upon considerations analogous to those by which 1 of the Sherman Act is applied. These were illuminatingly stated by Mr. Justice Brandeis for the Court:\n\n\"The true test of legality is whether the restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby promotes competition or whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition. To determine that question the court must ordinarily consider the facts peculiar to the business to which \n\n[351 \nU.S. 377, 414]\n\u00a0\n the restraint is applied; its condition before and after the restraint was imposed; the nature of the restraint and its effect, actual or probable. The history of the restraint, the evil believed to exist, the reason for adopting the particular remedy, the purpose or end sought to be attained, are all relevant facts. . . .\" Board of Trade of the City of Chicago v. United States, \n246 \nU.S. 231, 238\n.\n\n\n\n Sections 1 and 2 of course implicate different considerations. But the so-called issues of fact and law that call for adjudication in this legal territory are united, and intrinsically so, with factors that entail social and economic judgment. Any consideration of \"monopoly\" under the Sherman law can hardly escape judgment, even if only implied, on social and economic issues. It had best be withheld until a case inescapably calls for it.\n\n\nMR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN, with whom MR. JUSTICE BLACK and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS join, dissenting.\n\n\nThis case, like many under the Sherman Act, turns upon the proper definition of the market. In defining the market in which du Pont's economic power is to be measured, the majority virtually emasculate 2 of the Sherman Act. They admit that \"cellophane combines the desirable elements of transparency, strength and cheapness more definitely than any of\" a host of other packaging materials. Yet they hold that all of those materials are so indistinguishable from cellophane as to warrant their inclusion in the market. We cannot agree that cellophane, in the language of Times-Picayune Publishing Co. v. United States, \n345 \nU.S. 594, 613\n, is \"the selfsame product\" as glassine, greaseproof and vegetable parchment papers, waxed papers, sulphite papers, \n\n[351 \nU.S. 377, 415]\n\u00a0\n aluminum foil, cellulose acetate, and Pliofilm and other films.\n1\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe majority opinion states that \"[I]t will adequately illustrate the similarity in characteristics of the various products by noting here Finding 62 as to glassine.\" But Finding 62 merely states the respects in which the selected flexible packaging materials are as satisfactory as cellophane; it does not compare all the physical properties of cellophane and other materials. The Table incorporated in Finding 59 does make such a comparison, and enables us to note cellophane's unique combination of qualities lacking among less expensive materials in varying degrees.\n2\n A glance at this Table reveals that cellophane has a high bursting strength while glassine's is low; that cellophane's permeability to gases is lower than that of glassine; and that both its transparency and its resistance to grease and oils are greater than glassine's. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 377, 416]\n\u00a0\n Similarly, we see that waxed paper's bursting strength is less than cellophane's and that it is highly permeable to gases and offers no resistance whatsoever to grease and oils. With respect to the two other major products held to be close substitutes for cellophane, Finding 59 makes the majority's market definition more dubious. In contrast to cellophane, aluminum foil is actually opaque and has a low bursting strength. And sulphite papers, in addition to being opaque, are highly permeable to both moisture and gases, have no resistance to grease and oils, have a lower bursting strength than cellophane, and are not even heat sealable. Indeed, the majority go further than placing cellophane in the same market with such products. They also include the transparent films, which are more expensive than cellophane. These bear even less resemblance to the lower priced packaging materials than does cellophane. The juxtaposition of one of these films, Cry-O-Rap, with sulphite in the Table facilitates a comparison which shows that Cry-O-Rap is markedly different and far superior.\n\n\nIf the conduct of buyers indicated that glassine, waxed and sulphite papers and aluminum foil were actually \"the selfsame products\" as cellophane, the qualitative differences demonstrated by the comparison of physical properties in Finding 59 would not be conclusive. But the record provides convincing proof that businessmen did not so regard these products. During the period covered by the complaint (1923-1947) cellophane enjoyed phenomenal growth. Du Pont's 1924 production was 361,-249 pounds, which sold for $1,306,662. Its 1947 production was 133,502,858 pounds, which sold for $55,339,626. Findings 297 and 337. Yet throughout this period the price of cellophane was far greater than that of glassine, waxed paper or sulphite paper. Finding 136 states that in 1929 cellophane's price was seven times that of glassine; in 1934, four times, and in 1949 still more than twice \n\n[351 \nU.S. 377, 417]\n\u00a0\n glassine's price. Reference to DX-994, the graph upon which Finding 136 is based, shows that cellophane had a similar price relation to waxed paper and that sulphite paper sold at even less than glassine and waxed paper. We cannot believe that buyers, practical businessmen, would have bought cellophane in increasing amounts over a quarter of a century if close substitutes were available at from one-seventh to one-half cellophane's price. That they did so is testimony to cellophane's distinctiveness.\n\n\nThe inference yielded by the conduct of cellophane buyers is reinforced by the conduct of sellers other than du Pont. Finding 587 states that Sylvania, the only other cellophane producer, absolutely and immediately followed every du Pont price change, even dating back its price list to the effective date of du Pont's change. Producers of glassine and waxed paper, on the other hand, displayed apparent indifference to du Pont's repeated and substantial price cuts. DX-994 shows that from 1924 to 1932 du Pont dropped the price of plain cellophane 84%, while the price of glassine remained constant.\n3\n And during the period 1933-1946 the prices for glassine and waxed paper actually increased in the face of a further 21% decline in the price of cellophane. If \"shifts of business\" due to \"price sensitivity\" had been substantial, glassine and waxed paper producers who wanted to stay in business would have been compelled by market forces to meet du Pont's price challenge just as Sylvania was. The majority correctly point out that:\n\n \"An element for consideration as to cross-elasticity of demand between products is the responsiveness of the sales of one product to price changes of the other. If a slight decrease in the price of cellophane causes a considerable number of customers of other flexible wrappings to switch to cellophane, it would be an \n\n[351 \nU.S. 377, 418]\n\u00a0\n indication that a high cross-elasticity of demand exists between them; that the products compete in the same market.\"\n\n\n\n Surely there was more than \"a slight decrease in the price of cellophane\" during the period covered by the complaint. That producers of glassine and waxed paper remained dominant in the flexible packaging materials market without meeting cellophane's tremendous price cuts convinces us that cellophane was not in effective competition with their products.\n4\n\u00a0\n\n\nCertainly du Pont itself shared our view. From the first, du Pont recognized that it need not concern itself with competition from other packaging materials. For example, when du Pont was contemplating entry into cellophane production, its Development Department reported that glassine \"is so inferior that it belongs in an entirely different class and has hardly to be considered as a competitor of cellophane.\"\n5\n This was still du Pont's view in 1950 when its survey of competitive prospects wholly omitted reference to glassine, waxed paper or sulphite paper and stated that \"Competition for du Pont cellophane will come from competitive cellophane and from non-cellophane films made by us or by others.\"\n6\n\u00a0\n\n\nDu Pont's every action was directed toward maintaining dominance over cellophane. Its 1923 agreements with La Cellophane, the French concern which first produced commercial cellophane, gave du Pont exclusive \n\n[351 \nU.S. 377, 419]\n\u00a0\n North and Central American rights to cellophane's technology, manufacture and sale, and provided, without any limitation in time, that all existing and future information pertaining to the cellophane process be considered \"secret and confidential,\" and be held in an exclusive common pool.\n7\n In its subsequent agreements with foreign licensees, du Pont was careful to preserve its continental market inviolate.\n8\n In 1929, while it was still the sole domestic producer of cellophane, du Pont won its long struggle to raise the tariff from 25% to 60%, and valorem, on cellophane imports,\n9\n substantially foreclosing foreign competition. When Sylvania became the second American cellophane producer the following year and du Pont filed suit claiming infringement of its moistureproof patents, they settled the suit by entering into a cross-licensing agreement. Under this agreement, du Pont obtained the right to exclude third persons from use of any patentable moistureproof invention made during the next 15 years by the sole other domestic cellophane producer, and, by a prohibitive royalty provision, it limited Sylvania's moistureproof production to approximately \n\n[351 \nU.S. 377, 420]\n\u00a0\n 20% of the industry's moistureproof sales.\n10\n The record shows that du Pont and Sylvania were aware that, by settling the infringement suit, they avoided the possibility that the courts might hold the patent claims invalid and thereby open cellophane manufacture to additional competition.\n11\n If close substitutes for cellophane had been commercially available, du Pont, an enlightened enterprise, would not have gone to such lengths to control cellophane.\n\n\nAs predicted by its 1923 market analysis,\n12\n du Pont's dominance in cellophane proved enormously profitable from the outset. After only five years of production, when du Pont bought out the minority stock interests in its cellophane subsidiary, it had to pay more than fifteen times the original price of the stock.\n13\n But such success was not limited to the period of innovation, limited sales and complete domestic monopoly. A confidential du Pont report shows that during the period 1937-1947, despite great expansion of sales, du Pont's \"operative return\" (before taxes) averaged 31%, while its average \"net return\" (after deduction of taxes, bonuses, and fundamental research expenditures) was 15.9%.\n14\n Such profits provide a powerful incentive for the entry of competitors.\n15\n\u00a0\n\n[351 \nU.S. 377, 421]\n\u00a0\n Yet from 1924 to 1951 only one new firm, Sylvania, was able to begin cellophane production. And Sylvania could not have entered if La Cellophane's secret process had not been stolen.\n16\n It is significant that for 15 years Olin Industries, a substantial firm, was unsuccessful in its attempt to produce cellophane, finally abandoning the project in 1944 after having spent about $1,000,000.\n17\n When the Government brought this suit, du Pont, \"to reduce the hazard of being judged to have a monopoly of the U.S. cellophane business,\"\n18\n decided to let Olin enter the industry. Despite this demonstration of the control achieved by du Pont through its exclusive dominion over the cellophane process, the District Court found that du Pont could not exclude competitors from the manufacture of cellophane. Finding 727. This finding is \"clearly erroneous.\"\n19\n The majority avoid \n\n[351 \nU.S. 377, 422]\n\u00a0\n passing upon Finding 727 by stating that it is \"immaterial . . . if the market is flexible packaging material.\" They do not appear to disagree with our conclusion, however, since they concede that \". . . it may be practically impossible for anyone to commerce manufacturing cellophane without full access to du Pont's technique.\"\n\n\nThe trial court found that\n\n \"Du Pont has no power to set cellophane prices arbitrarily. If prices for cellophane increase in relation to prices of other flexible packaging materials it will lose business to manufacturers of such materials in varying amounts for each of duPont cellophane's major end uses.\" Finding 712.\n\n\n\n This further reveals its misconception of the antitrust laws. A monopolist seeking to maximize profits cannot raise prices \"arbitrarily.\" Higher prices of course mean smaller sales, but they also mean higher per-unit profit. Lower prices will increase sales but reduce per-unit profit. Within these limits a monopolist has a considerable degree of latitude in determining which course to pursue in attempting to maximize profits. The trial judge thought that, if du Pont raised its price, the market would \"penalize\" it with smaller profits as well as lower sales.\n20\n Du Pont proved him wrong. When 1947 operating earnings dropped below 26% for the first time in 10 years, it increased cellophane's price 7% and boosted its earnings in 1948. Du Pont's division manager then reported that \"If an operative return of 31% is considered inadequate then an upward revision in prices will be necessary to improve the return.\"\n21\n It is this latitude with respect to price, this broad power of choice, that the antitrust \n\n[351 \nU.S. 377, 423]\n\u00a0\n laws forbid.\n22\n Du Pont's independent pricing policy and the great profits consistently yielded by that policy leave no room for doubt that it had power to control the price of cellophane. The findings of fact cited by the majority cannot affect this conclusion.\n23\n For they merely demonstrate that, during the period covered by the complaint, du Pont was a \"good monopolist,\" i. e., that it did not engage in predatory practices and that it chose to maximize profits by lowering price and expanding sales. Proof of enlightened exercise of monopoly power certainly does not refute the existence of that power.\n\n\nThe majority opinion purports to reject the theory of \"interindustry competition.\" Brick, steel, wood, cement and stone, it says, are \"too different\" to be placed in the same market. But cellophane, glassine, wax papers, sulphite papers, greaseproof and vegetable parchment papers, aluminum foil, cellulose acetate, Pliofilm and other films are not \"too different,\" the opinion concludes. The majority approach would apparently enable a monopolist of motion picture exhibition to avoid Sherman Act consequences by showing that motion pictures compete in substantial measure with legitimate theater, television, radio, sporting events and other forms of entertainment. Here, too, \"shifts of business\" undoubtedly accompany fluctuations in price and \"there are market alternatives that buyers may readily use for their purposes.\" Yet, in United States v. Paramount Pictures, \n334 \nU.S. 131\n, where the District Court had confined the relevant market to that for nationwide movie exhibition, this Court remanded the case to the District Court with directions to determine whether there was a monopoly on the part of the five major distributors \"in the first-run field for the entire \n\n[351 \nU.S. 377, 424]\n\u00a0\n country, in the first-run field in the 92 largest cities of the country, or in the first-run field in separate localities.\" \n334 \nU.S., at 172\n. Similarly, it is difficult to square the majority view with United States v. Aluminum Co. of America, 148 F.2d 416, a landmark 2 case. There Judge Learned Hand, reversing a district court, held that the close competition which \"secondary\" (used) aluminum offered to \"virgin\" aluminum did not justify including the former within the relevant market for measuring Alcoa's economic power. Against these and other precedents, which the Court's opinion approves but does not follow, the formula of \"reasonable interchangeability,\" as applied by the majority, appears indistinguishable from the theory of \"interindustry competition.\" The danger in it is that, as demonstrated in this case, it is \"perfectly compatible with a fully monopolized economy.\"\n24\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe majority hold in effect that, because cellophane meets competition for many end uses, those buyers for other uses who need or want only cellophane are not entitled to the benefits of competition within the cellophane industry. For example, Finding 282 shows that the largest single use of cellophane in 1951 was for wrapping cigarettes, and Finding 292 shows that 75 to 80% of all cigarettes are wrapped with cellophane. As the recent report of the Attorney General's National Committee to Study the Antitrust Laws states: \"In the interest of rivalry that extends to all buyers and all uses, competition among rivals within the industry is always important.\"\n25\n (Emphasis added.) Furthermore, those buyers who have \"reasonable alternatives\" between cellophane \n\n[351 \nU.S. 377, 425]\n\u00a0\n and other products are also entitled to competition within the cellophane industry, for such competition may lead to lower prices and improved quality.\n\n\nThe foregoing analysis of the record shows conclusively that cellophane is the relevant market. Since du Pont has the lion's share of that market, it must have monopoly power, as the majority concede.\n26\n This being so, we think it clear that, in the circumstances of this case, du Pont is guilty of \"monopolization.\" The briefest sketch of du Pont's business history precludes it from falling within the \"exception to the Sherman Act prohibitions of monopoly power\" (majority opinion, pp. 390-391) by successfully asserting that monopoly was \"thrust upon\" it. Du Pont was not \"the passive beneficiary of a monopoly\" within the meaning of United States v. Aluminum Co. of America, supra, at 429-430. It sought and maintained dominance through illegal agreements dividing the world market, concealing and suppressing technological information, and restricting its licensee's production by prohibitive royalties,\n27\n and through numerous maneuvers which might have been \"honestly industrial\" but whose necessary effect was nevertheless exclusionary.\n28\n Du Pont cannot bear \"the burden of \n\n[351 \nU.S. 377, 426]\n\u00a0\n proving that it owes its monopoly solely to superior skill. . . .\" (Emphasis supplied.) United States v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 110 F. Supp. 295, 342, aff'd per curiam, \n347 \nU.S. 521\n.\n\n\nNor can du Pont rely upon its moistureproof patents as a defense to the charge of monopolization. Once du Pont acquired the basic cellophane process as a result of its illegal 1923 agreements with La Cellophane, development of moistureproofing was relatively easy. Du Pont's moistureproof patents were fully subject to the exclusive pooling arrangements and territorial restrictions established by those agreements. And they were the subject of the illicit and exclusionary du Pont-Sylvania agreement. Hence, these patents became tainted as part and parcel of du Pont's illegal monopoly. Cf., Mercoid Corp. v. Mid-Continent Co., \n320 \nU.S. 661, 670\n. Any other result would permit one who monopolizes a market to escape the statutory liability by patenting a simple improvement on his product.\n\n\nIf competition is at the core of the Sherman Act, we cannot agree that it was consistent with that Act for the enormously lucrative cellophane industry to have no more than two sellers from 1924 to 1951. The conduct of du Pont and Sylvania illustrates that a few sellers tend to act like one and that an industry which does not have a competitive structure will not have competitive behavior. The public should not be left to rely upon the dispensations of management in order to obtain the benefits which normally accompany competition. Such beneficence is of uncertain tenure. Only actual competition can assure long-run enjoyment of the goals of a free economy.\n\n\nWe would reverse the decision below and remand the cause to the District Court with directions to determine the relief which should be granted against du Pont.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In Times-Picayune Publishing Co. v. United States, \n345 \nU.S. 594, 612\n, note 31, the Court said: \"For every product, substitutes exist. But a relevant market cannot meaningfully encompass that infinite range. The circle must be drawn narrowly to exclude any other product to which, within reasonable variations in price, only a limited number of buyers will turn; in technical terms, products whose `cross-elasticities of demand' are small.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See 118 F. Supp., at 64. The majority opinion quotes at length from Stocking and Mueller, The Cellophane Case, XLV Amer. Economic Rev. 29, 48-49, in noting the comparative characteristics of cellophane and other products. Unfortunately, the opinion fails to quote the conclusion reached by these economists. They state: \"The [trial] court to the contrary notwithstanding, the market in which cellophane meets the `competition' of other wrappers is narrower than the market for all flexible packaging materials.\" Id., at 52. And they conclude that \". . . cellophane is so differentiated from other flexible wrapping materials that its cross elasticity of demand gives du Pont significant and continuing monopoly power.\" Id., at 63.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The record provides no figures for waxed paper prior to 1933.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] See Stocking and Mueller, The Cellophane Case, XLV Amer. Economic Rev. 29, 56.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] R. 3549, GX-392. The record contains many reports prepared by du Pont from 1928 to 1947. They virtually ignore the possibility of competition from other packaging materials. E. g., R. 3651, 3678, 3724, 3739.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] R. 4070. It is interesting to note that du Pont had almost 70% of the market which this report considered relevant.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] See Finding 24; GX-1001, R. 3253; and GX-1002, R. 3257-3260. The agreement of June 9, 1923, in which the parties agreed to divide the world cellophane market, is illegal per se under Timken Roller Bearing Co. v. United States, \n341 \nU.S. 593, 596\n-599. The supplementary agreement providing for the interchange of technological information tightened the cellophane monopoly and denied to others any access to what went into the common pool - all in violation of United States v. National Lead Co., \n332 \nU.S. 319, 328\n. As was said in United States v. Griffith, \n334 \nU.S. 100, 107\n: \"The anti-trust laws are as much violated by the prevention of competition as by its destruction.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] See Finding 602; GX-1087, R. 3288; and GX-1109, R. 3301.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Finding 633. On appeal from an adverse decision by the Commissioner of Customs, du Pont persuaded the United States Customs Court to order reclassification of cellophane.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] The agreement is summarized in Finding 545 and appears in full in GX-2487, R. 3383-3408. We believe that under the principles set forth in Transparent-Wrap Machine Corp. v. Stokes & Smith Co., \n329 \nU.S. 637, 646\n, this agreement violated the Sherman Act.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] GX-2811, R. 6073-6074.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] R. 3563.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] When du Pont Cellophane was organized in 1923, du Pont received 52,000 shares of its stock in return for $866,666.67 in cash, or $16.67 per share. F. 22; DX-735, R. 5402. In 1929 du Pont had to surrender stock having a market value of $12,129,600 in order to obtain the 48,000 shares held by French interests, a sum equal to $252.70 per share.

Economic Rev. 29, 60-63, where the authors compare the domestic economic history of rayon with that of cellophane. The first American rayon producer earned 64.2% on its investment in 1920, thereby attracting du Pont. After a loss in 1921, du Pont's average return for the next four years was roughly 32%. As more firms began rayon production, du Pont's and the industry's return on investment began to drop. When 6 new firms entered the industry in 1930, bringing the number of producers to 20, average industry earnings for that year declined to 5% and du Pont suffered a net loss. \"From the beginning of the depression in 1929 through the succeeding recovery and the 1938 recession du Pont averaged 29.6 per cent before taxes on its cellophane investment. On its rayon investment it averaged only 6.3 per cent.\" Id., at 62-63.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] In 1924 two of La Cellophane's principal officials absconded with complete information on the cellophane process.

Instead the court relied upon the absence of criminality in the acts charged, and it was therefore logical for the trial court to deny acquittal and new trial.\n2\n The court thought persuasive our recent cases which held union efforts to secure \"made work\" for their members were not unfair labor practices.\n3\n From its view that extortion as defined in the Hobbs Act covers only the taking of property from another for the extortioner's personal advantage, the necessity to arrest the judgment followed. Rule 34, Fed. Rules Crim. Proc.\n\nWe do not agree with that interpretation of the section. The Hobbs Act was passed after this Court had construed 2 of the Federal Anti-Racketeering Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 979, in United States v. Local 807, \n315 \nU.S. 521\n. Subsection (a) of 2 barred, with respect to interstate commerce, exaction of valuable considerations by force, violence or coercion, \"not including, however, the payment \n\n[350 \nU.S. 415, 419]\n\u00a0\n of wages by a bona-fide employer to a bona-fide employee.\" We held in Local 807 that this exception covered members of a city truck drivers' union offering superfluous services to drive arriving trucks to their city destination with intent, if the truck owners refused their offer, to exact the wages by violence.\n4\n In the Hobbs Act, 60 Stat. 420, carried forward as 18 U.S.C. 1951, which amended the Anti-Racketeering Act, the exclusion clause involved in the Local 807 decision was dropped. The legislative history makes clear that the new Act was meant to eliminate any grounds for future judicial conclusions that Congress did not intend to cover the employer-employee relationship.\n5\n The words were defined to avoid any misunderstanding.\n\nTitle II of the Hobbs Act provides that the provisions of the Act shall not affect the Clayton Act, 6 and 20, \n\n[350 \nU.S. 415, 420]\n\u00a0\n 38 Stat. 731, 738; the Norris-LaGuardia Act, 47 Stat. 70; the Railway Labor Act, 44 Stat. 577; or the National Labor Relations Act, 49 Stat. 449.\n6\n There is nothing in any of those Acts, however, that indicates any protection for unions or their officials in attempts to get personal property through threats of force or violence. Those are not legitimate means for improving labor conditions.\n7\n If the trial court intended by its references to the Norris-LaGuardia and Wagner Acts to indicate any such labor exception, which we doubt, it was in error. Apparently what the court meant is more clearly expressed by its statement, set out in the last paragraph of note 2 above, that the charged acts would be criminal only if they were used to obtain property for the personal benefit of the union or its agent, in this case Green. This latter holding is also erroneous. The city truckers in the Local 807 case similarly were trying by force to get jobs and pay from the out-of-state truckers by threats and violence. The Hobbs Act was meant to stop just such conduct. And extortion as defined in the statute in no way depends upon having a direct benefit conferred on the person who obtains the property.\n\nIt is also stated in the opinion below that to interpret the Act as covering the activity charged would \"extend the jurisdiction of the Court, and the power of Congress beyond their Constitutional limits.\" 135 F. Supp., at 162. The same language is in the order. Since in our view the legislation is directed at the protection of interstate commerce against injury from extortion, the court's holding is clearly wrong. We said in the Local 807 case \n\n[350 \nU.S. 415, 421]\n\u00a0\n that racketeering affecting interstate commerce was within federal legislative control. \n315 \nU.S., at 536\n. Cf. Cleveland v. United States, \n329 \nU.S. 14, 19\n; Mitchell v. Vollmer & Co., \n349 \nU.S. 427\n.\n\nOn this appeal the record does not contain the evidence upon which the court acted. The indictment charges interference with commerce by extortion in the words of the Act's definition of that crime. We rule only on the allegations of the indictment and hold that the acts charged against appellees fall within the terms of the Act. The order in arrest of judgment is reversed and the cause remanded to the District Court.\n\n    It is so ordered.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"An appeal may be taken by and on behalf of the United States from the district courts direct to the Supreme Court of the United States in all criminal cases in the following instances:\n\n .   .   .   .  .\n\n\n\"From a decision arresting a judgment of conviction for insufficiency of the indictment or information, where such decision is based upon the invalidity or construction of the statute upon which the indictment or information is founded.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The opinion states:\n\n\"It is now contended that the Indictment does not state a cause of action within the meaning of the above section.

I am convinced that there is such an independent ground for the District Court's judgment in this case. It is evident from the district judge's memorandum opinion (135 F. Supp. 162) that his order granting the motions in arrest of judgment rested at least in part upon the insufficiency of the evidence to support the conviction. He considered facts not alleged in the indictment, e. g., that contractors in the community had customarily agreed to the employment of labor which allegedly was demanded by appellees, and that the trouble on the particular job was caused by a disagreement between the contractor and labor, not by an attempt to extort. I would therefore dismiss the Government's appeal. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 415, 422]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","99":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v. I. C. C.(1956)\nNo. 12\nArgued: October 11, 1956Decided: December 17, 1956\n\n\n\n\n Since May 1, 1951, railroads serving the port of Norfolk, Va., have refused to pay an allowance to the Army for the wharfage and handling services the Army performs for itself on military export traffic passing through Army base piers. In their tariffs the railroads assumed the obligation to furnish such services for all shippers that complied with the tariffs, and accordingly furnished the services for commercial shippers at public sections of the same piers without additional charge. Because the Army provides these services itself, it claimed a right to the $1.00 per ton paid by the railroads on behalf of commercial shippers. A complaint charging the railroads with violating the Interstate Commerce Act was dismissed by the Interstate Commerce Commission, and the United States sued to set aside the order. Held: In the circumstances of this case, the refusal of the railroads to make the allowance to the Army did not subject the Government to unjust discrimination and did not constitute an unreasonable practice in violation of the Interstate Commerce Act. Pp. 160-176.\n\n (a) The circumstances of Army shipments are markedly different from those of private shippers that received wharfage and handling services: and the Army was treated identically with those shippers who for business reasons did not care to comply with the tariff requirements. Pp. 168-169.\n\n\n (b) Although the Army hired the same private company as did the railroads to operate the Army portion of the base, the Army's control was \"absolute.\" Pp. 169-171.\n\n\n (c) The method of handling government freight did not comply with the tariff requirements. P. 172.\n\n\n (d) Any deviation from tariffs by carriers violates 6 (7) of the Interstate Commerce Act, unless they grant a concession to the United States under 22. P. 172.\n\n\n (e) The Government was being treated just as any shipper who decides not to take advantage of the services offered in the tariff and takes deliveries of export rate traffic at private piers under his own control. Pp. 172-173. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 158, 159]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n (f) That the Government took control of the piers to meet a national emergency cannot convert the Government's operation of its private piers into a category different from that of private shippers. P. 173.\n\n\n (g) The fact that the operations of the Government and the railroads are in the same pier area is immaterial. P. 174.\n\n\n (h) If the railroads gave an allowance in these circumstances, excepting one given as a concession to the Government under 22 of the Act, they would have to give it at all private piers where the shipper wanted to handle wharfage at its own discretion. P. 174.\n\n\n (i) The Government has the right to have its shipments accorded the same privileges given others; in emergencies its traffic may have \"preference or priority in transportation\"; and it may be granted and may accept preferences in rates; but it cannot otherwise require extra services or allowances.

Cox and Mr. Cousins for the Pennsylvania Railroad Co. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 158, 160]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis appeal requires a determination of whether railroads serving the port of Norfolk, Virginia, must grant the United States an allowance for the Government's performance of certain wharfage and handling services on its own export freight. For shippers who conform to the requirements of the tariff, the railroads assume these charges as a part of the rate. The United States, however, found it impractical to conform to the tariff requirements.\n\nThe present litigation was instituted pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2325 in a three-judge District Court of the District of Columbia by the United States, through its Department of the Army, against the Interstate Commerce Commission and the United States, to set aside the Commission's order in United States v. Aberdeen & Rockfish R. Co., 289 I. C. C. 49. That order dismissed a complaint filed by the United States on November 20, 1951, against several named railroads charging them with violations of the Interstate Commerce Act. The District Court, one judge dissenting, dismissed the complaint. 132 F. Supp. 34. We noted probable jurisdiction. \n350 \nU.S. 930\n.\n\nSince May 1, 1951, the railroads have refused to pay an allowance to the Army for the wharfage and handling\n1\n services the Army performs on military export traffic passing through Army base piers in Norfolk, Virginia. The railroads have assumed in their tariffs the obligation to \n\n[352 \nU.S. 158, 161]\n\u00a0\n furnish these accessorial services for all shippers that comply with their tariffs. And, in accordance with these tariffs, the railroads have furnished the services for commercial shippers at public sections of the same piers without additional charge. These services were performed for the Army and the railroads by the same private company - for the Army under contract to carry out its orders for terminal and storage services; for the railroads by contract to act as the carriers' agent in accordance with their tariffs.\n\nThe Army sought a determination that the railroads' refusal to make an allowance to it to the same extent that the railroads paid the private company, Stevenson & Young, for handling of private shipments subjected the Government to unjust discrimination and constituted an unreasonable practice in violation of 1, 2, 3, and 6 of the Interstate Commerce Act.\n2\n The Army also requested \n\n[352 \nU.S. 158, 162]\n\u00a0\n an order that the railroads cease and desist from such refusal in the future.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nThe transfer of export freight from rail carriers to outbound water carriers is made on piers or wharves that allow the unloading of freight from railroad cars to within reach of ships' tackle. Railroads are under no statutory obligation to furnish such piers or to unload carlot freight, Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Kittanning Co., \n253 \nU.S. 319, 323\n.\n4\n In general the railroads have taken on the duty of wharfage and handling for freight consigned for overseas shipment.\n5\n In some instances railroads have charged for the use of the piers (\"wharfage\") and the necessary \"handling\" separately from their charge for \n\n[352 \nU.S. 158, 163]\n\u00a0\n line-haul transportation. In other cases there has been only a single factor export rate (one inclusive charge) providing for limited shipside delivery with the railroad furnishing these accessorial services pursuant to their tariffs at no extra charge to the shipper. The latter practice has been generally followed by railroads serving North Atlantic ports. Where railroads do not have their own piers, they have provided these services by contracting with commercial terminal operators.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nThe Norfolk piers, involved in this matter, were managed by such operators. They were built by the United States after World War I and have been leased in part or in whole to a series of commercial operators since then. The leases were cancelled during World War II but they were leased to Stevenson & Young, a private terminal operator, at the end of that war. The railroads here involved, using the single factor shipside rate described above, contracted with Stevenson & Young, as their agent, to perform the wharfage and handling for 25 per ton for wharfage and 75 per ton for handling, on both commercial and military freight. But with the advent of the Korean hostilities, the Government again cancelled the leases and the Army took entire control of the piers. Apparently the military shipments require special handling and storage. To assure its complete satisfaction, the Army hired Stevenson & Young to perform those services under a general pier-operating contract for the Army.\n6\n\u00a0\n\n[352 \nU.S. 158, 164]\n\u00a0\n The unused portions of the piers were later released by the Government, by a contract dated December 28, 1951, for the commercial operations of Stevenson & Young. By that contract Stevenson & Young leased the unused parts for 1952 from the United States, for a public commercial maritime terminal. It was over these leased portions of the piers that the lessee carried on its public warehousing activities in accordance with the railroad tariffs.\n\nA typical tariff arrangement appears in the note below. It is the basic exhibit in this case.\n7\n It was bottomed on \n\n[352 \nU.S. 158, 165]\n\u00a0\n a contract of April 5, 1947, between the Pennsylvania Railroad and Stevenson & Young. By that contract Stevenson & Young, as a public wharfinger, agreed to act \"as directed by the Railroad\" and as its agent for wharfage and handling of \"export, import, coastwise and intercoastal freight\" in accordance with the tariff upon the facilities it acquired on the Army base. The agent assumed responsibility for freight charges and care of freight in its charge. It agreed, paragraph 4, that:\n\n \"The Terminal [Stevenson & Young] shall provide adequate facilities for the handling and storage of the freight subject to this agreement, shall provide access to the Railroad or its agent, the Norfolk and Portsmouth Belt Line Railroad, for the delivery of cars to and from shipside without interference or \n\n[352 \nU.S. 158, 166]\n\u00a0\n interruption, and shall load and unload cars promptly without delay of freight or railroad equipment.\"\n\n\n Paragraph 13 said:\n\n \"This agreement shall terminate absolutely and immediately whenever the Terminal ceases to operate the said facilities as a public wharfinger for the handling of freight, and in any event shall be terminable by either party on thirty days notice in writing.\"\n\n\n A large amount of private commercial traffic continued over the released portions of the piers, and the railroads continued to absorb the cost of that wharfage and handling by paying Stevenson & Young $1.00 per ton of freight.\n\nThe result of the Army's insistence on operating its own pier facilities is that the Army pays the same export rates without receiving wharfage and handling services as commercial shippers do for whom the railroads provide those services at no additional charge. Because the Army provides these services itself, it claims a right to the $1.00 per ton payment paid by the railroads on behalf of the commercial shippers.\n\nIn terms of the Interstate Commerce Act, the Government bases its argument on two grounds:\n\n\"The railroads' refusal to absorb wharfage and handling charges on Army freight to the same extent that they absorb such charges on civilian freight moving over the same piers under identical rates is unjustly discriminatory in violation of Section 2 of the Interstate Commerce Act.\"\n\n\n and\n\n\"The railroads' refusal to pay for wharfage and handling on Army freight was an unjust and unreasonable practice in violation of Section 1 (6) of the Act.\" \n\n[352 \nU.S. 158, 167]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n It should be noted that the United States is not attacking the form of the tariff, which provides for both line-haul service and the accessorial services in the single factor export rate.\n8\n Consequently, this case involves only charged discrimination and injustice. Cf. United States v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n337 \nU.S. 426, 437\n-438. In short, the United States seeks to be excepted from the tariff requirement that calls for the shipper to use a public wharfinger under contract to the railroads for performance of the wharfage and handling.\n9\n\u00a0\n\n[352 \nU.S. 158, 168]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThis controversy is similar to one that arose out of the Army's cancellation of the Norfolk pier leases during World War II, United States v. Aberdeen & Rockfish R. Co., 269 I. C. C. 141. Interpreting railroad practices much like those now before this Court, the I. C. C. determined that the Army was not being discriminated against. However, on review, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia remanded the case to the I. C. C. for further exposition and clarification. 91 U.S. App. D.C. 178, 198 F.2d 958. On remand the I. C. C. reaffirmed its earlier determination and no appeal has been taken from that order. 294 I. C. C. 203. Because the question of whether the Army was discriminated against following the Government's World War II lease cancellation has never been finally passed upon, the District of Columbia ruling is not inconsistent with the Commission's conclusion in this litigation.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nThe Government asserts that it is charged more on its export shipments through the Norfolk Army Base than commercial shippers under substantially similar circumstances. Such an exaction would be, of course, an unjust and unreasonable practice of discrimination. But it seems apparent that the circumstances of Army shipments are markedly different from those of private shippers that receive wharfage and handling services. Moreover, it seems equally clear that the Army is treated identically with those shippers who for business reasons do not care to comply with the tariff requirements.\n\nThe Army routed its export shipments direct to itself at the Army base as consignee. As is shown by the contracts summarized above, the entire Army base property was under military control except for the commercial \n\n[352 \nU.S. 158, 169]\n\u00a0\n operations of Stevenson & Young. The base included piers, bulkheads, railways and storage warehouses, and railroad switches, tracks and yards. The Commission found that the Army had determined \"that ports of embarkation must be operated by personnel of the military service and civilian employees of the Government.\" 289 I. C. C., at 53.\n10\n\u00a0\n\nAlthough the Army hired the Stevenson company to operate the Army portion of the base, the Army's control was \"absolute.\"\n\n \"[An Army yardmaster] is on duty at all times to give instructions for disposition of cars of Army freight delivered at the base. When either the Belt Line or the Virginian has cars for delivery, the yard clerk at the base is notified by telephone. If placement at a pier or warehouse is ready for any of those cars, the carrier is told where to make delivery. These instructions are confirmed in writing and handed to the conductor when he arrives at the base. Cars for which placement orders are not ready are left in the pier No. 1 yard by the Belt Line and in the \n\n[352 \nU.S. 158, 170]\n\u00a0\n uptown yard by the Virginian, in accordance with a general understanding as to the disposition of such cars.\" 289 I. C. C., at 54-55.\n\n\n Such direction was necessary. As the Commanding Officer said, in regard to switching and placing by the carriers:\n\n \"The Witness: If you would let them switch themselves, they have to know what they are doing, we have to give them the switch list and know what to do with it.\n\n\n  .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \"Q. Will you permit them to do it at their own convenience, in an orderly manner?\n\n\n \"A. I don't know how any business can be run, if you run it at the convenience of someone else. They couldn't possibly do it at their own convenience, unless their convenience coincided with our requirement.\n\n\n  .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \"Q. And yet you couldn't permit the terminal operator to in a normal way.\n\n\n \"A. No, because that involves a management problem. You would have to have a management team in here to settle the accounts of the terminal operator. They don't work for nothing, as you quite well know. Somebody has to monitor all that, manage the whole thing, and direct the bringing in of the cargo. That is all in over-lay staff of ours, which is large enough.\"\n\n\n This Army control over the movement of freight on those portions of the piers that were not leased to Stevenson & Young left the railroads serving the base without authority in those areas to direct the switching, spotting \n\n[352 \nU.S. 158, 171]\n\u00a0\n and removal of the cars according to their own convenience. 289 I. C. C., at 64.\n\nThe fact that the Army controls its areas of the base, and the fact that the railroads handle their own wharfage and switching on their portions as they choose, are not mere formal differences. They are factors in traffic movement.\n\n \"It is the right of every shipper including the Government as here concerned, to prohibit a carrier from performing switching upon private tracks, even though the carrier might be willing and able to perform the service. When so prohibited by the shipper, as was here done by the Army, the carrier's obligation to perform the service is discharged, and the payment of allowances to the shipper for its performance of the service, in whole or in part, would be unlawful, except as a voluntary concession of the carriers to the Government under section 22.\" 289 I. C. C., at 65.\n\n\n The problems of the assumption by the carriers of the costs of wharfage and handling at ports have a long history. The Norfolk area has not been an exception, as has been heretofore indicated. See p. 168, supra. When the Government again in 1951 found it desirable to cancel the leases, it was familiar with the various facets of the controversy over wharfage and handling.\n11\n\u00a0\n\n[352 \nU.S. 158, 172]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nIt is obvious that the method of handling government freight does not comply with the tariff requirements. It does not move over wharf properties owned, leased and operated by the Stevenson company \"as a public terminal facility of the rail carriers.\" Rule 47 (b), n. 7, supra.\n\n\"At all times during that period, military traffic was stored on and handled over wharf and other properties on the Army Base which were under the exclusive control of the Army.\" 289 I. C. C., at 60.\n\n\n Any deviation from tariffs by carriers violates 6 (7) of the Act, 49 U.S.C., unless they grant a concession under 22.\n12\n\u00a0\n\n\nIV.\n\n\n\nThe Government actually is being treated just as any shipper who decides not to take advantage of the services offered in the tariff. It seeks a preference over these other shippers who take deliveries of export rate traffic at piers under their own control, so-called private piers. The general practice at North Atlantic ports is to refuse to absorb handling charges at private piers, even though they are absorbed where the carriers have control of the facilities. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 158, 173]\n\u00a0\n The record shows 84 private piers along the Atlantic Coast where the railroads make no allowance or compensation for handling or wharfage. It was testified:\n\n\"One of the principal limitations on the port practices which I shall mention is the restriction of the loading practice to railroad or other public piers, as distinguished from private piers operated by shippers.\"\n\n\n There was no evidence to the contrary and the Commission accepted that situation as a fact. 289 I. C. C., at 58, 61, 63. The difference between a public and a private pier under the tariffs is whether the railroads have control of the areas directly or through their agents, or whether the shipper or consignee has control.\n\nThere is no objection to such a practice generally, whether the line-haul rates and the handling rates are stated in a single factor rate or separately. To require the carriers to furnish such accessorial services at every private pier would disperse the traffic, cause the maintenance of more crews or watchmen, and thus add to the cost of transportation.\n\nThe Government contends that it is not in the same position as other shippers who control private piers, because it took control of the Norfolk piers to meet a national emergency. But we think that the emergency cannot convert the Government's operation of its private piers into a category different from that of private shippers.\n13\n\u00a0\n\n[352 \nU.S. 158, 174]\n\u00a0\n And, the fact that the operations of the Government and the railroads are in the same pier area seems to us immaterial. If the railroads gave an allowance here, excepting one given under 22 of the Act, they would have to give it at all private piers where the shipper wanted to handle wharfage at its own discretion. Cf. Merchants Warehouse Co. v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 501\n; Weyerhaeuser Timber Co. v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 229 I. C. C. 463.\n\nThe Government has the right to have its shipments accorded the same privileges given others. Moreover, in emergencies its traffic may have \"preference or priority in transportation,\" 49 U.S.C. 1 (15) (d), and it may be granted and may accept preferences in rates.\n14\n But the Government cannot otherwise require extra services or allowances. In the situation here presented, it could have used the same facilities as commercial shippers and obtained the benefits of the tariff. The evidence to this effect is uncontradicted.\n15\n The Commission accepted it as a fact. 289 I. C. C., at 58, 60-61, 63. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 158, 175]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nV.\n\n\n\nThe Commission drew from the above circumstances a conclusion that the tariffs and conduct of the railroads are not shown to have been unlawful.\n\nThe United States argues that carriers cannot perform accessorial services in such a way that \"some shippers would pay an identical line-haul rate for less service than that required by other industrial plants.\" United States v. United States Smelting Co., \n339 \nU.S. 186, 197\n. To do so would indeed violate 2 of the Interstate Commerce Act.\n16\n But the Smelting case is not apposite. We affirmed a Commission order enjoining intra-plant car switching and spotting services after termination of the line haul. It terminated at a \"convenient point\" on a siding at consignee's plant. Our decision there turned on and upheld the Commission's power to determine the end point of the line haul. Because the line-haul tariffs included only car movement to and from that convenient point, some shippers received more service than others for the line-haul rate. P. 197.\n17\n Thus our determination was based on the unlawful preference allowed some shippers by the tariffs since those discriminated against could not get the same service as other shippers.\n\nFurthermore, whether the circumstances and conditions are sufficiently dissimilar to justify differences in rates \n\n[352 \nU.S. 158, 176]\n\u00a0\n or charges is a question of fact for the Commission's determination.\n18\n\u00a0\n\nThe District Court dismissed the complaint on the record before the Commission, and we affirm.\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE BRENNAN took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"Wharfage refers to the provision of space on the docks for storage of freight pending transfer between freight cars and cargo vessels; handling refers to the unloading of goods from freight cars and placing them on the docks within reach of ship's tackle . . . .\" United States v.

Aberdeen & Rockfish R. Co., 289 I. C. C., at 61. It seems clear that such an attack could be made if present conditions justified a re-examination. The War Department attacked the practice in 1921 but its objection was overruled by the I. C. C. in 1929 after a thorough investigation in a 6-5 vote. Wharfage Charges at Atlantic and Gulf Ports, 157 I. C. C. 663, 678-686. Separation was sought largely to force the railroads to increase terminal charges so that competitive municipal and other nonrailroad wharfingers might expand to develop better port facilities. The Commission reached the conclusion that such separation was inadvisable, as there was no evidence of injury from such practice.\n\n\"The carriers afford port facilities in competition with each other at the ports and a competitive condition exists which can not be eliminated by the mere segregation of uniform port charges. If the port charges were uniform at all ports the carriers still could meet competition by shrinking their line-haul rates. If the port charges were different at each port the carriers having the larger charge could shrink their line-haul rates sufficiently to offset the larger port charge, and the real substance of the present ship-side rates, where they exist, would be reestablished.\" Id., at 684.\n\n\n It was the sensitivity of the foreign importers and domestic ports to rates so stated that led to this conclusion. In the highly competitive railway network, export traffic is an important factor to the carriers and the ports. Costs of port handling vary widely, 157 I. C. C., at 673. Such variations are now absorbed in the practice of quoting shipside delivery in tariffs.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Such an exception is beyond the requirements of 6 (8) of the Act that provides for preference and precedence for United States shipments in emergencies.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] This conclusion was amply supported by testimony of a Government witness, the Commanding Officer, Hampton Roads, Port of Embarkation:\n\n\"Only such personnel has the requisite training in the intricate nomenclature pertaining to the items and to the documentation required in connection with the proper loading and dispatching of vessels.\n\n\n\"A vast amount of pre-stowage planning of vessels in a port of embarkation must precede the labor of actual loading. Precise knowledge of overseas requirements must be available. Therefore, controls required to be exercised of all shipments must be absolute. These begin when freight is ordered shipped from points of origin and continue until the various commodities reach their final destination overseas.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] The Government's request for export rates on its war shipments was granted by the railroads so that commercial and government export freight had the same rates. Cf. War Materials Reparation Cases, 294 I. C. C. 5. This was a substantial concession by the railroads, contrary to their tariffs, and done only because of 22 of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C., allowing concessions to the United States. 289 I. C. C., at 63. The railroads have also spotted cars for the Army after delivery in the storage yards without \n\n[352 \nU.S. 158, 172]\n\u00a0\n extra charge. Other shippers would be charged for such service. 289 I. C. C., at 55. See United States v. American Tin Plate Co., \n301 \nU.S. 402\n. Such relaxation of possible additional charges by the railroads does not decide the Army's claim for allowances for handling. The Commission did take the concessions into consideration, however, as to the fairness of the refusal to grant the claimed allowances. 289 I. C. C., at 64.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] Although the Government seeks only an allowance of the published charge absorbed by the carriers of $1.00 per ton, the kind of service it requires in its area is illustrated by the fact that it pays $2.87 for handling. 289 I. C. C., at 61 et seq.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] The Army's reliance on Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co. v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 199\n, is misplaced. There this Court sustained the Commission in granting a shipper of fruit the right to precool the car and contents, although the carriers were in a position to refrigerate, though not in the better way. As the carriers were not in a position to perform the service properly, they could not by a tariff deny the consignor such right.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] \"Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the . . . handling of property free or at reduced rates for the United States . . . .\" 49 U.S.C. 22.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] \"If it were not for the fact that the Government has reasons for handling its water-borne traffic differently from commercial shippers, there would be no reason why the Government should not use public piers like other shippers. There is no question but that a private shipper operating his own pier and handling his own traffic in a manner similar to the operation of the Norfolk Army Base today would not be entitled to the port rates.\"\n\n289 I. C. C., at 63: \"Evidence presented by the defendants supports their position that it is not unreasonable to refuse to extend wharfage and handling services to traffic handled over private piers when the shipper does not wish to use adequate facilities of the defendants.

Hence its conclusion that in view of all the relevant facts and circumstances a rate or practice either is or is not unjustly discriminatory within the meaning of 2 of the Act will not be disturbed here unless we can say that its finding is unsupported by evidence or without rational basis, or rests on an erroneous construction of the statute.\"\n\n\n For the same reasons, in Baltimore & Ohio R.

American Tin Plate Co., \n301 \nU.S. 402, 407\n-408, dealing with post-line-haul switching practices, this Court has upheld the Commission's determination of unfairness vis-a-vis other shippers and its prohibitory orders. See Seaboard Air Line R. Co. v. United States, \n254 \nU.S. 57\n; Merchants Warehouse Co. v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 501\n; United States v. Wabash R. Co., \n321 \nU.S. 403, 410\n.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE concurs, dissenting.\n\nFrom the very beginning the Interstate Commerce Act has made it unlawful for railroads to discriminate by charging some shippers more than others for carrying the same kind of freight the same distance. The provisions of the Act make it clear that the ban on such discrimination cannot be evaded by any contrivance or guise that \n\n[352 \nU.S. 158, 177]\n\u00a0\n accomplishes the prohibited end. In the present case the undisputed evidence, as well as the Interstate Commerce Commission's findings, convinces me beyond doubt that the railroads are subjecting the United States, as a shipper, to precisely the kind of discrimination which the Act prohibits. When the mass of verbiage which has befogged this case is stripped away, the issues are not complex and no expert guidance is needed for their proper resolution.\n\nThe Government owns several piers at Norfolk, Virginia which are connected by tracks with the main lines of certain major railroads. Storage space is provided on the piers for freight. For many years the piers were leased to a private terminal operator. This operator has a contract with the railroads hauling to the piers to perform handling and wharfage services with respect to their freight. The railroads pay the operator $1 per ton for these services. They do not charge shippers separately for this handling and wharfage but instead include the cost with the transportation charges in a single line-haul rate.\n\nShipments by the United States through the piers were handled exactly the same as any other shipment. The operator, acting under contract with the railroads, performed the necessary unloading and storage; the railroads paid it $1 per ton for these services; and the Government paid the railroads the single rate covering both transportation and pier services. The Government was not required to pay anything in addition to this single rate.\n\nIn 1951, however, with the outbreak of the Korean conflict, the Government found it necessary to operate directly certain portions of the piers in order to facilitate the shipment of military supplies. The Government hired the same operator who was acting for the railroads to perform the same services in handling government shipments as he had before. The sole difference was that the operator acted under contract with the Government and \n\n[352 \nU.S. 158, 178]\n\u00a0\n was paid by it rather than by the railroads. The railroads continued to charge the same line-haul rate as before, however, on government shipments. The Government requested that the railroads continue to pay the $1 per ton for handling and wharfage of its shipments. The railroads refused. The net result is that the Government receives less services from the railroads than other shippers although it pays the same rate. Or stated in a more familiar manner it is compelled to pay more than other shippers for the same transportation even though they all ship the same kind of freight from the same points to the same pier.\n\nNothing in the record below or in the arguments presented to us justifies this plain discrimination. There is no finding, nor even any indication, that it costs the railroads one penny more to transport freight to the portions of the pier operated by the Government than to the immediately adjacent parts of the pier operated by their agent. And the mere fact that a discriminatory rate is embedded in a tariff does not make it legal.\n\nIt is claimed that the railroads can establish a general rule that they will not pay for wharfage and handling costs at private piers. This is undoubtedly true, but it does not follow that they can include within the line-haul rate charges for handling services at such piers that the railroads do not perform. Under any realistic appraisal, the railroads' costs for handling and wharfage services in the present situation are included as a part of their line-haul rate and are in no sense a \"free service.\" The Government is compelled to pay this rate to get its goods transported. But, as the Interstate Commerce Commission expressly found, wartime conditions make it wholly impractical for the Government in shipping certain military goods to use the wharfage and handling services provided by the railroads under this rate. The Government is entitled to recover that portion of the \"line-haul\" \n\n[352 \nU.S. 158, 179]\n\u00a0\n rate which it is charged for services that it cannot use. That is all it claims. There is no reason why the railroads should be allowed to operate in a manner that exacts a transportation charge from all shippers for benefits that some can enjoy and others, although in exactly the same situation, cannot. As this Court said in Union Pacific R. Co. v. Updike Grain Co., \n222 \nU.S. 215, 220\n, \"A rule apparently fair on its face and reasonable in its terms may, in fact, be unfair and unreasonable if it operates so as to give one an advantage of which another similarly situated cannot avail himself.\"\n\nI would reverse the judgment below. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 158, 180]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","100":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v. LESLIE SALT CO.(1956)\nNo. 74\nArgued: December 7, 1955Decided: March 5, 1956\n\n\n\n\n In 1949, a corporation in need of funds to meet maturing bank loans and for working capital borrowed $3,000,000 from one insurance company and $1,000,000 from another for 15 years, giving each a single typewritten instrument entitled \"3 1\/4% Sinking Fund Promissory Note Due February 1, 1964.\" Each not was subject to the terms of an underlying agreement containing elaborate provision for the protection of the note holders and a provision under which each insurance company could require the borrower to convert its note into a series of new notes in denominations of $1,000 or multiples thereof, \"either in registered form without coupons or in coupon form, and in printed or in fully engraved form.\" This option had not been exercised by either note holder. Held: These two notes are not subject to the documentary stamp taxes laid under 1800 and 1801 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 on \"all bonds, debentures, or certificates of indebtedness issued by any corporation . . . .\" Pp. 384-398.\n\n (a) It is significant that the stamp tax which was levied on \"promissory notes\" for many years, but which has been repealed, was always carried in a separate section from that containing the tax on \"bonds, debentures, or certificates of indebtedness\" and was always at a lower rate than the tax on the latter instruments. P. 388.\n\n\n (b) That these notes are for large amounts and of long maturity and are secured by an elaborate underlying agreement does not prevent them from being promissory notes, nor does anything in the earlier legislation or its history indicate that this type of note would not have been taxable at the lower rate provided in the promissory-note section of the former statute. P. 389.\n\n\n (c) Even if these notes could not fairly be called \"promissory notes,\" it does not follow that they must be regarded as \"debentures\" or \"certificates of indebtedness.\" P. 389.\n\n\n (d) The administrative history of the statute establishes that, until 1947, when General Motors Acceptance Corp. v. Higgins, 161 F.2d 593, was decided, the Treasury considered no instruments \n\n[350 \nU.S. 383, 384]\n\u00a0\n subject to the \"debenture\" tax except those which were issued (1) in series, (2) under trust indentures, and (3) in registered form or with coupons attached. Pp. 389-393.\n\n\n (e) Since 1920, the Treasury has considered \"certificates of indebtedness\" as akin to bonds and debentures and as including \"only instruments having the general character of investment securities,\" which these notes do not have. Pp. 393-395.\n\n\n (f) The stamp taxes on \"debentures\" and \"certificates of indebtedness\" are based upon the character of the instruments employed, not upon the nature of the transactions involved; and an instrument which is neither a \"debenture\" nor a \"certificate of indebtedness\" does not become such merely because it evidences a longterm debt obligation supported by elaborate protective covenants. Pp. 395-396.\n\n\n (g) In view of the Treasury's prior long-standing and consistent administrative interpretation of the terms \"debentures\" and \"certificates of indebtedness\" and the fact that Congress has let that administrative interpretation remain undisturbed for many years, the Treasury's present ad hoc contention that those terms should now be construed as including the notes here involved cannot stand. Pp. 396-397.\n\n\n (h) The fact that the agreement underlying these notes provides for the substitution of instruments which might qualify as \"debentures\" does not render these notes taxable as \"debentures.\" P. 398.\n\n\n 218 F.2d 91, affirmed.\n\nJohn F. Davis argued the cause for the United States. With him on the brief were Solicitor General Sobeloff, Assistant Attorney General Holland, Ellis N. Slack, A. F. Prescott and Fred E. Youngman.\n\nBruce M. Casey, Jr. argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief was Walter C. Fox, Jr.\n\nChester Rohrlich filed a brief for Rayonier Incorporated, as amicus curiae, urging affirmance.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nOn February 1, 1949, Leslie Salt Company, being in need of funds to meet maturing bank loans and for working \n\n[350 \nU.S. 383, 385]\n\u00a0\n capital, borrowed $3,000,000 from the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York and $1,000,000 from the Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Company. As evidence of the indebtedness Leslie Salt delivered to each insurance company its \"3 1\/4% Sinking Fund Promissory Note Due February 1, 1964\" in these amounts. The question presented is whether these instruments are subject to the documentary stamp taxes laid on \"all bonds, debentures, or certificates of indebtedness issued by any corporation . . . .\" under 1800 and 1801 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nThe Commissioner of Internal Revenue held the tax applicable, considering the two instruments to be \"debentures\" within the meaning of 1801. However, in a tax recovery suit instituted by Leslie Salt, following payment of the tax under protest and the Commissioner's denial of a refund, the District Court\n2\n and the Court of Appeals\n3\n held the instruments not to be \"debentures\" or otherwise subject to stamp taxes. We brought the case here, \n349 \nU.S. 951\n, to resolve the uncertainty left by lower court \n\n[350 \nU.S. 383, 386]\n\u00a0\n decisions as to whether 1801 applies to corporate notes of this type.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nExcept as to amounts and payees, the two instruments in question were in identical terms, having these principal features: (1) each instrument carried the promissory note description already indicated; (2) each had a maturity of 15 years; (3) each carried interest of 3 1\/4% payable August 1 and February 1 of each year on the unpaid balance; and (4) each was subject to the terms of an underlying agreement containing elaborate provisions for the protection of the note holders. Among those provisions was one under which each insurance company could require \n\n[350 \nU.S. 383, 387]\n\u00a0\n Leslie Salt to convert its note, which was typewritten on ordinary white paper, into a series of new notes in denominations of $1,000 or multiples thereof, \"either in registered form without coupons or in coupon form, and in printed or in fully engraved form.\"\n5\n This option has not been exercised by either note holder.\n\nThese transactions with the two insurance companies constituted a variety of \"private placement,\" a method of corporate financing which, because of its economies and conveniences, has become popular since the enactment of the Securities Act of 1933. The Government claims that these notes are taxable under 1801 either as \"debentures\" or \"certificates of indebtedness.\" The taxpayer, on the other hand, contends that these terms, undefined in the statute, do not include notes of the type \n\n[350 \nU.S. 383, 388]\n\u00a0\n here in issue. Taking the statute in light of its legislative and administrative history, we agree with the taxpayer's contention.\n\n\"Debentures\" and \"certificates of indebtedness,\" along with other kinds of corporate securities, have been subject to stamp taxes since 1898, except for the period between 1902 and 1914.\n6\n \"Promissory notes\" were also subject to stamp duties from 1898 to 1901 and from 1914 until 1924, when the tax was repealed;\n7\n it has never been re-enacted. The tax on \"promissory notes,\" however, was always carried in a section separate from that containing the tax on \"bonds, debentures, or certificates of indebtedness,\" and was always at a rate lower than the tax on those instruments. Since promissory notes, debentures, and certificates of indebtedness all serve the same basic purpose - that is, as evidence of a debt - this former legislative distinction between promissory notes and the other instruments assumes significance in determining whether the present notes are taxable. For unless the earlier statutes were intended to impose two taxes on the same instruments, which we should not assume, or the present tax on debentures and certificates of indebtedness is broader in scope than that in effect in 1924, of which there is no indication, it would seem to follow that these notes should not now be taxed if they can be said to fall within the class of \"promissory notes\" on which the tax was repealed. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 383, 389]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n The Government argues that the repealed promissory note provision related only to ordinary short-term paper customarily used in day-to-day commercial transactions, and that it did not embrace notes, like those here involved, of large amounts, long maturity, and secured by an elaborate underlying agreement. See General Motors Acceptance Corp. v. Higgins, 161 F.2d 593, 595. The existence of these features, however, does not render either of the Leslie Salt instruments any the less a promissory note, as each was captioned. Nor do we find anything in the earlier legislation or in its history which satisfies us that this type of note would not have been taxable at the lower rate provided in the promissory note section of the former statute. See Niles-Bement-Pond Co. v. Fitzpatrick, 213 F.2d 305, 308-310. Moreover, the administrative interpretations of the Treasury, discussed below, affirmatively indicate that they would have been considered taxable under that section.\n\nBut even assuming that these notes could not fairly be called \"promissory notes,\" it does not follow that they must therefore be regarded as \"debentures\" or \"certificates of indebtedness.\" That depends upon the meaning of those terms in the statute, and upon whether these notes, regardless of their descriptive caption, have the essential characteristics of \"debentures\" or \"certificates of indebtedness,\" as those terms are used in the statute. General Motors Acceptance Corp. v. Higgins, supra; Niles-Bement-Pond Co. v. Fitzpatrick, supra. And in determining the scope of the statute, which has remained substantially unchanged since its first enactment, the Treasury's interpretations of it are entitled to great weight. White v. Winchester Club, \n315 \nU.S. 32, 41\n.\n\nThe administrative history of the statute establishes that until 1947, when the General Motors case, supra, was decided, only those instruments were considered subject to the \"debenture\" tax which were issued (1) in series, \n\n[350 \nU.S. 383, 390]\n\u00a0\n (2) under a trust indenture, and (3) in registered form or with coupons attached. In other words, that tax was considered to apply only to marketable corporate securities, as that term is generally understood. Conversely, corporate promissory notes lacking any of those features, such as those issued by respondent, were taxed at the lower promissory note rate until that tax was repealed in 1924, and were not taxed thereafter until the Government's success in the General Motors case in 1947.\n\nAs early as 1918 the Treasury, in distinguishing instruments taxable at the \"bond\" and \"debenture\" rate from those taxable at the lower \"promissory note\" rate, then still in force, drew the line as follows:\n\n \"(3) Instruments containing the essential features of a promissory note, but issued by corporations in numbers under a trust indenture, either in registered form or with coupons attached, embodying provisions for acceleration of maturity in the event of any default by the obligor, for optional registration in the case of bearer bonds, for authentication by the trustee, and sometimes for redemption before maturity, or similar provisions, are bonds within the meaning of the statute, whether called bonds, debentures, or notes. However, a short-term instrument, although issued by a corporation under a trust indenture, may be regarded as a note if every instrument of such issue both (a) is payable to bearer and incapable of registration and (b) lacks interest coupons and so requires presentation upon each payment of interest.\" T. D. 2713, May 14, 1918, 20 Treas. Dec. Int. Rev. 358 (1918).\n8\n\u00a0\n\n[350 \nU.S. 383, 391]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n When Congress in 1918 amended the existing statute by adding the language \"and all instruments, however termed, issued by any corporation with interest coupons or in registered form, known generally as corporate securities . . .,\" still found in 1801, the Treasury recognized that this was in effect an enactment of its prior restrictive interpretation.\n9\n The regulations which followed the repeal in 1924 of the tax on promissory notes did not purport to enlarge the scope of the tax on \"bonds\" or \"debentures\"; the Treasury adhered to the same interpretation issued under the previous statute.\n10\n The regulations \n\n[350 \nU.S. 383, 392]\n\u00a0\n were amended in 1941 to the less specific, but not inconsistent, form under which the present notes were taxed.\n11\n Finally, explicit recognition that the attempt to tax notes not having the features of marketable corporate \n\n[350 \nU.S. 383, 393]\n\u00a0\n securities was a departure from prior Treasury practice is found in a ruling by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue that General Motors would not be applied retroactively:\n\n \"The Bureau has for a considerable period of time held that an instrument termed `note,' not in registered form and issued without interest coupons, is not subject to the stamp tax upon issuance or transfer. Because of this long and uniform holding of the Bureau and the consequent reliance of corporations on these rulings, it has been concluded that, under the authority contained in section 3791 (b) of the Internal Revenue Code, the decision in General Motors Acceptance Corporation v. Higgins, supra, will not be applied retroactively, except that any tax which has been paid on the issuance or transfer of instruments falling within the scope of the decision will not be refunded.\" Cum. Bull. 1948-2, M. T. 32, p. 160.\n\n\n The term \"certificate of indebtedness\" has a similar administrative background. Since 1920 the Treasury has considered certificates of indebtedness as akin to bonds and debentures, including \"only instruments having the general character of investment securities, as distinguished from instruments evidencing debts arising in ordinary transaction between individuals . . . .\" Sales Tax Rulings, L. O. 909, December 1920, ST. 1-20-85; Regs. 55 (Art. 14), October 26, 1920, 22 T. D. Int. Rev. 502 (1920).\n12\n The essence of an \"investment security\" \n\n[350 \nU.S. 383, 394]\n\u00a0\n is, of course, marketability, and this basic feature the Leslie Salt notes did not have. The Treasury itself has acknowledged that promissory notes lacking this quality have never been taxed as \"certificates of indebtedness,\" \n\n[350 \nU.S. 383, 395]\n\u00a0\n Cum. Bull. 1948-2, M. T. 32, p. 160 (supra, p. 393), and none of the lower court cases, including General Motors, supra, have regarded instruments such as the Leslie Salt notes as being certificates of indebtedness. Moreover, it may be observed that in the stamp tax sections of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 the words \"certificates of indebtedness,\" consistently with this administrative history, have been eliminated as a separate taxable category of corporate instruments, and are employed simply as a term of art embracing all the instruments taxed, that is, \"bonds,\" \"debentures\" and other instruments in registered form or with coupons. Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 4311, 4381, 68A Stat. 514, 523, 26 U.S.C. 4311, 4381.\n\nIn contrast to the position it had consistently taken throughout the many years preceding the decision in the General Motors case, the Treasury now argues \"that Congress intended in Section 1801 to cover all long-term debt obligations supported by elaborate protective covenants and that this is so regardless of the details of the papers used, the language by which the transaction was consummated or the nature of the purchaser's business.\" This contention seems to stem from the belief that had the \"private placement\" method of financing been as widely known in 1924 as it is now, Congress would not have repealed the promissory note tax in its entirety, as it did. But if that be so it is nevertheless for Congress, not the courts, to change the statute. We must deal with the statute as we find it, and if these instruments are neither \n\n[350 \nU.S. 383, 396]\n\u00a0\n \"debentures\" nor \"certificates of indebtedness\" they may not be taxed under the present statute. These taxes are based not upon the nature of the transaction involved, but upon the character of the instruments employed. As long ago as 1873, this Court said: \"The liability of an instrument to a stamp duty, as well as the amount of such duty, is determined by the form and face of the instrument, and cannot be affected by proof of facts outside of the instrument itself.\" United States v. Isham, 17 Wall. 496, 504.\n\nThere are persuasive reasons for construing \"debentures\" and \"certificates of indebtedness\" in accordance with the Treasury's original interpretation of those terms in this statute's altogether comparable predecessors. In Norwegian Nitrogen Prod. Co. v. United States, \n288 \nU.S. 294, 315\n, Mr. Justice Cardozo said:\n\n\"administrative practice, consistent and generally unchallenged, will not be overturned except for very cogent reasons if the scope of the command is indefinite and doubtful. United States v. Moore, \n95 \nU.S. 760, 763\n; Logan v. Davis, \n233 \nU.S. 613, 627\n; Brewster v. Gage, \n280 \nU.S. 327, 336\n; Fawcus Machine Co. v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 375\n; Interstate Commerce Commn. v. N. Y., N. H. & H. R. Co., \n287 \nU.S. 178\n. The practice has peculiar weight when it involves a contemporaneous construction of a statute by the men charged with the responsibility of setting its machinery in motion, of making the parts work efficiently and smoothly while they are yet untried and new.\"\n\n\n Against the Treasury's prior longstanding and consistent administrative interpretation its more recent ad hoc contention as to how the statute should be construed cannot stand. Moreover, that original interpretation has had both express and implied congressional acquiescence, \n\n[350 \nU.S. 383, 397]\n\u00a0\n through the 1918 amendment to the statute (supra, p. 391), which has ever since continued in effect, and through Congress having let the administrative interpretation remain undisturbed for so many years. See Corn Products Refining Co. v. Commissioner, \n350 \nU.S. 46, 53\n; Norwegian Nitrogen Prod. Co. v. United States, supra, at p. 313.\n13\n Still further, it is an interpretation which is in accord with the generally understood meaning of the term \"debentures.\" Cf. First Nat. Bank v. Flershem, \n290 \nU.S. 504, 508\n.\n14\n \"The words of the statute [a stamp tax statute] are to be taken in the sense in which they will be understood by that public in which they are to take effect.\" United States v. Isham, supra, at p. 504. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 383, 398]\n\u00a0\n\n\nConstruing the statute as we have, we conclude that the Leslie Salt notes are neither \"debentures\" nor \"certificates of indebtedness\" within its meaning. The fact that the agreement underlying these notes provides for the substitution of instruments which might qualify as debentures does not render these notes taxable, for until debentures are in existence the \"debenture\" tax cannot be imposed.\n\nWe hold these notes are not subject to stamp taxes under the statute.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] SEC. 1800. \"There shall be levied, collected, and paid, for and in respect of the several bonds, debentures, or certificates of stock and of indebtedness, and other documents, instruments, matters, and things mentioned and described in sections 1801 to 1807, inclusive, or for or in respect of the vellum, parchment, or paper upon which such instruments, matters, or things, or any of them, are written or printed, the several taxes specified in such sections.\" 53 Stat. 195, 26 U.S.C. 1800.\n\nSEC. 1801. \"On all bonds, debentures, or certificates of indebtedness issued by any corporation, and all instruments, however termed, issued by any corporation with interest coupons or in registered form known generally as corporate securities, on each $100 of face value or fraction thereof, 11 cents: Provided, That every renewal of the foregoing shall be taxed as a new issue . . . .\" 53 Stat. 195-196, 26 U.S.C. 1801.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 110 F.

(2) Representations by Leslie Salt that financial statements and lists of property holdings submitted by it were complete and accurate. (3) Various conditions precedent to the purchase of the notes, including: opinion by counsel that the transaction was authorized under the applicable state law; that the balance of the $4,000,000 loan was subscribed; and that the loan documents would be in form satisfactory to counsel. (4) A representation by the lender that it was not acquiring the note for the purpose of sale. (5) A provision for prepayment by Leslie Salt of $285,000 principal amount for each year, without premium, and of an additional $285,000 annually at the option of Leslie Salt, also without premium, as long as the prepayment came from earnings or liquidation of assets. Leslie Salt had the right to make further prepayments, but subject to a premium of 3%, which after the first three years of the note descended in amount at the rate of 1\/4% each year. (6) Leslie Salt promised to pay all its taxes, keep its property in repair, keep accurate records, insure its properties, and make regular financial statements to the holders of the notes. (7) Leslie Salt promised not to become indebted, not to pay dividends or retire stock, except as provided in the agreement, and not to change the nature of its business or let its working capital decline beneath a specified amount.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Act of June 13, 1898, 30 Stat. 448, 451, 458; Act of March 2, 1901, 31 Stat. 938, 940, 942; repealed by the Act of April 12, 1902, 32 Stat. 96, 97; re-enacted in the Act of October 22, 1914, 38 Stat. 745, 753, 759, and carried forward in subsequent Revenue Acts.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Act of June 13, 1898, 30 Stat. 448, 451, 459; repealed by the Act of March 2, 1901, 31 Stat. 942; re-enacted in the Act of October 22, 1914, 38 Stat. 745, 753, 760; carried over in the Revenue Acts of 1917, 1918, and 1921, 40 Stat. 300, 319, 323; 40 Stat. 1057, 1133, 1137; 42 Stat. 227, 301, 305, and repealed by the Revenue Act of 1924, 43 Stat. 253, 352.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] In this same Treasury Decision \"promissory note\" was defined as \"An instrument not under seal containing a simple promise to pay a sum of money at a specified time, such as is common in everyday commercial use, is a promissory note within the meaning of the \n\n[350 \nU.S. 383, 391]\n\u00a0\n statute.\" It should be noted that the qualification which we have italicized was omitted from the definition of \"promissory note\" in the Regulations promulgated one year later. See note 10, infra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] The then Solicitor of Internal Revenue, Mr. Robert N. Miller, expressed this view:\n\n\"The words `all instruments, however termed, issued by any corporation with interest coupons or in registered form, known generally as corporate securities,' were clearly added in recognition of the varied forms in which corporate securities are issued, and to defeat any attempt by a corporation to avoid the tax by issuing instruments of the general character of bonds, debentures, or certificates of indebtedness under a different name.\" Sales Tax Rulings, L. O. 909, December 1920, ST. 1-20-85.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] \"ART. 8. Instruments issued in numbers, under a trust indenture, are bonds. - Instruments containing the essential features of a promissory note, but issued in series, secured by a trust indenture, either in registered form or with coupons attached, embodying provisions for acceleration of maturity in the event of any default by the obligor, for optional registration in the case of bearer bonds, for authentication by the trustee, and in some instances for redemption before maturity, or similar provisions, are bonds within the meaning of the statute, whether called bonds, debentures, or notes.\" Treasury Regulations 55, September 13, 1924.\n\nThe regulations preceding the repeal of the tax on promissory notes provided:\n\n\"ART. 8.

Section 1801 imposes a tax upon the issue by any corporation of bonds, debentures, certificates of indebtedness, and all instruments, however termed, with interest coupons or in registered form and known generally as corporate securities. Every renewal of the above described instruments is taxable as a new issue.\"\n\nSEC. 113.55. \"Issues subject to tax. Ordinarily, a corporate instrument styled a bond, debenture, or certificate of indebtedness is subject to the tax. However, the taxability of an instrument is not determined by the name alone but depends upon all the circumstances, such as the name, form, and terms of the instrument, etc. Hence, an instrument, however designated, having all the essential characteristics of a bond, debenture, or certificate of indebtedness is taxable as such. Similarly, an instrument issued with interest coupons, or with provision for registration, and coming within the class known generally as corporate securities will be held subject to the tax regardless of the name by which it may be called.\" 26 CFR, 1944 Cum. Supp., 113.50, 113.55.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] The ruling by the Solicitor of Internal Revenue said:\n\n\"The Century Dictionary defines `debenture' as `A writing acknowledging a debt; specifically, an instrument, generally under seal, for the repayment of money lent; usually, if not exclusively, used as obligations of corporations or large moneyed copartnerships, issued in a form convenient to be bought and sold as investments.' This \n\n[350 \nU.S. 383, 394]\n\u00a0\n definition was adopted by the court in Barton Nat. Bank v. Atkins, 72 Vt. 55; 47 Atl. 176, 180. The term `certificates of indebtedness' has also come to have in commercial use a similar meaning. In Denver v. Home Savings Bank, \n236 \nU.S. 101, 105\n, the court said:\n\n\n\"`What is true about bonds is true about certificates of indebtedness. Indeed it is difficult to see any distinction between them as they are commonly known to the business world. The essence of each is that they contain a promise under seal of the corporation to pay a certain sum to order or bearer.'\n\n\n\"If the term `certificates of indebtedness' standing by itself be susceptible of a broader meaning than that given to it above, its association here with bonds and debentures excludes such broader meaning. The maxim noscitur a sociis applies.\n\n\n\"A consideration of Title XI as a whole supports the conclusion above arrived at. Three classes of paper issued by individuals, partnerships, and corporations are subject thereunder to stamp tax: Bonds of indebtedness (subdivision 1), certificates of stock (subdivision 3), and drafts or checks and promissory notes (subdivision 6); i. e., instruments possessing to a greater or less extent the attributes of commercial paper.\n\n\n\"The premises lead inevitably to the conclusion that it was not the intention of Congress to tax under subdivision 1 of the said Schedule A every evidence of indebtedness other than those included under the heads of shares or certificates of stock, promissory notes, or bills of exchange, but only those evidences of indebtedness which have the general character of investment securities and which may properly be included under the term `bonds of indebtedness.' The definition of `certificate of indebtedness' as `primarily any instrument acknowledging liability for the payment of money, not in the recognized form of a promissory note or bill of exchange,' contained in T. D. 2713, is too inclusive and does not sufficiently delimit the instruments included in the term.\n\n\n\"It is therefore held that the term `certificate of indebtedness' as used in subdivision 1 of Schedule A, Title XI, Revenue Act of 1918, includes only instruments having the general character of investment \n\n[350 \nU.S. 383, 395]\n\u00a0\n securities, as distinguished from instruments evidencing debts arising in ordinary transaction between individuals; and that conditional bills of sale are not certificates of indebtedness.\n\n\n\"T. D. 2713 should be modified to conform with this holding.\n\n     \"ROBERT N. MILLER,     \"Solicitor of Internal Revenue.\"\n\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] It should be said that the administrative practice, which we consider as crucial here, was not brought to the attention of the Court of Appeals in Niles-Bement-Pond Co. v. Fitzpatrick, supra. Nor do General Motors Acceptance Corp. v. Higgins, supra, or any of the cases cited in note 4, supra, advert to that practice.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] As long ago as 1916, no less an authority on corporate finance than the late Mr. F. L. Stetson described debentures in the following terms:\n\n\"In the United States, as already mentioned, the term `debenture' is understood to mean serial obligations of a corporation not secured by a specific mortgage, pledge or assignment of property. Of course a series of debentures may be issued without the execution of any indenture relating thereto. Prior to 1900 the few issues that had been made of such debentures were not accompanied by a trust agreement. In such case the rights and privileges given to bondholders were set forth at length in the obligation, thus making a somewhat lengthy instrument. Since an issue of debentures under trust agreements by the Lake Shore R. R. Co. and by the New York Central, the custom of adopting such agreements has become general. Originally in 1893 the General Electric Company made a large issue of debentures without an agreement, but at the time of the refunding in 1912 a trust agreement was executed.\" \"Preparation of Corporate Bonds, Mortgages, Collateral Trusts and Debenture Indentures,\" in Some Legal Phases of Corporate Financing, Reorganization and Regulation, p. 66 (Assn. of the Bar of the City of New York, 1917). \n\n[350 \nU.S. 383, 399]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","101":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v. McKESSON & ROBBINS(1956)\nNo. 448\nArgued: April 30, 1956Decided: June 11, 1956\n\n\n\n\n Appellee is the largest drug wholesaler in the United States and sells to retailers in many states. It also manufactures its own line of brand-name drugs, which it sells to retailers and to independent wholesalers in many states. It refused to sell its brand products to independent wholesalers which had not entered into agreements that, in wholesaling appellee's products, they would adhere to the wholesale prices fixed by appellee. As a result, many independent wholesalers which were in direct competition with appellee's wholesaling operations signed such agreements. Held: Such price-fixing agreements were not exempted from the prohibitions of 1 of the Sherman Act by the \"fair-trade\" provisions of the Miller-Tydings Act or the McGuire Act. Pp. 306-316.\n\n (a) Such price-fixing agreements are illegal per se under 1 of the Sherman Act, unless they are within the exemptions of the Miller-Tydings Act or the McGuire Act. Pp. 308-311.\n\n\n (b) The exemptions of the Miller-Tydings Act and the McGuire Act are expressly made inapplicable to agreements \"between wholesalers\" or \"between persons, firms, or corporations in competition with each other,\" and these words must be taken in their normal and customary meaning. Pp. 311-312.\n\n\n (c) Appellee is admittedly a \"wholesaler\" with resale price maintenance contracts with many other \"wholesalers\" who are in competition with it, and it cannot be brought within the exemptions of the Miller-Tydings Act or the McGuire Act by resort to a fiction that it acts only as a manufacturer when it concludes such agreements with competing wholesalers. P. 312.\n\n\n (d) Even if appellee were not properly considered a \"wholesaler,\" it would not be within the exemptions of the Miller-Tydings Act or the McGuire Act, because the price-fixing agreements here involved are \"between persons, firms, or corporations in competition with each other\" within the meaning of those Acts. Pp. 312-313.\n\n\n (e) This restrictive language is unambiguous, and a different result is not required by the legislative history of the McGuire Act. Pp. 313-315. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 305, 306]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n (f) These limitations must be construed strictly, since resale price maintenance is a privilege restrictive of a free economy.

Operating through 74 wholesale divisions located in 35 States, it sells drugstore merchandise of various brands to retailers, principally drugstores, substantially throughout the nation. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 1954, its sales of all drug products amounted to $338,000,000.\n\nAppellee is also a manufacturer of its own line of drug products, the total sales of which amounted to $11,000,000 for the year ended March 31, 1954. Its manufacturing operation is conducted through a single manufacturing division, McKesson Laboratories, located at Bridgeport, Connecticut. This division, like each of appellee's wholesale divisions, has a separate headquarters and a separate staff of employees, but none of the 75 divisions is \n\n[351 \nU.S. 305, 307]\n\u00a0\n separately incorporated. All are component parts of the same corporation and are responsible to the corporation's president and board of directors.\n\nAppellee distributes its own brand products to retailers through two channels: (1) directly to retailers, and (2) through independent wholesalers. The major portion of its brand products is distributed to retailers through its own wholesale divisions. Appellee also makes direct sales to important retailers through its manufacturing division. Most of appellee's sales to independent wholesalers are made by its manufacturing division, but its wholesale divisions sold approximately $200,000 of McKesson brand products to other wholesalers during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1952.\n\nTo the extent possible under state law, appellee requires all retailers of its brand products to sell them at \"fair trade\" retail prices fixed by appellee. These prices are set forth in published schedules of wholesale and retail prices.\n\nAppellee also has \"fair trade\" agreements with 21 independent wholesalers who buy from its manufacturing division. Sixteen of these independents compete with appellee's wholesale divisions. The other 5 compete with the manufacturing division for sales to chain drugstores located in their trading areas. On June 6, 1951, in accordance with appellee's \"fair trade\" policy, a vice president in charge of merchandising notified appellee's wholesale divisions that -\n\n\"None of our wholesale divisions will sell any McKesson labeled products to any wholesaler who has not entered into a fair trade contract with McKesson Laboratories.\"\n\n\n As a result, 73 of the independent wholesalers who had been dealing with McKesson wholesale divisions entered \n\n[351 \nU.S. 305, 308]\n\u00a0\n into \"fair trade\" agreements with McKesson by which they bound themselves in reselling its brand products to adhere to the wholesale prices fixed by it. Each of these independent wholesalers is in direct competition with the McKesson wholesale division from which it buys.\n\nThe Government, under Section 4 of the Sherman Act,\n1\n brought this civil action for injunctive relief against appellee in the District Court. The complaint charged that appellee's \"fair trade\" agreements with independent wholesalers with whom it was in competition constituted illegal price fixing in violation of Section 1 of the Act. Appellee admitted the contracts, but claimed that they were exempted from the Sherman Act by the Miller-Tydings Act\n2\n and the McGuire Act.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nThe Government moved for summary judgment on the ground that these Acts do not immunize McKesson's agreements with other wholesalers, since they expressly exclude from their exemption from the antitrust laws contracts \"between wholesalers\" or \"between persons, firms, or corporations in competition with each other.\" The district judge denied the motion.\n4\n He recognized that price fixing is illegal per se under the Sherman Act, but announced that in \"fair trade\" cases \"No inflexible standard should be laid down to govern in advance.\" He was \"unwilling, at this stage of case law development of legislatively sanctioned resale price fixing\" to apply the per se rule \"in fair trade situations absent a factual showing of illegality.\" Such a showing, he said, could not be made \"simply by pointing to some restraint of competition.\" The \"true test of legality\" of \"fair trade\" agreements between a producer-wholesaler and independent \n\n[351 \nU.S. 305, 309]\n\u00a0\n wholesalers, the court held, \"is whether some additional restraint destructive of competition is occasioned.\"\n5\n\u00a0\n\nThe case then proceeded to trial before another district judge, who concurred in the \"ruling that fair trade price fixing by a producer-wholesaler was not per se illegal under the Sherman Act,\" and held that the Government's evidence did not establish an \"additional restraint\" within the meaning of the test previously enunciated in the case.\n6\n He ordered the complaint dismissed, and the Government took a direct appeal under the Expediting Act. We noted probable jurisdiction.\n7\n\u00a0\n\nThe issue presented is a narrow one of statutory interpretation. The Government does not question the so-called vertical \"fair trade\" agreements between McKesson and retailers of McKesson brand products. It challenges only appellee's price-fixing agreements with independent wholesalers with whom it is in competition.\n\nSection 1 of the Sherman Act provides:\n\n \"Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to be illegal. . . .\"\n8\n\u00a0\n\n\n It has been held too often to require elaboration now that price fixing is contrary to the policy of competition underlying the Sherman Act and that its illegality does \n\n[351 \nU.S. 305, 310]\n\u00a0\n not depend on a showing of its unreasonableness, since it is conclusively presumed to be unreasonable.\n9\n It makes no difference whether the motives of the participants are good or evil; whether the price fixing is accomplished by express contract or by some more subtle means; whether the participants possess market control; whether the amount of interstate commerce affected is large or small; or whether the effect of the agreement is to raise or to decrease prices.\n10\n\u00a0\n\nIn United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., \n310 \nU.S. 150\n, in holding price-fixing agreements to be illegal per se, this Court said:\n\n\"Congress has not left with us the determination of whether or not particular price-fixing schemes are wise or unwise, healthy or destructive. . . . the Sherman Act, so far as price-fixing agreements are concerned, establishes one uniform rule applicable to all industries alike.\"\n11\n\u00a0\n\n\n And it has been said by this Court:\n\n\"A distributor of a trade-marked article may not lawfully limit by agreement, express or implied, the price at which or the persons to whom its purchaser may resell, except as the seller moves along the route which is marked by the Miller-Tydings Act.\"\n12\n\u00a0\n\n\n The question before us is whether the price-fixing agreements challenged herein move along that route. If they do not, they are illegal per se. There is no basis for supposing that Congress, in enacting the Miller-Tydings and McGuire Acts, intended any change in the traditional \n\n[351 \nU.S. 305, 311]\n\u00a0\n per se doctrine. The District Court was plainly in error in attempting to create a category of agreements which are outside the exemption of those Acts but which should nevertheless be spared from application of the per se rule.\n\nIn the Miller-Tydings Act, passed as a rider to a District of Columbia revenue bill, Congress was careful to state that its exemption of certain resale price maintenance contracts from the prohibitions of the antitrust laws \"shall not make lawful any contract or agreement, providing for the establishment or maintenance of minimum resale prices on any commodity herein involved, between manufacturers, or between producers, or between wholesalers, or between brokers, or between factors, or between retailers, or between persons, firms, or corporations in competition with each other.\"\n13\n (Emphasis supplied.)\n\nFifteen years later, Congress attached an almost identical proviso to the McGuire Act.\n14\n We are to take the \n\n[351 \nU.S. 305, 312]\n\u00a0\n words of these statutes \"in their normal and customary meaning.\" Schwegmann Bros. v. Calvert Corp., \n341 \nU.S. 384, 388\n.\n\nAppellee is admittedly a wholesaler with resale price maintenance contracts with 94 other wholesalers who are in competition with it. Thus, even if we read the proviso so that the words \"in competition with each other\" modify \"between wholesalers,\" the agreements in question would seem clearly to be outside the statutory exemption. Appellee concedes that the proviso does not exempt a contract between two competing independent wholesalers fixing the price of a brand product produced by neither of them.\n15\n Yet it urges that what would be illegal if done between competing independent wholesalers becomes legal if done between an independent wholesaler and a competing wholesaler who is also the manufacturer of the brand product. This is so, appellee maintains, because in contracting with independent wholesalers it acted solely as a manufacturer selling to buyers rather than as a competitor of these buyers. But the statutes provide no basis for sanctioning the fiction of McKesson, the country's largest drug wholesaler, acting only as a manufacturer when it concludes \"fair trade\" agreements with competing wholesalers. These were agreements \"between wholesalers.\"\n\nAny doubts which might otherwise be raised as to the propriety of considering a manufacturer-wholesaler as a \n\n[351 \nU.S. 305, 313]\n\u00a0\n \"wholesaler\" are dispelled by the last phrase of the proviso in question, which continues the proscription against price-fixing agreements \"between persons, firms, or corporations in competition with each other.\" Congress thus made as plain as words can make it that, without regard to categories or labels, the crucial inquiry is whether the contracting parties compete with each other. If they do, the Miller-Tydings and McGuire Acts do not permit them to fix resale prices. The Court stated in Schwegmann Bros. v. Calvert Corp., \n341 \nU.S. 384, 389\n, that this proviso \"expressly continues the prohibitions of the Sherman Act against `horizontal' price fixing by those in competition with each other at the same functional level.\"\n16\n Since appellee competes \"at the same functional level\" with each of the 94 wholesalers with whom it has price-fixing agreements, the proviso prevents these agreements from falling within the statutory exemption.\n\nAppellee argues that a brief colloquy on the Senate floor between a supporter of the McGuire Act and an inquiring Senator shortly before the Act was passed should dictate a meaning contrary to that revealed by the Act's plain language. But, at best, the statement was inconclusive.\n17\n And the Senator whose statement is relied on was not in charge of the bill, nor was he a member of \n\n[351 \nU.S. 305, 314]\n\u00a0\n any committee that had considered it. Moreover, the McGuire Act was not a Senate bill, having been passed by the House of Representatives prior to this Senate discussion. There is nothing in the proceedings of the \n\n[351 \nU.S. 305, 315]\n\u00a0\n House to indicate that the meaning for which appellee contends should be given to the Act. Similarly, except to show congressional concern that the prohibition against \"horizontal\" price fixing be continued, the Senate and House debates on the proviso in the Miller-Tydings Act are of little assistance with respect to the problem before us.\n\nThe court below did not rely on the legislative history, finding it to be \"unedifying and unilluminating.\"\n18\n We agree with this appraisal, but are not troubled by it since the language of the proviso in question is unambiguous.\n19\n It excludes from the exemption from the per se rule of illegality resale price maintenance contracts between firms competing on the same functional level.\n\nBoth the Government and appellee press upon us economic arguments which could reasonably have caused Congress to support their respective positions.\n20\n We need \n\n[351 \nU.S. 305, 316]\n\u00a0\n not concern ourselves with such speculation. Congress has marked the limitations beyond which price fixing cannot go. We are not only bound by those limitations but we are bound to construe them strictly, since resale price maintenance is a privilege restrictive of a free economy. Cf. United States v. Masonite Corp., \n316 \nU.S. 265, 280\n.\n\nThe judgment of the District Court dismissing the complaint must, therefore, be reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n    Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 26 Stat. 209.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 50 Stat. 693.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] 66 Stat. 632.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] 122 F.

The district judge provided an illustration of the kind of conduct which might satisfy his test: \"If, for example, it could be established that a producer became a wholesaler, though not in competition with an independent wholesaler, and stipulated prices for his own and the independent wholesaler as a first step toward and with intent to gouge consumers, that might suffice prima facie as violation of the Sherman Act outside the privilege of the fair trade statutes.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] R. 180.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] \n350 \nU.S. 922\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] 26 Stat. 209.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] E. g., United States v.

This proviso qualified the proviso immediately preceding it, which amended 1 of the Sherman Act so as to make lawful resale price maintenance contracts entered into by manufacturers of branded or trade-marked goods if such contracts are authorized by state law as to intrastate transactions and if the commodity affected is in \"free and open competition with commodities of the same general class produced or distributed by others . . . .\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] 66 Stat. 632. The McGuire Act amended 5 (a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act by adding, inter alia, 5 (a) (2). This specifically exempts from the antitrust laws price fixing under \"fair trade\" agreements which bind not only retailers who are parties to the agreement but also retailers who refuse to sign the agreement. As in the Miller-Tydings Act, the statutory exemption was qualified by an important proviso. This stated: \"(5) Nothing contained in paragraph (2) of this subsection shall make lawful contracts or agreements providing for the establishment or maintenance of minimum or stipulated resale prices on any commodity referred to in paragraph (2) of this subsection, between manufacturers, or between producers, or between wholesalers, or \n\n[351 \nU.S. 305, 312]\n\u00a0\n between brokers, or between factors, or between retailers, or between persons, firms, or corporations in competition with each other.\" (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] Appellee's brief, p. 6. In the District Court and in its motion to affirm filed in this Court, however, appellee claimed that the proviso applies only to agreements \"between manufacturers of competing products, or between wholesalers of competing products, or retailers of such products, fixing the prices at which two or more competitive products are to be sold.\" (Appellee's emphasis.) Motion to affirm, pp. 5-6.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] Previous phrases of the proviso appear in state \"fair trade\" laws, upon which the proviso seems to have been modeled. FTC Report on \"Resale Price Maintenance,\" pp. 80-81 (1945). The last phrase, however, has apparently never been included in any state statute. Thus, meticulous inclusion of this phrase in the federal acts is not without significance.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] 98 Cong. Rec. 8870. Senator Humphrey, in answer to an inquiry by Senator Sparkman, said: \". . . If, for example, when a producer, who sells to distributors, wholesalers, retailers, and consumers, makes a resale price-maintenance agreement relative to a commodity made by him and bearing a trade-mark or brand, with a distributor, wholesaler, or retailer who resells such commodity at either the wholesale, or retail level, there \n\n[351 \nU.S. 305, 314]\n\u00a0\n exists a vertical resale price-maintenance contract which would be lawful under the bill if the requirements of paragraph (2) are met. \"On the other hand, if one wholesaler enters into a resale price-maintenance agreement with another wholesaler prescribing the price at which they both sell a trade-marked or branded commodity which they both buy from the producer, that agreement would be horizontal and would not be made lawful. \"In other words, wholesalers getting together on a price are acting illegally. For a manufacturer to get together with other manufacturers to maintain prices is illegal, but for a manufacturer to say that a certain product will sell at a certain price from the manufacturer down to the retailer is legal under the limitations prescribed in paragraph (2) of section 5 (a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act. \"In general, the test of whether a resale price-maintenance contract is vertical is if the contract is between a seller and buyers who resell the original seller's product; whereas, the test of whether a resale price-maintenance contract is horizontal as if it is between competing sellers between whom the relation of buyer and seller or reseller does not exist as to the product involved. \"It is important to keep this distinction in mind, because many producers of trade-marked items sell them to consumers, retailers, and wholesalers alike. \"Under the bill, such firms may make resale price-maintenance contracts with both wholesalers and retailers because such contracts are vertical, that is, between sellers and buyers. While in one sense firms in this position function not only as producers but also as wholesalers and retailers, they may still lawfully make contracts with other wholesalers and retailers, when in making such contracts they act as producers of a trade-marked or branded commodity, rather than as wholesalers and retailers entering into forbidden horizontal resale price-maintenance contracts with other wholesalers or other retailers.\" (Emphasis added.) It should be noted that these remarks appear to be confined to the \"between wholesalers\" and \"between retailers\" phrases and do not deal with the \"corporations in competition\" phrase. And, even as to the former, it is not at all clear that Senator Humphrey was discussing the situation where actual competition exists between the \n\n[351 \nU.S. 305, 315]\n\u00a0\n manufacturer-wholesaler and independent wholesalers. As indicated in note 15, supra, until we noted probable jurisdiction, appellee flatly disagreed with an important part of this statement.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] 122 F. Supp., at 336.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 19\n] Cf. Greenwood v. United States, \n350 \nU.S. 366, 374\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 20\n] The Government maintains that a resale price maintenance agreement between a manufacturer-wholesaler and competing independent wholesalers, in addition to eliminating competition between the parties, enables the former, because of its leverage as a manufacturer of branded products, to dictate the latter's prices on these products. Such an agreement, the Government claims, also leaves the manufacturer-wholesaler free to undersell the independent wholesalers when dealing with large retailers directly through its manufacturing division. And if the manufacturer's own wholesale outlets are inefficient, resale price maintenance permits it to insulate those outlets from the inroads of more efficient operators by setting its \"fair trade\" price higher than otherwise. According to the Government, none of these effects is present where price fixing exists between independent wholesalers and a nonintegrated manufacturer. Appellee contends that the economic effects of \"fair trading\" are the same whether or not the manufacturer has its own wholesale outlets, \n\n[351 \nU.S. 305, 316]\n\u00a0\n since the protection which resale price maintenance provides to the manufacturer's good will \"necessarily involves elimination of price competition among different outlets for the manufacturer's own branded merchandise.\" In both situations, appellee claims, the manufacturer makes \"at the source, as a manufacturer, . . . downstream price fixing arrangements with its outlets.\" The court below indicated an awareness of the economic arguments on both sides but refused to follow \"either of alternate horns . . . in the dilemma of fair trade agreements with independent wholesalers by a manufacturer who is also a wholesaler . . . .\" 122 F. Supp., at 337. Instead, the district judge advocated a case-by-case examination of the economic setting in which the question arises, with the burden on the Government to show \"some additional restraint destructive of competition.\" 122 F. Supp., at 339. For discussion of these economic contentions and the conclusions which they are designed to support, see Weston, Resale Price Maintenance and Market Integration: Fair Trade or Foul Play? 22 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 658; Note, 64 Yale L. J. 426; 54 Col. L. Rev. 282.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, whom MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER and MR. JUSTICE BURTON join, dissenting.\n\nLack of sympathy with an Act of Congress does not justify giving to it a construction that cannot be rationalized in terms of any policy reasonably attributable to Congress. Rather our duty, as always, is to seek out the policy underlying the Act and, if possible, give effect \n\n[351 \nU.S. 305, 317]\n\u00a0\n to it. In this instance, I think the Court has departed from that rule by giving the Miller-Tydings and McGuire Acts an artificial construction which produces results that could hardly have been intended by Congress.\n\nThe purpose of the state fair-trade laws is to allow the manufacturer of a brand-named product to protect the goodwill his name enjoys by controlling the prices at which his branded products are resold. Old Dearborn Distributing Co. v. Seagram-Distillers Corp., \n299 \nU.S. 183, 193\n-194. The necessary result - indeed, the very object - is to permit the elimination of price competition in the branded product among those who sell it. Congress has sanctioned those laws in the Miller-Tydings and McGuire Acts, considering them not to be offensive to federal antitrust policy.\n1\n Sufficient protection to the public interest was deemed to be afforded by the competition among different brands, a safeguard made express by the provision of the Miller-Tydings and McGuire Acts denying fair-trade contracts exemption from the antitrust laws unless the fair-traded product is \"in free and open competition with commodities of the same general class.\" In short, the very purpose of the Acts is to permit a manufacturer to set the resale price for his own products while preserving competition between brands - that is, between the fair-traded item and similar items produced by other manufacturers.\n\nIf we accept the legislative judgment implicit in the Acts that resale price maintenance is necessary and desirable to protect the goodwill attached to a brand name, \n\n[351 \nU.S. 305, 318]\n\u00a0\n there is no meaningful distinction between the fair-trade contracts of integrated and non-integrated manufacturers. Certainly the integrated manufacturer has as strong a claim to protection of his goodwill as a non-integrated manufacturer, and the economic effect of the contracts is the same. In both cases price competition in the resale of the branded product is eliminated, and in neither case does the price fixing extend beyond the manufacturer's own product. While the Government concedes the right of a non-integrated manufacturer to eliminate price competition in his products between wholesalers, it finds a vice not contemplated by the Acts when one of the \"wholesalers\" is also the manufacturer, for then the contracts eliminate competition between the very parties to the contracts. But, in either case, all price competition is eliminated, and I am unable to see what difference it makes between whom the eliminated competition would have existed had it not been eliminated. The other bases of distinction suggested by the Government are equally tenuous and reflect a subtlety of analysis for which there is no support in either the Acts or their history.\n\nSo unsatisfactory, indeed, are the Government's attempts to rationalize the result contended for, that the Court chooses not to rely upon them, finding the language of the provisos so clear as to make it unnecessary even to hypothesize a consistent rationale attributable to Congress that might justify the discrimination against integrated producers. Indeed, not even the fact that the only legislative history directly in point is squarely opposed to the Court's reading of the statute (see note 17 of the Court's opinion, pp. 313-315) prompts enough doubt in the Court to require an inquiry into the purpose of the Acts. The Court's reasoning is this: the provisos except from the Acts contracts \"between wholesalers\" or \"between persons, firms, or corporations in competition with each other\"; McKesson is a \"wholesaler\" \n\n[351 \nU.S. 305, 319]\n\u00a0\n as well as a manufacturer and is also \"in competition with\" independent wholesalers; its contracts with independent wholesalers are therefore forbidden contracts \"between wholesalers\" and between \"corporations in competition with each other.\" This verbalistic argument can be answered by the equally verbalistic one that the fair-trade contracts, being made in connection with the sale of its own branded products, were made by McKesson in its capacity as a \"manufacturer\" rather than as a competing \"wholesaler.\" Neither argument being more conclusive than the other, the answer to the problem can be found only by looking to the purpose of the provisos and its relation to the basic policy of permitting resale price maintenance of branded goods.\n\nAs noted above, the Acts necessarily contemplate the elimination of price competition in the resale of a particular branded product and rely for protection of the public interest upon competition between brands. Viewed in the light of this purpose, the provisos become readily understandable. The vice of price-fixing agreements between those in competition with each other, whether at the manufacturing, wholesaling, or retailing level, is that they can be utilized to eliminate competition between brands. Thus manufacturers might agree to fix the resale prices of their competing brands in relation to each other; the same result, on an even broader scale, could be achieved by agreements between wholesalers or retailers. Further, agreements initiated by anyone other than the owner of the brand name are unnecessary to the protection of goodwill, the very justification for permitting fair-trade contracts. Thus an agreement between wholesalers to fix the price of a product bearing the trade name of neither would serve no purpose other than the elimination of competition. Interpreting the provisos in the light of these considerations, I conclude that an integrated manufacturer selling \n\n[351 \nU.S. 305, 320]\n\u00a0\n its products under fair-trade contracts to independent wholesalers should be deemed to be acting as a \"manufacturer\" rather than as a \"wholesaler.\" This interpretation of the provisos fits with their terms and produces, rather than an arbitrary discrimination hardly intended by Congress, a result fully in harmony with the policy of the Acts to permit manufacturers to maintain the resale prices of their branded products while preserving competition between brands.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nFor these reasons, therefore, I would hold McKesson's contracts to be within the Miller-Tydings and McGuire Acts and would affirm the judgment below.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Court refers to the Miller-Tydings Act as having been \"passed as a rider to a District of Columbia revenue bill.\" It is pertinent to note that, in passing the later McGuire Act, Congress not only reaffirmed the policy of the Miller-Tydings Act but also eliminated the restrictive effect of this Court's decision in Schwegmann Bros. v. Calvert Distillers Corp., \n341 \nU.S. 384\n, as regards \"non-signers\" of fair-trade contracts.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The Federal Trade Commission, the administrative agency specially charged with administering the McGuire Act, has reached like conclusions.

When respondent thereafter failed to obey the subpoena, the District Court, on application of the District Director, ordered respondent to appear before the Service and testify. He disregarded this order. After a hearing he was adjudged in contempt for so doing and fined $500. The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed, holding that while the power to subpoena under 235 (a) was available for investigations directed toward denaturalization proceedings, respondent as a putative defendant in such a proceeding was not a \"witness\" within the meaning of the section, and the Service was, therefore, without power to subpoena him.\n4\n 217 F.2d 350.\n\nIn No. 47, each petitioner was served with a subpoena issued by the officer in charge of the Immigration and Naturalization Service at Syracuse, New York. The subpoenas commanded petitioners' appearance and testimony, and required them to produce specified documents. They appeared with documents as ordered, but refused to be sworn or to testify. Thereupon an application for an order of compliance was made by the Service in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York; but the court, denying the Service's authority, refused to compel petitioners to appear and give testimony. 116 F. Supp. 464. On appeal, to the Court of \n\n[350 \nU.S. 179, 184]\n\u00a0\n Appeals for the Second Circuit, this judgment was reversed. 219 F.2d 137. The court held that 235 (a) of the Act permitted the immigration officer to subpoena the petitioners in furtherance of the Service's investigation of them under 340.11 of the regulations. The decision assumed, although the court did not discuss the question, that each petitioner, even though a subject of investigation, was a \"witness\" within the meaning of 235 (a).\n5\n\u00a0\n\nThis brings us to an examination of the scope of 235 (a). It had its genesis in 16 of the Immigration Act of 1917, 39 Stat. 874, 885, which dealt with the examination of entering aliens by the Immigration Service. With respect to subpoenas the section provided: \"Any commissioner of immigration or inspector in charge shall also have power to require by subpoena the attendance and testimony of witnesses before said inspectors and the production of books, papers, and documents touching the right of any alien to enter, reenter, reside in, or pass through the United States, and to that end may invoke the aid of any court of the United States . . . .\" Obviously, this provision strictly defined the purposes for which officers of the Service could subpoena witnesses. It did not give them power to issue subpoenas as aids in investigating potential naturalization offenses.\n\nThe 1952 Act in 235 (a) retained the substance of this language in 16. But the word \"alien\" was changed to \"person,\" and additional language extended the subpoena power to \"any matter which is material and relevant to the enforcement of this Act and the administration of the Service.\" If the additional clause, following the portion \"relating to the privilege of any person to enter, reenter, reside in, or pass through the United States,\" had merely read \"and any other matter which is material and \n\n[350 \nU.S. 179, 185]\n\u00a0\n relevant,\" the doctrine of ejusdem generis would appropriately be invoked to limit the subpoena power to an investigation pertaining to questions of admission and deportation. The comprehensive addition of the clause \"or concerning any matter which is material and relevant to the enforcement of this Act and the administration of the Service,\" precludes such narrowing reading. \"Act\" encompasses the full range of subjects covered by the statute. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 brought together in one statute the previously atomized subjects of immigration, nationality and naturalization. The unqualified use of the word \"Act\" in 235 (a), if read as ordinary English, embraces all of these subjects even though 235 (a) is itself in the immigration title of the statute. But \"the title of a statute and the heading of a section cannot limit the plain meaning . . . .\" Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., \n331 \nU.S. 519, 528\n-529. Throughout this statute the word \"Act\" is given its full significance. The word embraces the entire statute.\n6\n On the other hand, when \n\n[350 \nU.S. 179, 186]\n\u00a0\n only a particular title is referred to, it is designated as such, and when the reference is to a section, that word is employed.\n7\n No justification appears for treating \"Act\" in 235 (a) as meaning \"section.\" Thus far the Second and Third Circuits are in agreement.\n\nWe come then to the question upon which the two Courts of Appeals part ways in their construction of 235 (a), namely, whether Salvatore and Joseph Falcone in the one case and Abraham Minker in the other, although each the subject of a denaturalization investigation under 340.11 of the regulations, were \"witnesses\" within the meaning of the power given to \"any immigration officer\" to require \"by subpoena the attendance and testimony of witnesses\" before immigration officers.\n\nIf the answer to the question merely depended upon whether, as a matter of allowable English usage, the word \"witness\" may fairly describe a person in the position of Minker and the Falcones, it could not be denied that the word could as readily be deemed to cover persons in their position as not. In short, the word is patently ambiguous: it can fairly be applied to anyone who gives testimony in a proceeding, although the proceeding immediately or potentially involves him as a party, or it may be restricted to the person who gives testimony in another's case. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 179, 187]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt is pertinent to note the breadth of 235 (a) not only with respect to the type of investigation in which a subpoena may be issued (\"any matter which is material and relevant to the enforcement of this Act\"), but also with respect to the member of the Service empowered to issue it. The power is granted \"any immigration officer,\" who in turn is defined in 101 (a) (18) of the Act as \"any employee or class of employees of the Service or of the United States designated by the Attorney General, individually or by regulation, to perform the functions of an immigration officer specified by this Act or any section thereof.\" This extensive delegated authority reinforces the considerations inherent in the nature of the power sought to be exercised that make for a restrictive reading of the Janus-faced word \"witness.\" The subpoena power \"is a power capable of oppressive use, especially when it may be indiscriminately delegated and the subpoena is not returnable before a judicial officer. . . . True, there can be no penalty incurred for contempt before there is a judicial order of enforcement. But the subpoena is in form an official command, and even though improvidently issued it has some coercive tendency, either because of ignorance of their rights on the part of those whom it purports to command or their natural respect for what appears to be an official command, or because of their reluctance to test the subpoena's validity by litigation.\" Cudahy Packing Co., Ltd. v. Holland, \n315 \nU.S. 357, 363\n-364.\n\nThese concerns, relevant to the construction of this ambiguously worded power, are emphatically pertinent to investigations that constitute the first step in proceedings calculated to bring about the denaturalization of citizens. See Schneiderman v. United States, \n320 \nU.S. 118\n; Baumgartner v. United States, \n322 \nU.S. 665\n. This may result in \"loss of both property and life; or of all that makes life worth living.\" Ng Fung Ho v. White, \n259 \nU.S. 276\n, \n\n[350 \nU.S. 179, 188]\n\u00a0\n 284. In such a situation where there is doubt it must be resolved in the citizen's favor. Especially must we be sensitive to the citizen's rights where the proceeding is nonjudicial because of \"[t]he difference in security of judicial over administrative action . . . .\" Ng Fung Ho v. White, supra, at 285.\n\nThese considerations of policy, which determined the Court's decisions in requiring judicial as against administrative adjudication of the issue of citizenship in a deportation proceeding and those defining the heavy criterion of proof to be exacted by the lower courts from the Government before decreeing denaturalization, are important guides in reaching decision here. They give coherence to law and are fairly to be assumed as congressional presuppositions, unless by appropriate explicitness the lawmakers make them inapplicable. Cf. Bell v. United States, \n349 \nU.S. 81, 83\n. It does not bespeak deprecation of official zeal, nor does it bring into question disinterestedness, to conclude that compulsory ex parte administrative examinations, untrammelled by the safeguards of a public adversary judicial proceeding, afford too ready opportunities for unhappy consequences to prospective defendants in denaturalization suits.\n\nThese general considerations find specific reinforcement in the language of other provisions of the Act, wherein the person who is the subject of an investigation is referred to with particularity. The most striking example of this is to be found in 335 and its legislative history which pertains to the investigation of an alien who petitions for naturalization. Section 335 (b) provides: \"The Attorney General shall designate employees of the Service to conduct preliminary examinations upon petitions for naturalization . . . . For such purposes any such employee so designated is hereby authorized to take testimony concerning any matter touching or in any way affecting the admissibility of any petitioner for naturalization, \n\n[350 \nU.S. 179, 189]\n\u00a0\n to administer oaths, including the oath of the petitioner for naturalization and the oaths of petitioner's witnesses to the petition for naturalization, and to require by subpoena the attendance and testimony of witnesses, including petitioner . . . .\" Contrast this with 335 (b)'s predecessor, 333 (a) of the Nationality Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 1137, 1156: \". . . any such designated examiner is hereby authorized to take testimony concerning any matter touching or in any way affecting the admissibility of any petitioner for naturalization, to subpena witnesses, and to administer oaths, including the oath of the petitioner to the petition for naturalization and the oath of petitioner's witnesses.\"\n8\n Other examples of Congress' careful differentiation between a witness who is not the subject of an investigation and the person who is, may be found in 236 (a),\n9\n 242 (b)\n10\n and 336 (d)\n11\n of the 1952 Act. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 179, 190]\n\u00a0\n\n\nAll these considerations converge to the conclusion that Congress has not provided with sufficient clarity that the subpoena power granted by 235 (a) extends over persons who are the subject of denaturalization investigations; therefore Congress is not to be deemed to have done so impliedly. Since this is so, we are not called upon to consider whether Congress may empower an immigration officer to secure evidence, under the authority of a subpoena, from a citizen who is himself the subject of an investigation directed toward his denaturalization. The judgment in No. 35 is affirmed; in No. 47, the judgment is reversed.\n\n   Affirmed and reversed respectively.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 235 (a) in full provides: \"The inspection, other than the physical and mental examination, of aliens (including alien crewmen) seeking admission or readmission to, or the privilege of passing through the United States shall be conducted by immigration officers, except as otherwise provided in regard to special inquiry officers. All aliens arriving at ports of the United States shall be examined by one or more immigration officers at the discretion of the Attorney General and under such regulations as he may prescribe. Immigration officers are hereby authorized and empowered to board and search any vessel, aircraft, railway car, or other conveyance, or vehicle in which they believe aliens are being brought into the United States. The Attorney General and any immigration officer, including special inquiry officers, shall have power to administer oaths and to take and consider evidence of or from any person touching the privilege of any alien or person he believes or suspects to be an alien to enter, reenter, pass through, or reside in the United States or concerning any matter which is material and relevant to the enforcement of this Act and the administration of the Service, and, where such action may be necessary, to make a written record of such evidence. Any person coming into the United States may be required to state \n\n[350 \nU.S. 179, 181]\n\u00a0\n under oath the purpose or purposes for which he comes, the length of time he intends to remain in the United States, whether or not he intends to remain in the United States permanently and, if an alien, whether he intends to become a citizen thereof, and such other items of information as will aid the immigration officer in determining whether he is a national of the United States or an alien and, if the latter, whether he belongs to any of the excluded classes enumerated in section 212. The Attorney General and any immigration officer, including special inquiry officers, shall have power to require by subpena the attendance and testimony of witnesses before immigration officers and special inquiry officers and the production of books, papers, and documents relating to the privilege of any person to enter, reenter, reside in, or pass through the United States or concerning any matter which is material and relevant to the enforcement of this Act and the administration of the Service, and to that end may invoke the aid of any court of the United States. Any United States district court within the jurisdiction of which investigations or inquiries are being conducted by an immigration officer or special inquiry officer may, in the event of neglect or refusal to respond to a subpena issued under this subsection or refusal to testify before an immigration officer or special inquiry officer, issue an order requiring such persons to appear before an immigration officer or special inquiry officer, produce books, papers, and documents if demanded, and testify, and any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by the court as a contempt thereof.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Section 340 (a) provides: \"It shall be the duty of the United States district attorneys for the respective districts, upon affidavit \n\n[350 \nU.S. 179, 182]\n\u00a0\n showing good cause therefor, to institute proceedings in any court specified in subsection (a) of section 310 of this title in the judicial district in which the naturalized citizen may reside at the time of bringing suit, for the purpose of revoking and setting aside the order admitting such person to citizenship and canceling the certificate of naturalization on the ground that such order and certificate of naturalization were procured by concealment of a material fact or by willful misrepresentation, and such revocation and setting aside of the order admitting such person to citizenship and such canceling of certificate of naturalization shall be effective as of the original date of the order and certificate, respectively: Provided, That refusal on the part of a naturalized citizen within a period of ten years following his naturalization to testify as a witness in any proceeding before a congressional committee concerning his subversive activities, in a case where such person has been convicted of contempt for such refusal, shall be held to constitute a ground for revocation of such person's naturalization under this subsection as having been procured by concealment of a material fact or by willful misrepresentation. If the naturalized citizen does not reside in any judicial district in the United States at the time of bringing such suit, the proceedings may be instituted in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or in the United States district court in the judicial district in which such person last had his residence.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] 8 CFR 340.11 provides: \"Investigation and report.

If the district director is satisfied that a prima facie showing has been made that grounds for revocation exist, he shall cause an investigation to be made and report the facts in writing to the Commissioner with a recommendation as to whether revocation proceedings should be instituted. If it appears that naturalization was procured in violation of section 1425 of Title 18 of the United States Code, the facts in regard thereto may be presented by the district director to the appropriate United States Attorney for possible criminal prosecution.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The question whether respondent was required to obey the order of the District Court irrespective of that court's power under 235 (a) has not been raised. See United States v. United Mine Workers of America, \n330 \nU.S. 258\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has taken the same view. Lansky et al. v. Savoretti, 220 F.2d 906.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] E. g., 215 (g): \"Passports, visas, reentry permits, and other documents required for entry under this Act may be considered as permits to enter for the purposes of this section.\" 241 (a) (2): \"Any alien in the United States . . . shall, upon the order of the Attorney General, be deported who - entered the United States without inspection or at any time or place other than as designated by the Attorney General or is in the United States in violation of this Act or in violation of any other law of the United States.\" 290 (a): \"There shall be established in the office of the Commissioner for the use of the security and enforcement agencies of the Government of the United States, a central index, which shall contain the names of all aliens heretofore admitted to the United States, or excluded therefrom, insofar as such information is available from the existing records of the Service, and the names of all aliens hereafter admitted to the United States, or excluded therefrom, the names of their sponsors of record, if any, and such other relevant information as the Attorney General shall require as an aid to the proper enforcement of this Act.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] E. g., 284: \"Nothing contained in this title shall be construed so as to limit, restrict, deny, or affect the coming into or departure from the United States of an alien member of the Armed Forces of the United States who is in the uniform of, or who bears documents identifying him as a member of, such Armed Forces, and who is coming to or departing from the United States under official orders or permit of such Armed Forces: Provided, That nothing contained in this section shall be construed to give to or confer upon any such alien any other privileges, rights, benefits, exemptions, or immunities under this Act, which are not otherwise specifically granted by this Act.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] \"While the Nationality Act [ 333 (a) of the 1940 Act] provides for subpena of witnesses at a preliminary [naturalization] hearing and for calling of witnesses in any naturalization proceedings in court, specific provision is not made for subpenaing the petitioner.

No. 1515, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. 739.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Section 236 (a) provides: \"A special inquiry officer shall conduct evidence, and interrogate, examine, and cross-examine the alien or witnesses.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] Section 242 (b) provides: \"A special inquiry officer shall conduct proceedings under this section to determine the deportability of any alien, and shall administer oaths, present and receive evidence, interrogate, examine, and cross-examine the alien or witnesses, and, as authorized by the Attorney General, shall make determinations, including orders of deportation.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] Section 336 (d) provides: \"The Attorney General shall have the right to appear before any court in any naturalization proceedings for the purpose of cross-examining the petitioner and the witnesses produced in support of the petition concerning any matter touching \n\n[350 \nU.S. 179, 190]\n\u00a0\n or in any way affecting the petitioner's right to admission to citizenship, and shall have the right to call witnesses, including the petitioner, produce evidence, and be heard in opposition to, or in favor of, the granting of any petition in naturalization proceedings.\"\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK, concurring.\n\nThe respondent Minker is a naturalized citizen of the United States.\n1\n He was subpoenaed by an immigration officer to appear and give testimony as a \"witness.\" But Minker was not to be a witness within the traditional meaning of that word, that is, one who testifies in a court proceeding or in a public quasi-judicial hearing of some kind. The immigration officer summoning Minker was not a judge or \"grand jury\" of any kind, nor was he at the time acting in any quasi-judicial capacity. Cf. In re Oliver, \n333 \nU.S. 257\n. He was acting under his broad power as a law enforcement officer to follow up clues and find information that might be useful in later civil or criminal prosecutions brought against persons suspected \n\n[350 \nU.S. 179, 191]\n\u00a0\n of violating the immigration and naturalization laws. See, e. g., 287, Immigration and Nationality Act, 66 Stat. 233, 8 U.S.C. 1357; 8 CFR 287.1-287.5. The object in summoning Minker was to interrogate him in the immigration officer's private chambers to try to elicit information \"relating to the possible institution of proceedings seeking the revocation of . . . [Minker's] naturalization . . . .\" Information so obtained might be used under some circumstances in court to take away Minker's American citizenship or convict him of perjury or some other crime.\n2\n Thus the capacity in which this immigration officer was acting was precisely the same as that of a policeman, constable, sheriff, or Federal Bureau of Investigation agent who interrogates a person, perhaps himself a suspect, in connection with murder or some other crime. Apparently Congress has never even attempted to vest FBI agents with such private inquisitorial power. Indeed, this Court has construed congressional enactments as designed to safeguard persons against compulsory questioning by law enforcement officers behind closed doors. McNabb v. United States, \n318 \nU.S. 332\n; Upshaw v. United States, \n335 \nU.S. 410\n. And we have frequently set aside state criminal convictions as a denial of due process of law because of coercive questioning of suspects by public prosecutors and other law enforcement officers in their official chambers. See, e. g., Watts v. Indiana, \n338 \nU.S. 49\n; Harris v. South Carolina, \n338 \nU.S. 68\n; Chambers v. Florida, \n309 \nU.S. 227\n. Yet power of the Attorney General and immigration officers to compel persons, including suspects, to appear and subject themselves \n\n[350 \nU.S. 179, 192]\n\u00a0\n to questioning by law enforcement officers in their private chambers is precisely what the Department of Justice claims here. This is no less true because a federal judge must be called on to \"aid\" the immigration officer in subjecting a summoned person to questioning. 235 (a), 66 Stat. 198, 8 U.S.C. 1225 (a). For after a court order, as before, the person summoned must go to an immigration officer's private chambers for questioning by him, out of which may come a prosecution against the \"witness\" for perjury or some other crime. A purpose to subject aliens, much less citizens, to a police practice so dangerous to individual liberty as this should not be read into an Act of Congress in the absence of a clear and unequivocal congressional mandate. I think the Act relied on here by the Department of Justice should not be so read. I would hold that immigration officers are wholly without statutory authority to summon persons, whether suspects or not, to testify in private as \"witnesses\" in denaturalization matters. For this reason I concur in the Court's judgment in this case.\n\nThe Department of Justice finds the sweeping power it claims in 235 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 66 Stat. 163, 198, 8 U.S.C. 1101, 1225. That Act is a comprehensive codification of laws relating to entry, exclusion, domestic control, deportation and naturalization of aliens; the Act also provides the controlling rules and procedures for denaturalizing naturalized citizens. Primary responsibility for administration and enforcement of the Act is vested in the Attorney General, acting chiefly through his subordinates in the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 103, 66 Stat. 173, 8 U.S.C. 1103.\n\nThis Court has drawn sharp and highly important distinctions between the constitutional power of Congress to bar and exclude aliens and congressional power to strip \n\n[350 \nU.S. 179, 193]\n\u00a0\n citizens of their citizenship. Former cases have held that Congress has full power to bar or exclude aliens from the country. See, e. g., United States v. Ju Toy, \n198 \nU.S. 253\n; Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, \n342 \nU.S. 580\n; Shaughnessy v. United States ex rel. Mezei, \n345 \nU.S. 206\n. But citizenship, whether acquired by birth or by naturalization, cannot be taken away without a judicial trial in which the Government carries a heavy burden. See, e. g., Ng Fung Ho v. White, \n259 \nU.S. 276\n; Baumgartner v. United States, \n322 \nU.S. 665\n; Gonzales v. Landon, \n350 \nU.S. 920\n. Congress, apparently taking note of these basic distinctions, divided the Act into different \"Titles\" and \"Chapters.\" Section 235, on which the Government relies here, appears in Chapter IV of Title II. Title II as a whole contains provisions relating to \"Immigration\" and Chapter IV of that Title contains the \"Provisions Relating to Entry and Exclusion.\" It is in the context of Chapter IV that 235 gives the Attorney General and immigration officers, \"including special inquiry officers,\" broad power to subpoena and require testimony of \"witnesses\" as to \"the privilege of any person to enter, reenter, reside in, or pass through the United States or concerning any matter which is material and relevant to the enforcement of this Act and the administration of the Service . . . .\" I think that context indicates that 235 was designed to apply only to the examination of \"witnesses\" by immigration officers in relation to \"entry and exclusion\" of aliens, and matters material and relevant to entry and exclusion. Such a reading makes the subpoena power given fit into the carefully devised pattern of Title II, which deals with aliens and immigration, not with naturalization or denaturalization. Even if limited to matters pertaining to the entry and exclusion of aliens, compulsory private examination of \"witnesses\" might be invalid. The broad powers here claimed by the \n\n[350 \nU.S. 179, 194]\n\u00a0\n Attorney General and his immigration officers could be more nearly defended, if they can be defended at all, by confining use of the powers to the field of treatment of aliens, where this Court has said Congress has most power.\n\nLimitation of the subpoena and investigatory powers in 235 to matters relating to entry, control and exclusion of aliens is strengthened by consideration of Title III of the Act which covers \"Nationality and Naturalization.\" That Title provides procedures for investigation and trial of naturalization and denaturalization cases, wholly adequate in themselves without reliance on the subpoena and examination powers of immigration officers under 235. The naturalization and denaturalization procedures of Title III are not merely adequate, but are in a measure inconsistent with 235 procedure. Looking first at naturalization procedure under 332-336, 66 Stat. 252-258, 8 U.S.C. 1443-1447, it appears that Congress with meticulous care provided a procedure for investigation of naturalization cases. These sections provide their own way for summoning and examining witnesses. Without mentioning immigration officers, the sections provide for investigations, etc., to be carried on by any employee of the Service or of the United States designated by the Attorney General. An examination under this Title is carried on by a public hearing at which an applicant for citizenship can produce his own witnesses.\n3\n The designated \n\n[350 \nU.S. 179, 195]\n\u00a0\n hearing examiner is given the power to subpoena witnesses by 335 (b), 66 Stat. 255, 8 U.S.C. 1446 (b), and the naturalization judge is authorized to compel compliance with the subpoena. After the hearing the examiner reports his findings and recommendations to the Attorney General. The views of the designated examiner, and of the Attorney General if in conflict, are then reported to the naturalization court for its consideration. All of this persuades me that reliance on the subpoena and private examination powers of immigration officers under 235 would actually conflict with the public hearing procedure Congress and the Attorney General have provided for naturalization cases in 332-335, 66 Stat. 252-257, 8 U.S.C. 1443-1446, and 8 CFR 335.11-335.13.\n\nIt seems even clearer that immigration officers' powers under 235 are not applicable in denaturalization cases. Section 340 of Title III of the Act, 66 Stat. 260, 8 U.S.C. 1451, provides for revocation of naturalization. Responsibility for initiating such cases is placed on district attorneys \"upon affidavit showing good cause therefor . . . .\" Many of the grounds for denaturalization are also grounds for felony prosecutions. Under these circumstances it is not surprising that Congress expressly placed responsibility for instituting denaturalization proceedings on district attorneys, leaving them to summon persons to appear as witnesses in the traditional manner before grand juries or courts. It would have been surprising had Congress attempted to authorize the Nation's chief prosecuting officer and his subordinates to compel a citizen to appear in government private offices to \n\n[350 \nU.S. 179, 196]\n\u00a0\n answer questions in secret about that citizen's conduct, associations and beliefs. Some countries give such powers to their officials. It is to be hoped that this country never will.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Minker is respondent in No. 35. He and the petitioners in No. 47, Salvatore and Joseph Falcone, raise the same questions, and what I say about Minker's case applies also to that of the Falcones.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See 348, 66 Stat. 267, 8 U.S.C. 1459; 18 U.S.C. 1621. See also Gonzales v. Landon, \n350 \nU.S. 920\n, reversing 215 F.2d 955. But see Boyd v. United States, \n116 \nU.S. 616\n; majority and dissenting opinions in Feldman v. United States, \n322 \nU.S. 487\n; Adams v. Maryland, \n347 \nU.S. 179\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The Attorney General's regulations for the conduct of these examinations, 8 CFR 335.11-335.13, also provide that the petitioner for naturalization may be represented by counsel and that the petitioner may cross-examine government witnesses. If petitioner is not represented by counsel, the hearing examiner must assist him in introducing his evidence. Furthermore the decision of the examiner may not be based on evidence which is not in the record or which would be inadmissible in judicial proceedings. Thus the regulations emphasize the difference between a subpoena to testify before a 335 naturalization hearing officer and a subpoena to testify before a 235 \n\n[350 \nU.S. 179, 195]\n\u00a0\n immigration officer seeking to obtain evidence for criminal prosecution or deportation. And they show that naturalization procedures are completely independent from entry and exclusion procedures.

JUSTICE DOUGLAS, concurring.\n\nWhile I agree with the result reached by the Court, I do not think this case is comparable to those controversies that frequently rage over the scope of the investigative power in support of administrative action. Cf. Cudahy Packing Co. v. Holland, \n315 \nU.S. 357\n, with United States v. Morton Salt Co., \n338 \nU.S. 632\n. Congress has provided a special judicial procedure which must be followed, if a citizen is denaturalized. That procedure is contained in 340 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. 66 Stat. 163, 8 U.S.C. 1451. It provides for canceling a certificate of naturalization on the ground that it was procured \"by concealment of a material fact or by willful misrepresentation.\" 340 (a). Suit may be brought by the United States Attorney in the District Court \"upon affidavit showing good cause.\" Id. The citizen whose citizenship is challenged has 60 days \"in which to make answer to the petition of the United States.\" 340 (b). There is no pretrial administrative procedure provided in the section governing denaturalization. One can search 340 in vain for any suggestion that the judicial procedure is supplemented by a pretrial procedure. So to hold would make the 60-day period for answer \"empty words.\" as Judge Foley ruled in Application of Barnes, 116 F. Supp. 464, 469. As Judge Hastie, writing for the court below in the Minker case, said, the administrative pretrial procedure is not consistent with the safeguards which Congress has provided in the judicial proceedings. 217 F.2d 350, 352. I agree with that view and would, therefore, read \n\n[350 \nU.S. 179, 197]\n\u00a0\n 235 (a) to exclude witnesses who are potential defendants in 340 cases.\n\nThere is another reason for reading the section narrowly. When we deal with citizenship we tread on sensitive ground. The citizenship of a naturalized person has the same dignity and status as the citizenship of those of us born here, save only for eligibility to the Presidency. He is a member of a community included within the protection of all the guarantees of the Constitution. Those safeguards would be imperiled if prior to the institution of the proceedings the citizen could be compelled to be a witness against himself and furnish out of his own mouth the evidence used to denaturalize him. I would require the Government to proceed with meticulous regard for the basic notions of Due Process which protect every vital right of the American citizen. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 179, 198]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","103":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v.

JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe question for decision in this case is whether the president and principal negotiator of a labor union is a \"representative\" of employees within the meaning of 302 (b) of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947. 61 Stat. 136, 29 U.S.C. 141. That section makes it unlawful for \"any representative of any employees\" to receive money or other thing of value from the employer. The District Court, 128 F. Supp. 128, held that respondent Joseph P. Ryan was a \"representative\" within the meaning of 302 (b), but the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed, Judge Hand dissenting. 225 F.2d 417. Because of the importance of this question in the administration of the Act, we granted certiorari, \n350 \nU.S. 860\n.\n\nRyan was president of The International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) during the years 1950 and 1951. The ILA and its affiliated groups were the recognized collective-bargaining agents for longshore labor in the Port of New York, and bargained through a wage scale committee of which Ryan was a member. He signed the agreements negotiated during that period. J. Arthur Kennedy & Son, Inc., and Daniels & Kennedy, Inc., were concerns engaged in stevedoring operations; their employees were members of the ILA, and they were bound by the agreements negotiated with that union by the New York Shipping Association. The District Court found that James C. Kennedy, president of both Kennedy companies, had given Ryan $1,000 in December of each year from 1946 through 1951, and $500 in April 1951. These findings are not disputed. Ryan was indicted under 302 (b) for accepting the one 1950 and two 1951 payments.\n1\n He was found guilty and sentenced to \n\n[350 \nU.S. 299, 301]\n\u00a0\n six months' imprisonment on each of the three counts, the sentences to run concurrently, and fined $2,500.\n\nThe Court of Appeals reversed solely on its interpretation of the term \"representative\" in 302 (b) of the LMRA. It concluded that the term had a technical meaning in labor legislation and was limited to \"the exclusive bargaining representative\" of the employees, which in this case was the ILA itself. Since the section applied only to the \"representative,\" payments to Ryan individually were not covered even though as president of the representative union, he was a member of its wage scale committee and signed all negotiated agreements. We do not decide whether any official of a union is ex officio a representative of employees under 302. We believe, however, that respondent's relationship brings him within that term.\n\nThe LMRA provides that the term \"representative\" shall have \"the same meaning as when used in the National Labor Relations Act as amended by this Act.\" 501 (3). The pertinent definition appears in 2 (4) of the NLRA: \"The term `representatives' includes any individual or labor organization.\" 49 Stat. 449, 450, 29 U.S.C. 151, 152 (4).\n\nThe Board has held that employees may choose to elect an individual as exclusive or sole bargaining representative.\n2\n The Court of Appeals, laying much stress on these holdings, assumes that the possibility of such a one-man exclusive bargaining representative, though extremely rare,\n3\n is the only reason for the inclusion of the word \"individual\" \n\n[350 \nU.S. 299, 302]\n\u00a0\n in this definition. We cannot accept such an anomalous view. It is obvious that any labor organization, even when serving as an exclusive bargaining representative, can negotiate, speak, and act only through individuals. All collective bargaining is conducted by individuals who represent labor and management. Many limitations or prohibitions upon labor organization action can be effective only if there are corresponding limitations or prohibitions on the individuals who act for the labor organization. Congress, we believe, placed the identical limitations on both individuals and organizations by terming both \"representatives\" of employees in 2 (4). We agree with Judge Hand that in using the term \"representative\" Congress intended that it include any person authorized by the employees to act for them in dealings with their employers.\n\nConsidering the precise words of the statute - \"any representative of any employees\" - it is plain that their literal meaning strongly suggests that they were meant to include someone in the position of respondent Ryan who represented employees both as a union president and principal negotiator. And this interpretation is strengthened by a consideration of the full text of 302.\n4\n Paragraphs \n\n[350 \nU.S. 299, 303]\n\u00a0\n (a) and (b) of 302 make it unlawful for any employer to offer, or any representative to accept, money or other thing of value. Paragraph (c) lists five exceptions to these broad prohibitions. The first exempts payments as compensation for services \"to any representative who is an employee\" of the employer. Thus it is clear that 302 anticipates that a \"representative\" may be an individual. Of the remaining four exceptions, one could \n\n[350 \nU.S. 299, 304]\n\u00a0\n apply only to unions but each of the other three could apply as readily to individuals.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nFurther, a narrow reading of the term \"representative\" would substantially defeat the congressional purpose. In 1946 Congress was disturbed by the demands of certain unions that the employers contribute to \"welfare funds\" which were in the sole control of the union or its officers and could be used as the individual officers saw fit. The United Mine Workers' demand that mine \n\n[350 \nU.S. 299, 305]\n\u00a0\n operators create a welfare fund for the union by contributing 10 cents for each ton of coal mined, caused the Congress to act. The Case Bill, H. R. 4908, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., which regulated welfare funds in a manner similar to 302, was enacted in 1946, but was vetoed by the President. The following year the Taft-Hartley Act containing 302 was passed over another veto. But, if \"representative\" means only the \"exclusive bargaining representative,\" the explicit limitations on welfare funds in 302 (c) (5) may be easily evaded. Payments made directly to union officials, or to other individuals as trustees, would apparently be excluded from 302. Thus, a narrow construction would frustrate the primary intent of Congress.\n\nNor can it be contended that in this legislation Congress was aiming solely at the welfare fund problem. Such a suggestion is supported neither by the legislative history nor the structure of the section. The arrangement of 302 is such that the only reference to welfare funds is contained in 302 (c) (5). If Congress intended to deal with that problem alone, it could have done so directly, without writing a broad prohibition in subsections (a) and (b) and five specific exceptions thereto in subsection (c), only the last of which covers welfare funds. As the statute reads, it appears to be a criminal provision, malum prohibitum, which outlaws all payments, with stated exceptions, between employer and representative.\n\nThe legislative history supports these conclusions. As passed by the House of Representatives, the Hartley Bill forbade employer contributions to union welfare funds, and made it an unfair labor practice to give favors to \"any person in a position of trust in a labor organization . . . .\" H. R. 3020, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 8 (a) (2). The scope of this bill was enlarged when it reached the Senate to include, in the words of Senator Taft, a \"case \n\n[350 \nU.S. 299, 306]\n\u00a0\n where the union representative is shaking down the employer . . . .\" 93 Cong. Rec. 4746. The resulting Senate amendment made it criminal both for the employer and the \"representative\" of employees to engage in such practices.\n\nIt is not disputed that the plain language of the Senate version of the bill brought within its coverage any individual who dealt with an employer on behalf of two or more of the latter's employees concerning employment matters. As passed by the Senate, 302 contained a special definition of the term \"representative.\"\n6\n The Joint Conference Committee substituted for it the definition of that term in the NLRA, as amended. 501 (3). This substitution was among those described by the Joint Conference Committee Report as \"minor clarifying changes.\" H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 510, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., at 67.\n\nWe cannot read this history as supporting the conclusion that the scope of 302 was limited by the Joint Conference to include only the \"exclusive bargaining representative\" of employees. Such a change would have drastically reduced the scope of the section, and could hardly be described as a \"minor clarifying\" change. Certainly, in the face of this legislative history, we should not reduce the legislation to a practical nullity.\n\nIt is insisted that this interpretation clashes with the use of the term \"representative\" in various sections of the NLRA. In the majority of the examples given, the scope of the term is made clear by other words in the provisions \n\n[350 \nU.S. 299, 307]\n\u00a0\n themselves.\n7\n But further, the provision in the LMRA that \"representative\" shall have its NLRA meaning is no more applicable to 302 than to any other section of the LMRA, and in several other sections of that Act it is patent that \"representative\" cannot be construed to include only the exclusive bargaining representative. For example, 204 (a) refers to \"employers and employees and their representatives,\" and 211 (a) refers to \"interested representatives of employers, employees, and the general public.\" There are other examples, but these are sufficient. If the severely restricted construction contended for the word \"representative\" is inapplicable to one section of the LMRA, there is no compulsion to apply it to any other section.\n\nWe conclude, therefore, that 302 prohibits payments by employers to individuals who represent employees in their relations with the employers. The judgment is\n\n   Reversed and remanded.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE HARLAN took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The previous section, 302 (a), makes it unlawful for any employer \"to pay or deliver, or to agree to pay or deliver, any money or other thing of value to any representative of any of his employees who are employed in an industry affecting commerce.\" The record does not disclose whether the Government has taken any action under this section against the employers involved.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See The Robinson-Ransbottom Pottery Co., 27 N.

With him on the brief were James F. Dreher and R. Hoke Robinson.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis is a suit for condemnation of land instituted by the United States against respondent power company. A single question of valuation is presented. It is whether the just compensation which the United States must pay by force of the Fifth Amendment includes the value of the land as a site for hydroelectric power operations. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals held that it does. 215 F.2d 592. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reached the same result in litigation involving other lands in the same hydroelectric project. United States v. Twin City Power Co., 221 F.2d 299. We granted the petition for certiorari in the former case because of the importance of the issue presented. \n348 \nU.S. 910\n.\n\nThe condemnation proceedings are part of the procedure for completion of the Clark Hill project on the Savannah River, a navigable stream in southeastern United States. The Clark Hill project is the first in a series of steps recommended by the Chief of Army Engineers for the improvement of the basin of that river. H. R. Doc. No. 657, 78th Cong., 2d Sess. That Report conceives of the Clark Hill project as serving multiple purposes - hydroelectric, flood control, and navigation. It states that the Clark Hill project, \"if suitably constructed and operated primarily for hydroelectric-power development, would incidentally reduce downstream flood damages and improve low-water flows for navigation.\" Id., \n\n[350 \nU.S. 222, 224]\n\u00a0\n p. 3. Congress approved this project as part of \"the comprehensive development of the Savannah River Basin for flood control and other purposes.\" Section 10 of the Flood Control Act of 1944, 58 Stat. 887. And see United States ex rel. Chapman v. Federal Power Commission, \n345 \nU.S. 153, 170\n.\n\nThe Court of Appeals concluded that the improvement of navigation was not the purpose of the taking but that the Clark Hill project was designed to serve flood control and water-power development. 215 F.2d, at 597. It is not for courts, however, to substitute their judgments for congressional decisions on what is or is not necessary for the improvement or protection of navigation. See Arizona v. California, \n283 \nU.S. 423, 455\n-457. The role of the judiciary in reviewing the legislative judgment is a narrow one in any case. See Berman v. Parker, \n348 \nU.S. 26, 32\n; United States ex rel. TVA v. Welch, \n327 \nU.S. 546, 552\n. The decision of Congress that this project will serve the interests of navigation involves engineering and policy considerations for Congress and Congress alone to evaluate. Courts should respect that decision until and unless it is shown \"to involve an impossibility,\" as Mr. Justice Holmes expressed it in Old Dominion Co. v. United States, \n269 \nU.S. 55, 66\n. If the interests of navigation are served, it is constitutionally irrelevant that other purposes may also be advanced. United States v. Appalachian Power Co., \n311 \nU.S. 377, 426\n; Oklahoma ex rel. Phillips v. Atkinson Co., \n313 \nU.S. 508, 525\n, 533-534. As we said in the Appalachian Power Co. case, \"Flood protection, watershed development, recovery of the cost of improvements through utilization of power are likewise parts of commerce control.\" \n311 \nU.S., at 426\n.\n\nThe interest of the United States in the flow of a navigable stream originates in the Commerce Clause. That Clause speaks in terms of power, not of property. But the power is a dominant one which can be asserted to the \n\n[350 \nU.S. 222, 225]\n\u00a0\n exclusion of any competing or conflicting one. The power is a privilege which we have called \"a dominant servitude\" (see United States v. Commodore Park, Inc., \n324 \nU.S. 386, 391\n; Federal Power Commission v. Niagara Mohawk Power Corp., \n347 \nU.S. 239, 249\n) or \"a superior navigation easement.\" United States v. Gerlach Live Stock Co., \n339 \nU.S. 725, 736\n. The legislative history and construction of particular enactments may lead to the conclusion that Congress exercised less than its constitutional power, fell short of appropriating the flow of the river to the public domain, and provided that private rights existing under state law should be compensable or otherwise recognized. Such were United States v. Gerlach Live Stock Co., supra, and Federal Power Commission v. Niagara Mohawk Power Corp., supra. We have a different situation here, one where the United States displaces all competing interests and appropriates the entire flow of the river for the declared public purpose.\n\nWe can also put aside such cases as United States v. Kansas City Life Ins. Co., \n339 \nU.S. 799\n, where assertion of the dominant servitude in the navigable river injured property beyond the bed of the stream. Here we are dealing with the stream itself, for it is in the water power that respondents have been granted a compensable interest.\n\nIt is argued, however, that the special water-rights value should be awarded the owners of this land since it lies not in the bed of the river nor below high water but above and beyond the ordinary high-water mark. An effort is made by this argument to establish that this private land is not burdened with the Government's servitude. The flaw in that reasoning is that the landowner here seeks a value in the flow of the stream, a value that inheres in the Government's servitude and one that under our decisions the Government can grant or withhold as it chooses. It is no answer to say that payment is \n\n[350 \nU.S. 222, 226]\n\u00a0\n sought only for the location value of the fast lands. That special location value is due to the flow of the stream; and if the United States were required to pay the judgments below, it would be compensating the landowner for the increment of value added to the fast lands if the flow of the stream were taken into account.\n\nThat is illustrated by United States v. Chandler-Dunbar Co., \n229 \nU.S. 53\n, the case that controls this one. In that case a private company installed a power project in St. Mary's River under a permit from the Government, revocable at will. The permit was revoked, Congress appropriating the entire flow of the stream for navigation purposes. The Court unanimously held that the riparian owner had no compensable interest in the water power of which it had been deprived. Mr. Justice Lurton, speaking for the Court, said, \"Ownership of a private stream wholly upon the lands of an individual is conceivable; but that the running water in a great navigable stream is capable of private ownership is inconceivable.\" Id., at 69. The Court accordingly reversed a judgment that awarded the riparian owner what respondents have obtained in this case, viz., \"the present money value of the rapids and falls to the Chandler-Dunbar Company as riparian owners of the shore and appurtenant submerged land.\" Id., at 74. The Court said, \"The Government had dominion over the water power of the rapids and falls and cannot be required to pay any hypothetical additional value to a riparian owner who had no right to appropriate the current to his own commercial use.\"\n*\n Id., at 76. Some of the land owned by the private \n\n[350 \nU.S. 222, 227]\n\u00a0\n company was in the bed of the stream, some above ordinary high water. But the location of the land was not determinative. It was the dominion of the Government over the water power that controlled the decision. Both in Chandler-Dunbar and in this case it is the water power that creates the special value, whether the lands are above or below ordinary high water. The holding in Chandler-Dunbar led us to say in United States v. Appalachian Power Co., supra, at 424, that the \"exclusion of riparian owners\" from the benefits of the power in a navigable stream \"without compensation is entirely within the Government's discretion.\" And again, \"If the Government were now to build the dam, it would have to pay the fair value, judicially determined, for the fast land; nothing for the water power.\" Id., at 427.\n\nThe power company in the present case is certainly in no stronger position than the owner of the hydroelectric site in the Chandler-Dunbar case. While the latter was deprived of a going private power project by the Government, the present private owners never had a power project on the Savannah and as a result of the Government's pre-emption never can have one.\n\nIt is no answer to say that these private owners had interests in the water that were recognized by state law. We deal here with the federal domain, an area which Congress can completely pre-empt, leaving no vested private claims that constitute \"private property\" within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment. Location of the lands might under some circumstances give them special value, \n\n[350 \nU.S. 222, 228]\n\u00a0\n as our cases have illustrated. But to attach a value of water power of the Savannah River due to location and to enforce that value against the United States would go contra to the teaching of Chandler-Dunbar - \"that the running water in a great navigable stream is capable of private ownership is inconceivable.\" \n229 \nU.S., at 69\n.\n\nThe holding of the Chandler-Dunbar case that water power in a navigable stream is not by force of the Fifth Amendment a compensable interest when the United States asserts its easement of navigation is in harmony with another rule of law expressed in United States v. Miller, \n317 \nU.S. 369, 375\n.\n\n \"Since the owner is to receive no more than indemnity for his loss, his award cannot be enhanced by any gain to the taker. Thus, although the market value of the property is to be fixed with due consideration of all its available uses, its special value to the condemnor as distinguished from others who may or may not possess the power to condemn, must be excluded as an element of market value.\"\n\n\n The Court in the Chandler-Dunbar case emphasized that it was only loss to the owner, not gain to the taker, that is compensable. \n229 \nU.S., at 76\n. If the owner of the fast lands can demand water-power value as part of his compensation, he gets the value of a right that the Government in the exercise of its dominant servitude can grant or withhold as it chooses. The right has value or is an empty one dependent solely on the Government. What the Government can grant or withhold and exploit for its own benefit has a value that is peculiar to it and that no other user enjoys. Cf. U.S. ex rel. T. V. A. v. Powelson, \n319 \nU.S. 266, 273\n et seq. To require the United States to pay for this water-power value would be to create private claims in the public domain.\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] In the Chandler-Dunbar case, an award of compensation was made for the value of the land for a lock and canal, passing \"around the falls and rapids.\" United States v. Chandler-Dunbar Co., \n229 \nU.S., at 67\n, 76-78. It may be that the Court was influenced by the fact that, on the special facts of the case, the use of the land for canals and \n\n[350 \nU.S. 222, 227]\n\u00a0\n locks was wholly consistent with the dominant navigation servitude of the United States and indeed aided navigation. Whatever may be said for that phase of the case, it affords no support for respondent, since water-power value, held to be compensable by the Court of Appeals, was ruled to be noncompensable in the Chandler-Dunbar case. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 222, 229]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE BURTON, with whom MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, MR. JUSTICE MINTON, and MR. JUSTICE HARLAN join, dissenting.\n\nThe issue here is the determination of the compensation which, under the Fifth Amendment, must be paid for privately owned fast land adjoining a navigable stream when such land is taken by the United States for a public use. For the reasons hereafter stated, I agree with the courts below that the proper measure of such compensation is the fair market value of the land at the time it is taken, and that this includes recognition of any fair market value of the land that is due to its riparian character.\n\nThis issue has confronted the United States ever since it proposed to construct a multipurpose dam across the Savannah River, and found it necessary to acquire privately owned land on which to locate its Clark Hill dam, plant and reservoir. Part of the needed land lay in South Carolina on the north bank of the river and the remainder on its south bank in Georgia. Of the 70,000 or more acres thus required, about 4,700, at the heart of the project, are the ones before us. Those in South Carolina are owned by the Twin City Power Company, a South Carolina corporation. Those in Georgia are owned by the Twin City Power Company of Georgia, a Georgia corporation. The latter is a wholly owned subsidiary of the former and the two will be referred to as Twin City.\n\nIn 1947, the United States, in seven proceedings, but under a single program, took possession of the 4,700 acres. It filed four actions in the United States District Court for the Western District of South Carolina, and three in the corresponding court for the Southern District of Georgia. Each sought to condemn the title to some of the property taken and to fix the compensation to be paid for it.\n\nBecause of the necessity for proceeding in two jurisdictions, the compensation issue has been passed upon by \n\n[350 \nU.S. 222, 230]\n\u00a0\n two District Courts and two Courts of Appeals, as well as by three Commissioners appointed jointly by the District Courts to recommend the compensation to be paid. All of the opinions rendered have held that the fair market value of the land taken should include recognition of the value of its location, availability and exceptional suitability for use as a dam site, plant site or reservoir basin incidental to a water-power development. By doing so, they have expressly declined to limit their estimates of the fair market value of the Twin City land merely to its market value for agricultural purposes and the supplying of timber as contended by the Government.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nFor over 50 years, the land in question has been the subject of frequent consideration and negotiation in connection with the proposed construction of some dam to raise the level of the Savannah River from 60 to 100 feet in that vicinity. Twin City was organized for the development of a hydroelectric plant in this area and began acquiring this property for that purpose in 1901. By 1911, it owned practically all of the land necessary for an integrated site for a hydroelectric power project with a \n\n[350 \nU.S. 222, 231]\n\u00a0\n 60-foot head at Price's Island.\n2\n Under six Acts of Congress, passed between 1901 and 1919, Twin City was authorized to build power dams in the Savannah River at Price's Island utilizing the land involved here. The Secretary of War and the Chief of Engineers of the United States approved those plans. The land before us included an excellent dam site where the river narrowed to 900 feet. At appropriate points, the land included sound foundation rock and much clay suitable for earth dam purposes. The stream flow at Price's Island exceeded that of most hydro developments in North Carolina, South Carolina or Georgia. At all material times, there has been an ample and growing market for the electrical energy to be produced. The area contained substantially no improvements requiring removal and was suited for a reservoir basin extending 11 or more miles up the river.\n\nIn 1925, the Federal Power Commission granted Twin City a preliminary permit for a development at Price's Island involving a dam with a 60-foot head of water. In 1926, the Southeastern Power & Light Company negotiated with Twin City for the purchase of its land. Shortly thereafter, the Savannah River Electric Company intervened and obtained a license from the Commission to construct a 90-foot dam for a hydroelectric development which would have absorbed the land now before us. The Savannah River Electric Company also instituted, but later abandoned, proceedings to condemn the Twin City \n\n[350 \nU.S. 222, 232]\n\u00a0\n property. After World War II, the Savannah River Electric Company applied to the Commission for a permit to construct a dam for the development of water power at a point almost identical with the Clark Hill site. That proposal called for occupation of the Twin City land and negotiations for its purchase were renewed. By then, however, the United States had made plans for its own comprehensive improvement of the Savannah River for flood control, navigation and power purposes. In 1944, Congress had authorized the Clark Hill project. 58 Stat. 894. In 1947, the efforts of the Savannah River Electric Company came to an end with its unsuccessful petition for a federal license.\n3\n In that year, the Government took possession of the land for its present Clark Hill project, calling for a 130-foot dam about six miles below Price's Island and for the complete absorption of the Twin City land.\n\nIncluded in the 4,707.65 acres to be evaluated are 4,519.15 acres owned in fee, and 188.50 over which Twin City merely has flowage rights.\n4\n The latter are significant because a market for flowage rights is a recognition of a special value of the land for that use.\n\nThere is no need to discuss here the question whether the Clark Hill project, as authorized by Congress, is primarily in the interest of navigation, rather than of flood control or power development, for, in any event, the United States has the power of eminent domain. By \n\n[350 \nU.S. 222, 233]\n\u00a0\n payment of just compensation, it may acquire whatever private property may be necessary and appropriate for the project, including the Twin City fast land and flowage rights.\n\nThere also is no need to discuss the traditional servitude, generally referred to as the navigation servitude, which the United States enjoys within the banks and bed of the Savannah River. All of the Twin City land and flowage rights involved are located above and beyond the ordinary high-water mark of the river. It is conceded that the United States has a right to exercise its navigation servitude without payment of compensation within the limits of the servitude. There is no claim made here for payment for any value in the flow of the stream, for any part of the bed of the river or for any land below the ordinary high-water mark of the river.\n5\n\u00a0\n\n \"It is not the broad constitutional power to regulate commerce, but rather the servitude derived from that power and narrower in scope, that frees the Government from liability in these cases [United States v. Chicago, M., St. P. & P. R. Co., \n312 \nU.S. 592\n, and United States v. Willow River Power Co., \n324 \nU.S. 499\n]. When the Government exercises this servitude, it is exercising its paramount power \n\n[350 \nU.S. 222, 234]\n\u00a0\n in the interest of navigation, rather than taking the private property of anyone. The owner's use of property riparian to a navigable stream long has been limited by the right of the public to use the stream in the interest of navigation. See Gould on Waters, c. IV, 86-90 (1883); I Farnham, Waters and Water Rights, c. III, 29 (1904). This has applied to the stream and to the land submerged by the stream. There thus has been ample notice over the years that such property is subject to a dominant public interest. This right of the public has crystallized in terms of a servitude over the bed of the stream. The relevance of the high-water level of the navigable stream is that it marks its bed. Accordingly, it is consistent with the history and reason of the rule to deny compensation where the claimant's private title is burdened with this servitude but to award compensation where his title is not so burdened.\" United States v. Kansas City Ins. Co., \n339 \nU.S. 799, 808\n.\n6\n\u00a0\n\n\n Similarly, there is no controversy here between the United States, any State, or private landowner as to the paramount right of the United States to take possession of the land in question for the purposes stated. Unlike the situation in Federal Power Commission v. Niagara Mohawk Corp., \n347 \nU.S. 239\n, there are no vested water rights claimed here under state law. Twin City does not contest the right of the United States to develop the \n\n[350 \nU.S. 222, 235]\n\u00a0\n power resources of the river. It asks only that, to the extent that the United States takes private fast land for public use, it shall pay its fair market value, including its fair market value for riparian uses.\n\n \". . . The statement in that opinion (p. 326) [Monongahela Navigation Co. v. United States, \n148 \nU.S. 312\n] that `no private property shall be appropriated to public uses unless a full and exact equivalent for it be returned to the owner' aptly expresses the scope of the constitutional safeguard against the uncompensated taking or use of private property for public purposes. Reagan v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., \n154 \nU.S. 362, 399\n.\n\n\n \"That equivalent is the market value of the property at the time of the taking contemporaneously paid in money. . . .\n\n\n \"Just compensation includes all elements of value that inhere in the property, but it does not exceed market value fairly determined. The sum required to be paid the owner does not depend upon the uses to which he has devoted his land but is to be arrived at upon just consideration of all the uses for which it is suitable. The highest and most profitable use for which the property is adaptable and needed or likely to be needed in the reasonably near future is to be considered, not necessarily as the measure of value, but to the full extent that the prospect of demand for such use affects the market value while the property is privately held. Boom Co. v. Patterson, \n98 \nU.S. 403, 408\n. Clark's Ferry Bridge Co. v. Public Service Comm'n, \n291 \nU.S. 227\n. 2 Lewis, Eminent Domain, 3d ed., 707, p. 1233. 1 Nichols, Eminent Domain, 2d ed., 220, p. 671. The fact that the most profitable use of a parcel can be made only in combination with other lands does not necessarily exclude that use from consideration if the \n\n[350 \nU.S. 222, 236]\n\u00a0\n possibility of combination is reasonably sufficient to affect market value.\"\n7\n Olson v. United States, \n292 \nU.S. 246, 254\n-256.\n\n\n In the instant case, the Commissioners, the District Courts and the Court of Appeals have applied the above rule. The Commissioners considered all elements of value which they could ascertain with reasonable accuracy, provided those elements were sufficiently assured to be reflected in the fair market value of the premises.\n8\n\u00a0\n\n[350 \nU.S. 222, 237]\n\u00a0\n In confirming the report of the Commissioners, the District Court said:\n\n \"Since the award to Twin City of $1,257,033.20 is not the value of its property for any particular purpose but represents its fair market value after considering all of the reasonable uses of the property which were not too remote or speculative, this amount is the `just compensation' required by the Fifth Amendment and the applicable statutes. . . . This is the amount that in all probability would have been arrived at by fair negotiations between an owner willing to sell and a purchaser desiring to buy.\" 114 F. Supp., at 725.\n\n\n The potential use of this land for dam, plant and reservoir purposes is far from speculative in the light of the 50 years of recognition of its availability and suitability for those purposes. The land was accumulated by Twin City for this very purpose and it is now flooded as part of the Clark Hill project. The steam-plant comparison computations made by the Commissioners are substantially uncontroverted. If a purchase price had been sought by negotiation in 1947, it is inevitable that a primary consideration would have been the value of the flowage rights and of the dam and plant locations in relation to water-power development. We cannot realistically imagine that such a negotiation would have been limited to a consideration of the land's timber and its minor value for agricultural uses.\n9\n\u00a0\n\n[350 \nU.S. 222, 238]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe value recommended by the Commissioners and approved by the courts below includes nothing for strategic or \"hold-up\" value. It reflects no inflation due to the \"taking\" of the property by the Government and no deflation due to the absence of other bidders after the Government announced that it would take the property. There was nothing condemned or valued that could be described as \"in the flow of the stream.\" Only the fast land, was taken and valued. It is because of that land's location near, but apart from, the flow of the stream that an additional fair market value, long recognized in this land, was recommended and approved below. The location of land is always a factor, and often a primary factor, in determining its market value. Every public utility exercising the right of eminent domain is required to pay it.\n\nBefore passage of the Water Power Act, the paramount, but unexercised, right of the Government to control the water power in the Savannah River did not exclude the development of that river under state control. The Water Power Act imposed additional conditions and provided for federal licensing. See Federal Power Commission v. Niagara Mohawk Corp., \n347 \nU.S. 239\n, and Grand River Dam Authority v. Grand-Hydro, \n335 \nU.S. 359\n. But, even though a federal license then became generally necessary, a substantial market for the fast land still existed, because of its importance to any licensee. Up to the time of its \"taking\" of the property, the Government was but one of several prospective purchasers.\n\nAfter the Federal Government announced that it would, itself, develop and use the water power, it still had to acquire fast land for its dam and plant site and for its reservoir basin. Although its taking of the property cut off further competitive bids for the land, the Government had the same constitutional obligation to \n\n[350 \nU.S. 222, 239]\n\u00a0\n pay \"just compensation\" for whatever private property it took.\n\nA classic comment upon a comparable situation was made by this Court when the Federal Government, after condemning a lock and dam, sought to pay only for the tangible property taken, without recognizing the established value of a franchise issued by a State to exact tolls for the use of the canal and lock. In requiring recognition of the latter value, the Court said:\n\n \"And here it may be noticed that, after taking this property, the government will have the right to exact the same tolls the Navigation Company has been receiving. It would seem strange that if by asserting its right to take the property, the government could strip it largely of its value, destroying all that value which comes from the receipt of tolls, and, having taken the property at this reduced valuation, immediately possess and enjoy all the profits from the collection of the same tolls. In other words, by the contention this element of value exists before and after the taking, and disappears only during the very moment and process of taking. Surely, reasoning which leads to such a result must have some vice, at least the vice of injustice.\" Monongahela Navigation Co. v. United States, \n148 \nU.S. 312, 337\n-338.\n\n\n While the United States enjoys special rights in relation to navigable streams, such as its navigation servitude, there is no good reason why, when the Government condemns private property for a public use, its condemnee should not receive from the Government the same measure of \"just compensation\" as from other condemnors. If the property taken is \"private property,\" the constitutional compensation for it should be the same. That measure includes the \"highest and most profitable use for which the property is adaptable . . . to the full extent \n\n[350 \nU.S. 222, 240]\n\u00a0\n that the prospect of demand for such use affects the market value while the property is privately held.\" Olson v. United States, supra, at 255.\n\n \". . . No precedent has been advanced which suggests that a different measure of compensation should be required where the United States rather than the state is the taker of the property for a public project. Nor has any reason been suggested why as a matter of principle or policy there should be a different measure of compensation in such a case. . . .\n\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \". . . The United States no more than a state can be excused from paying just compensation measured by the value of the property at the time of the taking merely because it could destroy that value by appropriate legislation or regulation.\" United States ex rel. T. V. A. v. Powelson, \n319 \nU.S. 266, 278\n, 284. See also, United States v. Cress, \n243 \nU.S. 316, 319\n, 326-327, 329-330.\n\n\n The Government contends, however, that since it need not pay for appropriating the water in the stream, it should not be required to pay for any value in the fast lands that is predicated upon the riparian location of such lands, or their special value in relation to the use of that water. In this connection, the issues decided and the statements made by Justice Lurton for a unanimous Court in United States v. Chandler-Dunbar Co., \n229 \nU.S. 53\n, are helpful. The Chandler case was a condemnation proceeding brought by the United States under a special Act of Congress relating to all the land and other property between the St. Mary's Falls Ship Canal at Sault Sainte Marie, Michigan, and the international boundary to the north. The United States \"took\" this land and property so as to improve navigation in these highly navigable waters. It exercised plenary control over the entire river \n\n[350 \nU.S. 222, 241]\n\u00a0\n and over everything within its bed up to its ordinary high-water mark. It thus exercised its navigation servitude and eliminated, without compensation, a hydroelectric development which the Chandler-Dunbar Company had constructed on the latter's submerged land within the bed of the river. That elimination was no longer in issue in this Court. The principal questions related to the District Court's awards for water rights claimed by Chandler and for fast land owned by Chandler above and beyond the bed of the river.\n10\n\u00a0\n\n1. The District Court allowed Chandler $550,000 for the water rights. Chandler, however, established no vested right to such water under state law and this Court disallowed the entire claim. It said:\n\n \". . . Unless . . . the water power rights asserted by the Chandler-Dunbar Company are determined to be private property the court below was not authorized to award compensation for such rights.\n\n\n \". . . Ownership of a private stream wholly upon the lands of an individual is conceivable; but that the running water in a great navigable stream is capable of private ownership is inconceivable.\" Id., at 69.\n\n\n That conclusion is not questioned.\n\n2. In fixing compensation to Chandler for its strip of eight acres of fast land, the District Court allowed for \"use for canal and lock purposes, an additional value of $25,000,\" and for a smaller area consisting of two other parcels of fast land for \"its special value for canal and lock purposes an additional sum of $10,000.\" Id., at 75. \n\n[350 \nU.S. 222, 242]\n\u00a0\n These allowances of additional value for fast lands, due to their suitability and availability for canal and lock purposes, are significant for our present purposes. The Court explained them as follows:\n\n \". . . That this land had a prospective value for the purpose of constructing a canal and lock parallel with those in use had passed beyond the region of the purely conjectural or speculative. That one or more additional parallel canals and locks would be needed to meet the increasing demands of lake traffic was an immediate probability. This land was the only land available for the purpose. It included all the land between the canals in use and the bank of the river. Although it is not proper to estimate land condemned for public purposes by the public necessities or its worth to the public for such purpose, it is proper to consider the fact that the property is so situated that it will probably be desired and available for such a purpose. Lewis on Eminent Domain,  707. Boom Co. v. Patterson, \n98 \nU.S. 403, 408\n; Shoemaker v. United States, \n147 \nU.S. 282\n; Young v. Harrison, 17 Georgia, 30; Alloway v. Nashville, 88 Tennessee, 510; Sargent v. Merrimac, 196 Massachusetts, 171.\" (Emphasis supplied.) Id., at 76-77.\n\n\n Justice Lurton then reviewed and quoted at length from the opinions in Boom Co. v. Patterson, supra, and Shoemaker v. United States, supra.\n11\n\u00a0\n\n[350 \nU.S. 222, 243]\n\u00a0\n\n\nCoupled with the reasoning of the Court and its quotations from earlier cases, these allowances support the position taken by the lower courts in the instant case. They are \"additional values\" allowed for the location, special suitability and availability of the riparian land for use in connection with the recognized future public use of the area. In fact, the uses for which the allowances are made are of the very same type as that for which the land has been condemned. There is no allowance for strategic or \"hold-up\" value. The Chandler case thus supplies specific authority for the decision of the lower courts in the instant case.\n\n3. In fixing the compensation for the same eight acres and the smaller area, the District Court also made a basic allowance of $20,000 for the value of the strip \"for all general purposes, like residences, or hotels, factory sites, disconnected with water power etc.,\" and $10,000 in relation to the smaller area for \"general wharfage, dock and warehouse purposes.\" Id., at 74, 75. This Court upheld both, thereby further demonstrating that the location of land is a proper element to be considered in determining \"just compensation.\"\n\n4. On the other hand, the District Court approved one other element of \"additional value\" in relation to these land areas which this Court rejected. In valuing the eight acres, the District Court allowed an \"additional value\" of $20,000 for \"use as factory site in connection with the development of 6,500 horse power, either as a single site or for several factories to use the surplus of 6,500 horse power not now used in the city.\" Id., at 74-75. Likewise, in valuing the smaller area, the District Court allowed an additional value of $5,000 in \"connection \n\n[350 \nU.S. 222, 244]\n\u00a0\n with the canal along the rapids, if used as a part of the development of 4,500 (6,500) horse power.\" Id., at 75. It has been suggested that these rejections are in conflict with the Court's simultaneous approval of the additional values of the same land for canal or lock purposes. The Government also claims to find in these rejections some support for its opposition in the instant case to any allowance reflecting the favorable location of the fast land it has taken on the banks of the Savannah River.\n\nThe Court's reasons for rejecting these particular values in the Chandler case, as expressly stated by Justice Lurton, lend no such support to the Government's position in the instant case. He said:\n\n \". . . These `additional' values were based upon the erroneous hypothesis that that company [Chandler-Dunbar] had a private property interest in the water power of the river, not possibly needed now or in the future for purposes of navigation, and that that excess or surplus water was capable, by some extension of their works already in the river, of producing 6,500 horse power.\n\n\n \"Having decided that the Chandler-Dunbar Company as riparian owners had no such vested property right in the water power inherent in the falls and rapids of the river, and no right to place in the river the works essential to any practical use of the flow of the river, the Government cannot be justly required to pay for an element of value which did not inhere in these parcels as upland.\" Id., at 75-76.\n\n\n In other words, the rejected values were not part of the fair market value of the land for any assured use. They sought to recognize a value in the fast land for factory sites which were conditioned upon there being excess water in the stream not needed by the Government for \n\n[350 \nU.S. 222, 245]\n\u00a0\n navigation, and further conditioned upon the development by Chandler of structures in the bed of the stream to develop 6,500 additional horsepower from this excess water. Not only was there found to be no such excess water but Chandler's potential power development within the bed of the stream was expressly disallowed. The rejection thus was due to the speculative nature of the proposed use and not to the favorable riparian location of the land for assured uses. It was thoroughly consistent with the Court's allowance of established values of the land for canal and lock purposes.\n\nTo accept the Government's position in the instant case would, in effect, extend its navigation servitude far above and beyond the high-water mark of the Savannah River. In the face of decisions uniformly limiting that servitude to the bed of the stream, the Government would take 4,700 acres of private property for a public use, substantially without compensation therefor. This would enforce the Government's right of condemnation, while repudiating its constitutional obligation to pay for the private property taken.\n\nThe justice of sustaining the interpretation placed on the Fifth Amendment by the courts below is emphasized in the following statements made by this Court in Monongahela Navigation Co. v. United States, \n148 \nU.S. 312, 324\n, 325:\n\n \". . . The question presented is not whether the United States has the power to condemn and appropriate this property of the Monongahela Company, for that is conceded, but how much it must pay as compensation therefor. Obviously, this question, as all others which run along the line of the extent of the protection the individual has under the Constitution against the demands of the government, is of importance; for in any society the fulness and sufficiency of the securities which surround the individual \n\n[350 \nU.S. 222, 246]\n\u00a0\n in the use and enjoyment of his property constitute one of the most certain tests of the character and value of the government. The first ten amendments to the Constitution, adopted as they were soon after the adoption of the Constitution, are in the nature of a bill of rights, and were adopted in order to quiet the apprehension of many, that without some such declaration of rights the government would assume, and might be held to possess, the power to trespass upon those rights of persons and property which by the Declaration of Independence were affirmed to be unalienable rights.\n\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \". . . And in this there is a natural equity which commends it to every one. It in no wise detracts from the power of the public to take whatever may be necessary for its uses; while, on the other hand, it prevents the public from loading upon one individual more than his just share of the burdens of government, and says that when he surrenders to the public something more and different from that which is exacted from other members of the public, a full and just equivalent shall be returned to him.\"\n\n\n For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be affirmed.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See opinion of District Judge Wyche speaking, in 1949, for the District Courts for the Western District of South Carolina and the Southern District of Georgia, 86 F.

A 60-foot head at that point with a 5-foot surcharge would require about 400 additional acres instead of 170, a 70-foot head with a 5-foot surcharge, 1,250 acres, and an 80-foot head with a 5-foot surcharge, 2,800 acres. The Twin City land was not only available but essential for such developments in the vicinity of Price's Island. Cf. United States ex rel. T. V. A. v. Powelson, \n319 \nU.S. 266\n; Olson v.

The flowage rights were acquired by Twin City through deeds of purchase and, for reservoir purposes, they are as valuable as a title in fee. They evidence a control over riparian land without which water rights are useless for the development of a hydroelectric project.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The answers filed by the condemnees in this action were so construed by the District Court. The United States, relying on United States v. Chandler-Dunbar Co., \n229 \nU.S. 53\n, moved to strike portions of the amended answers filed by the condemnees. In denying these motions, the District Court said:\n\n\". . . But, I do not understand that the condemnee by its answers claims to have any private property right in the `water power capacity' or the `raw water' of the river; neither has it built, nor does it own, any structures in the stream for which it claims compensation. On the contrary, its claim is limited to the fair market value of its fast lands, based upon `the most profitable use to which the land can probably be put in the reasonably near future.'\" United States v. 1532.63 Acres of Land, 86 F.

The Court also remanded that case for a determination of whether or not certain other lands were within the bed of the stream.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Near this point, there also appears the following statement which has significance here in view of the competition between Twin City and others prior to the taking of the land in question by the United States:\n\n\". . .

In that connection, we wish to make it clear that the figure arrived at by the so-called `steam plant comparison method' [$1,600,000], was not taken as an absolute guide, or basis, but was used as one of the principal bases, together with numerous other factors considered by these expert witnesses . . . .\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] The estimate which the Commissioners made of the value of the land based upon its timber and agricultural value, plus an allowance of $5 per acre for the assembly of the title under a single ownership, was about $37 per acre in South Carolina and $31 per acre in Georgia, producing a total of $150,841.85. This contrasts with the $267.02 per acre, and a total \"just compensation\" of $1,257,033.20, approved by the Commissioners and the courts below.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] The allowances of value are here discussed in the following order:\n\n (1) for water rights; (2) for value of land for canal and lock purposes; (3) for value of land for general purposes; and (4) for value of land for factory sites contingent upon availability of surplus privately developed electric power.

The carriers claimed to be entitled to payment at the high first class rates established in Item 1820 of Consolidated Freight Classification No. 17 for \"incendiary bombs.\" In each case the suit was brought within six years, though not within two years, after the cause of action accrued.

With him on the brief was Lawrence Cake.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe three respondent railroads each sued in the Court of Claims to recover from the United States as shipper the difference between the tariff rates actually paid and those allegedly due on 211 Army shipments of steel aerial bomb cases filled with napalm gel.\n1\n Approximately 200 of the shipments were made over the lines of respondents Bangor and Seaboard in 1944; the remainder were carried by respondent Western Pacific in 1948 and 1950.\n\nNapalm gel is gasoline which has been thickened by the addition of aluminum soap powder. The mixture is inflammable but not self-igniting. In a completed incendiary bomb the napalm gel is ignited by white phosphorus contained in a burster charge, which in turn is fired by a fuse. These shipments, however, involved only the steel casings and the napalm gel; burster and fuse had not yet been added.\n\nThe carriers billed the Government at the high first class rates established in Item 1820 of Consolidated Freight Classification No. 17 for \"incendiary bombs.\" Pursuant to 322 of the Transportation Act of 1940,\n2\n the \n\n[352 \nU.S. 59, 61]\n\u00a0\n Government paid the bills of the Bangor and the Seaboard as presented; on post-audit, however, the General Accounting Office made deductions against these respondents' subsequent bills on other shipments, on the ground that the shipments in question should have been carried at the lower, fifth-class, rate applicable to gasoline in steel drums.\n3\n The bills of the Western Pacific were initially paid at the lower rate. Respondents thereupon brought the present suits to recover the difference between the bills as rendered and as paid in the case of the Western Pacific, and the amount of the deductions in the other two cases.\n\nThe Government defended on three grounds: (1) that Item 1820 was inapplicable because absence of burster and fuse deprived these bombs of the essential characteristics of \"incendiary bombs,\" and hence no additional sums were due; (2) that if this tariff item was held to govern, the tariff would be unreasonable as applied to these shipments, and that as to this issue the court proceedings should be suspended and the matter referred to \n\n[352 \nU.S. 59, 62]\n\u00a0\n the Interstate Commerce Commission; and (3) that in any event the Bangor and Seaboard were estopped from charging the \"1820\" rate.\n\nThe Court of Claims, relying on its earlier decision in Union Pacific R. Co. v. United States, 125 Ct. Cl. 390, 111 F. Supp. 266,\n4\n entered summary judgment for respondents, two judges dissenting.\n5\n It held that the shipments in question were \"incendiary bombs\" within the meaning of Item 1820 of the tariff and thus entitled to the higher rate. In addition, while seemingly recognizing the Government's right to have the defense of unreasonableness determined by the Interstate Commerce Commission, the court ruled that the running of the two-year period of limitations provided by 16 (3) of the Interstate Commerce Act\n6\n cut off the right of referral to the Commission. Lastly, the court overruled the defense of estoppel as to the respondents Bangor and Seaboard. Because of the importance of these questions in the administration of the Interstate Commerce Act, and alleged conflict among the lower courts on the issue of limitations, we granted certiorari. \n350 \nU.S. 953\n.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nWe are met at the outset with the question of whether the Court of Claims properly applied the doctrine of primary jurisdiction in this case; that is, whether it correctly allocated the issues in the suit between the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission and that of the court. In the view of the court below, the case presented two entirely separate questions. One was the question \n\n[352 \nU.S. 59, 63]\n\u00a0\n of the construction of the tariff - whether Item 1820 was applicable to these shipments. The second was the question of the reasonableness of that tariff, if so applied. The Court of Claims assumed, as it had in the Union Pacific case, supra, that the first of these - whether the \"1820\" rate applied - was a matter simply of tariff construction and thus properly within the initial cognizance of the court.\n7\n The second - the reasonableness of the tariff as applied to these shipments - it seemed to regard as being within the initial competence of the Interstate Commerce Commission. Before this Court neither side has questioned the validity of the lower court's views in these respects. Nevertheless, because we regard the maintenance of a proper relationship between the courts and the Commission in matters affecting transportation policy to be of continuing public concern, we have been constrained to inquire into this aspect of the decision. We have concluded that in the circumstances here presented the question of tariff construction, as well as that of the reasonableness of the tariff as applied, was within the exclusive primary jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission.\n\nThe doctrine of primary jurisdiction, like the rule requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies, is concerned with promoting proper relationships between the courts and administrative agencies charged with particular regulatory duties. \"Exhaustion\" applies where a claim is cognizable in the first instance by an administrative agency alone; judicial interference is withheld until the administrative process has run its course. \"Primary \n\n[352 \nU.S. 59, 64]\n\u00a0\n jurisdiction,\" on the other hand, applies where a claim is originally cognizable in the courts, and comes into play whenever enforcement of the claim requires the resolution of issues which, under a regulatory scheme, have been placed within the special competence of an administrative body; in such a case the judicial process is suspended pending referral of such issues to the administrative body for its views. General American Tank Car Corp. v. El Dorado Terminal Co., \n308 \nU.S. 422, 433\n.\n\nNo fixed formula exists for applying the doctrine of primary jurisdiction. In every case the question is whether the reasons for the existence of the doctrine are present and whether the purposes it serves will be aided by its application in the particular litigation. These reasons and purposes have often been given expression by this Court. In the earlier cases emphasis was laid on the desirable uniformity which would obtain if initially a specialized agency passed on certain types of administrative questions. See Texas & Pacific R. Co. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co., \n204 \nU.S. 426\n. More recently the expert and specialized knowledge of the agencies involved has been particularly stressed. See Far East Conference v. United States, \n342 \nU.S. 570\n. The two factors are part of the same principle,\n\n\"now firmly established, that in cases raising issues of fact not within the conventional experience of judges or cases requiring the exercise of administrative discretion, agencies created by Congress for regulating the subject matter should not be passed over. This is so even though the facts after they have been appraised by specialized competence serve as a premise for legal consequences to be judicially defined. Uniformity and consistency in the regulation of business entrusted to a particular agency are secured, and the limited functions of review by the judiciary are more rationally exercised, by preliminary \n\n[352 \nU.S. 59, 65]\n\u00a0\n resort for ascertaining and interpreting the circumstances underlying legal issues to agencies that are better equipped than courts by specialization, by insight gained through experience, and by more flexible procedure.\" Id., at 574-575.\n\n\n The doctrine of primary jurisdiction thus does \"more than prescribe the mere procedural time table of the lawsuit. It is a doctrine allocating the law-making power over certain aspects\" of commercial relations. \"It transfers from court to agency the power to determine\" some of the incidents of such relations.\n8\n\u00a0\n\nThus the first question presented is whether effectuation of the statutory purposes of the Interstate Commerce Act requires that the Interstate Commerce Commission should first pass on the construction of the tariff in dispute here; this, in turn, depends on whether the question raises issues of transportation policy which ought to be considered by the Commission in the interests of a uniform and expert administration of the regulatory scheme laid down by that Act. Decision is governed by two earlier cases in this Court. In Texas & Pacific R. Co. v. American Tie & Timber Co., \n234 \nU.S. 138\n, a shipper attempted to ship oak railroad ties under a tariff for \"lumber.\" The carrier rejected them, urging that such ties were not lumber. In a damage action expert testimony was received on the question. This Court, however, held that the Interstate Commerce Commission alone could resolve the question. The effect of the holding is clear: the courts must not only refrain from making tariffs, but, under certain circumstances, must decline to construe them as well. A particularization of such circumstances emerged in Great Northern R. Co. v. Merchants Elevator Co., \n259 \nU.S. 285\n. There the Court held that where the \n\n[352 \nU.S. 59, 66]\n\u00a0\n question is simply one of construction the courts may pass on it as an issue \"solely of law.\" But where words in a tariff are used in a peculiar or technical sense, and where extrinsic evidence is necessary to determine their meaning or proper application, so that \"the enquiry is essentially one of fact and of discretion in technical matters,\" then the issue of tariff application must first go to the Commission. The reason is plainly set forth: such a \"determination is reached ordinarily upon voluminous and conflicting evidence, for the adequate appreciation of which acquaintance with many intricate facts of transportation is indispensable; and such acquaintance is commonly to be found only in a body of experts.\" Id., at 291. We must therefore decide whether a determination of the meaning of the term \"incendiary bomb\" in Item 1820 involves factors \"the adequate appreciation of which\" presupposes an \"acquaintance with many intricate facts of transportation.\" We conclude that it does.\n\nA tariff is not an abstraction. It embodies an analysis of the costs incurred in the transportation of a certain article and a decision as to how much should, therefore, be charged for the carriage of that article in order to produce a fair and reasonable return. Complex and technical cost-allocation and accounting problems must be solved in setting the tariff initially. In the case of \"incendiary bombs,\" since it is expensive to take the elaborate safety precautions necessary to carry such items in safety, evidently there must have been calculation of the costs of handling, supervising and insuring an inherently dangerous cargo. In other words, there were obviously commercial reasons why a higher tariff was set for incendiary bombs than for, say, lumber. It therefore follows that the decision whether a certain item was intended to be covered by the tariff for incendiary bombs involves an intimate knowledge of these very reasons themselves. Whether steel casings filled with napalm \n\n[352 \nU.S. 59, 67]\n\u00a0\n gel are incendiary bombs is, in this context, more than simply a question of reading the tariff language or applying abstract \"rules\" of construction. For the basic issue is how far the reasons justifying a high rate for the carriage of extra-hazardous objects were applicable to the instant shipment. Do the factors which make for high costs and therefore high rates on incendiary bombs also call for a high rate on steel casings filled with napalm gel? To answer that question there must be close familiarity with these factors. Such familiarity is possessed not by the courts but by the agency which had the exclusive power to pass on the rate in the first instance. And, on the other hand, to decide the question of the scope of this tariff without consideration of the factors and purposes underlying the terminology employed would make the process of adjudication little more than an exercise in semantics.\n\nThe main thrust of the Government's argument on the construction question went to the fact that the shipments here involved were not as hazardous as contemplated by the term \"incendiary bomb\" as used in the tariff, and that therefore the tariff should not be construed to cover them.\n9\n Similarly, the dissenting judges below emphasized the absence from the shipments of the commercial factors which call for a high rate on incendiary bombs: \"If the reason for the high freight rate is the incendiary quality of the freight, and if the freight does not have the incendiary quality, the reason for the high rate vanishes and the rate should vanish with it.\" 132 Ct. Cl., at 118, 131 F. Supp., at 921. The difficulty with this line of argument is that we do not know whether \n\n[352 \nU.S. 59, 68]\n\u00a0\n the \"incendiary quality of the freight\" was in fact the reason for the high rate, still less whether that was the only reason and how much weight should be assigned to it. Courts which do not make rates cannot know with exactitude the factors which go into the rate-making process. And for the court here to undertake to fix the limits of the tariff's application without knowledge of such factors, and the extent to which they are present or absent in the particular case, is tantamount to engaging in judicial guesswork. It was the Commission and not the court which originally determined why incendiaries should be transported at a high rate. It is thus the Commission which should determine whether shipments of napalm gel bombs, minus bursters and fuses, meet those requirements; that is, whether the factors making for certain costs and thus a certain rate on incendiaries are present in the carriage of such incompleted bombs.\n\nThis conclusion is fortified by the artificiality of the distinction between the issues of tariff construction and of the reasonableness of the tariff as applied, the latter being recognized by all to be one for the Interstate Commerce Commission. For the Government's thesis on the issue of reasonableness is not that the rate on incendiary bombs is, in general, too high. It argues only that the rate \"as applied\" to these particular shipments is too high - i. e., that since the expenses which have to be met in shipping incendiaries have not been incurred in this case, the carriers will be making an unreasonable profit on these shipments. This seems to us to be but another way of saying that the wrong tariff was applied. In both instances the issue is whether the factors which call for a high rate on incendiary bomb shipments are present in a shipment of bomb casings full of napalm gel but lacking bursters and fuses. And the mere fact that the issue is phrased in one instance as a matter of tariff construction and in the other as a matter of reasonableness should not \n\n[352 \nU.S. 59, 69]\n\u00a0\n be determinative on the jurisdictional issue. To hold otherwise would make the doctrine of primary jurisdiction an abstraction to be called into operation at the whim of the pleader.\n10\n\u00a0\n\nBy no means do we imply that matters of tariff construction are never cognizable in the courts. We adhere to the distinctions laid down in Great Northern R. Co. v. Merchants Elevator Co., supra, which call for decision based on the particular facts of each case. Certainly there would be no need to refer the matter of construction to the Commission if that body, in prior releases or opinions, has already construed the particular tariff at issue or has clarified the factors underlying it. See Crancer v. Lowden, \n315 \nU.S. 631\n. And in many instances construing the tariff does not call for examination of the underlying cost-allocation which went into the making of the tariff in the first instance. We say merely that where, as here, the problem of cost-allocation is relevant, and where therefore the questions of construction and reasonableness are so intertwined that the same factors are determinative on both issues, then it is the Commission which must first pass on them. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 59, 70]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe hold, therefore, that both the issues of tariff construction and the reasonableness of the tariff as applied were initially matters for the Commission's determination.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nWe come then to the question of whether referral of these issues to the Commission was barred by the two-year period of limitation contained in 16 (3) of the Interstate Commerce Act. We hold that it was not.\n\nSection 16 (3) (a) provides that \"all actions at law by carriers subject to this chapter for recovery of their charges . . . shall be begun within two years from the time the cause of action accrues, and not after.\"\n11\n This provision makes it clear that where a carrier sues a private shipper the action must be brought within two years. However, the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. 2501, provides that \"every claim of which the Court of Claims has jurisdiction shall be barred unless the petition thereon is filed . . . within six years after such claim first accrues.\" Relying on the broad language of the latter act, the Court of Claims has, since 1926, consistently held that 16 (3) does not apply to suits by carriers to recover alleged undercharges from the United States as shipper. Southern Pac. Co. v. United States, 62 Ct. Cl. 391; Seaboard Air Line R. Co. v. United States, 113 Ct. Cl. 437, 83 F. Supp. 1012; Union Pacific R. Co. v. United States, 114 Ct. Cl. 714, 86 F. Supp. 907. The present suits were thus held timely brought,\n12\n even though more than two \n\n[352 \nU.S. 59, 71]\n\u00a0\n years had elapsed since the accrual of the cause of action.\n13\n However, the Court of Claims held that the two-year limitation of 16 (3) did bar the Government from obtaining a reference of its defense of unreasonableness to the Interstate Commerce Commission.\n14\n Presumably it would have ruled likewise as to the issue of tariff construction had it regarded that question as lying initially within the competence of the Commission. In other words, the holding below was that the United States can be sued for six years but can raise certain defenses only if the suit is brought in the first two of those years.\n\nWe may assume, without deciding, that the Government would have been barred by 16 (3) from filing an affirmative suit before the Commission to recover overcharges from a carrier. Nevertheless we do not think that the statute operates to bar reference to the Commission of questions raised by way of defense in suits which are themselves timely brought. Respondents in effect ask us to hold that a suit may be brought for six years but that certain defenses thereto may be raised only for two years. Only the clearest congressional language could force us to a result which would allow a carrier to recover unreasonable charges with impunity merely by waiting two years before filing suit. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 59, 72]\n\u00a0\n\n\nSection 16 (3) does not deal with referral of questions to the Commission incident to judicial proceedings. On its face it has to do only with the commencement of actions or reparation proceedings before the Commission. There is therefore no language which militates against the conclusion that the statute does not apply to referrals. More important, the basic policy behind statutes of limitations has no relevance to the situation here. The purpose of such statutes is to keep stale litigation out of the courts. They are aimed at lawsuits, not at the consideration of particular issues in lawsuits. Here the action was already in court and held to have been brought in time. To use the statute of limitations to cut off the consideration of a particular defense in the case is quite foreign to the policy of preventing the commencement of stale litigation. We think it would be incongruous to hold that once a lawsuit is properly before the court, decision must be made without consideration of all the issues in the case and without the benefit of all the applicable law. If this litigation is not stale, then no issue in it can be deemed stale.\n\nIt is argued that this Court has construed 16 (3) as \"jurisdictional\" and that the Commission is therefore barred absolutely from hearing questions as to the reasonableness of rates arising in suits brought after two years, whether such questions come to the Commission by way of referral or in an original suit. Reliance is placed upon A. J. Phillips Co. v. Grand Trunk R. Co., \n236 \nU.S. 662\n; William Danzer & Co. v. Gulf & S. I. R. Co., \n268 \nU.S. 633\n; Midstate Co. v. Pennsylvania R. Co., \n320 \nU.S. 356\n. But these cases all dealt with affirmative claims for the recovery of transportation charges, and not with referrals incident to suits which were originally brought in time. The teaching of the Midstate case, for instance, is that the running of the statute destroys the right to affirmative recovery as well as the remedy, so that the period of limitations cannot be waived by the parties. But here the \n\n[352 \nU.S. 59, 73]\n\u00a0\n Government is not asserting a right to affirmative recovery. It is seeking only to have adjudicated questions raised by way of defense. It is therefore irrelevant whether the statute of limitations is \"jurisdictional\" or not; the question would still remain whether Congress intended it to apply to referrals as well as to affirmative suits. Nor does Morrisdale Coal Co. v. Pennsylvania R. Co., \n230 \nU.S. 304\n, help the respondents. There again the statute of limitations was invoked against a plaintiff in order to bar an affirmative claim which was untimely filed. A coal shipper had sued a carrier for damages arising out of the alleged discriminatory allotment of railroad cars for its use. Stating that the propriety of the carrier's method of allotment, even though incident to a damage action, was cognizable only by the Commission, and that redress there was governed by the two-year statute of limitations, the Court held that the statute could not be evaded by filing suit in the District Court, rather than before the Commission, and then having the barred claim adjudicated by referral to the latter. In effect the holding was that the plaintiff had invoked the wrong tribunal, and that since limitations barred suit before the correct tribunal no referral could be made to the latter. Morrisdale must be limited to its peculiar facts, and we shall not extend it to bar the referral of defenses in actions properly and timely brought, as the Court of Claims has held this one was.\n15\n\u00a0\n\nWe are told that the Government can protect itself, when it believes it has been charged an unreasonable rate, \n\n[352 \nU.S. 59, 74]\n\u00a0\n by filing an affirmative claim for reparations with the Commission within the two-year period provided by 16 (3). But Congress has relieved the Government from filing such anticipatory suits by expressly authorizing the General Accounting Office to deduct overpayments from subsequent bills of the carrier if, on post-audit, it finds that the United States has been overcharged.\n16\n This right was thought to be a necessary measure to protect the Government, since carriers' bills must be paid on presentation and before audit. On respondents' theory the Government could invoke this right only at the peril of losing its defenses in a later suit by the carrier. Evidently this was not the purpose of Congress in authorizing unilateral set-off.\n17\n\u00a0\n\nWe hold, therefore, that the limitation of 16 (3) does not bar a reference to the Interstate Commerce Commission of questions raised by way of defense and within the Commission's primary jurisdiction, as were these questions relating to the applicable tariff.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nThere remains the question of whether the Court of Claims properly dismissed the Government's defense of estoppel as to the respondents Bangor and Seaboard. We deal with it now because that defense would be reached should the further proceedings below, which must follow in consequence of what we have already said, result in \n\n[352 \nU.S. 59, 75]\n\u00a0\n adherence to the view that Item 1820 applies to these shipments.\n18\n\u00a0\n\nThe Government's claim is that the Bangor and Seaboard were estopped from charging the \"1820\" rate because of the Army's reliance on a ruling of the Official Classification Committee, a railroad tariff agency to which these two respondents belonged, that this type of napalm gel bomb shipment would be carried at a lower rate. The Court of Claims rejected this defense because (1) the ruling was later withdrawn by the Committee; (2) the Government had shown no detrimental reliance on the ruling; (3) it had paid the high rate billed for all shipments; and (4) neither carrier had acquiesced in the Committee's ruling.\n\nWe think that the Court of Claims erred in disposing of this defense by summary judgment. It appears to be undisputed that the ruling in question was not rescinded until after all of these shipments had been made.\n19\n The Government's affidavits in opposition to the motion for summary judgment were, in our opinion, sufficient to entitle it to an opportunity to prove reliance and detriment. The fact that the Government paid the carrier's bills as rendered is without significance in light of 322 of the Transportation Act, supra, requiring payment \"upon presentation\" of such bills and postponing final settlement until audit. And the question whether the Official Classification Committee had authority to bind these two carriers to acceptance of a lower rate presents \n\n[352 \nU.S. 59, 76]\n\u00a0\n issues of fact which must be tried. Nor, unlike the case of a private shipper, do we think that the defense of estoppel is unavailable to the Government. See 49 U.S.C. 22. Cf. Oregon-Wash. R. & N. Co. v. United States, \n255 \nU.S. 339\n; Western Pac. R. Co. v. United States, \n255 \nU.S. 349\n.\n20\n We conclude that the Government should have an opportunity to prove estoppel, without any intimation, of course, as to whether it will be able to establish the defense.\n\nThe judgment below must be reversed and the case remanded to the Court of Claims for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE DOUGLAS dissents from a reference of these matters to the Interstate Commerce Commission, since he is of the view that the principles of Great Northern R. Co. v. Merchants Elevator Co., \n259 \nU.S. 285\n, are applicable here.\n\nMR. JUSTICE REED and MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The suits were brought under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. 1491.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 54 Stat. 955, 49 U.S.C. 66. This section provides: \"Payment for transportation of the United States mail and of persons or property \n\n[352 \nU.S. 59, 61]\n\u00a0\n for or on behalf of the United States by any common carrier subject to the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended, or the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938, shall be made upon presentation of bills therefore, prior to audit or settlement by the General Accounting Office, but the right is hereby reserved to the United States Government to deduct the amount of any overpayment to any such carrier from any amount subsequently found to be due such carrier.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] It is not entirely clear from the record just what rate the Government believes is applicable to these shipments. It seems to concede that Item 1895 of Consolidated Freight Classification No. 17, covering \"Empty Aerial Bombs,\" does not apply, although this was the original classification assigned to such shipments by the Official Classification Committee, a railroad tariff agency. The essence of the Government's position seems to be that these shipments, being nonincendiary, were a mere combination of gasoline, napalm thickener, and steel casings. Since these three items, standing alone, are all carried at the fifth-class rate, the Government urges that the \"combination rule\" should apply and the articles be carried at the same fifth-class rate under Rule 18 of Consolidated Freight Classification No. 17.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] In that case the Court of Claims held Item 1820 applicable to shipments similar to those involved here. The Government did not seek review of that decision.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] 132 Ct. Cl. 115, 131 F. Supp. 919. The dissenters were Judge Madden and Chief Judge Jones.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] 24 Stat. 384, as amended, 49 U.S.C. 16 (3).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] The Court of Claims stated in the Union Pacific case, 125 Ct. Cl., at 393, 111 F. Supp., at 268: \"At the outset, it should be noted that while this court has no rate-making functions . . . the construction and application of published rates and classifications are proper matters for the courts as well as for the Interstate Commerce Commission.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Jaffe, Primary Jurisdiction Reconsidered, 102 Univ. Pa. L. Rev. 577, 583-584 (1954).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] In response to the motion for summary judgment the Government presented affidavits by chemical engineers stating that napalm gel is not incendiary. But these affidavits become meaningful only if the court knows the precise relevance of the incendiary quality of the shipments to the setting of the rate.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] The artificiality of trying to separate the issue of \"construction\" from that of \"reasonableness as applied\" is illustrated by the Court of Claims' holding in the Union Pacific case, supra. There, after holding that the absence of bursters and fuses did \"not affect the identity of the articles\" as incendiary bombs, the court went on to say that \"it may well be that a lower tariff rate should apply to the carriage of the less hazardous incendiary bomb [one without burster and fuse]. This question is not within our jurisdiction, however, as the question of the reasonableness of rates is a matter entrusted by Congress solely to the Interstate Commerce Commission.\" 125 Ct. Cl., at 393, 394, 111 F. Supp., at 268. Similarly, the Government here concedes that the question of hazard \"goes to the issue of reasonableness,\" although arguing that it is \"also relevant to the question of tariff interpretation, for, like any other instrument, a tariff is to be read in the light of its known purposes and in a manner which avoids unnecessary and gross unfairness.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] 24 Stat. 384, as amended, 49 U.S.C. 16 (3) (a).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] The suits were instituted in 1954. In the Western Pacific case the carrier's claims accrued in 1948 and 1950, when the United States paid the lower rate instead of the \"1820\" rate for which it was billed. As to the Bangor and Seaboard cases, where the United States initially paid the \"1820\" rate as billed (presumably in 1944 when the shipments were made), and subsequently readjusted that rate on post-audit, it is impossible to say when the claims accrued as the record is silent as to when the post-audit readjustment was made.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] Although questioning the soundness of this ruling which subjects carriers' claims against the United States as shipper to a more lenient statute of limitations than that applicable to their claims against other shippers, the Government has not challenged it here. We therefore do not pass on it.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] The opinion of the Court of Claims does not expressly refer to the two-year period of 16 (3). The cases cited by the court, however, make it clear that it had in mind that provision, probably 16 (3) (c), which reads: \"For recovery of overcharges action at law shall be begun or complaint filed with the commission against carriers subject to this chapter within two years from the time the cause of action accrues, and not after . . . .\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] The fact that in this instance the issues of tariff \"construction\" and \"reasonableness\" were both referrable to the Commission does not, of course, bring the case within Morrisdale. Both of these questions were issues only by reason of the Government's defense; neither was part of the carrier's affirmative case. In other words, had the applicability of this tariff not been challenged by the Government, the carrier's own case would have presented nothing which was referrable to the Commission.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] See n. 2, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] Statistics furnished by the Comptroller General show that since 1948 the General Accounting Office has post-audited 17,220,783 bills presented by carriers. In the same period post-audit revealed overpayment in 1,102,654 cases. The magnitude of these figures underscores the impossibility of requiring the Government to file anticipatory suits before the I. C. C. in every case where it thinks the carrier might later sue to recover the amount set off by the Government.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] The estoppel defense is not asserted against the Western Pacific, so that this case must in any event go to the Commission. Hence adjudication of the estoppel defense as to the Bangor and Seaboard would no doubt await the Commission's determination as to whether the \"1820\" tariff was applicable to these shipments, and reasonable if so applied.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 19\n] The ruling was made in 1943 and was confirmed in 1945. The Bangor and Seaboard shipments were made in 1944.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 20\n] A private shipper may not invoke the defense of estoppel to prevent a carrier from collecting a higher applicable tariff rate than that which may have been actually quoted by the carrier. This results from 6 (7) of the Interstate Commerce Act, 24 Stat. 380, as amended, 49 U.S.C. 6 (7), forbidding departures from the published tariff. See Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago & St. Louis R. Co. v. Fink, \n250 \nU.S. 577, 583\n. The same considerations do not obtain when the Government is the shipper, in view of 22 of the Act, 24 Stat. 387, as amended, 49 U.S.C. 22, providing that \"nothing in this chapter shall prevent the carriage, storage, or handling of property free or at reduced rates for the United States.\" \n\n[352 \nU.S. 59, 77]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","106":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v.

With him on the brief was Earle K. Moore.\n\nMR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis is a denaturalization proceeding under 340 (a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952.\n1\n The sole question is whether 340 (a) makes the filing of the \"affidavit showing good cause\" a prerequisite to maintenance of the suit. The District Court held that it does \n\n[351 \nU.S. 91, 92]\n\u00a0\n and ordered the complaint dismissed unless the Government filed an affidavit showing good cause within 60 days. As this was not done, the complaint was dismissed without prejudice to the Government's right to institute an action to denaturalize the respondent upon filing the affidavit. 125 F. Supp. 551. On appeal by the Government the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed, adopting the opinion of the District Court. 221 F.2d 805. We granted certiorari, \n350 \nU.S. 817\n, because of an asserted conflict with decisions of the Seventh\n2\n and Ninth\n3\n Circuits and because of the importance of the question in the administration of the immigration and naturalization laws.\n\nRespondent Ettore Zucca was naturalized on January 4, 1944. In 1954, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, proceeding under 340 (a), filed a verified complaint in the United States District Court in his District seeking revocation of respondent's naturalization on the grounds of illegality, concealment of material facts, and willful misrepresentation.\n\nThe complaint alleged that respondent, at his naturalization hearing and in his petition for naturalization, had falsely sworn \"that he did not belong to and was not associated with any organization which teaches or advocates the overthrow of existing government in this country . . .,\" that it was his \"intention in good faith to become a citizen of the United States and to renounce absolutely and forever all allegiance and fidelity to any [foreign powers] . . .,\" and that he was and had been \"attached to the principles of the Constitution of the United States and well disposed to the good order and happiness of the United States.\" This was followed by \n\n[351 \nU.S. 91, 93]\n\u00a0\n a general allegation of membership in the Communist Party and \"other organizations affiliated with or controlled by the Communist Party of the United States from 1925 to 1947,\" and equally general allegations that respondent procured his naturalization by concealment and willful misrepresentation in that he concealed the facts relating to his membership in the Communist Party and affiliated organizations and otherwise swore falsely as to his intentions and beliefs. The pleader concluded that \"good cause exists for the institution of this suit . . . .\" The complaint, no part of which was alleged on information and belief, was verified by an Assistant United States Attorney. When respondent sought to take depositions of this Attorney, he was met with an affidavit in opposition denying personal knowledge.\n4\n Respondent then filed his motion to dismiss on the ground, inter alia, that 340 (a) required the filing of an affidavit showing good cause and that this requirement had not been complied \n\n[351 \nU.S. 91, 94]\n\u00a0\n with. As stated above, the motion to dismiss was granted on this ground.\n\nThe Government argues that a reading of the statute and its legislative history leads to the conclusion that the filing of an \"affidavit showing good cause\" is not a prerequisite to maintaining denaturalization proceedings under 340 (a). We do not agree.\n\nThe affidavit provision with which we are here concerned first appeared in 15 of the Act of June 29, 1906.\n5\n Without substantial change, it was carried forward in the laws of 1940\n6\n and 1952,\n7\n currently reading as follows:\n\n \"SEC. 340. (a) It shall be the duty of the United States district attorneys for the respective districts, upon affidavit showing good cause therefor, to institute proceedings in any court specified in subsection (a) of section 310 of this title in the judicial district in which the naturalized citizen may reside at the time of bringing suit, for the purpose of revoking and setting aside the order admitting such person to citizenship and canceling the certificate of naturalization on the ground that such order and certificate of naturalization were procured by concealment of a material fact or by willful misrepresentation, . . . .\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n Were we obliged to rely solely on the wording of the statute, we would have no difficulty in reaching the conclusion that the filing of the affidavit is a prerequisite to maintaining a denaturalization suit. This conclusion is not altered by a consideration of the Government's highly \n\n[351 \nU.S. 91, 95]\n\u00a0\n speculative suggestions as to the meaning of the legislative history. On the contrary, we think that it is entirely consistent with the Court's statement in Bindczyck v. Finucane, \n342 \nU.S. 76\n, that Congress acted \"[w]ith a view to protecting the Government against fraud while safeguarding citizenship from abrogation except by a clearly defined procedure . . . .\" Id., at 83.\n\nThe natural meaning of the language used in 340 (a) is that filing of the affidavit is a procedural prerequisite to maintenance of the suit. In the Bindczyck case, this Court held that 338 (a) of the Nationality Act of 1940, predecessor of 340 (a), sets forth the exclusive procedure for denaturalization.\n8\n Despite that decision, the Government would have us hold now that the grant of power to maintain denaturalization suits is found in the general duty of United States Attorneys to prosecute all civil actions in which the United States is concerned,\n9\n and that 340 (a) merely imposes the \"additional duty . . . to act, not alone on their own knowledge and judgment, but on the basis of an affidavit of good cause furnished by private citizens.\" In effect the Government argues that the affidavit is required only when the proceeding is to be brought on the complaint of a private citizen. We need not decide whether a private citizen may ever file such a complaint. The short answer in this case is that the Government laid its complaint expressly under 340 (a).\n\nWhile arguing that the words of 340 are words of limitation on the discretion of the United States Attorney, the Government apparently concedes that the \n\n[351 \nU.S. 91, 96]\n\u00a0\n venue and notice provisions of the Section are generally applicable to denaturalization proceedings. Its argument overlooks the fact that the affidavit and venue provisions are in the same sentence. If the affidavit were required only when the United States Attorney proceeded on the complaint of a private citizen, then only in such a case would the venue be restricted to the district of the defendant's residence. We could accept such a limiting construction of the statute only upon a very clear showing that Congress meant something other than what it said.\n\nThe original Act of 1906 was the culmination of many years of study by Congress and a commission of which the Attorney General was a leading spirit and his Assistant the Chairman. Shortly after its enactment, the same Attorney General rendered an opinion to the Secretary of Commerce and Labor to the effect that the filing of an affidavit was \"necessary to give a United States attorney authority to institute proceedings in any court for the cancellation of a naturalization certificate.\"\n10\n In such circumstances, a contemporaneous construction of a statute by the officer charged with its enforcement is entitled to great weight. Fawcus Machine Co. v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 375, 378\n; Norwegian Nitrogen Products Co. v. United States, \n288 \nU.S. 294, 315\n. Over a period of years, however, there has been some conflict among the circuits concerning the affidavit requirement.\n11\n The Government \n\n[351 \nU.S. 91, 97]\n\u00a0\n relies particularly on our affirmance of the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Schwinn v. United States, \n311 \nU.S. 616\n. The Court decided that case on the sole ground of illegal procurement. Although the necessity of the affidavit was considered below in view of the Government's failure to offer proof in support of its allegation that an affidavit of good cause had been furnished, the question was not presented to this Court.\n12\n\u00a0\n\nPrior to the decision in the Schwinn case the practice of the Justice Department seems generally to have been to institute denaturalization proceedings upon affidavit showing good cause. The Government does not now contend that it has abandoned that practice. It merely claims the right not to do so when it chooses, as clearly appears from portions of a Department of Justice memorandum which has been brought to the Court's attention.\n13\n\u00a0\n\n[351 \nU.S. 91, 98]\n\u00a0\n We are unimpressed by the reasoning of that memorandum. We think that the public interest is not served by taking such liberties with a specific statutory requirement designed for the protection of naturalized citizens. And we fail to see that the requirement imposes a burden on the Government. At this Term, it has been represented to us that the usual practice is that, \"if sufficient grounds are shown, an `affidavit showing good cause' (see Section 340 (a) of the Act . . .) is prepared and executed, and is forwarded as an aid to the formal judicial proceedings . . . .\"\n14\n\u00a0\n\nLastly the Government contends, as an alternate ground for reversal, that no harm is done to the defendant because the complaint itself is verified and, therefore, accomplishes the function of the affidavit. With this we cannot agree. The complaint, under modern practice, is required merely \n\n[351 \nU.S. 91, 99]\n\u00a0\n to allege ultimate facts while the affidavit must set forth evidentiary matters showing good cause for cancellation of citizenship.\n15\n\u00a0\n\nIn the Bindczyck case, supra, the Court summed up the purpose of and approach to denaturalization proceedings as follows:\n\n\"[W]e cannot escape the conclusion that in its detailed provisions for revoking a naturalization because of fraud or illegal procurement not appearing on the face of the record, Congress formulated a self-contained, exclusive procedure. With a view to protecting the Government against fraud while safeguarding citizenship from abrogation except by a clearly defined procedure, Congress insisted on the detailed, explicit provisions of 15.\n\n\n \". . . if citizenship was granted, it was to be proof against attacks for fraud or illegal procurement based on evidence outside the record, except through the proceedings prescribed in 15. The congressional scheme, providing carefully for the representation of the Government's interest before the grant of citizenship and a detailed, safeguarded procedure for attacking the decree on evidence of fraud outside the record, covers the whole ground. Every national interest is thereby protected.\" \n342 \nU.S., at 83\n, 84.\n\n\n This proceeding was concededly brought under 340 (a). We hold that this is the only Section under which a United States attorney may institute denaturalization proceedings, and that the affidavit showing good cause is a procedural prerequisite to the maintenance of proceedings thereunder.\n\nThe mere filing of a proceeding for denaturalization results in serious consequences to a defendant. Even if \n\n[351 \nU.S. 91, 100]\n\u00a0\n his citizenship is not cancelled, his reputation is tarnished and his standing in the community damaged. Congress recognized this danger and provided that a person, once admitted to American citizenship, should not be subject to legal proceedings to defend his citizenship without a preliminary showing of good cause. Such a safeguard must not be lightly regarded. We believe that, not only in some cases but in all cases, the District Attorney must, as a prerequisite to the initiation of such proceedings, file an affidavit showing good cause. The District Court below correctly dismissed the proceedings in this case because of the failure of the Government to file the required affidavit and the judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE HARLAN took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 66 Stat. 163, 260, as amended, 68 Stat. 1232, 8 U.S.C.

Pre-Trial Procedure,' the defendant can probably obtain most of the government's evidence by a proper utilization of the methods of discovery provided in Rules 16, 33, and 34. It, therefore, may be advisable at the outset to furnish him with a reasonable amount of the government's evidence in order to reduce the chance of these discovery rules being employed, and thus avoid the ensuing delay. If this is done, it would seem that the affidavit rather than the complaint is the proper place in which to recite evidence. \"In the event it is decided in a given case to furnish the defendant with some of the government's evidence, it is recommended that an affidavit be prepared and served with the complaint and that in the affidavit there be recited briefly the nature of the evidence to be relied upon. This recitation of evidence should be of a general nature \n\n[351 \nU.S. 91, 98]\n\u00a0\n but sufficient to reduce the ordinary chance of the discovery rules being employed and at the same time to reduce the likelihood of the government having to oppose a motion for a bill of particulars. On the other hand, it should not be so complete as to provide the defendant with the names of witnesses and possibly can be so phrased as not to disclose their identity. Similarly, it may be disadvantageous to make it so complete as to identify specific instruments or writings, for this may increase the likelihood of a demand for their production under Rule 34. It would seem sufficient to set out the general substance or type of statements or writings known to have been made without quoting them. It would also seem proper to aver generally membership and leadership in the German-American Bund or other un-American organizations, refusal of military service, general propaganda activities, etc. \"If it is believed undesirable to attach an affidavit to the complaint and to serve it upon the defendant, as discussed above, in that instance no reference should be made in the complaint to an affidavit having been prepared and as constituting the basis of the action.\" Circular No. 3663, Dept. of Justice, Supp. No. 9, April 6, 1943 (mimeographed), p. 87, printed in a supplemental memorandum filed by the Government in this case.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] Brief for the United States, United States v. Minker, \n350 \nU.S. 179\n (No. 35, October Term, 1955), at p. 34.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] United States v. Richmond, 17 F.2d 28; United States v. Salomon, 231 F. 928.\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK, with whom MR. JUSTICE REED and MR. JUSTICE MINTON join, dissenting.\n\nThe Court's ruling today seriously obstructs the Government in filing denaturalization proceedings in this type of case. It reverses a long line of cases in the lower federal courts\n1\n and disregards a consistent administrative practice of over thirty years standing, a period which \n\n[351 \nU.S. 91, 101]\n\u00a0\n includes two recodifications of the immigration laws. Furthermore, the identical point on which the case today is decided was present in two earlier cases where it apparently was not considered important enough to be presented to this Court.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nThe only authority for the Court's action is an unpublished, informal, and somewhat ambiguous inter-departmental letter of the Attorney General written in 1907. While any Attorney General might well be proud to see his views given such lasting effect, he undoubtedly would be surprised to learn that the authority of such an informal statement could overrule later court decisions and a thirty-year, firmly established position of the Department of Justice. Many cases witness the fact that the Court has often given little or no weight to carefully drawn opinions of the Attorney General on questions of statutory interpretation.\n\nBut my major objection to the decision today is the extreme burden placed on the Government in cases such as this. The Court construes 340 (a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act to require something more than was filed in the present case. The complaint here was verified; the Assistant United States Attorney swore that the facts alleged in the complaint were \"true\" and \"that the sources of his information . . . are the records which are on file in his office.\" Thus the complaint in this case was supported by the jurat of a notary public \n\n[351 \nU.S. 91, 102]\n\u00a0\n and the sworn statement of an Assistant United States Attorney who held office by virtue of his oath to carry out his official duties fairly and impartially. No more was present in Schneiderman v. United States, \n320 \nU.S. 118\n.\n\nThe complaint alleged that Zucca had lied in his alien registration statement in 1940, and in his preliminary naturalization examination and testimony before a naturalization examiner in 1952. He is alleged to have stated under oath that \"he did not belong to and was not associated with any organization which teaches or advocates the overthrow of existing government.\" The complaint then alleges that Zucca \"was a member of the Communist Party of the United States, including the Workers Communist Party . . . from 1925 to 1947.\" Under 305 of the Nationality Act of 1940, the complaint continues, Zucca's naturalization was illegal.\n\nBut the majority declares that these sworn allegations are insufficient. It makes a vague reference to the pleading of \"ultimate facts while the affidavit must set forth evidentiary matters showing good cause for cancellation of citizenship.\" From this statement I can draw only one conclusion. As respondent contends, \"good cause\" means \"that the Government must furnish the Court with sworn statements by persons having personal knowledge of the facts . . . Congress could not have intended that the courts be required to accept the second-hand statements of investigators . . . .\"\n3\n Apparently neither the United States Attorney nor anyone in the Immigration Service or the FBI can make such an affidavit unless he has personal knowledge of the facts. This would limit verification by these officers to cases based on prior undisclosed \n\n[351 \nU.S. 91, 103]\n\u00a0\n criminal convictions, arrival age where controlling, etc.\n\nBut in proceedings based solely on membership in the Communist Party substantially different conditions prevail. Invariably, membership can be proved only from the testimony of other members concerning attendance at meetings, payment of dues, etc. There are no membership cards in the Party and have been none for more than a decade. If these evidential methods of proof - the testimony and identity of undercover agents - must be disclosed in an affidavit, the Government must choose between foregoing denaturalization cases and drying up its source of information before the proceeding can be brought. It is common knowledge among law enforcement officers that witnesses are affidavit-shy, particularly in cases involving subversion. Often, testimony can be obtained only in court with the aid of compulsory process. The difficulties in requiring exposure by affidavit are overwhelming and decisive in cases of this type.\n\nI do not believe Congress ever intended such a rule. To me 340 (a) is clear and unambiguous. Its plain reading is that proceedings may be filed by the United States Attorney \"upon affidavit showing good cause therefor.\" Here the Attorney swore to specific charges which certainly do constitute \"good cause.\" The sworn statement that petitioner was a member of the Communist Party and the Workers Communist Party from 1925 to 1947 alleges a prima facie case. To me it seems obvious that the purpose of 340 (a) - to reduce the possibility of spurious denaturalization proceedings - is fully served by such a sworn statement.\n\nNor did the Congress intend that there should be two trials of issues of fact in these cases. To require the filing of evidential affidavits implies, as Zucca contends, extensive testing of their sufficiency before trial. The defendant is thus given two chances at the Government's case. \n\n[351 \nU.S. 91, 104]\n\u00a0\n There is no comparable requirement for an indictment in a criminal prosecution, Costello v. United States, \n350 \nU.S. 359\n. But denaturalization is only a civil proceeding to withdraw a privilege wrongfully obtained. There has always been the requirement of proof under cross-examination of charges against the naturalized citizen, but apparently in this case the Court authorizes an additional procedure. Before his trial in this denaturalization proceeding, Zucca may file a bill of particulars and take depositions of each witness signing a \"good cause\" affidavit. The scope and reliability of the affidavits are then made the subject of judicial inquiry.\n4\n If the Government proves its case at this stage, it may then go to trial, where the same evidence is considered again. To my way of thinking, this clearly frustrates an important congressional program, a part of the broader one designed to protect our country from Communist infiltration.\n\nIn my opinion 340 (a) requires the United States Attorney to allege in a sworn complaint sufficient factual information to show a prima facie case for denaturalization. At most it should be sufficient for an officer of the Immigration and Naturalization Service familiar with the case to make such allegations under oath. If the Court would require this paper to be headed \"Affidavit\" and contained in a separate blue backing, I would have no objection, though I see nothing to be gained from such a technical labeling. But as I read the Court's decision today it goes much further than this, and it may well submerge the denaturalization procedure established by Congress in a morass of unintended procedural difficulties.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Schwinn v.

HUTCHINSON CITY(1956)\nNo. 13\nArgued: Decided: December 10, 1956\n\n\n\n\n Pursuant to Article 2, Chapter 26, of the General Statutes of Kansas, a City filed an action to condemn part of appellant's land for public use. Acting under 26-202, commissioners appointed to determine compensation gave no notice of a hearing except by publication in the official city newspaper, though appellant was a resident of Kansas and his name was known to the city and was on the official records. Alleging that he had no actual knowledge of the proceedings until after damages had been fixed and the time for appeal had passed, appellant sued in equity for an injunction against trespass and for other relief.

Littooy argued the cause and filed a brief for appellees.\n\nOpinion of the Court by MR. JUSTICE BLACK, announced by MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS.\n\nThe appellant Lee Walker owned certain land in the City of Hutchinson, Kansas. In 1954 the City filed an action in the District Court of Reno County, Kansas, to condemn part of his property in order to open, widen, and \n\n[352 \nU.S. 112, 113]\n\u00a0\n extend one of the City's streets. The proceeding was instituted under the authority of Article 2, Chapter 26 of the General Statutes of Kansas, 1949. Pursuant to 26-201 of that statute\n1\n the court appointed three commissioners to determine compensation for the property taken and for any other damage suffered. These commissioners were required by 26-202 to give landowners at least ten days' notice of the time and place of their proceedings. Such notice could be given either \"in writing . . . or by one publication in the official city paper . . . .\"\n2\n The appellant here was not given notice \n\n[352 \nU.S. 112, 114]\n\u00a0\n in writing but publication was made in the official city paper of Hutchinson. The commissioners fixed his damages at $725, and pursuant to statute, this amount was deposited with the city treasurer for the benefit of appellant. Section 26-205 authorized an appeal from the award of the commissioners if taken within 30 days after the filing of their report. Appellant took no appeal within the prescribed period. Some time later, however, he brought the present equitable action in the Kansas District Court. His petition alleged that he had never been notified of the condemnation proceedings and knew nothing about them until after the time for appeal had passed. He charged that the newspaper publication authorized by the statute was not sufficient notice to satisfy the Fourteenth Amendment's due process requirements. He asked the court to enjoin the City of Hutchinson and its agents from entering or trespassing on the property \"and for such other and further relief as to this Court seem[s] just and equitable.\"\n3\n After a hearing, the Kansas trial \n\n[352 \nU.S. 112, 115]\n\u00a0\n court denied relief, holding that the newspaper publication provided for by 26-202 was sufficient notice of the Commissioners' proceedings to meet the requirements of the Due Process Clause. Agreeing with the trial court, the State Supreme Court affirmed. 178 Kan. 263, 284 P.2d 1073. The case is properly here on appeal under 28 U.S.C. 1257 (2). The only question we find it necessary to decide is whether, under circumstances of this kind, newspaper publication alone measures up to the quality of notice the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires as a prerequisite to proceedings to fix compensation in condemnation cases.\n\nIt cannot be disputed that due process requires that an owner whose property is taken for public use must be given a hearing in determining just compensation. The right to a hearing is meaningless without notice. In Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., \n339 \nU.S. 306\n, we gave thorough consideration to the problem of adequate notice under the Due Process Clause. That case establishes the rule that, if feasible, notice must be reasonably calculated to inform parties of proceedings which may directly and adversely affect their legally protected interests.\n4\n We there called attention to the impossibility of setting up a rigid formula as to the kind of notice that must be given; notice required will vary with circumstances and conditions. We recognized \n\n[352 \nU.S. 112, 116]\n\u00a0\n that in some cases it might not be reasonably possible to give personal notice, for example where people are missing or unknown.\n\nMeasured by the principles stated in the Mullane case, we think that the notice by publication here falls short of the requirements of due process. It is common knowledge that mere newspaper publication rarely informs a landowner of proceedings against his property. In Mullane we pointed out many of the infirmities of such notice and emphasized the advantage of some kind of personal notice to interested parties. In the present case there seem to be no compelling or even persuasive reasons why such direct notice cannot be given. Appellant's name was known to the city and was on the official records. Even a letter would have apprised him that his property was about to be taken and that he must appear if he wanted to be heard as to its value.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nNothing in our prior decisions requires a holding that newspaper publication under the circumstances here provides adequate notice of a hearing to determine compensation. The State relies primarily on Huling v. Kaw Valley Railway & Improvement Co., \n130 \nU.S. 559\n. We think that reliance is misplaced. Decided in 1889, that case upheld notice by publication in a condemnation proceeding on the ground that the landowner was a nonresident. Since appellant in this case is a resident of Kansas, we are not called upon to consider the extent to which Mullane may have undermined the reasoning of the Huling decision.\n6\n\u00a0\n\n[352 \nU.S. 112, 117]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThere is nothing peculiar about litigation between the Government and its citizens that should deprive those citizens of a right to be heard. Nor is there any reason to suspect that it will interfere with the orderly condemnation of property to preserve effectively the citizen's right to a hearing in connection with just compensation. In too many instances notice by publication is no notice at all. It may leave government authorities free to fix one-sidedly the amount that must be paid owners for their property taken for public use.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons the judgment of the Supreme Court of Kansas is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE BRENNAN took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 26-201 reads in part as follows:\n\n\"Private property for city purposes; survey; ordinance fixing benefit district; application to district court; commissioners. Whenever it shall be deemed necessary by any governing body of any city to appropriate private property for the opening, widening, or extending any street or alley, . . . the governing body shall cause a survey and description of the land or easement so required to be made by some competent engineer and file with the city clerk. And thereupon the governing body shall make an order setting forth such condemnation and for what purpose the same is to be used. . . . The governing body, as soon as practicable after making the order declaring the appropriation of such land necessary . . . shall present a written application to the judge of the district court of the county in which said land is situated describing the land sought to be taken and setting forth the land necessary for the use of the city and . . . praying for the appointment of three commissioners to make an appraisement and assessment of the damages therefor.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Section 26-202 read in part as follows:\n\n\"Notice to property owners or lienholders of record; appraisement and assessment of damages; reports. The commissioners appointed by the judge of the district court shall give any owner and any lienholder of record of the property sought to be taken at least ten days' notice in writing of the time and place when and where the damage will be assessed, or by one publication in the official city paper, and at the time fixed by such notice shall, upon actual view, appraise the value of the lands taken and assess the other damages done to the owners of such property, respectively, by such appropriations. For the payment of such value and damages the commissioners shall \n\n[352 \nU.S. 112, 114]\n\u00a0\n assess against the city the amount of the benefit to the public generally and the remainder of such damages against the property within the benefit district which shall in the opinion of the appraisers be especially benefited by the proposed improvement. The said commissioners may adjourn as often and for such length of time as may be deemed convenient, and may, during any adjournment, perfect or correct all errors or omissions in the giving of notice by serving new notice or making new publication, citing corporations or individual property owners who have not been notified or to whom defective notice or insufficient notice has been given, and notice of any adjourned meeting shall be as effective as notice of the first meeting of the commissioners. . . .\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Although the relief prayed for was an injunction against the taking, the Supreme Court of Kansas evidently construed the pleadings as adequately raising the question whether notice was sufficient to assure the constitutionality of the compensation procedure; in its opinion it passed only on 26-202, dealing with the latter problem. Since Kansas requires a showing of actual damage for standing to maintain an equity suit, McKeever v. Buker, 80 Kan. 201, 101 P. 991, \n\n[352 \nU.S. 112, 115]\n\u00a0\n and since the Kansas court took the complaint as alleging damage as a result of the compensation rather than the taking procedure, the pleading was evidently treated by the state court as alleging monetary damage resulting from the lack of notice in connection with compensation. We accept this construction of the complaint by the Kansas court as sufficient allegation of damage. See Bragg v. Weaver, \n251 \nU.S. 57\n, where the adequacy of notice of compensation proceedings was passed on by this Court in an injunction suit like this one.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] We applied the same rule in Covey v. Town of Somers, \n351 \nU.S. 141\n; see also City of New York v. New York, N. H. & H. R. Co., \n344 \nU.S. 293\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Section 26-202 was amended in 1955, after this Court's decision in Mullane, to require that the city must give notice to property owners by mailing a copy of the newspaper notice to their last known residence, unless such residence could not be located by diligent inquiry. Kan. Gen. Stat., 1949 (Supp. 1955), 26.202.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The State also relies on North Laramie Land Co. v. Hoffman, \n268 \nU.S. 276\n, and Bragg v. Weaver, \n251 \nU.S. 57\n. But the holdings in \n\n[352 \nU.S. 112, 117]\n\u00a0\n those cases do not conflict with our holding here. The North Laramie case upheld c. 73, 2, of the 1913 Laws of Wyoming, which provided for notice by publication in a newspaper and required that a copy of the newspaper must be sent to the landowner by registered mail. This Court's opinion stated at p. 282 that: \"The Supreme Court of Wyoming held that the procedure followed complied with the statutory requirements. By that determination we are bound.\" In Bragg v. Weaver, supra, at pp. 61-62, this Court stated that the controlling Virginia statute provided that a landowner must be notified \"in writing and shall have thirty days after such notice within which to appeal. . . . It is apparent therefore that special care is taken to afford him ample opportunity to appeal and thereby to obtain a full hearing in the circuit court.\"\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, dissenting.\n\nAppellant contends that the provision of Kan. Gen. Stat., 1949, 26-202, allowing notice of the hearing on compensation to be given by one publication in the official city newspaper of itself violates the provision of the \n\n[352 \nU.S. 112, 118]\n\u00a0\n Fourteenth Amendment that no State shall \"deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law. . . .\"\n1\n The first issue that faces us, however, is to decide from the pleadings exactly what it is that we must decide in this case.\n\nOnce appellant discovered that his land had been condemned and that the time for appeal from the award of the commissioners had passed, various possible courses of action, followed separately or in combination and each raising different issues, were open to him. If he considered the award fair but still desired to keep his land, he could have contended that unconstitutionality of the notice for the hearing on compensation invalidated the taking. If he considered the award unfair, he could have \n\n[352 \nU.S. 112, 119]\n\u00a0\n alleged in an appropriate action the unconstitutionality of the notice of the compensation hearing and the inadequacy of the compensation and sought to obtain fair compensation, see Ward v. Love County, \n253 \nU.S. 17\n, or to restrain entry onto his land until he received a hearing under Kan. Gen. Stat., 1949, 26-202, or, making a further allegation of the invalidity of the taking, to obtain a permanent injunction. At this stage, it is not relevant for me to imply any opinion on the merits of any of these possible courses of action.\n\nOn a fair reading of the complaint, appellant chose to pursue only the first course. The theory of his action, an attempt to restrain the city from trespassing on his land, is that he still has the right to possession. His petition for injunction based this right to possession solely on the allegation that the statutory notice was insufficient. Nowhere in his petition for an injunction does appellant make any factual allegation that the money deposited by the commissioners did not represent the fair value of his land and therefore left him out of pocket. Nowhere did he indicate that he wanted an injunction only until he received a hearing. The whole theory of his petition is that the property that was being taken without due process of law was his land, not its money value.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nIn a memorandum filed after oral argument in this Court, appellant contends that the allegation of \"irreparable damage\" is a sufficient allegation of monetary loss. He states: \"Of course, there could be no irreparable damage - indeed there could be no damage at all - unless the amount of the award was less than the actual value of the property. Had this been an action for damages, then an allegation of the differences in value would logically \n\n[352 \nU.S. 112, 120]\n\u00a0\n have been found in the petition. But it was an injunction proceeding.\"\n\nBut an allegation of \"irreparable damage\" is merely a legal conclusion, flowing from, and justified by, the necessary allegation of facts warranting injunctive relief. The usual factual assertion underlying such an allegation in a suit to restrain trespass is that the threatened continuous nature of the entry represents the \"irreparable damage.\" Indeed, in his petition for injunction, appellant made the usual factual assertion, immediately preceding the prayer for relief:\n\n \"That at the present moment defendant City of Hutchinson, either itself, or by contractors employed by it, is, or is threatening to enter upon said real estate owned by the Plaintiff, and this for the purpose of building a highway across said real estate, all in utter and complete disregard of the rights of this Plaintiff.\"\n\n\n In view of this assertion and the absence of any other assertion with respect to \"irreparable damage,\" appellant's claim that monetary loss is alleged is baseless.\n\nIf the Kansas Supreme Court had construed the pleading of \"irreparable damage\" as implying a factual assertion that the award was less than the fair value of the land, I would accept that construction. See Saltonstall v. Saltonstall, \n276 \nU.S. 260, 267\n-268. But the Kansas Supreme Court did not construe the pleadings at all. It decided the case by upholding the constitutionality of the statute. Kansas has a right to make such an abstract determination for itself. This Court, however, can decide only \"Cases\" or \"Controversies.\" U.S. Const., Art. III, 2. It has no constitutional power to render advisory opinions. To assume that the Kansas courts construed these pleadings sub silentio as alleging monetary loss is to excogitate. A much more probable inference \n\n[352 \nU.S. 112, 121]\n\u00a0\n is that since the issue so controlling for this Court's jurisdiction was not raised in the pleadings, the Kansas court did not concern itself with it. In any event, lacking an explicit construction of the pleadings by the Kansas courts, we must construe the pleadings ourselves to decide what constitutional questions are here raised on the record as it comes to us. See Doremus v. Board of Education, \n342 \nU.S. 429, 432\n.\n\nIn my view, the only constitutional question raised by appellant is whether failure to give adequate notice of the hearing on compensation of itself invalidates the taking of his land, apart from any claim of loss. We have held many times that the State's interest in the expeditious handling of condemnation proceedings justifies the taking of land prior to payment, without violating the Due Process Clause, so long as adequate provision for payment of compensation is made. See, e. g., Bragg v. Weaver, \n251 \nU.S. 57, 62\n. Appellant must be able to show that the provisions for payment, as they operated in his case, were inadequate before he can attack the Kansas statutory scheme for compensation in condemnation cases. See Ashwander v. T. V. A., \n297 \nU.S. 288, 347\n and cases cited n. 6 (Brandeis, J., concurring); cf. Smith v. Indiana, \n191 \nU.S. 138, 148\n-149. Since on the record before us the compensation was not alleged to be inadequate, the taking was valid and the judgment of the Kansas Supreme Court should be affirmed. At the very least, the case should be returned to the Kansas court so that we may have the benefit of its construction of the pleadings. See Honeyman v. Hanan, \n300 \nU.S. 14\n.\n\nBut the Court, without explicitly construing the pleadings, passes upon the constitutionality of Kan. Gen. Stat., 1949, 26-202. Without intimating any opinion whether in the circumstances of this case appellant was denied the due process required in determining fair compensation for property taken under the power of \n\n[352 \nU.S. 112, 122]\n\u00a0\n eminent domain, I feel constrained to point out that the Court's decision does not hold the taking itself invalid and therefore does not require the Kansas court to grant an injunction so long as appellant's rights are protected.\n\n[For dissenting opinion of MR.

Johnson, members of the City Commission, all of the City of Hutchinson. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 112, 123]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"4. That on or about the 27th day of February, 1905, the Plaintiff acquired fee simple title through a Warranty Deed, duly executed by one Arthur Walker, which deed was duly recorded with the Register of Deeds of Reno County, Kansas, on the 28th day of February, 1905, in Book 85, \n\n[352 \nU.S. 112, 479]\n\u00a0\n, to the following described real estate, all situated in Reno County, Kansas:\n\n \"Lots thirty-seven (37), thirty-eight (38), thirty-nine (39), forty (40), forty-one (41), forty-two (42), forty-three (43), forty-four (44), forty-five (45), forty-six (46), forty-seven (47) and forty-eight (48), Block Five (5), Maple Grove Addition to the City of Hutchinson,\n\n\n\n\"and ever since that time, the Plaintiff has owned same, enjoyed quiet and peaceful possession thereof and likewise has had and enjoyed all the fruits of such ownership, and has paid, from time to time, all assessments and taxes of every kind and nature legally assessed against said real estate; that he is therefore now the legal and equitable owner of said real estate.\n\n\n\"5. That on or about the 12th day of April, 1954, the defendant City of Hutchinson, through its duly elected or appointed, qualified and acting officials, filed an action in the District Court of Reno County, Kansas, entitled:\n\n \"In the matter of the application of the city of Hutchinson, Kansas, a municipal corporation, for the appointment of commissioners in the matter of the condemnation of property for the acquisition of right of way for the opening, widening and extending of portions of Eleventh Avenue, Harrison Street and Twenty-third Avenue in the city of Hutchinson, Kansas,\n\n\n\n\"the same being docketed as Case No. 7867.\n\n\n\"6. That said action was for the purpose of taking from the Plaintiff and condemning certain portions of the above \n\n[352 \nU.S. 112, 124]\n\u00a0\n described real estate, as a by-pass, so to speak, for Hutchinson's Super-Sports Arena.\n\n\n\"7. That the Plaintiff has never been, at any time, notified in any manner that the City of Hutchinson coveted the bit of real estate as a by-pass to Hutchinson's Super-Sports Arena he has owned since 1905; nor has he ever been served with any summons, nor given any other personal notice of any kind whatsoever that said defendant City of Hutchinson had filed the aforesaid action for the purpose of taking a part of his said real estate.\n\n\n\"8. That the pretended right of defendant City of Hutchinson to the real estate above legally described, owned by the Plaintiff, rests upon the authority, so far as this Plaintiff and counsel have been able to ascertain, of G. S. 26-201 and 26-202, and Reno County, Kansas District Court Case No. 7867, more fully described in Paragraph 5 herein, brought thereunder, which statute or statutes are void and of no force and effect whatsoever, because same attempt to vest the power in certain municipalities to take property without due process of law.\n\n\n\"9. That the only notice to an owner of real property, which G. S. 26-201 and 26-202 requires is by publication, which is not sufficient notice under the above mentioned due process clauses of both Federal and State Constitutions.\n\n\n\"10. That the Plaintiff had no actual notice, and did not actually know, or have any reason to know that Defendants sought to condemn and take his land, until approximately the middle part of August, 1954; unless by a peculiar quirk of the imagination, it can be said that the single legal publication, published just once in The Hutchinson News-Herald, and that on the 14th day of April, 1954, gave him notice; that said single notice so published in the official newspaper was not sufficient notice to satisfy the requirements of the Due Process clauses of both Federal and State Constitutions. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 112, 125]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"11. That at the present moment defendant City of Hutchinson, either itself, or by contractors employed by it, is, or is threatening to enter upon said real estate owned by the Plaintiff, and this for the purpose of building a highway across said real estate, all in utter and complete disregard of the rights of this Plaintiff.\n\n\n\"12. That the Plaintiff is entitled to an Order of this Court instanter, enjoining and restraining defendant City of Hutchinson from entering upon, or in any manner trespassing upon said real estate, for the reason, inter alia, that there is no other remedy, either at law or in equity, open to the Plaintiff; that if said defendant City of Hutchinson is not so restrained and enjoined, the Plaintiff will suffer irreparable damage by reason thereof.\n\n\n\"13. That the Plaintiff is advised that in some orders by Courts of competent jurisdiction, in the granting of a restraining order, or temporary injunction of this nature, the party seeking same, and obtaining same, is required to post certain indemnity or other type of bond or bonds; that the Plaintiff hereby respectfully and humbly advises the Court that by reason of his limited financial resources, he cannot post such a bond, and therefore asks, upon the above and foregoing statement of facts, that the Court does not make the giving of such a bond or bonds as a condition precedent to Plaintiff's obtaining a restraining order or temporary injunction at this time.\n\n\n\"14. That by reason of the above and foregoing facts, the Plaintiff is entitled to have, and desires to have a permanent injunction against defendant City of Hutchinson, restraining and enjoining it, and its servants, agents and all others in its employment, from entering or trespassing upon the Plaintiff's real estate, above described, or preventing him from otherwise enjoying the quiet and peaceful enjoyment thereof.\n\n\n\"Wherefore and by reason of the foregoing, the Plaintiff prays for an immediate Order of this Court restraining \n\n[352 \nU.S. 112, 126]\n\u00a0\n and enjoining defendant City of Hutchinson from entering or trespassing upon the Plaintiff's real estate, above described, and the Plaintiff further prays for a judgment of this Court permanently enjoining and restraining the City of Hutchinson from entering or trespassing upon Plaintiff's real estate, above described; and Plaintiff further prays for judgment for his costs herein, and for such other and further relief as to this Court seem just and equitable.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The important statutory provisions of the Kansas condemnation procedure are set forth in the opinion of the Court, except for the provision in Kan. Gen. Stat., 1949, 26-204, that title to lands condemned for parkways or boulevards vests in the city immediately on publication of the resolution of condemnation and that the city's right to possession of condemned land vests when the report of the commissioners is filed in the office of the register of deeds. Kan. Gen. Stat., 1949, 26-204, is as follows:\n\n\"That the city clerk shall forthwith, upon any report [of assessment commissioners] being filed in his office, prepare and deposit a copy thereof in the office of the treasurer of such city, and if there be deposited with the city treasurer, for the benefit of the owner or owners of such lands, the amount of the award, such treasurer shall thereupon certify such facts upon the copy of the report, and shall pay said awards to such persons as shall be respectively entitled thereto. . . . The title to lands condemned by any city for parks, parkways or boulevards shall vest in such city upon the publication of the resolution of the governing body condemning the same. Upon the recording of a copy of said report so certified in the office of the register of deeds of the county, the right to the possession of lands condemned shall vest in the city and the city shall have the right to forthwith take possession of, occupy, use and improve said lands for the purposes specified in the resolution appropriating the same.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The complaint in its entirety is set forth in an Appendix at the end of this opinion, post, p. 122.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BURTON, dissenting.\n\nIf the issue in this case is the constitutionality of the statutory provision made for taking the property, its constitutionality seems clear. If, as I assume to be the case, the issue is the constitutional sufficiency of the statutory ten-day notice by publication of the hearing to assess the compensation for the land taken, I consider such a provision to be within the constitutional discretion of the lawmaking body of the State.\n\nIn weighing the \"due process\" of condemnation procedure some reasonable balance must be struck between the needs of the public to acquire the property, and the opportunity for a hearing as to the compensation to be paid for the property. Just compensation is constitutionally necessary, but the length and kind of notice of the proceeding to determine such compensation is largely a matter of legislative discretion. The minimum notice required by this statute may seem to some to be inadequate or undesirably short, but it was satisfactory to the lawmakers of Kansas. It also has been upheld by the Supreme Court of Kansas and the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. To proscribe it as violative of the Federal Constitution fails to allow adequate scope to local legislative discretion. Accordingly, while not passing upon the desirability of the statutory requirement \n\n[352 \nU.S. 112, 127]\n\u00a0\n before us, I am not ready to hold that the Constitution of the United States prohibits the people of Kansas from choosing that standard. Particularly, I am not ready to throw a nationwide cloud of uncertainty upon the validity of condemnation proceedings based on compliance with similar local statutes. Since 1889, it has been settled that notice by publication in condemnation proceedings to take and to fix the value to be paid for the land of a nonresident comports with due process. Huling v. Kaw Valley R. Co., \n130 \nU.S. 559\n. See also, North Laramie Land Co. v. Hoffman, \n268 \nU.S. 276, 283\n-287; Bragg v. Weaver, \n251 \nU.S. 57\n.\n\nI agree with the court below and with the opinion of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit rendered in the comparable case of Collins v. Wichita, 225 F.2d 132, which came to our attention at the last term of Court and in which certiorari was denied on November 7, 1955, \n350 \nU.S. 886\n. Therefore, I would affirm the judgment here. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 112, 128]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","108":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWERNER CO. v. DIRECTOR OF TAXATION(1956)\nNo. 63\nArgued: Decided: March 26, 1956\n\n\n\n\n As applied to this New Jersey corporation, the New Jersey corporation tax here involved, measured by the corporation's \"net worth,\" is a tax on the corporate franchise, does not discriminate against federal obligations, and is valid despite the inclusion of federal bonds in the determination of net worth. Pp. 492-494.\n\n 17 N. J. 121, 110 A. 2d 89, affirmed.\n\nCharles Goodwin, Jr. argued the cause for appellant. With him on the brief were Halsey T. Tichenor, III, and Leopold Frankel.\n\nHarold Kolovsky, Assistant Attorney General of New Jersey, argued the cause for appellee. With him on the brief were Grover C. Richman, Jr., Attorney General, and Lawrence E. Stern and David D. Furman, Deputy Attorneys General. Ned J. Parsekian, Deputy Attorney General, was on a Motion to Dismiss.\n\n\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\nThe State of New Jersey imposes on each domestic corporation \"an annual franchise tax . . . for the privilege of having or exercising its corporate franchise\" in the State.\n1\n This tax, as applied to appellant, is measured by the corporation's \"net worth,\" which is defined as the sum of the corporation's issued and outstanding capital stock, paid-in or capital surplus, earned surplus and undivided profits, other surplus accounts which will accrue to the shareholders (not including depreciation reserves), and debts owed to shareholders owning 10 percent or more \n\n[350 \nU.S. 492, 493]\n\u00a0\n of the corporation's stock.\n2\n Appellant is a corporation organized under the laws of New Jersey, and is therefore subject to the tax. In assessing appellant's tax for 1952, the Tax Commissioner included in appellant's net worth the value of certain federal bonds held by appellant, thereby increasing the amount due by $320.07. Appellant protested, claiming that under R. S. 3701, 31 U.S.C. 742, these bonds were immune from state taxation. The New Jersey courts upheld the Commissioner's assessment, and this appeal contests the validity of the state statute as so applied.\n\nAppellant contends that this tax is not in reality a franchise tax, but is rather in the nature of a direct property tax on the immune federal obligations. Corporate franchises granted by a State create a relationship which may legitimately be made the subject of taxation, Home Ins. Co. v. New York, \n134 \nU.S. 594, 599\n-600; Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., \n220 \nU.S. 107, 162\n; Educational Films Corp. v. Ward, \n282 \nU.S. 379, 388\n; and the statute expressly declares this to be a franchise tax. Moreover, the Supreme Court of New Jersey has, on independent examination, found this to be \"a bona fide franchise tax.\"\n3\n While this is, of course, not conclusive here, Society for Savings v. Bowers, \n349 \nU.S. 143\n, we find no basis in this instance for not accepting the state court's conclusion that this tax is not imposed directly on the property held by the corporation. Cf. Pacific Co. v. Johnson, \n285 \nU.S. 480, 495\n-496.\n\nAppellant argues further that even if this is a franchise tax, it must fall because its effect is the same as if it had been imposed directly on the tax-exempt federal securities. Since the tax remains the same whatever the character of \n\n[350 \nU.S. 492, 494]\n\u00a0\n the corporate assets may be, no claim can be sustained that this taxing statute discriminates against the federal obligations. And since this is a tax on the corporate franchise, it is valid despite the inclusion of federal bonds in the determination of net worth. This Court has consistently upheld franchise taxes measured by a yardstick which includes tax-exempt income or property, even though a part of the economic impact of the tax may be said to bear indirectly upon such income or property. See, e. g., Society for Savings v. Coite, 6 Wall. 594; Provident Institution v. Massachusetts, 6 Wall. 611; Hamilton Co. v. Massachusetts, 6 Wall. 632; Home Ins. Co. v. New York, supra; Educational Films Corp. v. Ward, supra; Pacific Co. v. Johnson, supra. We have only recently adhered to this principle in another aspect of this field of taxation. See Society for Savings v. Bowers, supra, at 147-148. New Jersey Realty Title Ins. Co. v. Division of Tax Appeals, \n338 \nU.S. 665\n, on which appellant relies, is distinguishable, in that it did not involve a franchise tax, but rather a tax whose legal incidence this Court found to be upon the intangible assets of the corporation.\n\nSince as applied here this is a permissible tax on the corporate franchise, the decision below must be\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] N.
